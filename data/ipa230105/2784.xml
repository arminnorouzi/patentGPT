The vast majority of unintended pregnancy occurred when contraception was used inconsistently or not at all. Currently 72% of women who practice contraception use hormonal methods, but there is frequent dissatisfaction with these methods, due to quality of life and safety concerns; a recent high profile study (March, L S, et al., N Engl J Med., 7; 377(23):2228-39 (2017)), brought the risk of breast cancer back to the discussion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, contraception is achieved by either physical blockage of the fallopian tube (through intrauterine devices) or hormonal therapy (such as Depo-Provera&#xae;, Loestrin&#xae;, or Ortho Evra&#xae;). However, both of these contraception strategies have drawbacks. IUDs can cause severe pain and result in infections and other complications. Hormones can have unwanted side effects such as weight gain, increased formation of blood clots, headaches, nausea, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reversible immunocontraception offers a non-hormonal solution, where antibodies are introduced into the female reproductive tract (FRT) and inhibit sperm function. This approach, though, has a number of challenges including: identification of a specific and effective monoclonal antibody (Ab) against a human sperm antigen, and a safe and reliable method for introduction of Abs that is temporally and spatially controllable.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a clear need for new approaches to non-hormonal female contraceptives that are easy to use, woman-applied, and have a controllable duration of action.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Non-hormonal contraception compositions and methods for contraception are provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment provides an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to one or more sperm antigens and inhibits the ability of antibody-bound sperm to fertilize an egg. Typically, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody, for example a human or humanized monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof specifically binds to CD52g expressed on vertebrate, for example human, sperm cells and inhibits, blocks, or reduces the ability of the antibody-bound sperm to fertilize an egg. In one embodiment the antibody contains a membrane anchor. The membrane anchor can contain transmembrane domains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, or myristoylation motifs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment provides a recombinant genetic construct. The construct encodes an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a sperm antigen and a membrane anchor. The genetic construct can be configured to be delivered and expressed in an animal subject, for example a human. In one embodiment the genetic construct is an RNA construct including but not limited to a mRNA construct.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment provides a therapeutic mRNA that expresses an antibody or antigen binding fragment there that specifically binds to sperm and inhibits antibody-bound sperm for fertilizing an egg. In some embodiments, the antibody is an immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin D, or immunoglobulin E. In one embodiment the antibody specifically binds to CD52g expressed on sperm cells. In some embodiments the antibody contains a membrane anchor. The membrane anchor can contain transmembrane domains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, or myristoylation motifs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition containing a nucleic acid construct encoding an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a sperm antigen and a membrane anchor. In one embodiment the nucleic construct is an mRNA construct, for example an mRNA construct. In one embodiment the sperm antigen is CD25g. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains an excipient. In some embodiments, the excipient is water. The membrane anchor can contain transmembrane domains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, or myristoylation motifs. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical contains anti-CD52g antibodies.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One embodiment provides a method for providing contraception to a female subject in need thereof including the steps of administering to the subject's female reproductive tract a nucleic acid construct encoding an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof and a membrane anchor in an amount effective to provide contraception. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct is a mRNA construct. In some embodiments the construct is delivered as an aerosol.

Some vectors are those capable of autonomous replication (episomal vector) and/or expression of nucleic acids to which they are linked (expression vectors). Large numbers of suitable vectors are known to those of skill in the art and commercially available.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is intended to denote an immunoglobulin molecule that possesses a &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; antigen recognition site. The term &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; is intended to distinguish such domain of the immunoglobulin from domains that are broadly shared by antibodies (such as an antibody Fc domain). The variable region includes a &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; whose residues are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region includes amino acid residues from a &#x201c;Complementarity Determining Region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; (i.e., typically at approximately residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and at approximately residues 27-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5th Ed.

Such fragments include Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fv, single chain (ScFv), and mutants thereof, naturally occurring variants, and fusion proteins including the antibody's &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; antigen recognition site and a heterologous protein (e.g., a toxin, an antigen recognition site for a different antigen, an enzyme, a receptor or receptor ligand, etc.).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; refers to a peptide or polypeptide including an amino acid sequence of at least 5 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 25 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 50 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 60 contiguous amino residues, at least 70 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 80 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 90 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 100 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 125 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 150 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 175 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 200 contiguous amino acid residues, or at least 250 contiguous amino acid residues.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; refers to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that immunospecifically binds to the same target of a parent or reference antibody but which differs in amino acid sequence from the parent or reference antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof by including one, two, three, four, five or more amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or modifications relative to the parent or reference antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, such derivatives will have substantially the same immunospecificity and/or characteristics, or the same immunospecificity and characteristics as the parent or reference antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. The amino acid substitutions or additions of such derivatives can include naturally occurring (i.e., DNA-encoded) or non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. The term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; encompasses, for example, chimeric or humanized variants, as well as variants having altered CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3 or CH4 regions, so as to form, for example antibodies, etc., having variant Fc regions that exhibit enhanced or impaired effector or binding characteristics.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, a &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to an immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the &#x201c;donor&#x201d; and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the &#x201c;acceptor.&#x201d; Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they should be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-99%, or about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A humanized antibody is an antibody including a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody, because, e.g., the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">II.

It will be appreciated that these antibodies can be humanized and modified to include a membrane anchor.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0069">It has been discovered that mRNA delivered via aerosol can express sufficient quantities of protein to achieve therapeutic and/or preventive efficacy at a mucosal site. We extended this approach to the FRT of sheep and macaques, as shown in our preliminary data, using an off-the shelf Teleflex atomizer for delivery. In some embodiments, the cells in the vagina and/or the cervix are transfected with mRNA encoding anti-CD52g antibodies suspended in water and delivered with an atomizer. The discovery that synthetic mRNA in water can be delivered to mucosal surfaces of the FRT via aerosol introduces the possibility that contraceptive proteins such as antisperm Abs may be delivered by this mechanism, as well as products that may have other beneficial effects on reproductive health such as Abs that specifically bind to sexually transmitted organisms, antimicrobial peptides and antigens for elicitation of local immune responses.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0070">Anti-sperm Abs commonly occur in infertility patients, and are thought to cause infertility due to sperm agglutination and immobilization (Bronson, RA., J. Reprod. Immunol., 45(2):159-83 (1999); Ustay, K, et al., Univ Mich Med Cent J., 33(5):225-7 (1967)). Abs found in some immune infertile patients are directed against a glycoprotein called CD52g, a molecule unique to the male reproductive tract and initially detected on the surface of sperm. CD52g is related to CD52, a molecule expressed by T lymphocytes, but differs in its carbohydrate side chain that contains the epitope that is specific for the male reproductive tract. CD52g is produced and secreted by epithelial cells lining the lumen of the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles (Norton, E J., et al., Tissue Antigens, 60(5):3 (2002)). It contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is transferred to the plasma membrane of sperm as they mature in the epididymis (Diekman, A B., et al., Immunol., Rev., 171:203-11(1999); Diekman, A B, et al., Am. J. Reprod. Immunol., 43(3):134-43 (2000)). Isojima and coworkers made two monoclonal Abs against CD52g: HC4, a human IgM Ab made from B cells of an infertile woman, and 2C6, a mouse monoclonal Ab with the same specificity (Isojima, S., et al., J. Reprod. Immunol., 10(1):67-78 (1987)). A WHO-sponsored contraceptive vaccine workshop that examined the function and specificity of these and other antisperm monoclonal Abs identified CD52g as a promising anti-fertility vaccine candidate due to its unique expression in the male reproductive tract, potent antigenicity, and its ability to induce infertility in otherwise healthy individuals (Anderson, D J, et al., J. Reprod. Immunol., 10(3):231-57(1987)). While systemic Abs have multiple potential effector functions (e.g. complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), Ab dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)), there are also mucosal-specific mechanisms including agglutination (Cone, R A, et al., Am. J. Reprod. Immunol., September; 32(2):114-31 (1994); Roche, A M, et al., Mucosal Immunology., 8(1):176&#x2014; 85 (2015)) and binding to mucus (Phalipon, A, et al., Immunity., 17(1):107-15 (2002); Wang, Y-Y, et al., Eur. Respir. J., 49(1):1601709 (2017)) that are less widely discussed, but are crucial for the protection of mucosal surfaces. These effector functions for Abs in mucus serve to block the movement of entities such as viruses, bacteria, infected cells, and sperm, and prevent them from reaching target cells. Drs. Anderson, Whaley and Moench have produced a human anti-CD52g Ab in <i>Nicotiana </i>based on the sequence of the original HC4 Ab, and call this Ab &#x201c;Human Contraceptive Antibody&#x201d; (HCA). Their studies have shown that HCA, like the parent Ab, potently agglutinates sperm and immobilizes sperm in cervicovaginal mucus.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0071">In one embodiment the mRNA encoding the anti-CD52g antibodies are produced by large-scale production of under GMP conditions is easy, robust, and inexpensive, when compared to the production of peptides, proteins, modified microorganisms and cells (Tusup, M, and Pascolo S., Methods Mol. Biol. New York, N.Y.: Springer New York, 1499 (Chapter 9):155-63 (2017)). In one embodiment the transcription reaction produces the same final concentration of mRNA whether it is performed in a 10 ul or 10 ml. Upscaling the transcription reaction to a volume of a liter or more should not pose any problems. Using established conditions to produce a GMP molecule with a different sequence. Every mRNA molecule consists of A, C, G and U residues. Thus, the final molecule will always be soluble and stable at neutral pH and will not present any unpredictable behavior. Accordingly, established methods can be used for the production of any mRNA under GMP conditions. Lyophilization/resolubilization: mRNA can be lyophilized and resuspended immediately in water-based solutions regardless of its sequence. Storage and temperature stability: mRNA in solution can be stored for weeks at room temperature as long as it is pure and in a neutral or acidic solution. Lyophilized mRNA can be stored for months at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0072">Synthetic mRNA has a number of properties ideal for in vivo expression of Abs as compared with viral vectors and DNA. The expression is transient compared with viral vectors, and the RNA is non-integrating. mRNA stability in vivo is controllable, to some degree, via the UTR sequences, and mRNA will always degrade. Therefore Ab production will not be permanent, an important feature for human immunocontraception. The transient nature, though, does not preclude the ability to produce a durable Ab presence in vaginal secretions. Sheep data shows high levels of mRNA-expressed Ab in sheep secretions for 20 days following a single administration of mRNA encoding simple (unlinked) Ab, and 28 days following a single administration of mRNA encoding a GPI-linked Ab. In addition, synthetic mRNA has not been observed in the nucleus, and it is unlikely to be integrated. DNA must reach the nucleus to function and thus can interact with chromatin; this is not the case with mRNA.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0073">The mRNA does not provoke a significant immune response. Two approaches were used for mitigating innate immune responses to the RNA itself: First, the mRNA was modified with N1-methyl-pseudouridine, and reverse phase HPLC was used to reduce double-stranded aberrant RNAs, etc. It was recently reported that cytokines were not elevated in the mouse lung after mRNA delivery (Tiwari, P M, et al., Nature Communications., 9(1):3999 (2018)).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0074">mRNA can transfect difficult to transfect cell types. Given that the mRNA is delivered to the cytosol, many cells that are difficult to transfect with DNA can be transfected with mRNA.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0075">The ability to express Abs in the FRT using such a simple formulation via clearly separates mRNA from DNA delivery which is usually achieved by injection or via the use of viral vectors. In some embodiments a Penn Century microsprayer or a Teleflex MADgic Laryngo-Tracheal Mucosal Atomization Device can be used to transfect tissue culture cells in dishes, mouse lung epithelial cells in vivo, and the vagina and cervix of sheep and macaques in vivo, using mRNA in water. As little as 125 ug of mRNA in sheep has been used to transfect the cervix, and 100 ug to transfect mouse lungs.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0076">A.

Standard pharmaceutical excipients are available from any formulator.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0086">Transdermal formulations may also be prepared. These will typically be ointments, lotions, sprays, or patches, all of which can be prepared using standard technology.

Controlled Delivery Polymeric Matrices</p><p id="p-0099" num="0088">The nucleic constructs disclosed herein can also be administered in controlled release formulations. Controlled release polymeric devices can be made for long term release systemically following implantation of a polymeric device (rod, cylinder, film, disk) or injection (microparticles). The matrix can be in the form of microparticles such as microspheres, where the agent is dispersed within a solid polymeric matrix or microcapsules, where the core is of a different material than the polymeric shell, and the peptide is dispersed or suspended in the core, which may be liquid or solid in nature. Unless specifically defined herein, microparticles, microspheres, and microcapsules are used interchangeably. Alternatively, the polymer may be cast as a thin slab or film, ranging from nanometers to four centimeters, a powder produced by grinding or other standard techniques, or even a gel such as a hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0089">Either non-biodegradable or biodegradable matrices can be used for delivery of nucleic acids constructs, although in some embodiments biodegradable matrices are preferred. These may be natural or synthetic polymers, although synthetic polymers are preferred in some embodiments due to the better characterization of degradation and release profiles. The polymer is selected based on the period over which release is desired. In some cases linear release may be most useful, although in others a pulse release or &#x201c;bulk release&#x201d; may provide more effective results. The polymer may be in the form of a hydrogel (typically in absorbing up to about 90% by weight of water), and can optionally be crosslinked with multivalent ions or polymers.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0090">The matrices can be formed by solvent evaporation, spray drying, solvent extraction and other methods known to those skilled in the art. Bioerodible microspheres can be prepared using any of the methods developed for making microspheres for drug delivery, for example, as described by Mathiowitz and Langer, J. Controlled Release, 5:13-22 (1987); Mathiowitz, et al., Reactive Polymers, 6:275-283 (1987); and Mathiowitz, et al., J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 35:755-774 (1988).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0091">B.

Methods of Manufacture</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0095">A. Methods of Making Antibodies</p><p id="p-0107" num="0096">The disclosed anti-sperm antigen antibodies can be generated in cell culture, in phage, or in various animals, including but not limited to cows, rabbits, goats, mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, sheep, dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees, and apes. Therefore, in one embodiment, an antibody is a mammalian antibody. Phage techniques can be used to isolate an initial antibody or to generate variants with altered specificity or avidity characteristics. Such techniques are routine and well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is produced by recombinant means known in the art. For example, a recombinant antibody can be produced by transfecting a host cell with a vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the antibody. One or more vectors can be used to transfect the DNA sequence expressing at least one VL and one VH region in the host cell. Exemplary descriptions of recombinant means of antibody generation and production include Delves, <i>Antibody Production: Essential Techniques </i>(Wiley, 1997); Shephard, et al., <i>Monoclonal Antibodies </i>(Oxford University Press, 2000); Goding, <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles And Practice </i>(Academic Press, 1993); <i>Current Protocols In Immunology </i>(John Wiley &#x26; Sons, most recent edition).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0097">The disclosed anti-sperm antigen antibodies can be modified by recombinant means to increase greater efficacy of the antibody in mediating the desired function. Thus, it is within the scope of the invention that antibodies can be modified by substitutions using recombinant means. Typically, the substitutions will be conservative substitutions. For example, at least one amino acid in the constant region of the antibody can be replaced with a different residue. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821, 6,194,551, Application No. WO 9958572; and Angal, et al., <i>Mol. Immunol. </i>30:105-08 (1993). The modification in amino acids includes deletions, additions, and substitutions of amino acids. In some cases, such changes are made to reduce undesired activities, e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Frequently, the antibodies are labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently, a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. These antibodies can be screened for binding to proteins, polypeptides, or fusion proteins of FLRT3. See, e.g., <i>Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach </i>(Oxford University Press, 1996).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0098">For example, suitable antibodies with the desired biologic activities can be identified using in vitro assays including but not limited to: proliferation, migration, adhesion, soft agar growth, angiogenesis, cell-cell communication, apoptosis, transport, signal transduction, and in vivo assays such as the inhibition of tumor growth. The antibodies provided herein can also be useful in diagnostic applications. As capture or non-neutralizing antibodies, they can be screened for the ability to bind to the specific antigen without inhibiting the receptor-binding or biological activity of the antigen. As neutralizing antibodies, the antibodies can be useful in competitive binding assays.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0099">Antibodies that can be used in the disclosed compositions and methods include whole immunoglobulin (i.e., an intact antibody) of any class, fragments thereof, and synthetic proteins containing at least the antigen binding variable domain of an antibody. The variable domains differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not usually evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0100">Also disclosed are fragments of antibodies which have bioactivity. The fragments, whether attached to other sequences or not, include insertions, deletions, substitutions, or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acids residues, provided the activity of the fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the non-modified antibody or antibody fragment.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0101">Techniques can also be adapted for the production of single-chain antibodies specific to an antigenic peptide. Methods for the production of single-chain antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. A single chain antibody can be created by fusing together the variable domains of the heavy and light chains using a short peptide linker, thereby reconstituting an antigen binding site on a single molecule. Single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs) in which the C-terminus of one variable domain is tethered to the N-terminus of the other variable domain via a 15 to 25 amino acid peptide or linker have been developed without significantly disrupting antigen binding or specificity of the binding. The linker is chosen to permit the heavy chain and light chain to bind together in their proper conformational orientation.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0102">Divalent single-chain variable fragments (di-scFvs) can be engineered by linking two scFvs. This can be done by producing a single peptide chain with two VH and two VL regions, yielding tandem scFvs. ScFvs can also be designed with linker peptides that are too short for the two variable regions to fold together (about five amino acids), forcing scFvs to dimerize. This type is known as diabodies. Diabodies have been shown to have dissociation constants up to 40-fold lower than corresponding scFvs, meaning that they have a much higher affinity to their target. Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) lead to the formation of trimers (triabodies or tribodies). Tetrabodies have also been produced. They exhibit an even higher affinity to their targets than diabodies.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0103">A monoclonal antibody is obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies within the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in a small subset of the antibody molecules. Monoclonal antibodies include &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, as long as they exhibit the desired antagonistic activity.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0104">Monoclonal antibodies can be made using any procedure which produces monoclonal antibodies. In a hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0105">Antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the disclosed antibodies can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). Libraries of antibodies or active antibody fragments can also be generated and screened using phage display techniques.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0106">Methods of making antibodies using protein chemistry are also known in the art. One method of producing proteins comprising the antibodies is to link two or more peptides or polypeptides together by protein chemistry techniques. For example, peptides or polypeptides can be chemically synthesized using currently available laboratory equipment using either Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) or Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonoyl) chemistry. (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.). One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that a peptide or polypeptide corresponding to the antibody, for example, can be synthesized by standard chemical reactions. For example, a peptide or polypeptide can be synthesized and not cleaved from its synthesis resin whereas the other fragment of an antibody can be synthesized and subsequently cleaved from the resin, thereby exposing a terminal group which is functionally blocked on the other fragment. By peptide condensation reactions, these two fragments can be covalently joined via a peptide bond at their carboxyl and amino termini, respectively, to form an antibody, or fragment thereof. Alternatively, the peptide or polypeptide is independently synthesized in vivo as described above. Once isolated, these independent peptides or polypeptides may be linked to form an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof via similar peptide condensation reactions.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0107">For example, enzymatic ligation of cloned or synthetic peptide segments allow relatively short peptide fragments to be joined to produce larger peptide fragments, polypeptides or whole protein domains. Alternatively, native chemical ligation of synthetic peptides can be utilized to synthetically construct large peptides or polypeptides from shorter peptide fragments. This method consists of a two-step chemical reaction. The first step is the chemoselective reaction of an unprotected synthetic peptide-alpha-thioester with another unprotected peptide segment containing an amino-terminal Cys residue to give a thioester-linked intermediate as the initial covalent product. Without a change in the reaction conditions, this intermediate undergoes spontaneous, rapid intramolecular reaction to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0108">B. Methods for Producing Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules Isolated nucleic acid molecules can be produced by standard techniques, including, without limitation, common molecular cloning and chemical nucleic acid synthesis techniques. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can be used to obtain an isolated nucleic acid encoding a variant polypeptide. PCR is a technique in which target nucleic acids are enzymatically amplified. Typically, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond can be employed to design oligonucleotide primers that are identical in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. PCR can be used to amplify specific sequences from DNA as well as RNA, including sequences from total genomic DNA or total cellular RNA. Primers typically are 14 to 40 nucleotides in length, but can range from 10 nucleotides to hundreds of nucleotides in length. General PCR techniques are described, for example in PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, ed. by Dieffenbach and Dveksler, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995. When using RNA as a source of template, reverse transcriptase can be used to synthesize a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand. Ligase chain reaction, strand displacement amplification, self-sustained sequence replication or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification also can be used to obtain isolated nucleic acids. See, for example, Lewis (1992) Genetic Engineering News 12:1; Guatelli et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1874-1878; and Weiss (1991) Science 254:1292-1293.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0109">Isolated nucleic acids can be chemically synthesized, either as a single nucleic acid molecule or as a series of oligonucleotides (e.g., using phosphoramidite technology for automated DNA synthesis in the 3&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; direction). For example, one or more pairs of long oligonucleotides (e.g., &#x3e;100 nucleotides) can be synthesized that contain the desired sequence, with each pair containing a short segment of complementarity (e.g., about 15 nucleotides) such that a duplex is formed when the oligonucleotide pair is annealed. DNA polymerase can be used to extend the oligonucleotides, resulting in a single, double-stranded nucleic acid molecule per oligonucleotide pair, which then can be ligated into a vector. Isolated nucleic acids can also obtained by mutagenesis. Protein-encoding nucleic acids can be mutated using standard techniques, including oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and/or site-directed mutagenesis through PCR.

It has been demonstrated in the mouse lung and sheep FRT that through the incorporation of a GPI-linker from decay accelerating factor (DAF) into the Ab heavy chain, Ab could be retained in the tissues, and detect high concentrations of Ab in secretions for over 28 days following a single administration. By varying the linker design, the tissue and secretion pharmacokinetics van be &#x201c;tuned&#x201d; to the temporal window of contraception. In addition, a by-product of the use of the linker, was the observation that mRNA-expressed Abs traffic through the ER and Golgi more efficiently, promoting antibody production, membrane display, and release from the membrane. Most GPI linked proteins traffic to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. This is clearly beneficial for exogenously expressed antibodies. True Ab secreting cells (ASC) are specialized for secreting antibody and expand their ER via IRE1-XBP1 pathway activation. This pathway is not often activated in epithelial cells, and thus these cells do not typically have the capacity to move antibody efficiently through the ER and Golgi. pERp1 and BiP are also important for Ab assembly and not often expressed outside of lymphocytes. It was found that by incorporating linkers into the heavy chain, ER trafficking of Abs produced in non-ASC cells without the benefit of these proteins and pathways was improved. Co-expression of XBP1, pERp1 and BiP, can be explored as a means of improving Ab production.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0111">DAF GPI linkers are well-studied and have demonstrated varying susceptibility to cleavage from phospholipase D and C (PLD and PLC) (Davitz, M A., J Exp Med., 1; 163(5):1150-61(1986); bovine AChE has been shown to be more resistant to PLDD, while susceptible to PLC, and human AchE is highly resistant to PLC and PLD. The resistance is due to the existence of an additional fatty acid chain on the inositol ring which blocks the action of PLC. In addition to GPI linkers, a transmembrane domain&#x2122; from MUC4, a typically expressed, cell-surface, mucin can be used, and a fusion between the MUC4 TM domain and peptides identified as substrates for kallikrein-related peptidase 13 (KLK13) (Muytjens, C M J, et al., Nature Publishing Group, 7; 13(10):596-607 (2016); Shaw, J L V, et al., Biological Chemistry., 389(12):561-10 (2008); Andrade, D., et al. Biochimie. Elsevier Masson SAS, 93(10):1701-9 2011)), both active in the FRT. Through the use of these various linkers, tissue retention and release rate of Ab from the cell surface, and into the cervicovaginal fluid can be controlled.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example II: Use of Imaging Tools to Assess mRNA Delivery at the Whole Body to Single Cell Level</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0112">RNA imaging probes (Kirschman, J L, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 45(12):e113-3 (2017)) PMCID: PMC5499550) can be used in the 3&#x2032;-UTR of the mRNA, that neither interfere with translation of mRNA nor induce innate immune responses.

PLA only yields a fluorescent puncta when the mRNA and protein of interest (e.g., endocytic markers) are within &#x2dc;30 nm of each other, where typical colocalization analysis is limited by the diffraction limit. PLA allows for the quantification of RNA-protein interactions over many cells and can identify mRNA entry pathways (42). Colocalization analysis is often used as an initial screen, followed by PLA, and then super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM) to confirm the findings (4, 49, 50). dSTORM is a subdiffraction-limited imaging approach with 20-30 nm resolution. Electron microscopy can also be used to determine if transient pores are developed during delivery, in conjunction with the Emory Electron Microscopy Core. mRNAs. Synthetic mRNAs encoding a (DAF) GPI-anchored nanoluc can be used. A single reporter mRNA will allow for both optimization of atomization parameters and for the interrogation of the mechanism of delivery. Anchored nanoluc allows for both nanoluc-assays to be performed, which are quantitative, and immunostaining for tissue and cellular localization. Immunostaining for endocytic markers. Reagents for clathrin light chain and heavy chain, caveolin 1 and 3, EEA1, Rab5, Rab7, CD63, and LAMP-1, for mouse (42,48), human and monkey species have been validated. Use of endocytosis inhibitors. Methyl-3-cyclodextrin (M3CD) and chlorpromazine inhibit clathrin mediated endocytosis, while Filipin III can be used to inhibit cavaelae mediated endocytosis. Blebbistatin is a general inhibitor of myosin II, ATP depletion and 4C are more general inhibitors of endocytosis. All of the drugs can be titrated in conjunction with fluorescently labeled dextran to verify function. ATP depletion is achieved via incubation with glucose-free medium or Ringers buffer containing antimycin A, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and sodium azide (NaN3). Concentrations can be optimized for the vaginal and endocervical cultures. Use of in vitro models to study effects of hormones. The Anderson laboratory has shown that the EpiVaginal model expresses hormone receptors and mounts characteristic responses when treated with estrogen and progesterone at concentrations similar to those found during the proliferative and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (36). EpiVaginal tissues can be pretreated with hormone combinations to determine whether hormone status affects mRNA transfection and translation. Induction of tissue lesions, inflammation. Microabrasions can be introduced in the Epivaginal model by repeated taping of the tissue with a fine-gauge needle.

When mRNA were added dropwise in water, in vitro, or with a syringe (jet, no atomization) in vivo, transfection did not occur, demonstrating the need for atomization. To date, water has been the only fluid used, based on literature suggesting that hypotonic solutions would augment delivery. Hypotonic solutions, such as water, when delivered via aerosol, alter the pressure at the membrane facilitating pore formation and direct access of the mRNA to the cytosol. In water, the mRNA will also have a highly reduced secondary structure, which may also facilitate entry. It was found in an earlier study using AAV-vectored Ab DNA, that vaginal tissue was relatively resistant to gene delivery unless microlesions were introduced which allowed the vectored DNA to reach the basal epithelial cell layer; based on this result, AAV-vectored minibodies were delivered to the macaque FRT by inducing mild abrasion with a cytobrush.
