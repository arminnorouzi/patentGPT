It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Aspects of the disclosure are capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Methods and systems described herein provide new capabilities for providing purchase recommendations to a user based consumer pattern behavior, such as a user's past purchasing history and the purchase history of others. The recommendations utilize &#x201c;purchase embeddings,&#x201d; which are data records in a new multi-dimensional space for representing, describing and tracking purchases of goods and services. Various aspects involve the compilation and structure of purchase embeddings in a database, updating purchase embedding records based on continued monitoring of purchases, identifying correlations between different purchases based on calculating distances between purchase embeddings, and providing shopping recommendations based on those correlations.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An item can be described in innumerable ways, such as by part number, use, size, color, smell, style, dimensions, whether it is perishable, whether it is gender specific, whether it requires assembly, whether it is known by different names in different geographical regions, etc. An item can also be described by how it is bought and sold. For example, an item can be characterized by vendors that sell the item, by particular people that buy the item, geographic regions in which sales occur, cost for the item, dates and times of day the item is bought/sold, quantities in which item is bought/sold, etc. All of these characteristics can be used to find correlations between items, or past purchases of items, that could be used to provide suggestions to a person to purchase items in the future. However, simple comparisons between these properties may provide only minimally useful results. For example, if a person buys a pack of gum each week, that purchase history could be used to suggest (e.g., in an advertisement) to buy the same pack of gum in the future. As another example, if a person performs a web search for &#x201c;candles,&#x201d; the search engine may provide options for buying a random selection of candles (e.g., birthday cake candles, tapered candles, scented candles, etc.) from major brands and vendors with a large on-line presence.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Purchase embeddings go beyond such simple word matching by characterizing the items in a new multi-dimensional search space (a &#x201c;purchase embedding space&#x201d;). In addition to considering basic descriptions of items, several other factors are considered, including an individual's past buying history, other's purchasing history, regional differences in shopping habits, etc. Not only are individual characteristics considered, but the process discovers (e.g., using a machine learning model) combinations of these characteristics that indicate some relationship between two products, which though may not be readily apparent, indicates some similarity suggesting that if a person was interested in buying one of the products, they would also be interested in buying the other product. These factors and combinations of factors are synthesized into the purchase embedding space such that measures of similarity may be calculated between two items (or a group of items) by calculating a distance between the purchase embeddings representing the respective items.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">More specifically, a purchase embedding is a tuple (e.g., coordinates of a vector) defined in the multi-dimensional description space, where each dimension (and element of the tuple), includes a range of values that provide a measure of some characteristic (or combination of characteristics) of an item. How similar two items are with respect to that characteristic (or combination of characteristics) can be calculated by the difference between values for that dimension of the respective purchase embeddings. Because the purchase embedding space is multi-dimensional, multiple different characteristics (or combination of characteristics) can be simultaneously considered, with the difference (or distance) between two purchase embedding providing a measure of similarity that has both magnitude and direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A dimension may correlate directly to a single parameter of an item (e.g., clothing size), but a dimension may also be a measure of some amalgamation of parameters (e.g., parameters describing the item, parameters characterizing how the item is bought or sold, an individual's or group's purchase habits, etc.) that are learned through analysis of purchase histories or inputted by a person. The elements may or may not be statistically independent. Further, purchase embeddings are not limited to tuples where each element have the same range or type of values. A purchase embedding may comprise a set of elements that, for example, could be defined by range of integer values (e.g., &#x2212;10 to +10), a real valued number from 0 to 1 (e.g., 0.567), a binary value (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no), a set of categories (e.g., formal, casual, business-casual), etc. When, the dimensions are created through a machine learning process, the parameters that go into defining a dimension may not be easily discernable.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, with purchase embeddings, a buyer's search for &#x201c;candles&#x201d; may return buying options for scented candles and incense from local vendors within a specific geographical region. This suggestion may be based on the buyer's past purchase history or search history that indicates a pattern of shopping for air deodorizers at local stores in the specific geographical region. Though not obvious upon first examination, purchase embedding enable correlations to be drawn between scented candles and air deodorizers because they provide the same effect of emitting a scent, and by extension draw a correlation to incense, which like scented candles, are burned to provide the scent. The ability to derive a preference for local vendors over big box stores, and to determine which local vendors stock the recommended products is another capability that results from using purchase embeddings and the disclosed system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As another example, a buyer may have a particular shopping pattern of purchasing a &#x201c;DC Lottery&#x201d; ticket, a sugar donut, and soft serve ice cream every Monday around 12:00 pm within a particular one mile region in Washington, D.C. Though the items themselves may be generally unrelated, purchase embeddings may be used to recommend a similar purchasing pattern in a different geographic region. For example, if the buyer is traveling in Burlington, Vt. on a Monday, purchase embeddings would enable a recommendation (e.g., from an application on the user's mobile phone) for a similar one mile route in Vermont to purchase a &#x201c;Vermont Lottery&#x201d; ticket, a cider donut, and a &#x201c;creemee&#x201d; (local name for soft serve ice cream), so that the buyer can duplicate their customary pattern. Here, utilizing purchase embeddings, three different factors may be considered (ether individually or in combination): 1) the similarity between the previously bought items respectively to the recommended items; 2) the purchase pattern of the purchased items by the buyer; and/or 3) the similarity (or dissimilarity) of the purchased items to each other. With respect to the first relationship, one or more elements of the purchase embeddings would reflect the likeness (e.g., based on a minimum distance between the purchase embeddings) between the previously purchased items respectively to their comparable recommended items based on parameters that describe the items themselves. Though the names of the items are different (e.g., soft serve versus creemee), other characteristics of the items enable the system to identify that the items are nonetheless essentially the same or similar things. With respect to the second relationship, one or more elements of the purchase embedding would reflect the likeness between how the previously purchased items are bought/sold to how the recommended items are bought/sold. Here characteristics such as time of day of the purchases, sequence of making the purchases, repetition of the purchases, and geographic locations are taken into account. With respect to the third relationship, distance and vector relationships (e.g., vector magnitude and/or direction) in the embedding space between the three purchased items may be compared to and duplicated within some threshold to distance relationships between the three recommended items. As compared to finding the shortest distance between purchase embeddings for finding the most similar items, the purchase embeddings are used to find, for example, that the three previously purchased items compare to each other in the same way as the three suggested items. While different elements of a purchase embedding may be a measure of any one of these factors, a purchase embedding element may reflect any combination of these factors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">How well these purchase recommendations match the buyer's intent can be measured, for example, by whether the recommended items are ultimately bought or by asking/polling the buyer about how useful the recommendation was.

For this transaction, the buyer may scan the receipt to generate a transaction record <b>200</b> that includes some of the parameters mentioned above (e.g., item name, cost, tax, vendor name, data and time of sale, identity of the purchaser).

Other pre-filters may be applied to limit results to items sold by a specific type of vendor (e.g., small business), or items of a specific size (e.g., small or medium, but not large). As another example, parameters characterizing the buyer may be removed such that the generated search embedding does not describe the user's personal information or preferences.

Other pre-filters may be applied to limit the purchase records searched to those of items sold by a specific type of vendor (e.g., small business), or items of a specific size (e.g., small or medium, but not large). In applying filters, the pool of purchase embedding records to consider in a query may be limited to just those that met the pre-filter criteria. For example, a pre-filter may limit the search to within a certain cluster of items (e.g., items defined by certain area or ranges of the dimensions in the embedding space).
