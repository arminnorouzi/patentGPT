For example, JP 2005-144797 A discloses a printing apparatus that determines whether a particular event that affects an image, such as sheet feeder switching, full load, paper depletion, a paper jam, or expiration of life of a consumable supply, has occurred during an image output process, and, on the basis of the result of the detection, ejects each affected paper sheet to an escape sheet ejection destination that is different from the regular ejection destination. Further, in this printing apparatus, information, such as the job name, the cause of the defect, the time, and the page number, about a paper sheet ejected to the escape sheet ejection destination is printed on a header page, and the header page is output to the escape sheet ejection destination. In this manner, checking of the details of an abnormality is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP 2016-61603 A discloses an apparatus that detects a defect by reading a printed material output from a printing apparatus with a testing apparatus independent of the printing apparatus. The apparatus displays, in a list, the job number, the number of copies, the page number, the front/back side, the number of defects, a read image, detailed information, and the like about a defective paper sheet, and positions and projects defect information onto the actual defective portion of the printed material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a case where an abnormal paper sheet is detected in a printing apparatus, not only the abnormal paper sheet is ejected to a sheet catch tray (a second sheet catch tray) different from the regular sheet catch tray, but also the abnormal paper sheet and the succeeding paper sheets are ejected to the second sheet catch tray. For example, an abnormal paper sheet appears in a first job, and the abnormal paper sheet and the succeeding paper sheets of the first job are ejected to the second sheet catch tray. If an abnormal paper sheet also appears in a second job being executed immediately after the first job, the abnormal paper sheet and the succeeding paper sheets of the second job are ejected to the second sheet catch tray and are stacked on the abnormal paper sheet and the succeeding paper sheets of the first job.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case where abnormal paper sheets and succeeding paper sheets of a plurality of jobs are stacked on the second sheet catch tray in this manner, it is difficult to find and retrieve a target abnormal paper sheet from among the paper sheets stacked on the second sheet catch tray, even if defect information about the abnormal paper sheet is displayed in a list or is printed out as disclosed in JP 2005-144797 A or JP 2016-61603 A.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is to solve the above problem and aims to provide an image forming system and an abnormal sheet information display method for easily finding and retrieving a target abnormal paper sheet among abnormal paper sheets and the succeeding paper sheets ejected to a different sheet catch tray from the regular sheet catch tray.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the abovementioned object, according to an aspect of the present invention, an image forming system reflecting one aspect of the present invention comprises: a sheet feeder; an image former that forms an image on a paper sheet; a conveyor that conveys a paper sheet supplied from the sheet feeder to a sheet ejection destination via the image former; a switcher that switches sheet ejection destinations; a reader that optically reads a paper sheet being conveyed by the conveyor between the image former and the switcher, and outputs a read image; an abnormal sheet detector that detects an abnormal paper sheet by analyzing the read image; a storage; a display; and a hardware processor that performs: ejection destination switch control to control the switcher to eject an abnormal paper sheet detected by the abnormal sheet detector and a succeeding paper sheet following the abnormal paper sheet to a second ejection destination different from a regular ejection destination; storage control, for each of the abnormal paper sheet and the succeeding paper sheet ejected to the second ejection destination, to associate sheet information indicating whether a paper sheet is an abnormal paper sheet, the read image of the paper sheet, and a stacking order of the paper sheet at the second ejection destination with one another, and store the sheet information, the read image, and the stacking order into the storage; and display control to cause the display to display the sheet information, the stacking order, and the read image associated with one another and stored in the storage, the sheet information, the stacking order, and the read image being associated with one another on the

As for each succeeding paper sheet, on the other hand, it is not necessary to check the back side, as long as the overlapping relationship with the abnormal paper sheet is clear. Therefore, for each abnormal paper sheet having an image abnormality on its back side, read images of the front and back sides are displayed on the confirmation screen. For each of the other paper sheets (abnormal paper sheets each having an image abnormality only on its front side, and the succeeding paper sheets), only a read image of the front side is displayed on the confirmation screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows an example of the thumbnail screen <b>100</b> at a time of two-sided printing.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an example of the page-by-page screen <b>92</b> at a time of two-sided printing in a case where the sheet ejection information about an abnormal paper sheet having a normal front side and an abnormal back side is displayed.

The controller <b>20</b> of the image forming system <b>5</b> monitors the detection value of the removal detector <b>72</b> that determines whether stacked paper sheets have been removed from a sheet catch tray that is a second ejection destination (step S<b>401</b>; No). If paper sheet removal is detected (step S<b>401</b>; Yes), the controller <b>20</b> waits until a second condition that is a predetermined weighting requirement is satisfied (step S<b>402</b>; No).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The second condition is satisfied when an instruction or an operation for deleting sheet ejection information is received from the user, when the image forming system <b>5</b> ejects a new paper sheet to the second ejection destination from which paper sheet removal has been detected, or when new printing is started after detection of paper sheet removal.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the second condition is satisfied (step S<b>402</b>; Yes), the sheet ejection information relating to the sheet ejection destination from which the paper sheet removal has been detected is deleted from the storage <b>43</b> (step S<b>403</b>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Normally, the user removes all the paper sheets stacked at the second ejection destination from the second ejection destination, and places the removed paper sheets at hand, before performing an operation to identify an abnormal paper sheet by comparing the read images or the thumbnail images displayed on the confirmation screen with the print contents of the respective paper sheets. Therefore, if the sheet ejection information is deleted only on the condition that paper sheets are removed from the second ejection destination, the sheet ejection information disappears before the user compares the read images with the printed material, and the confirmation screen necessary for the user is not displayed. In view of this, sheet ejection information is deleted after the second condition described above is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The above second condition is adopted for the following reasons. It is considered that the user issues a deletion instruction after completing an abnormal sheet removal checking operation. Further, it is considered that the user resumes the next printing after completing an abnormal sheet removal checking operation. Therefore, the past sheet ejection information is removed on condition that the next printing is resumed, or an abnormal paper sheet is newly detected and is ejected to the second ejection destination in the resumed printing.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Note that the image forming system <b>5</b> can also cause the communication unit <b>42</b> to transmit the sheet ejection information stored in the storage <b>43</b> to the external terminal <b>3</b> through the network <b>2</b>.
