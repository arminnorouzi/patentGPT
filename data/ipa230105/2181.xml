This enables space saving.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, in order to complicatedly switch conveyance routes, as described above, in a position where three conveyance paths cross each other, a plurality of gates is combined and used. Therefore, space fails to be saved from the point of view of the use of a plurality of gates.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, in the conveyance switching apparatus described above, one driving means is used. However, two conveyance switching blades are used, and therefore space fails to be saved. Further, in the conveyance switching apparatus described above, one driving means causes two conveyance switching blades to be interlocked with each other, and therefore conveyance routes fail to be complicatedly switched, as described above, in a position where three conveyance paths cross each other.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A conveyance route switching mechanism and a paper sheet handling apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention are described below with reference to the drawings by using, as an example, a conveyance route switching mechanism <b>1</b> and an automated transaction apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an internal configuration of the automated transaction apparatus <b>100</b> (at the time of deposits).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an internal configuration of the automated transaction apparatus <b>100</b> (at the time of withdrawals).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that each of the upward/downward, forward/backward, and leftward/rightward directions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>7</b></figref> described below is only an example in a case where it is assumed that a customer side of the automated transaction apparatus <b>100</b> is a forward direction.
