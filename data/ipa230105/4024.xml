A finished lens refers to a lens whose object-side surface (usually, a convex surface) and eyeball-side surface (usually, a concave surface) are mirror optical surfaces that satisfy a prescription lens power, and whose optical surfaces do not require curving processing. Note that the object-side surface of the lens refers to a surface out of the surfaces that constitute the lens and is to be visible when the lens is worn as an eyeglass. Also, the eyeball-side surface of the lens refers to a surface out of the surfaces that constitute the lens and is located on the eyeball side of the wearer when the lens is worn as the eyeglass.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, a semi-finished lens refers to a lens that has an object-side surface (usually, a convex surface) and an eyeball-side surface, and does not have a vision correction function, and only the object-side surface has a mirror-finished optical surface, and the eyeball-side surface is an unprocessed surface. The semi-finished lens is designed to have a lens thickness with a margin to be removed through processing such that the lens manufacturer can produce a lens having a vision correction function by performing surface processing (grinding, cutting, polishing, and the like) on the eyeball-side surface according to a lens prescription power.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-2012-228806A</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2: JP-2014-182278A</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 3: JP-2019-179219A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to reduce the weight of an eyeglass lens so as to not burden the wearer of the eyeglass lens, conventionally, the eyeglass lens is designed in a shape such that the thickness of the frame edge (edge thickness) of the lens is minimized according to a value of the wearer's prescription and frame shape (e.g., see Patent Document 3).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, because the frame edge thickness of the lens is minimized, a peripheral edge portion of a semi-finished lens may be cut during lens processing. In particular, cuts (also referred to as &#x201c;knife edges&#x201d;) are likely to occur in the peripheral edge portion of the semi-finished lens with a positive power or astigmatism prescription while the semi-finished lens is being processed, and the lens may crack during processing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, in a step of polishing the eyeball-side surface of the semi-finished lens, when the entire object-side surface of the lens is fixed through blocking for fixing the semi-finished lens, a blocking material is cut together with the lens while a processing surface is being cut, which causes the problem of having to dispose of waste generated during lens processing. On the other hand, in order to prevent the blocking material from being cut, if the semi-finished lens is fixed at the minimum required blocking diameter, an unfixed area outside the blocking diameter includes a peripheral portion of the frame. Thus, machining accuracy cannot be ensured, resulting in the issue of the resulting surface being optically unstable.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, a defective portion being formed due to a cut in the peripheral edge portion of the lens is problematic after the lens is polished. When surface treatment such as antireflection coating or hard coating is to be performed on the convex surface or concave surface of the lens, for example, the outer peripheral shape of the lens may not match the shape of a lens holding tool. Therefore, a problem arises in the surface treatment step, such as surface treatment being performed on a surface that originally does not require surface treatment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Conventional Patent Document 1 discloses a method for manufacturing a plastic lens for an eyeglass having a structure in which a lens side surface has a groove portion pinched inward and the shape of a cross section in a plan view that intersects the groove portion is non-circular.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, conventional Patent Document 2 discloses an eyeglass lens base member (semi-finished lens) constituted by a lens main portion having two lens surfaces formed in a rectangular shape when viewed in the direction of an optical axis and a relatively thin edge portion that protrudes laterally from the lens main portion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The plastic lens for an eyeglass obtained using the manufacturing method disclosed in Patent Document 1 above has the effect of being able to reduce waste that is generated in the eyeglass manufacturing step. However, it is not possible to avoid the above-described issues, that is, the occurrence of cuts in the peripheral edge portion of the lens in the step of processing the semi-finished lens.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, cuts are likely to occur in a thin edge portion of the eyeglass lens base member with the structure disclosed in Patent Document 2 above when the eyeball-side surface is processed, and thus the above-described issues cannot also be resolved.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of this, the present invention was made to resolve such conventional issues, and an object thereof is to provide a semi-finished lens with which it is possible to prevent the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As a result of intensive studies to resolve the above issues, the inventors of the present invention found that the issues can be resolved by the invention having the following configurations.

A completed eyeglass lens having a vision correction function can be obtained as a result of the lens manufacturer performing surface processing (grinding, cutting, polishing, and the like) on the eyeball-side surface such that the lens has a desired lens power that corresponds to a lens prescription value. It is possible to obtain an eyeglass lens having only a concave surface on the eyeball side, or an eyeglass lens having a concave surface in which a portion thereof includes a convex surface, for example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0062">Plastics are mainly used as the material of the eyeglass lens, and plastics are also preferably used as the material of the semi-finished lens according to the present invention. Specifically, it is possible to use various base members that are usually used as plastic lenses, and to manufacture lenses by injecting a lens monomer into a lens forming mold and performing curing treatment thereon.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0063">There is no particular limitation on the lens monomer, and it is possible to use various types of monomers that are usually used to manufacture plastic lenses. It is possible to use a monomer having a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring, an ester bond, a carbonate bond, or a urethane bond, in its molecule, and the like, for example.

Thus, when surface treatment such as antireflection coating or hard coating is performed on a convex surface or a concave surface of the polished lens, the outer peripheral shape of the lens matches the shape of the lens holding tool, and thus it is possible to resolve the above-described conventional issues arising in a surface treatment step performed after lens processing is performed. Also, even if blocking is performed at a blocking diameter with which the entire frame is covered during lens processing, there is no need to cut a blocking material at an outer peripheral portion of the lens, which is to be a portion outside the frame, and waste disposal is facilitated during the above-described conventional lens processing. Furthermore, blocking can be performed according to the outer diameter of a semi-finished lens, and the types of block rings used in blocking can be reduced, regardless of the size of the frame.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0090">A conventional semi-finished lens does not have a cutting allowance so as to provide versatility such that the semi-finished lens can take various frame shapes. In contrast, in the present invention, frame shapes are narrowed in advance, and a cutting allowance (non-optical region) for when an eyeglass lens is processed is provided. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing. That is, in the present invention, at the cost of versatility, it is possible to prevent the edge portion from being cut when processing is performed, compared to conventional semi-finished lenses. When eyeglass lenses whose frame shapes are narrowed down to some extent are to be manufactured, the semi-finished lens according to the present invention can be suitably used.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view showing a second embodiment of the semi-finished lens of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is the perspective view of the entire second embodiment.

Also, the optical region <b>31</b> and the non-optical region <b>32</b> can be in contact with each other continuously or discontinuously at a boundary <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0112">In the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> of this embodiment, the non-optical region <b>32</b> is located so as to surround the optical region <b>31</b>. That is, unlike the first and second embodiments, the non-optical region <b>32</b> is also arranged in the left-right direction of the optical region <b>31</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut in multiple directions.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0113">Although not shown, in this embodiment as well, the amount of sag in the vertical direction of the optical region <b>31</b> increases from the center to the peripheral edge of the semi-finished lens <b>3</b>. On the other hand, it is preferable that the amount of sag in the vertical direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b> is constant, or increases from the center to the peripheral edge of the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> at a smaller ratio than in the optical region <b>31</b>. Accordingly, the thickness and the area of the non-optical region <b>32</b> can be secured with ease, and thus it is possible to more remarkably obtain the effect of preventing the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0114">With the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> according to this embodiment, curvature changes at the boundary <b>33</b> between the optical region <b>31</b> and the non-optical region <b>32</b> of the object-side surface <b>30</b>. That is, the curvature changes at the boundary <b>33</b> from the curvature value of the optical region <b>31</b> to the curvature value of the non-optical region <b>32</b>. The curvature value may change discontinuously or continuously.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0115">In this embodiment as well, the optical region <b>31</b> and the non-optical region <b>32</b> also have different curvatures in at least one of the vertical direction and the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0116">Also, in this embodiment as well, the curvature in the vertical direction of the optical region <b>31</b> is preferably larger than the curvature in the vertical direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the thickness and the area of the non-optical region <b>32</b> can be secured with ease, and thus it is possible to more remarkably obtain the effect of preventing the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0117">Also, in this embodiment, the curvature in the vertical direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b> located in the peripheral edge portion of the optical region <b>31</b> is also preferably different from the curvature in the horizontal direction thereof. A configuration can be adopted in which the curvature in the horizontal direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b> is larger than the curvature in the vertical direction thereof, for example. The curvature in the vertical direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b> may be zero. The lens thickness at any position in the non-optical region <b>32</b> can be larger than the smallest thickness at the boundary <b>33</b> between the optical region <b>31</b> and the non-optical region <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0118">With the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> according to this embodiment, the curvature in the vertical direction of the optical region <b>31</b> is BC5,and the curvature in the horizontal direction is also BC5, for example.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0119">Also, the curvature in the vertical direction of the non-optical region <b>32</b> located in a peripheral edge portion of the optical region <b>31</b> is BC0 (zero), and the curvature in the horizontal direction is BC3.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0120">The above curvature values are merely examples, and the curvature values are not limited to these values, and may be optimized according to a frame shape, lens prescription values, and the like.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0121">As described above, in the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> of this embodiment, the optically ineffective non-optical region <b>32</b> is provided outside the optical region <b>31</b> that is larger than the frame shape, along the outer edge portion of the semi-finished lens <b>3</b>. Also, preferably, for the optical region <b>31</b> and the non-optical region <b>32</b>, the values of curvature in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction are adjusted as described above.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0122">The semi-finished lens <b>3</b> of this embodiment also has the same effects as the semi-finished lens <b>1</b> of the above-described first embodiment. That is, according to the semi-finished lens <b>3</b> of this embodiment, a cutting allowance can be provided by providing the optically ineffective non-optical region <b>32</b> at the peripheral edge portion of the optical region <b>31</b>, and thus, even when the thickness of a lens edge is optimized for the frame shape, it is possible to prevent the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing, regardless of the prescription power and frame shape of the eyeglass wearer, and the like. Also, it is possible to prevent the peripheral edge portion of the lens from being cut during lens processing in this manner, and thus, the outer diameter of the lens is maintained. Thus, no problem arises in the surface treatment step performed after conventional lens processing described above is performed. Furthermore, it is also possible to solve the above-described conventional problem of having to dispose of waste generated during lens processing.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0123">Although the semi-finished lens according to the present invention was described above in detail using the first to third embodiments, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0124">A non-optical region may have a spherical or an aspherical surface, and may have a round columnar surface or an astigmatic surface (toric surface), for example. Furthermore, the non-optical region may be a region that includes a combination of these surfaces. Also, the non-optical region may include a flat surface.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0125">Furthermore, although the non-optical regions <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> of the semi-finished lens <b>1</b> are formed as two regions that are located at opposing positions with the optical region <b>11</b> interposed therebetween in the first embodiment, the number of non-optical regions need not be two, and may be one, for example. The same applies to the second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0126">Furthermore, the invention of this application includes a method for manufacturing an eyeglass lens.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0127">That is, a method for manufacturing an eyeglass lens having a lens power that corresponds to a prescription value of the lens includes a step of preparing a semi-finished lens having an object-side surface and an eyeball-side surface and a step of processing the eyeball-side surface of the semi-finished lens according to the prescription value of the lens. The object-side surface of the semi-finished lens includes an optical region and a non-optical region that have different design shapes. The semi-finished lens prepared using this manufacturing method can have favorable characteristics of the semi-finished lenses according to the above embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0128"><b>1</b> Semi-finished lens</p><p id="p-0113" num="0129"><b>10</b> Object-side surface</p><p id="p-0114" num="0130"><b>11</b> Optical region</p><p id="p-0115" num="0131"><b>12</b>, <b>13</b> Non-optical region</p><p id="p-0116" num="0132"><b>14</b>, <b>15</b> Boundary (between optical region and non-optical region)</p><p id="p-0117" num="0133"><b>16</b> Eyeball-side surface</p><p id="p-0118" num="0134"><b>2</b> Semi-finished lens</p><p id="p-0119" num="0135"><b>20</b> Object-side surface</p><p id="p-0120" num="0136"><b>21</b> Optical region</p><p id="p-0121" num="0137"><b>22</b>, <b>23</b> Non-optical region</p><p id="p-0122" num="0138"><b>24</b>, <b>25</b> Boundary (between optical region and non-optical region)</p><p id="p-0123" num="0139"><b>26</b> Eyeball-side surface</p><p id="p-0124" num="0140"><b>3</b> Semi-finished lens</p><p id="p-0125" num="0141"><b>30</b> Object-side surface</p><p id="p-0126" num="0142"><b>31</b> Optical region</p><p id="p-0127" num="0143"><b>32</b> Non-optical region</p><p id="p-0128" num="0144"><b>33</b> Boundary (between optical region and non-optical region)</p><p id="p-0129" num="0145">L Vertical direction</p><p id="p-0130" num="0146">H Horizontal direction</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
