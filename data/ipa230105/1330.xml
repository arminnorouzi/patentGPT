As such and as discussed further below, decanting backwash receiver assembly <b>10</b> is configured and dimensioned to be utilized for decanting of input feeds <b>11</b>. The input feed <b>11</b> can enter assembly <b>10</b> via one or more inlets <b>12</b> of assembly <b>10</b> (or of assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; or of assembly <b>10</b>&#x2033;, discussed below).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In exemplary embodiments, assembly <b>10</b> (or assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; or <b>10</b>&#x2033;) is configured and dimensioned to receive a filter backwash surge flow <b>11</b> of slurry (e.g., solids and liquid mixture), and assembly <b>10</b> provides for settling of the solids from flow <b>11</b>, and provides for decanting of a liquid layer above the settled solids, and optionally provides for de-wetting the settled solids, and provides for discharge of the settled solids (e.g., liquid wetted) from the bottom of the assembly <b>10</b> (e.g., to a container, such as a drum, cart, tote, hopper, etc.).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Exemplary assembly <b>10</b> (or assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; or <b>10</b>&#x2033;) is also configured and dimensioned to receive a &#x201c;wet cake&#x201d; filter backwash surge flow <b>11</b>. In general, the &#x201c;wet cake&#x201d; surge flow <b>11</b> results when some portion of the liquid in the filter is removed before the filter backwash is performed. The &#x201c;wet cake&#x201d; may contain a lower weight percent (&#x201c;wt %&#x201d;) or a higher wt % of solids compared to non-wet cake filter backwash surge flow <b>11</b> to the assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, assembly <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, <b>10</b>&#x2033; includes a vessel housing <b>14</b> that extends from a first end <b>16</b> to a second end <b>18</b>.

In exemplary embodiments, the upper section <b>20</b> by design has a larger volume than the volume of the filter vessel utilized in the filter backwash operation, and upper section <b>20</b> has sufficient volume capacity to accept the surge flow <b>11</b> of slurry (liquid and solids) from the filter utilized in the filter backwash operation. The upper section <b>20</b> can be provided with one or more drain nozzles at various elevations to allow decanting of liquid from the upper section <b>20</b> (e.g., after solids have settled).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A filter backwash (e.g., such as from a Mott LSI filter) can require an instantaneous high flow surge of liquid during the backwash operation to effectively remove the collected filter cake solids from the filter media (e.g., porous metal candle for Mott LSI filter). The backwash surge flow <b>11</b> can be created by pressurizing the filter with gas to create a pressure drop from the filter to the backwash receiver assembly <b>10</b>, and then opening a discharge valve on a process line that is connected from the filter to the backwash receiver assembly <b>10</b> (e.g., to thereby allow flow <b>11</b> to enter assembly <b>10</b> via inlets <b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The exemplary middle section <b>22</b> of vessel housing <b>14</b> extends from a first interior position <b>21</b> to a second interior position <b>23</b>.

The slope of the tapered cone shape of middle section <b>22</b> allows for settling solids to move though the liquid to the lower section <b>24</b> (e.g., lower collection section <b>24</b>). In certain embodiments, the slope of the tapered cone shape of middle section <b>22</b> allows &#x201c;wet cake&#x201d; to move to the lower collection section <b>24</b> (e.g., without settling of solids from liquid). The middle section <b>22</b> can be provided with one or more drain nozzles <b>26</b> at various elevations of middle section <b>22</b> (e.g., to allow decanting of liquid from the middle section <b>22</b> after solids have settled).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The exemplary lower section <b>24</b> (e.g., lower collection section <b>24</b>) of vessel housing <b>14</b> takes the form of a cylindrical vessel section <b>24</b> (e.g., the diameter of section <b>24</b> is smaller than the diameter of sections <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>) that allows for collection of the settled solids from flow <b>11</b>, and provides for delineation of the solids-liquid interface.
