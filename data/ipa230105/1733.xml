More specifically, this disclosure relates to a micro-optic security device with phase aligned image layers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Depending on their construction and integration into the end product, micro-optic security devices with a dynamic, difficult to reproduce appearance can significantly enhance the counterfeit resistance of security documents, such as currency notes, passports and other documents requiring trustworthy visual indicia of authenticity. The overall effectiveness of a particular micro-optic security device depends on a plurality of variables, including, without limitation, the distinctiveness of visual effects produced by the device, the difficulty of reproduction, and the device's capacity for large-scale production. For example, a micro-optic security device which produces an indistinct or visually uninteresting visual effect, is less likely to be noticed by most end-users, and by implication, its absence is similarly likely to go unnoticed by end-users. In such cases, the likelihood of counterfeit documents, which lack the correct micro-optic security device, being circulated undetected is higher than in cases where the micro-optic security device provides a visual effect which, due to some combination of clarity or novelty, stands out to end users. Similarly, the effectiveness of a micro-optic security device is enhanced when it can be manufactured at scale, thereby lowering the price point and catalyzing widespread adoption. Pushing the envelope with respect to achieving increasingly distinctive visual effects which are simultaneously, beyond the reach of counterfeiters, but at the same time, capable of being manufactured at scale by legitimate actors, remains a persistent source of technical challenges and opportunities for improvement within the field of micro-optic security device design.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure illustrates embodiments of a micro-optic security device with phase aligned image layers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first embodiment, a micro-optic security device includes a planar array of microlenses, which are configured to focus light along a plurality of focal paths, the plurality of focal paths associated with a viewing angle of the micro-optic security device.

It is intended that the present disclosure encompass such changes and modifications as falling within the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate an example of a micro-optic security device according to certain embodiments of this disclosure and aspects of the micro-optic security device's operation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to the non-limiting example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref>, a first view <b>101</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and a second view <b>151</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) of a security document <b>105</b> comprising a micro-optic security device <b>110</b> are provided in the figures. According to various embodiments, security document <b>105</b> is a passport, currency note, identification card, or other document which benefits from trustworthy visual indicia of authenticity. In the non-limiting example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref>, micro-optic security device <b>110</b> comprises a layer of focusing elements (for example, microlenses), and an image stack comprising a region in which two or more layers of image icons are phase-aligned. As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;phase-aligned,&#x201d; as used with reference to icon structures within the layers of a multi-layer icon stack, encompasses the property wherein colored icons of a first icon layer occupy locations of the first icon layer associated with focal paths of a first range of viewing angles, colored icons of a second icon layer occupy locations of the second icon layer associated with focal paths of a second range of viewing angles, colored icons of the first icon layer occupy locations within the first icon layer associated with focal paths outside of the second range of viewing angles, and colored icons of the second icon layer occupy locations of the second layer associated with focal paths outside of the first range of viewing angles. In practical terms, where colored image icons are phase-aligned according to certain embodiments of this disclosure, cross-talk, or the condition where, for a given range of viewing angles, colored image icons from two or more layers of an icon stack are simultaneously projected by the focusing elements, can be substantially controlled, and incorporated or eliminated as a design feature of a synthetic image projected by the micro-optic security device. According to certain embodiments of this disclosure, controlling the incidence of cross-talk between image icon layers facilitates the creation of micro-optic security devices which exhibit improvement along at least three dimensions by which the performance of micro-optic security devices is measured. Specifically, with phase alignment between image icons as a controllable design parameter, transitions between multi-color synthetic images projected by the micro-optic security device at a first range of viewing angles to synthetic images projected by the micro-optic security device over a second range of viewing angles can become crisper, and embodiments according to this disclosure can, for example, both produce multi-color &#x201c;flicker&#x201d; effects, wherein a synthetic image comprises colored components which rapidly appear and disappear, as well as effects wherein colored regions of the synthetic image progressively move or change color. The incorporation of multi-color &#x201c;flicker&#x201d; effects, in addition to progressively evolving colored effects, can provide synthetic images that are eye-catching and engage viewers. Additionally, achieving phase alignment between layers of icon layers presents additional manufacturing challenges, and by implication, makes such devices even harder to counterfeit by malicious actors.

A micro-optic security device comprises a plurality (typically millions or more) of micro-optic cells. At a basic level, a micro-optic cell comprises a focusing element and one or more icon structures within focal regions (also referred to as a &#x201c;footprint&#x201d;) of the focusing element. In the explanatory example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>, micro-optic cell <b>200</b> comprises focusing element <b>205</b>, which in this example, is a plano-convex microlens. Other focusing elements are possible, including without limitation, reflective focusing elements (i.e., very small curved mirrors) and gradient-index (&#x201c;GRIN&#x201d;) lenses.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this example, micro-optic cell <b>200</b> further comprises an image icon layer <b>210</b>, which contains retaining structures (for example, retaining structure <b>211</b>), in which icons <b>213</b> of colored material can be formed. The angle &#x398;a, at which icon <b>213</b> are projected to a viewer by focusing element <b>205</b>, depends on its location within the footprint (shown by left and right boundaries <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>) of focusing element <b>205</b>. As shown with reference to second view <b>251</b>, small shifts <b>253</b> in the position of an icon with respect to the footprint of focusing element <b>205</b> translate into a change in the angle &#x398;<sub>b</sub>, at which icon <b>213</b> is projected to a viewer. When manufactured at scale, some variation in the registration of the retaining structures of image icon layer <b>210</b> relative to the footprint of focusing element is generally inevitable. In certain real-world applications, the variations in registration between focusing elements can be on the order of the pitch of the lenses of the lens array.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the context of a micro-optic security device with a single image icon layer, variations in the registration of the image icon layer relative to the focusing element can manifest themselves to end-users as variations in the range of angles at which a particular synthetic image is projected to a viewer. In many applications utilizing a single icon layer, this variation in the viewing angle at which a particular synthetic image appears is a non-issue, or at most, a mild inconvenience, in that a user may have to &#x201c;play around&#x201d; with a security document to find a viewing angle at which a particular synthetic image appears. In the context of micro-optic security devices in which two or more icon layers are stacked, the aforementioned variations in registration translate into variations in the extent to which the colored icons of the icon layers are registered with one another. These variations in inter-icon layer registration can manifest themselves as muddy or &#x201c;soft&#x201d; changes in the synthetic image projected by the micro-optic security device over changes in ranges of viewing angle. For example, instead of the crisp switch from projecting first synthetic image <b>120</b> to second synthetic image <b>155</b> described with reference to the non-limiting example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref>, the micro-optic system may, simultaneously project components of a first and second synthetic image across an intermediate range of angles. Depending on the extent and character of the inter-layer registration issues, the projected image may variously appear as a gradual color shift effect (as opposed to a defined &#x201c;on-off,&#x201d; or &#x201c;flicker&#x201d; effect) or a muddy mixture of two or more colors, or as a visual cacophony wherein the different colors of the different icon layers are projected without any angular relationship to each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of micro-optic security devices and security documents with phase-aligned image layers, according to various embodiments of this disclosure.

Further, planar array of focusing elements includes one or more cells which one or more image icons of arrangement of first icon layer <b>320</b>, or second image icon layer <b>323</b> are located. Further, icon layer stack <b>308</b> includes at least one region in which colored image icons of the first icon layer <b>320</b> and colored image icons of the second image icon layer <b>323</b> are phase-aligned.

According to some embodiments, the individual focusing elements of planar array of focusing elements <b>305</b> are disposed at one or more local repeat periods. As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;local repeat period&#x201d; encompasses an expression of how often a particular feature of a layer of micro-optic security device <b>301</b> repeats within a region of interest.

By varying the ratio of the local repeat period of focusing elements to icon structures, aspects of the appearance of synthetic images of icon structures projected by the focusing elements can be tuned. For example, the apparent position of the synthetic image relative to the plane of micro-optic security device <b>301</b> can be changed through the ratio of the local repeat period of the focusing elements to the local repeat period of the icon structure, such that the synthetic image can appear to be floating above the plane of micro-optic security device <b>301</b>, or positioned below the plane of micro-optic security device <b>301</b> (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;deep&#x201d; or &#x201c;superdeep&#x201d; effect).

Accordingly, the icon structures comprising volumes of light-curable material of a first color (including, for example, first volume <b>815</b><i>a</i>) are surface-mounted image icons. According to various embodiments, the icon structures of first icon layer <b>805</b> are produced by directionally curing portions of an applied layer of uncured light curable material of the first color (for example, according to the method shown with reference to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref> of this disclosure).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates further constructional aspects of section <b>800</b> of the micro-optic security device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> by showing plurality of focal paths <b>830</b> structured light from one or more sources projecting light upon section <b>800</b> at an angle (or range of angles) corresponding to a first range of viewing angles.

Accordingly, at viewing angles within the first range of viewing angles, colored material in second icon layer <b>810</b> does not contribute to a synthetic image projected by the micro-optic system.

At the same time, digital tooling, and the creation of icon structures without having to make molds for retaining structures offers new possibilities, including, without limitation, the ability to change the icon structure of the end product without the retooling costs associated with making new molds for retaining structures, and &#x201c;freeing up&#x201d; areas of the icon layer for additional colored icon structures.
