A frame rate, as used herein, is a measure of a number of frames, or images, per second that an electronic device may display. For instance, the electronic device may play a video at 60 frames per second (fps). To render an image, a display device charges and discharges pixels of a display panel. The display device has a frequency that is based on the charge and discharge rates of the pixels. The frequency is a measure of the number of times per second that the display device redraws the images on display. Refresh rate, as used herein, is the frequency of the display device. If the display device has a 60 Hertz (Hz) frequency and the electronic device plays the video at 60 fps, the redrawing of the images is indiscernible to a user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A video game application (e.g., executable code, or machine-readable instructions, that enable a user to play a game) played on the electronic device may generate images at a variable frame rate. The variable frame rate enables the video game to generate more complex images (e.g., images having more data) in response to actions occurring within the video game. For instance, a first image of the video game may be a two-dimensional (2-D) image and a second image may be a three-dimensional (3-D) image. The 3-D image comprises more data that takes longer to render than the 2-D image. Tearing, or image splitting, occurs in response to the display device refreshing before the 3-D image fully renders. To prevent tearing, the display device may take longer to refresh the 3-D image (e.g., reduce the refresh rate). However, flickering of the display device occurs in response to a frequency of a subsequent frame exceeding the frequency of the previous frame because the pixels of the display panel have not had sufficient time to discharge. The flickering of the display device diminishes the user experience. Additionally, the unbalanced discharge of the pixels stresses the pixels, and the stress reduces a quality of the images displayed on the display panel over time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This description describes an electronic device that reduces flickering of the display device by adjusting a reference voltage of the pixels to modify the discharge rate of the pixels. The electronic device adjusts the reference voltage in response to a variable frequency of image data transmitted to the display device. The image data may include audio data, video data, a frame rate, a frequency, or a combination thereof for a frame of the image data. Video data, as used herein, includes individual images as well as videos comprising multiple images, where an individual image is a subsequent frame of a previous individual image. The electronic device comprises a processor, a timing controller, a first voltage supply circuit, a second voltage supply circuit, and a scaler circuit comprising a buffer and a counter. The scaler circuit receives the image data from the processor and determines whether a second frame has a different frequency than a first frame. The second frame is subsequent and sequential to the first frame. In response to the second frame having a different frequency than the first frame, the scaler circuit adjusts a voltage of the second voltage supply. By adjusting the reference voltage supplied to the pixels, the stress on the pixels is reduced, flickering is mitigated, and the user experience is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some examples, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device comprises a voltage supply circuit to provide a reference voltage usable to discharge pixels in a display device; and a scaler circuit coupled to the voltage supply circuit. The scaler circuit is to buffer first and second frames and dynamically control the voltage supply circuit to modify the reference voltage based on a frequency of the first frame differing from a frequency of the second frame.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some examples, an electronic device is provided.

The display device comprises a timing controller circuit a first voltage supply circuit coupled to the timing controller circuit, the first voltage supply circuit to provide a supply voltage to charge pixels in the display device, a second voltage supply circuit coupled to the first voltage supply circuit, the second voltage supply circuit to provide a reference voltage to discharge the pixels in the display device, and a scaler circuit coupled to the second voltage supply circuit and the timing controller circuit. The scaler circuit is to receive first and second frames from the processor, buffer the second frame, transmit the first frame to the timing controller circuit, responsive to a frequency of the second frame differing from a frequency of the first frame, control the second voltage supply circuit to dynamically adjust the reference voltage, and transmit the second frame to the timing controller circuit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, an electronic device is provided.
