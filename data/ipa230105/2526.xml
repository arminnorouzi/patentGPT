the most widely used synthetic resins among thermoplastic resins.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vinyl chloride-based polymers can be produced by suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization, and bulk polymerization. Among these, in the case of suspension polymerization, a final polymerization conversion rate is high and operating costs are low, it is easy to recover unreacted monomers after polymerization is completed, maintenance is easy because of a small amount of scale accumulation in a polymerization reactor due to a coating system, and mass production is possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in order to process a vinyl chloride-based polymer into a final product, it is necessary to extrude the polymer after adding various additives thereto. In this case, when the fusion of the mixture proceeds rapidly, since the chains of the vinyl chloride-based polymer are easily disentangled and form a strong bond with each other, the mechanical properties of the final product are improved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the fusion proceeds slowly, since the chains of the vinyl chloride-based polymer cannot be disentangled, non-gelling particles are formed, and since these non-gelling particles act as defects in a final product, the mechanical properties of the final product may be degraded.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there have been continuous research efforts to improve fusibility when adding additives to a vinyl chloride-based polymer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to improving fusibility without affecting the thermal stability and polymerization time of a vinyl chloride-based polymer.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present invention provides a method of producing a vinyl chloride-based polymer including adding a vinyl chloride monomer and a monomer represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 to a reactor and performing polymerization, wherein an input amount of the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is from 1 to 4 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride monomer, and the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is continuously added to the reactor:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="15.07mm" wi="56.64mm" file="US20230002527A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In the above Chemical Formula 1, R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are each independently a hydrogen or a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl group.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011">According to a method of producing a vinyl chloride-based polymer of the present invention, it is possible to produce a vinyl chloride-based polymer with improved fusibility while maintaining the thermal stability and polymerization time of the vinyl chloride-based polymer at the same levels as those of conventional vinyl chloride-based polymers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODES OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail to help the understanding of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Terms and words used in this specification and the claims should not be interpreted as being limited to commonly used meanings or meanings in dictionaries, and, based on the principle that the inventors can appropriately define concepts of terms in order to describe their invention in the best way, the terms and words should be interpreted with meanings and concepts which are consistent with the technical spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The term &#x201c;polymerization conversion rate&#x201d; can be calculated by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Polymerization conversion rate (%)={(Total weight of monomers added until polymerization is terminated)&#x2212;(Total weight of unreacted monomers at the time of measuring polymerization conversion rate)}/(Total weight of monomers added until polymerization is terminated)&#xd7;100</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Method of Producing Vinyl Chloride-Based Polymer</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method of producing a vinyl chloride-based polymer includes adding a vinyl chloride monomer and a monomer represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 to a reactor and performing polymerization, wherein an input amount of the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is from 1 to 4 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride monomer, and the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is continuously added to the reactor:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="15.07mm" wi="56.64mm" file="US20230002527A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">In the above Chemical Formula 1, R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are each independently a hydrogen or a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl group.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">The input amount of monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 may be from 1 to 4 parts by weight and preferably from 2 to 3 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride monomer. Due to having lower reactivity than the vinyl chloride monomer, the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 can lower a polymerization rate and increase a polymerization time. However, when the above-described amount of monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is added, a vinyl chloride-based polymer having improved fusibility can be produced, and a decrease in polymerization rate and an increase in polymerization time can be minimized. On the other hand, when the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is not added or added in an amount less than the above-described amount, the fusibility of a vinyl chloride-based polymer cannot be improved. In addition, when more than the above-described amount of monomer represented by Chemical Formula 1 is added, since a polymerization rate is significantly reduced, the polymerization time is greatly increased. In addition, the thermal stability of a produced vinyl chloride-based polymer is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">In addition, when the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is continuously added, since the concentration of the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is maintained low while polymerization is carried out in a polymerization reactor, a decrease in polymerization rate and an increase in polymerization time due to the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">On the other hand, when the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is batch-added before the initiation of polymerization, since a polymerization rate is decreased, a polymerization time is greatly increased.

In addition, the time point at which the continuous addition of the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 ends may be a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate of from 60.0% to 80.0% and preferably from 65.0% to 75.0% is reached. When the above conditions are satisfied, since the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 is continuously added from the initial stage of polymerization to the end of polymerization, the concentration of the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 in a polymerization reaction can be maintained low. In this way, the decrease in polymerization rate, increase in polymerization time, and decrease in thermal stability due to the monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">The monomer represented by the Chemical Formula 1 may be one or more selected from the group consisting of 1,1-dichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloro-1-propylene, 1,1-dichloro-1-butene, 1,1-dichloro-1-pentene, 1,1-dichloro-1-hexene, 1,1-dichloro-1-heptene, 1,1-dichloro-1-octene, and 1,1-dichloro-1-nonene and is preferably 1,1-dichloroethylene.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">The vinyl chloride monomer may be batch-added to the reactor before the initiation of polymerization for process convenience, or may be dividedly added before polymerization and during polymerization to improve productivity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">Meanwhile, the polymerization may be suspension polymerization.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">The suspension polymerization may be carried out in the presence of an initiator, a dispersant, and an aqueous solvent.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">The initiator may be one or more selected from the group consisting of dicumyl peroxide, dipentyl peroxide, di(3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl)peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di-sec-butyl peroxydicarbonate, di(2-ethylhexyl)peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, t-butyl peroxyneoheptanoate, t-amyl peroxyneodecanoate, cumyl peroxyneodecanoate, cumyl peroxyneoheptanoate, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl peroxyneodecanoate, azobis-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile, potassium persulfate, and ammonium persulfate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">The dispersant may be one or more selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, partially saponified oil-soluble polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid, a copolymer of vinyl acetate and maleic anhydride, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, gelatin, calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan trioleate, polyoxyethylene, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">The aqueous solvent may be one or more selected from the group consisting of distilled water and ion-exchanged water.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The polymerization may be terminated when a polymerization conversion rate of from 85.0% to 95.0% and preferably from 85.0% to 90.0% is reached.

continuously adding 1 to 4 parts by weight of 1,1-dichloroethylene, had a high final polymerization conversion rate although a total polymerization time was not excessively increased as compared to Comparative Example 1 produced without adding 1,1-dichloroethylene. In addition, Examples 1 to 6 had a shorter fusion time and a more improved tensile yield strength than Comparative Example 1. On the other hand, when Examples 4 to 6 were compared, Example 4, which was produced by continuously adding 1,1-dichloroethylene from a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate was 0.0% to a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate of 70.0% was reached, had a shorter a fusion time than Example 5 produced by continuously adding 1,1-dichloroethylene from a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate was 0.0% to a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate of 81.0% was reached. In addition, Example 4 had excellent tensile yield strength and whiteness as compared to Example 6 produced by continuously adding 1,1-dichloroethylene from a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate was 11.0% to a time point at which a polymerization conversion rate of 70.0% was reached. When Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 were compared, Example 1, which was produced by continuously adding 1 part by weight of 1,1-dichloroethylene, had a significantly shorter total polymerization time than Comparative Example 2 produced by batch-adding 1 part by weight of 1,1-dichloroethylene.
