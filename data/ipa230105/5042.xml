Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the inventions described herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The systems and methods described herein perform a prescreening process on a potential borrower to determine which available credit cards the borrower will likely be issued after completing a full application with the issuer. The term &#x201c;potential borrower,&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;borrower,&#x201d; includes one or more of a single individual, a group of people, such as a couple or a family, or a business. The term &#x201c;prescreened credit card offers,&#x201d; &#x201c;prescreened offers,&#x201d; or &#x201c;matching offers,&#x201d; refers to zero or more credit card offers for which a potential borrower will likely be approved by the issuer, where the prescreening process may be based on credit data associated with the borrower, as well as approval rules for a particular credit card and/or credit card issuer, and any other related characteristics. In one embodiment, a particular credit card offer is included in prescreened credit card offers for a particular borrower if the likelihood that the borrower will be granted the particular credit card offer, after completion of a full application, is greater than a predetermined threshold, such as 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%, for example.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the prescreened offers are ranked, such as by assigning a 1-N ranking to each of N prescreened offers for a particular borrower, where N is the total number of prescreened offers for a particular borrower. In one embodiment, the rankings are generally based upon a bounty paid to the referrer. In another embodiment, the rankings are based on an expected value of each prescreened offer, which generally represents an expected monetary value to one or more referrers involved in providing the prescreened offer to the borrower. In one embodiment, the expected value of a credit card offer is based on a bounty associated with the offer, a click-through-rate for the offer, and/or a conversion rate for the offer. In another embodiment, the expected value for a credit card offer may be based on fewer or more attributes. Exemplary systems and methods for determining expected values and corresponding rankings for prescreened credit card offers are described below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is block diagram of a prescreened credit card offer ranking device <b>100</b>, or simply a &#x201c;ranking device <b>100</b>,&#x201d; configured to rank prescreened credit card offers.

For example, in one embodiment the prescreen device <b>162</b> comprises a prescreen data store comprising credit related data for a plurality of individuals. In one embodiment, the prescreen device <b>162</b> also comprises a computing device that determines one or more prescreened offers for borrowers and provides the prescreened offers directly to the borrower or to the ranking device <b>100</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The borrower <b>164</b>, also in communication with the network, may send information to the ranking device <b>100</b> via the network <b>160</b> via a website that interfaces with the ranking device <b>100</b>. Depending on the embodiment, information regarding a borrower may be provided to the ranking device <b>100</b> from a website that is controlled by the operator of the ranking device <b>100</b> (referred to generally as the &#x201c;ranking provider&#x201d;) or from a third party website, such as a commercial website that sells goods and/or services to visitors. The third party data source <b>166</b> may comprise any number of data sources, including web sites and customer databases of third party websites, storing information regarding potential borrowers. As described in further detail below, the ranking device <b>100</b> receives information regarding a potential borrower directly from the borrower <b>164</b> via a website controlled by the ranking provider, from the third party data source <b>166</b>, and/or from the prescreen device <b>162</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the ranking device <b>100</b> either initiates a prescreen process, performs a prescreen process, or simply receives prescreened offers for a borrower from the prescreen device <b>162</b>, for example, prior to ranking the prescreened offers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the ranking device <b>100</b> also includes three application modules that may be executed by the CPU <b>105</b>. More particularly, the application modules include a prescreen module <b>130</b>, a ranking module <b>150</b>, and a presentation module <b>170</b>, which are discussed in further detail below. Each of these application modules may include, by way of example, components, such as software components, object-oriented software components, class components and task components, processes, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, microcode, circuitry, data, databases, data structures, tables, arrays, and variables.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process that may be performed by the ranking device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or other suitable computing device in order to rank prescreened offers for borrowers. Depending on the embodiment, certain of the blocks described below may be removed, others may be added, and the sequence of the blocks may be altered. For example, in one embodiment the process may begin with block <b>230</b> where the ranking device <b>100</b> receives prescreened offers for a borrower from a prescreen device <b>162</b> without being previously involved in the prescreening process.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Beginning in block <b>210</b>, the prescreen module <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the ranking device <b>100</b> receives, or otherwise accesses, information regarding a potential borrower. For example, the prescreen module <b>130</b> may receive information, such as a name and address of the borrower <b>164</b>, that has been entered into a website that is dedicated to matching consumers to prescreened credit card offers. In one embodiment, the borrower <b>164</b> operates a computing device comprising a browser that is configured to render a web interface provided by the ranking entity or an affiliate of the ranking entity, such as an entity that performs the prescreening of borrowers. In this embodiment, the borrower may enter data into the user interface specifically for the purpose of being presented with one or more prescreened offers. In another embodiment, the borrower information may be received from another borrower data source <b>162</b>, such as a commercial website that wants to provide customers with one or more prescreened credit card offers. For example, a third party website that sells products and/or services to customers may send borrower data to the ranking device <b>100</b> in order to receive prescreened offers that may be presented to their customers. As noted above, in one embodiment the referrer of a borrower to apply for a credit card may receive a bounty upon issuance of an applied&#x2014;for credit card to the customer. Thus, if the borrower information is received from the borrower device <b>164</b> via a website operated by the ranking entity, the bounty may be paid to the ranking entity. Likewise, if borrower information is provided by a third part, such as from the third party data source <b>166</b>, a portion or all of the bounty may be paid to the third party. In other embodiments, the bounty could be shared between one or more third parties, the ranking entity, the prescreen entity, and/or others involved in the prescreening and ranking processes. In some embodiments, certain or all of the prescreened offers are not associated with a bounty.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moving to block <b>220</b>, the prescreen module <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) then performs the prescreen process, requests that a third party, such as the prescreen device <b>162</b>, performs the prescreen process, or simply receives prescreened credit card offers from the prescreen device <b>162</b>, for example. In one embodiment, the prescreen process accesses credit related data regarding the borrower and/or lender criteria associated with each of a plurality of credit card offers in order to determine one or more credit card offers that the borrower would likely be eligible for.

No. 11/537,330, titled &#x201c;Online Credit Card Prescreen Systems And Methods,&#x201d; filed on Sep. 29, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by references in its entirety, describes various methods of determining prescreened credit card offers for a potential borrower.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Continuing to block <b>230</b>, the prescreened offers are received by the prescreen module <b>130</b>, such as from the prescreen device <b>162</b>. Alternatively, in an embodiment where the prescreen module <b>130</b> performs the prescreen process, in block <b>230</b> the prescreen module <b>130</b> completes the prescreen process and makes the prescreened offers available to other modules of the ranking device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moving to block <b>240</b>, information regarding the prescreened offers is accessed by the ranking module <b>150</b>. As described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example, the ranking module <b>150</b> ranks the prescreened offers according to one or more attributes. The attributes may be borrower attributes, attributes associated with particular prescreened offers, credit card issuer attributes, and/or other relevant attributes. In one embodiment, the attributes used by the ranking module <b>150</b>, and the relative weightings assigned to each of the used attributes, are determined by the ranking entity and/or by a third party referrer that presents the ranked prescreened offers to the borrower.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, in block <b>250</b>, the ranked prescreened offers are accessed by the presentation module <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), which is configured to make the prescreened offers available to the borrower, such as via a website operated by the prescreen provider, the ranking provider, and/or a third party. In one embodiment, for example, the presentation module <b>170</b> generates a presentation interface, such as one or more HTML pages, for example, that includes indications of one or more of the ranked credit card offers. Depending on the embodiment, the presentation interface may be rendered in a web browser, a portable document file viewer, or any other suitable file viewer. In one embodiment, the presentation interface comprises an embedded viewer so that the prescreened offers may be viewed without the need for a host viewing application on the borrower's computing device. Additionally, the presentation interface may comprise software code configured for rendering in a portable device browser, such as a cell phone or PDA browser, or other application on a portable device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the presentation interface comprises information regarding only the highest ranked prescreened offer. In other embodiments, the presentation interface comprises information regarding multiple, or all, of the prescreened offers and an indication of the respective offer rankings. Depending on the embodiment, the presentation interface may comprise software code that depicts one or more of the ranked credit card offers on individual pages in sequence, in a vertical list on a single page, and/or in a flipbook type flash-based viewer, for example. In other embodiments, the presentation interface comprises any other suitable software code for displaying the ranked credit card offers to the borrower or raw data that is usable for generating a user interface for presentation to the borrower. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates only one embodiment of a method that may be used to rank prescreened offers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a process of ranking prescreened offers, such as may be performed in block <b>240</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In an advantageous embodiment, multiple credit card offers that are returned from (or received by) the prescreen module <b>130</b>, possibly from multiple credit card issuers, are presented to the borrower. In this embodiment, the ranking module <b>150</b> may rank the prescreened offers according to one or more attributes of the particular prescreened offers, credit card issuer criteria, and/or borrower characteristics, for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Beginning in block <b>310</b>, the ranking module <b>150</b> determines the attributes to be considered in the ranking process. Additionally, the ranking module <b>150</b> may determine weightings that should be assigned to attributes, if any. In one embodiment, attribute weightings are determined based on ranking criteria from the referring entity, such as a third party transmitting borrower data from the third party data source <b>166</b>, ranking criteria from the prescreen device <b>162</b>, and/or ranking criteria established by the ranking entity. For example, a first third party website may be associated with a first set of ranking criteria, where the ranking criteria indicate attributes, and possibly weightings for certain of the attributes, that should be applied to prescreened offers in determining prescreened offer rankings for visitors of the first third party website. Likewise, a second third party website may have a partially or completely different set of ranking criteria (where the ranking criteria comprises one or more attributes, and possibly different weightings for certain attributes), that should be applied to prescreened offers in determining prescreened offers for visitors of the second third party website. In one embodiment, if no ranking criteria are provided by the entity requesting the prescreened offer rankings, no ranking of the prescreened offers is performed or, alternatively, a default set of ranking criteria may be used to rank the prescreened offers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, borrower data received from a third party data source <b>162</b> may indicate that bounty is the only attribute to be considered in ranking prescreened offers. Thus, if three prescreened offers are returned from the prescreen module <b>130</b> for a particular borrower, and each offer has a different bounty, the offer with the largest bounty will be ranked highest and, thus, displayed to the borrower first.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other attributes that may be considered in the prescreen process may include, for example, historical click-through-rate for an offer, historical conversion rate for an offer, geographic location of the borrower, special interests of the borrower, modeled overall click propensity for the borrower, the time of day and/or day of week that the prescreening is requested, and promised or desired display rates for an offer. Each of these terms is defined below:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x201c;Click-through-rate&#x201d; or &#x201c;CTR&#x201d; means the ratio of an expected number of times a particular credit card offer will be pursued by borrowers to a number of times the credit card offer will be displayed to borrowers. Thus, if a credit card offer is expected to be pursued by borrowers 30 times out of each 60 times the offer is presented, the CTR for that offer is 50%. The CTR may be determined from historical rates of selection for presented credit card offers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">&#x201c;Conversion Rate&#x201d; or &#x201c;CR&#x201d; means the expected percentage of borrowers that will be accepted for a particular credit card upon application for the credit card. In one embodiment, each credit card offer has an associated conversion rate. The CR may be determined from historical rates of borrowers that are accepted for respective credit card offers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">&#x201c;Geographic location of the borrower&#x201d; may comprise one or multiple levels of geographic identifiers associated with a borrower. For example, the geographic location of the borrower may indicate the residential location of the borrower and/or a business location of the borrower. The geographic location of the borrower may further indicate a portion of a municipality, a municipality, a county, a region, a state, or a country in which the borrower resides.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Click Propensity&#x201d; means the particular borrower's propensity to select links that are presented to the borrower. In one embodiment, click propensity may be limited to certain types of links, such as finance related links. In one embodiment, click propensity may be determined based on historical information regarding the borrower's browsing habits and/or demographic analysis of the borrower. In one embodiment, each borrower is associated with a unique click propensity, while in other embodiments groups of borrowers, such as borrowers in a common geographic region or using a particular ISP, may have a common click propensity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x201c;Time of day and/or day of week that the prescreening is requested&#x201d; means the time of day and/or day of week that a prescreening request is received by a prescreen provider, a ranking provider, or by a third party website.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Promised or desired display rates for the offer&#x201d; may include periodic display quotas for a particular credit card offer, such as may be agreed upon by a prescreen provider and the credit card issuer, for example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">&#x201c;Special interests&#x201d; of the borrower include any indications of propensities and/or interests of the borrower. Special interests may be determined from information received from the borrower, from a third party through which the prescreened offers are being presented to the borrower, and/or from a third party data source. A third party data source may comprise a data source that may charge a fee for providing data regarding borrowers, such as interests, purchase habits, and/or life-stages of the borrower, for example. The special interest data may indicate, for example, whether the borrower is interested in outdoor activities, travel, investing, automobiles, gardening, collecting, sports, shopping, mail-order shopping, and/or any number of additional items. In one embodiment, special interests of the borrower are provided by Experian's Insource data source.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the ranking process may also comprise determining an expected value of certain prescreened offers using one or more of the above attributes and then performing a long term projection that considers offer display limits and schedules imposed by issuers, for example, as well as expected traffic patterns, in order to rank the credit card offers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, prescreened offers may be ranked using ranking criteria comprising any combination of the above-listed characteristics, and with various weightings assigned to the attributes. For example, in one embodiment the ranking module <b>150</b> may use ranking criteria that ranks prescreened offers based on each of the above-cited attributes that are weighted in the order listed above, such that the bounty is the most important (highly weighted) attribute, click-through-rate is the second most important attribute, and the promised or desired display rates for the offer is the least important (lowest weighted) attribute. In other embodiments, any combination of one or more of the above discussed attributes may be included in ranking criteria.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moving to block <b>320</b>, an expected value to the referrer of showing each prescreened offer to the borrower is determined based upon the determined weighted attributes. Finally, in block <b>330</b>, the prescreened offers assigned ranks based on their respective expected values. In one embodiment, block <b>330</b> is bypassed and the expected values for credit card offers represent the ranking.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Described below are exemplary methods of ranking prescreened offers, such as may be performed in blocks <b>320</b>, <b>330</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The examples below are provided as examples of how ranking may be performed and are not intended to limit the scope of the systems and methods described herein. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that other methods of ranking prescreened offers using the above-listed attributes, in addition to any other available attributes, in various other combinations and with different weightings than discussed herein, are expressly contemplated</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, rankings may be based on bounty alone. For example, the table below illustrates four prescreened offers that are ranked according to bounty.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Offer</entry><entry>Bounty</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Number</entry><entry>($)</entry><entry>Rank</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>0.40</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>0.30</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1.20</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>Thus, if the ranking is based only on bounty, the referrer would likely display Offer <b>3</b> first, as it has the highest bounty, Offer <b>4</b> next, followed by Offer <b>1</b>, and then Offer <b>2</b>. In another embodiment, the referrer may display only a single credit card offer to the borrower or a subset of the offers to the borrower. In this embodiment, the borrower would likely display the highest ranked offer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In another embodiment, the ranking criteria may include one or more of a combination of bounty, click-though-rate, and conversion rate for each prescreened offer. Considering the same four offers listed in Table 1, when the click-through-rate and conversion rate are also considered, the rankings could change significantly. In one embodiment, the bounty is simply multiplied by the click-through-rate and conversion rate in order to determine an expected value for each offer, where the highest expected value would be ranked highest. The table below illustrates the four exemplary prescreened offers illustrated in Table 1, but with rankings that are based on the click-through-rate and conversion rate, as well as the bounty, for each offer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Expected</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Click-</entry><entry/><entry>Value</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>through-</entry><entry>Conversion</entry><entry>(Bounty *</entry><entry>Rank</entry></row><row><entry>Offer</entry><entry/><entry>rate</entry><entry>rate</entry><entry>CTR *</entry><entry>[Rank in</entry></row><row><entry>Number</entry><entry>Bounty</entry><entry>(percent)</entry><entry>(percent)</entry><entry>CR)</entry><entry>Table 1]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>0.40</entry><entry>4&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.48</entry><entry>4[3]</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>0.30</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>0.82</entry><entry>2[4]</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1.20</entry><entry>1&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.72</entry><entry>3[1]</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry>3&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>3.15</entry><entry>1[2]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">The last column of the above table illustrates both the ranking for each offer based on a calculated expected value, and also indicates the ranking for each prescreened offer based only on bounty [in brackets]. As shown, each of the offer rankings has changed. For example, the second highest ranked prescreened offer based only on bounty is the highest ranked prescreened offer based on the expected value, while the highest ranked prescreened offer based only on bounty is now the third highest ranked prescreened offer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">In another embodiment, the attributes used in determining an expected value of prescreened offers may be weighted differently, such that certain heavily weighted factors may have more affect on the expected value than other lower weighted attributes. For example, with regard to Table 2, if the bounty and the conversion rate are the most important factors, while the click-through-rate is not as important in determining an expected value, the bounty and conversion rates may each be weighted higher by multiplying their values by 2, 3, 4, 5 or some other multiplier, while not multiplying the click-through-rate by a multiplier, or multiplying the click-through-rate by a fractional multiplier, such as 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, or lower. Table 3 below illustrates the four exemplary prescreened offers illustrated above, but with an exemplary weighting of 2 assigned to the bounty and conversion rate and no weighting assigned to the click-through rate.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Expected Value</entry><entry>Weighted</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Click-</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>(weighted</entry><entry>Rank</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Weighted</entry><entry>through-</entry><entry>Conversion</entry><entry>Weighted</entry><entry>Bounty *</entry><entry>[Rank in</entry></row><row><entry>Offer</entry><entry>Bounty</entry><entry>Bounty</entry><entry>rate</entry><entry>rate</entry><entry>Conversion</entry><entry>CTR *</entry><entry>Table 1,</entry></row><row><entry>Number</entry><entry>($)</entry><entry>(*2)</entry><entry>(percent)</entry><entry>(percent)</entry><entry>rate (*2)</entry><entry>weighted CR)</entry><entry>Table 2]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>0.40</entry><entry>0.80</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>1.92</entry><entry>4 [4, 3]</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>0.30</entry><entry>0.60</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>2.2</entry><entry>3.3</entry><entry>3 [2, 4]</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1.20</entry><entry>2.40</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>1.2</entry><entry>2.88</entry><entry>2 [3, 1]</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry>1.50</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>2.8</entry><entry>12.6</entry><entry>1 [1, 2]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>In the example of Table 3, the ranking for offers 2 and 3 have alternated when the exemplary weightings for the bounty and the conversion rate were added.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0051">In one embodiment, special interests of the borrower are used in calculating an expected value for certain or all prescreened offers. For example, an expected value formula may include a special interest value, where certain credit cards are associated with various special interests that increase the special interest value for borrowers that are determined to have corresponding special interests. For example, a first credit card may be sports related, while a second credit card may have a rewards program offering movie tickets to cardholders. Thus, for a borrower with special interests in one or more sports, the special interest value for the first card may be increased, such as to 2 or 3, while the special interest value for the same borrower may be 1 or less for the second card. In one embodiment, the special interest values vary based on the borrowers strength in a particular interest segment. For example, a strong NASCAR fan might have a special interest value of 3 for a NASCAR-related credit card, while a weak traveler might only have a special interest value of 1.1 for a travel-related credit card. In other embodiments, the special interest values may be lower or higher than the exemplary values described above. The special interests of the borrower may be used in other manners in ranking prescreened offers.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">In one embodiment, expected values for prescreened offers include a factor indicating expected future rankings for a respective card. Alternatively, a calculated expected value for a card may be adjusted based on a determined expected future ranking for the card. For example, the expected future ranking of one or more credit card offers X hours (where X is any number, such as 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24, for example) after determining the initial rankings may impact the initial rankings. Thus, rankings for each of a plurality of prescreened offers may first be generated and then modified based on expected future rankings for respective offers. For example, prescreened offer rankings for a first user determined at a first time, e.g., in the morning, may include multiple prescreened offers ranked according to the prescreened offers respective expected values in the order: offer A, E, and D. In this embodiment, the expected value for offer A may be only slightly larger than offer E (or may be significantly larger than offer E). In one embodiment, after determining the ranking order for the first user, the ranking module <b>150</b> analyzes a historical traffic pattern for one or more of offers A, E, and D, and determines that typically later in the day (e.g., 4-8 hours after the initial prescreening is performed) a large quantity of borrowers apply for the card associated with offer A, while very few apply for the card associated with offer E. Thus, in certain embodiments offer E may be promoted to the first choice for the first user because offer E is even less likely to be applied&#x2014;for later in the day. In one embodiment, an expected value formula for a group of prescreened offers may include an expected future ranking value, where the expected future ranking value for the prescreened offers may be determined using precalculated trending data or using realtime updated trending data. In some embodiments, the expected values for credit card offers may be affected by offer presentation limits or quotas associated with certain prescreened offers.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is one embodiment of a user interface <b>400</b> that allows a potential borrower to enter information for submission to a ranking provider and/or to a prescreen provider. In one embodiment, the user interface <b>400</b> is controlled by the prescreen provider such that data submitted in the user interface <b>400</b> is transmitted to the ranking device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In other embodiments, the user interface <b>400</b>, or similar interface, may be presented to a borrower by the prescreen provider or by a third party website. For example, the third party data source <b>166</b> may comprise software code, such as HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript, etc., configured to render a user interface, such as the user interface <b>400</b>, in the browser of the borrower <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user interface <b>400</b> comprises a first name and last name field <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, a home address field for 30, a state field <b>440</b>, and a zip code field <b>450</b>, each comprising text entry fields in the exemplary user interface <b>400</b>. Depending on the embodiment, one or more of the fields <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>450</b> may be replaced by other data controls, such as drop-down lists, radio buttons, or auto-fill text boxes, for example. In other embodiments, the user interface <b>400</b> comprises only a subset of the text entry fields illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. For example, in one embodiment the user interface <b>400</b> may include only a last name field <b>420</b> and a ZIP code field <b>450</b>. The user interface <b>400</b> further comprises a start button <b>460</b> that is selected in order to transmit entered data to the prescreen provider, the ranking provider, and and/or the hosting third party website. In one embodiment, when the borrower selects the start button <b>460</b>, the borrower data is transmitted to the ranking device <b>100</b> and a prescreening and ranking procedure, such as the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and/or <b>3</b></figref>, is performed using the borrower data.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is one embodiment a user interface <b>500</b> presenting a credit card offer that a first borrower was matched to, along with a link <b>510</b> that may be selected in order to apply for the illustrated credit card. Exemplary user interface <b>500</b> also includes a link <b>520</b> that may be selected in order to display one or more additional credit cards to which the borrower has been matched. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the user interface <b>500</b> comprises term information <b>530</b>, overview information <b>532</b>, summary information <b>534</b>, and a card image <b>536</b> for the prescreened credit card offer. In one embodiment, the user interface <b>500</b> is presented to the borrower after the borrower completes the text entry fields of a user interface, such as user interface <b>400</b>, and submits the borrower information, such as by clicking on the start button <b>460</b> of user interface <b>400</b>. In other embodiments, a third party website may provide borrower information to the prescreen provider and, in response, the prescreen provider may transmit a ranked listing of prescreened credit card offers to the third party website, which may be presented to the borrower via a user interface such as user interface <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the user interface <b>500</b> indicates that the borrower has been prescreened for 4 credit cards, meaning that the prescreening process has indicated that there are 4 credit cards that the particular borrower would likely be granted after completion of a full application with the respective issuers. While the prescreen module <b>130</b> indicates that there are 4 prescreened credit card offers for the particular borrower, the user interface <b>500</b> displays information regarding only a single highest ranked prescreened credit card offer.
