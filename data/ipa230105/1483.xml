Examples are provided by way of explanation and should not be interpreted as limiting the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described in one portion of the present disclosure can be used with features illustrated or described in another portion of the present disclosure, including with modification and variations thereof. It is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is understood that terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refer to the relative direction with respect to fluid flow in a fluid pathway. For example, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; refers to the direction from which the fluid flows, and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refers to the direction to which the fluid flows. It is also understood that terms such as &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;outward&#x201d;, &#x201c;inward&#x201d;, and the like are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to distinguish one component from another and are not intended to signify location or importance of the individual components. The terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; are not to be limited to the precise value specified. In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value, or the precision of the methods or machines for constructing or manufacturing the components and/or systems. For example, the approximating language may refer to being within a 10 percent margin.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here and throughout the specification and claims, range limitations are combined and interchanged, such ranges are identified and include all the sub-ranges contained therein unless context or language indicates otherwise. For example, all ranges disposed herein are inclusive of the endpoints, and the endpoints are independently combinable with each other.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described herein, the presently disclosed subject matter involves the use of additive manufacturing machines or systems. As used herein, the term &#x201c;additive manufacturing&#x201d; refers generally to manufacturing technology in which components are manufactured in a layer-by-layer manner. An exemplary additive manufacturing machine may be configured to utilize any desired additive manufacturing technology. The additive manufacturing machine may utilize an additive manufacturing technology that includes a powder bed fusion (PBF) technology, such as a direct metal laser melting (DMLM) technology, an electron beam melting (EBM) technology, an electron beam sintering (EBS) technology, a selective laser melting (SLM) technology, a directed metal laser sintering (DMLS) technology, or a selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. In an exemplary PBF technology, thin layers of powder material are sequentially applied to a build plane and then selectively melted or fused to one another in a layer-by-layer manner to form one or more three-dimensional objects. As used herein, the term &#x201c;object&#x201d; refers to any layer-by-layer additively manufactured product such as components, pieces, parts, builds, or any other type of similarly named object. Additively manufactured objects are generally monolithic in nature, and may have a variety of integral sub-components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;build plane&#x201d; refers to a plane defined by a surface upon which an energy beam impinges during an additive manufacturing process. Generally, the surface of a powder bed defines the build plane; however, during irradiation of a respective layer of the powder bed, a previously irradiated portion of the respective layer may define a portion of the build plane, and/or prior to distributing powder material across a build module, a build plate that supports the powder bed generally defines the build plane.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally or alternatively suitable additive manufacturing technologies include, for example, Binder Jet technology, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, Direct Energy Deposition (DED) technology, Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) technology, Laser Net Shape Manufacturing (LNSM) technology, Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) technology, Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology, Vat Polymerization (VP) technology, Sterolithography (SLA) technology, and other additive manufacturing technology that utilizes an energy beam.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additive manufacturing technology may generally be described as fabrication of objects by building objects point-by-point, layer-by-layer, typically in a vertical direction; however, other methods of fabrication are contemplated and within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, although the discussion herein refers to the addition of material to form successive layers, the presently disposed subject matter may be practiced with any additive manufacturing technology or other manufacturing technology, including layer-additive processes, layer-subtractive processes, or hybrid processes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The additive manufacturing processes described herein may be used for forming components using any suitable material.
