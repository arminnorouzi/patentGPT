This was done primarily to provide the rigidity required to attach and support additional structures, such as sheet metal frames and scale assemblies, to the bioptic barcode reader. In particular, the rigidity provided the die cast metal lower housing provides the support need for a scale assembly to prevent deflection when an item is weighed. However, a die cast metal lower housing adds significantly to the weight of the bioptic barcode reader and requires extensive cleaning to remove the dirt, dust, and debris that can accumulate from secondary operations, such as cutting threads in screw bosses, which in turn drives up the manufacturing, product, and shipping costs significantly. Die cast parts are typically difficult to clean and improper or insufficient cleaning of the die cast parts can result in particles left from the secondary operations interfering with the optical systems of the bioptic barcode reader.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Another drawback to the use of die cast metal lower housings in bioptic barcode readers is that the imaging and optical components are partially housed within the lower housing and the die cast metal lower housing is usually extremely reflective. Therefore, the die cast metal lower housing must either be painted with a non-reflective paint or covered with another plastic part.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, the lower housing is part of the scanner enclosure and often requires multiple features to be formed with the die cast metal lower housing, such as holders for mirrors or other delicate structural components. However, the hard metal surface of the die cast metal housing can chip or break the mirrors or other delicate structural components.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the die cast metal lower housing is also located adjacent to the main printed circuit board, it also necessitates a complex grounding design where the main printed circuit board must be grounded by a number of screws to the die cast metal lower housing, which can increase the cost and complexity of the design as well.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, the present invention is a bioptic barcode reader assembly comprising a metal perimeter frame and a bioptic barcode reader positioned within and supported by the metal perimeter frame.

The use of a plastic lower housing provides a lighter and lower cost plastic part for the lower housing, can lower the cost of the product because the lower housing does not need to be painted or additional optical coverings installed to reduce or eliminate reflection, allows for the mounting of delicate or sensitive components, such as mirrors, directly to the lower housing, etc. In addition, with a plastic lower housing, there is also no need for complicated printed circuit board grounding techniques since a simple grounding strap connected to one of the printed circuit board's connection or a spring contact could be used and optical features, such as illumination baffles, can be molded into the lower housing, which is not possible with die cast lower housings. By using a metal perimeter frame with a bioptic barcode reader with a plastic lower housing, the same rigidity is achieved as that of a bioptic barcode reader with a die cast housing, which allows the mounting and support of additional structures, such as a sheet metal frame and/or a scale assembly, while retaining the benefits of the plastic lower housing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, an example bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> is shown that generally includes a housing <b>225</b>, an imaging assembly <b>250</b> positioned within housing <b>225</b>, and a set of optical components <b>265</b> positioned within the housing. Housing <b>225</b> includes a plastic lower housing <b>235</b>, an upper housing <b>230</b> secured to and extending above plastic lower housing <b>235</b>, for example by threaded members, a generally horizontal window <b>237</b>, and a generally upright window <b>232</b>. Plastic lower housing <b>235</b> can be a molded part and can be non-reflective, which eliminates the need to paint the interior of the lower housing or cover the interior with additional plastic or other non-reflective parts. Upper housing <b>230</b> can be a single, integral, unitary part or can include a middle housing portion that extends parallel to plastic lower housing <b>235</b> and includes horizontal window <b>237</b> and a tower portion, attached to the middle housing portion, that extends perpendicular to plastic lower housing <b>235</b> and includes upright window <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Imaging assembly <b>250</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> can include, for example, an image sensor <b>260</b> mounted on a printed circuit board <b>255</b> and, since plastic lower housing <b>235</b> is plastic rather than metal, printed circuit board <b>255</b> can be mounted directly to plastic lower housing <b>235</b>. Alternatively, printed circuit board <b>255</b> can be mounted to an intermediate carrier that is then mounted to plastic lower housing <b>235</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optical components <b>265</b> can include, for example, a mirror arrangement <b>270</b> having a splitter mirror <b>275</b>, a first mirror <b>280</b> used to direct at least a portion of a field-of-view of image sensor <b>260</b> out of horizontal window <b>237</b>, and second mirror <b>285</b> used to direct at least a portion of the field-of-view of image sensor <b>260</b> out of upright window <b>232</b>. As shown, first mirror <b>280</b> can be mounted directly to plastic lower housing <b>235</b>, which, since plastic lower housing <b>235</b> is plastic rather than metal, can reduce or eliminate chipping or damage to first mirror <b>280</b>. In addition, plastic lower housing <b>235</b> can also have additional optical features molded directly into plastic lower housing <b>235</b>, such as a forward illumination baffle <b>290</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that helps to control illumination stray light that can otherwise scatter. Forming optical features, such as a forward illumination baffle <b>290</b>, is typically not possible with die cast lower housings due to the accuracy required for the features and the fact that the die cast lower housings are reflective.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an example bioptic barcode reader assembly <b>10</b> is shown that generally includes a metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> and bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> positioned within and supported by metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>. Although shown and described with bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>, any barcode reader could be used with metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> in bioptic barcode reader assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> is, preferably, generally U-shaped and provides structure and support along a first side <b>205</b>, second side <b>210</b>, and front end <b>215</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>. In this example, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> has a first side arm <b>105</b> that is positionable adjacent first side <b>205</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>, a second side arm <b>110</b> that is positionable adjacent second side <b>210</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>, and front arm <b>115</b> extending between first side arm <b>105</b> and second side arm <b>110</b> that is positionable adjacent front end <b>215</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>A can be generally rectangular and provide structure all around the perimeter of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>. In this example, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>A has the same first side arm <b>105</b>, second side arm <b>110</b>, and front arm <b>115</b> as metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, but also includes a rear arm <b>120</b> that extends between first side arm <b>105</b> and second side arm <b>110</b> and is adjacent a rear end <b>220</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To accurately align and position bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> within metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> can have a plurality of locators <b>125</b> that will align with and engage a plurality of locators <b>240</b> on plastic lower housing <b>235</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>. As best seen if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, in the example shown, locators <b>125</b> on metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> include one or more generally cylindrical protrusions and locators <b>240</b> on plastic lower housing <b>235</b> include one or more semi-circular apertures that are configured to receive locators <b>125</b>. Once correctly positioned in metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, if desired, bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> can also be secured to metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, for example with threaded members <b>310</b>. In the example shown, threaded members <b>310</b> extend through and are received by apertures <b>130</b> in locators <b>125</b> in metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> and can be threaded into apertures <b>245</b> in locators <b>240</b> in plastic lower housing <b>235</b> or pass through apertures <b>245</b> and be threaded into apertures in upper housing <b>230</b>. The use of locators <b>125</b>, <b>240</b> and threaded members <b>310</b> allows bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> to be easily removed from metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> without having to open housing <b>225</b> of bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> or disassemble bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b>. This is especially convenient if bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> requires service or if bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> needs to be removed to be sent for shipping or service.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Depending on the particular application, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> can also include additional features, such as one or more channels <b>135</b> that are configured to receive and guide cables, pass through holes to access housing screws, an attachment feature that allows attachment of a grounding strap or grounding cable, etc. In addition, although not required, metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> can also include one or more height adjustable leveling legs <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, depending on the application and installation, bioptic barcode reader assembly <b>10</b> can also include a sheet metal frame <b>300</b> and/or a scale assembly <b>305</b>, which can be attached to and supported by metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>. Sheet metal frame <b>300</b> can be a single, integral, unitary part or can include multiple parts that are assembled together, as shown. Metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> provides the strength necessary to support sheet metal frame <b>300</b> and/or a scale assembly <b>305</b> with the use of plastic lower housing <b>235</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To assemble bioptic barcode reader assembly <b>10</b>, imaging assembly <b>250</b> and optical components <b>265</b> are positioned within housing <b>225</b> and upper housing <b>230</b> is secured to plastic lower housing <b>235</b>, for example, with one or more threaded members. Bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> is then positioned within metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A such that bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> is supported by metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A. When positioning bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> into metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A, locators <b>125</b> on metal perimeter frame <b>100</b> can be aligned with locators <b>240</b> on plastic lower housing <b>235</b> to accurately position bioptic barcode reader <b>200</b> within metal perimeter frame <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A.
