particularly, to weld training simulations using desktop or mobile devices, modular workpieces, and simulated welding equipment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The welding industry has a shortage of experienced and skilled operators. Additionally, it is difficult and expensive to train new operators using live welding equipment. Further, even experienced welders often have difficulty maintaining important welding techniques throughout welding processes. Thus, there is a demand for affordable training tools and equipment that help operators develop, maintain, and/or refine welding skills.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Simulated welding tools make it possible for both experienced and inexperienced weld operators to practice producing high quality welds prior to actually using the real welding equipment. Additionally, welding operators can test out different welding tools in a simulated environment prior to actually purchasing that particular welding tool. However, conventional systems and methods for simulating joining operations require substantial investments in equipment (e.g., processors, displays, practice workpieces, welding tool(s), sensor(s), etc.).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with the present disclosure as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to weld training simulations using desktop or mobile devices, modular workpieces, and simulated welding equipment, substantially as illustrated by and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, and as set forth in the claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present disclosure, as well as details of an illustrated example thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

Other examples of the present disclosure relate to using mobile devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, personal digital assistant, electronic book reader, ipod, etc.). In some examples, it may be advantageous to use mobile devices due to their availability, relative affordability, and/or technical power. The disclosure further contemplates automatically detecting whether an orientation of the mobile device is proper for the simulation, and notifying the user if not.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure additionally contemplates using modular workpieces for conducting welding simulations. In some examples, the modular workpieces may be configured to tool-lessly connect to, and/or disconnect from, other modular workpieces to form various workpiece assemblies. In some examples, tool-less connectors may be advantageous because they can be easily connected to and/or engaged with other connectors without the need for auxiliary tools (e.g., screwdrivers, hammers, etc.). Tool-less connectors may also be advantageous over adhesives, as the tool-less connectors may be continually connected, disconnected, and reconnected with negligible change to their effectiveness, unlike adhesives. In some examples, the welding simulation may further be configured to recognize different joints formed by the modular workpieces, and conduct the welding simulation accordingly.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present disclosure further contemplates using simulated equipment interfaces that replicate the appearance of actual equipment interfaces of actual welding-type equipment.
