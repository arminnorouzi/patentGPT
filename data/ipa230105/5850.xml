On the contrary, these embodiments are provided to enable a more thorough understanding of the disclosure and to fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embodiments of the disclosure are described in more detail by way of example in the following paragraphs with reference to the drawings. The advantages and features of the disclosure will become clearer from the following description and claims. It is to be noted that the drawings are in a very simplified form with inaccurate proportions, and the drawings are only used to facilitate and clearly assist in illustrating the purposes of the embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is understood that the meanings of &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;up&#x201d; and &#x201c;above&#x201d; of the disclosure should be interpreted in the widest manner, so that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means its meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something &#x201c;without intervening features or layers (that is, directly on something), but also includes&#x201d; on &#x201c;something with intervening features or layers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiments of the disclosure, the term &#x201c;A connected to B&#x201d; includes a case where both A and B are in direct contact, or another case where A and B are in indirect contact through an intermediate conductive structure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiments of the disclosure, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d; and the like are used to distinguish similar objects and need not be used to describe a particular order or priority.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiments of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material part that includes a region having a thickness. The layer may extend on a lower surface or an upper surface of the structure, and its area may be less than or equal to the extended surface on which it lies.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is to be noted that the technical solution described in the embodiments of this disclosure can be arbitrarily combined without conflict.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The semiconductor functional structure related in embodiments of the disclosure is the one which will be used in subsequent processes to form at least a part of final device structure. Here, the final device may include a memory.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a design of a package structure of a semiconductor device such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a design mode of pads (also called bonding pad, expressed as PAD in English) is windowing the redistribution layer (RDL).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Windowing the redistribution layer means that a redistribution layer is formed on a top metal layer of a semiconductor functional structure, a passivation layer or an insulating layer is formed on the redistribution layer, and then windowing areas are formed on the passivation layer or the insulating layer to expose part of the redistribution layer and form two types of pads arranged side by side. Here, the redistribution layer can play a role in adjusting positions of the pads in the semiconductor device, and can also play a role of strengthening power supply network of power ground.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a mode of windowing the redistribution layer, two types of pads are usually provided, namely first type of pad and second type of pad. The first type of pad is used for probe card sticking test of probe card, and the second type of pad is used for leading out bonding wire on the pad. Due to need of physical isolation, and considering limited identification area of a machine for the first type of pad and the second type of pad, a partition wall is generally provided between a first type of pad and a second type of pad arranged side by side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an isolation layer <b>102</b>, a redistribution layer <b>103</b> covering the isolation layer <b>102</b>, and an insulating layer <b>104</b> covering the redistribution layer <b>103</b> are stacked in sequence on a semiconductor functional structure <b>101</b>. After part of the insulating layer <b>104</b> is removed, part of the redistribution layer <b>103</b> is exposed. The exposed part of the redistribution layer <b>103</b> includes a first type of pad <b>105</b> and a second type of pad <b>106</b>. A partition wall <b>107</b> is provided between the first type of pad <b>105</b> and the second type of pad <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, during alignment of a probe card with the first type of pad, when the probe card deviates from the center point of the first type of pad, probes of the probe card may hit the sidewall directly. Higher height of the sidewall will increase damage probability of the probe card. At the same time, the sidewalls are also easy to contaminate the probes with impurities (such as dielectric materials), thereby affecting test results. In addition, after the probe card breaks the partition wall, performance of the second type of pad <b>106</b> may also be affected, thereby affecting operation of the semiconductor functional structure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In view of this, in order to solve one or more of the above problems, the embodiments of the disclosure provide a package structure, a manufacturing method thereof and a semiconductor device. The package structure includes a redistribution layer and an insulating layer. The redistribution layer is electrically connected with an interconnection layer of a semiconductor functional structure. The insulating layer covers and exposes part of the redistribution layer. The exposed part of the redistribution layer includes at least one first pad. The first pad includes a first area and a second area arranged continuously. The first area is configured to perform a test, and the second area is configured to perform functional interaction corresponding to content of the test.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the package structure includes a substrate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), a semiconductor functional structure <b>200</b>, an isolation layer <b>203</b> and redistribution layer <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A component material of the substrate may include silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), silicon germanium (SiGe), silicon on insulator (SOI), or germanium on insulator (GOI).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The semiconductor functional structure <b>200</b> is located above the substrate. Specifically, the semiconductor functional structure <b>200</b> includes a semiconductor functional layer <b>201</b> and an interconnection layer <b>202</b> located on the semiconductor functional layer <b>201</b>.

When the probe identifies a pad, an identification range of graphics is limited. The identification range of the test machine is 50 um from a center point to a surrounding. In this range, it is necessary to find surrounding edges of the window, that is, the edges of the pad. The first pad in an embodiment of the disclosure may be strip-shaped, and a length of at least one side is easy to exceed the identification range due to superposition of lengths of two pads (the first type of pad and the second type of pad) in the related art, so that edges of the first pad may not be found by the test machine in the existing identification accuracy range, and then a positioning failure of the first pad is caused.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to be able to accurately position the specific position of the first pad <b>208</b> within the existing identification accuracy range, in some embodiments of the disclosure, the package structure includes at least one first pad and multiple second pads, and by rationally arranging positions of the first pad and the multiple second pads, both areas of the first pad can be successfully positioned.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the first pad and the second pad are both strip-shaped.

All the pads arranged side by side along the first direction being flush at one end, which can be understood as all the first pads and all the second pads arranged side by side along the first direction being flush at one end.

On the premise that the first pad <b>208</b> and the second pad <b>209</b> are both strip-shaped, the same in width, flush at one end, and spacing between two adjacent ones of the pads is equal, by reference to the positions of the second pads <b>209</b> on both sides, a predicted position of the area near the aligned end (first area or second area) in each of the first pads <b>208</b> can be obtained. Since in the width direction (that is, the first direction), the first pad <b>208</b> is within the identification range of the test machine, the area of each first pad <b>208</b> near the aligned end can be accurately identified in combination with the identification in the width direction. Upon accurate identification of one area of the first pad <b>208</b>, a center point of the first area can be obtained. Considering that the two areas of the first pad are arranged continuously and share a long side, and a length of the long side of the first pad is constant, the center point of the first area is moved by a fixed distance to a second direction perpendicular to the first direction and then may be considered to be the center point of the other area of the first pad <b>208</b> away from the aligned end, thereby further identifying the other area of the first pad <b>208</b> away from the aligned end.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, all pads arranged side by side along the first direction are flush at one end near the edge of the semiconductor functional structure.

Accordingly, subsequently, when a positional relationship of different areas in the second pad or a positional relationship of the first pad and the second pad is described by using an edge of the semiconductor functional structure, the edge refers to an edge to which the second pads are close among multiple edges of the semiconductor functional structure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is to be understood that, the process for leading out the bonding wire on the first pad <b>208</b> is flexible in controllability or adjustability.
