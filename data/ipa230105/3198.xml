A wind turbine generally includes a tower with a nacelle supported on top of the tower. A wind turbine rotor comprising a hub and a plurality of wind turbine blades may be rotatably mounted to the nacelle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The wind turbine blades may be set in motion by wind. The hub of the wind turbine may be operatively coupled with a rotor of a generator. As the hub and blades rotate, the kinetic energy of the wind is converted to kinetic mechanical energy of the wind turbine rotor and ultimately to electrical energy or power in the generator. The generator may typically be arranged inside the nacelle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The wind turbine rotor may be coupled directly to the generator rotor in so-called direct drive wind turbines. Or the wind turbine rotor may include a main rotor shaft (a so-called &#x201c;low speed shaft&#x201d; which leads to a gearbox. A high-speed shaft of the gearbox may then drive the generator. Regardless of the topology of the wind turbine, the electrical power output of the generator may be fed to an electric grid. The connection of the generator to the grid may include e.g. a converter, transformer, medium voltage line and other.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wind turbine controller may be configured to determine suitable actuator setpoints for the wind turbine based on the prevailing circumstances. The actuator setpoints for modern variable speed wind turbines include e.g. the generator torque and the pitch angle of the blades. Through control of the pitch angle(s) of the blade(s) and the generator torque, the speed of the rotor may be controlled, as well as the electrical power output, aerodynamic thrust and further mechanical loads. The purpose of the control system is generally to maximize electrical power output while at the same time keeping loads in the wind turbine at an acceptable level.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As mentioned before, the actuator setpoints of torque and pitch (but also other actuators such as yaw) may be changed in accordance with circumstances. Important input for the determination of the actuator setpoints include e.g. wind speed, and wind direction. The wind speed may be measured directly or indirectly e.g. through the use of a (generator) rotor speed sensor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wind turbines may also comprise load sensors on or in the blades for measuring loads on the blades caused by for example the wind and/or the weight of the blades. Too high loads on the blades can e.g. damage the blades and/or cause undesirable rotational speeds of the rotor which may damage other components of the wind turbine. The blade load sensors permit detecting high loads and make it possible to react, by e.g. acting on the pitch systems in such a way that loads on the blades may be reduced. These adjustments on the blades through the pitch systems may extend the life of the wind turbine and/or reduce the cost of producing power.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Load sensors for measuring loads on wind turbines, and particularly wind turbine blades may include resistive strain gauges, fiber optic strain gauges or any other known strain sensing system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Different blade loads may be defined for a wind turbine blade, namely edge-wise loads, spanwise loads and flap-wise loads. A spanwise direction refers to a direction along a longitudinal axis of the blade, extending from the blade root towards the blade tip. The edge-wise direction refers to a direction along the chord of a section of the wind turbine blade, i.e. extending from leading edge to trailing edge. The flap-wise direction is perpendicular to both the edge-wise and the spanwise direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With respect to a wind turbine rotor, loads may be decomposed as in-plane loads (loads that are tangential to the rotor plane) and out-of-plane loads (loads that are perpendicular to the rotor plane). The rotor plane may herein be defined as a plane perpendicular to the rotor rotational axis and passing through a center of the blades at the blade root.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further sensor that may be used in wind turbine operation(s) is an azimuth sensor. An azimuth angle indicates the angular position of the wind turbine rotor in the rotor plane. Although any specific reference position may be chosen, in an example, tin the 0&#xb0; position, one of the blades may be in the 12 o'clock position (pointing straight upwards). In a three-bladed rotor, the other two blades may be in the 4 o'clock position, and in the 8 o'clock position respectively. Maintaining the same reference position, in the 90&#xb0; position of the rotor, the three blades would be in the 3 o'clock position (substantially horizontal), the 7 o'clock position and the 11 o'clock position respectively.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An azimuth sensor as used throughout the present disclosure is any suitable sensor or sensor system which may be used to measure the azimuth position of the rotor. In an example, the azimuth sensor may be an encoder fixed to the wind turbine rotor shaft, or to the generator rotor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For wind turbine operation in general, and specific maintenance operations in particular, the correct functioning of the azimuth sensor is thus important. For example, individual blade pitch control may be based on signals from the azimuth sensor. In a rotor locking operation, the wind turbine rotor needs to be positioned precisely in one of a plurality of predefined positions, such that the locking mechanism on the nacelle can engage with the wind turbine rotor (hub) and maintenance can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Azimuth sensors can be calibrated in order to preserve their accuracy. Calibration normally comprises establishing correspondence between indications generated by the azimuth sensors and values of reference according to calibration patterns (i.e. particular conditions for calibration). Such a calibration is generally carried out offline (i.e. when the wind turbine is nor in operation) and requires specific conditions (no wind or very low wind speeds). In examples, it may require visual inspection by personnel on the ground to determine when the rotor is in a specific operation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is known that azimuth sensors can degrade over time. Particularly, it has been found that azimuth sensors may show a &#x201c;drift&#x201d; behaviour in the error, i.e. the difference between the actual angular position of the rotor and the indicated position increases over time. Also, after a maintenance operation it has been found that an offset may be introduced in the system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Wrong indications from the azimuth sensors can lead to a wrong or suboptimal load control, and/or wrong or suboptimal individual or collective pitch control which in turn can lead to higher (fatigue) loads, and/or reduced energy output. Wrong indications from the azimuth sensors can lead to complications in maintenance operations and increased maintenance time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure provides examples of methods and systems for determining reliability or correct functioning of azimuth sensors that resolve at least some of the aforementioned disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a first aspect, a method for determining reliability of an azimuth measurement system in a wind turbine is provided. The method comprises, measuring loads with the load sensors during operation of the wind turbine and determining in-plane moments with rotor rotational speed frequency of one or more blades based on the measured loads. The method then further comprises determining an angular phase of a wind turbine rotor based on the in-plane moments with rotor rotational speed frequency and determining that the azimuth measurement system has reduced reliability if an angular phase of the in-plane moments with rotor rotational speed frequency deviates from an angular phase measured by the azimuth measurement system by more than a first threshold value.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with this aspect, the reliability or correct functioning of azimuth sensors can be determined during operation of the wind turbine, i.e. the operation of the wind turbine does not need to be interrupted or put in specific conditions in order to be able to determine whether the azimuth measurement system is correctly indicating the azimuth position. The loads measured may be measured as in-plane moments or converted to in-plane moments. The in-plane moments at any given moment during operation will be a combination of aerodynamic loads and loads due to mass of the blades. The mass of the blades will however provide the same moment throughout every rotation of the blade. At a 12 o'clock position and at a 6 o'clock position, the mass of the blade will not contribute to a bending moment. But at a 3 o'clock position and a 9 o'clock position, the bending moment due to the mass of the blade will be at a maximum (in one direction, and in the opposite direction respectively). The mass of the blade will have a well-defined contribution with 1p frequency, i.e. the variation of the moment due to the mass will have the same frequency as the rotor rotational speed. The rotor in this respect refers to the wind turbine rotor, not to the generator rotor. The generator rotor may have the same rotational speed in the case of a direct drive wind turbine, but may have a very different speed in the case of a wind turbine with gearbox.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The terms &#x201c;1p frequency&#x201d; and &#x201c;rotor rotational speed frequency&#x201d; may be used interchangeably throughout this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By selecting the in-plane moments with the rotor rotational speed frequency and comparing the angular phase of selected in-plane moments with a measured azimuth phase angle, a deviation between the two indicates a possible malfunctioning of the azimuth measurement system. Once such a possible malfunctioning is detected, different actions can be taken to reduce the risk of a malfunctioning azimuth measurement system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Non-limiting examples of the present disclosure will be described in the following, with reference to the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a wind turbine according to one example;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a detailed, internal view of a nacelle of a wind turbine according to one example;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example of a method for determining reliability of an azimuth measuring system in a wind turbine;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example of a comparison between in-plane moments due to the mass of rotor blades and measured azimuth positions;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates another example of a method for determining reliability of a wind turbine azimuth measurement system;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> schematically illustrates a method for on-line determination of correct functioning azimuth sensors as may be implemented in a wind turbine controller, and</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> schematically illustrate a comparison between measured in-plane moments and theoretical in-plane moments based on a measured azimuth angle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example of a wind turbine <b>10</b>. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> is a horizontal-axis wind turbine. Alternatively, the wind turbine <b>10</b> may be a vertical-axis wind turbine. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> includes a tower <b>100</b> that extends from a support system <b>14</b> on a ground <b>12</b>, a nacelle <b>16</b> mounted on tower <b>100</b>, and a rotor <b>18</b> that is coupled to nacelle <b>16</b>. The rotor <b>18</b> includes a rotatable hub <b>20</b> and at least one rotor blade <b>22</b> coupled to and extending outward from the hub <b>20</b>. In the example, the rotor <b>18</b> has three rotor blades <b>22</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the rotor <b>18</b> includes more or less than three rotor blades <b>22</b>. The tower <b>100</b> may be fabricated from tubular steel to define a cavity (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) between a support system <b>14</b> and the nacelle <b>16</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the tower <b>100</b> is any suitable type of a tower having any suitable height. According to an alternative, the tower can be a hybrid tower comprising a portion made of concrete and a tubular steel portion. Also, the tower can be a partial or full lattice tower.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rotor blades <b>22</b> are spaced about the hub <b>20</b> to facilitate rotating the rotor <b>18</b> to enable kinetic energy to be transferred from the wind into usable mechanical energy, and subsequently, electrical energy. The rotor blades <b>22</b> are mated to the hub <b>20</b> by coupling a blade root portion <b>24</b> to the hub <b>20</b> at a plurality of load transfer regions <b>26</b>. The load transfer regions <b>26</b> may have a hub load transfer region and a blade load transfer region (both not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Loads induced to the rotor blades <b>22</b> are transferred to the hub <b>20</b> via the load transfer regions <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In examples, the rotor blades <b>22</b> may have a length ranging from about 15 meters (m) to about 90 m or more. Rotor blades <b>22</b> may have any suitable length that enables the wind turbine <b>10</b> to function as described herein. For example, non-limiting examples of blade lengths include 20 m or less, 37 m, 48.7 m, 50.2 m, 52.2 m or a length that is greater than 91 m. As wind strikes the rotor blades <b>22</b> from a wind direction <b>28</b>, the rotor <b>18</b> is rotated about a rotor axis <b>30</b>. As the rotor blades <b>22</b> are rotated and subjected to centrifugal forces, the rotor blades <b>22</b> are also subjected to various forces and moments. As such, the rotor blades <b>22</b> may deflect and/or rotate from a neutral, or non-deflected, position to a deflected position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Moreover, a pitch angle of the rotor blades <b>22</b>, i.e., an angle that determines an orientation of the rotor blades <b>22</b> with respect to the wind direction, may be changed by a pitch system <b>32</b> to control the load and power generated by the wind turbine <b>10</b> by adjusting an angular position of at least one rotor blade <b>22</b> relative to wind vectors. Pitch axes <b>34</b> of rotor blades <b>22</b> are shown. During operation of the wind turbine <b>10</b>, the pitch system <b>32</b> may particularly change a pitch angle of the rotor blades <b>22</b> such that the angle of attack of (portions of) the rotor blades are reduced, which facilitates reducing a rotational speed and/or facilitates a stall of the rotor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the example, a blade pitch of each rotor blade <b>22</b> is controlled individually by a wind turbine controller <b>36</b> or by a pitch control system <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the blade pitch for all rotor blades <b>22</b> may be controlled simultaneously by said control systems.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, in the example, as the wind direction <b>28</b> changes, a yaw direction of the nacelle <b>16</b> may be rotated about a yaw axis <b>38</b> to position the rotor blades <b>22</b> with respect to wind direction <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the example, the wind turbine controller <b>36</b> is shown as being centralized within the nacelle <b>16</b>, however, the wind turbine controller <b>36</b> may be a distributed system throughout the wind turbine <b>10</b>, on the support system <b>14</b>, within a wind farm, and/or at a remote control center. The wind turbine controller <b>36</b> includes a processor <b>40</b> configured to perform the methods and/or steps described herein. Further, many of the other components described herein include a processor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;processor&#x201d; is not limited to integrated circuits referred to in the art as a computer, but broadly refers to a controller, a microcontroller, a microcomputer, a programmable logic controller (PLC), an application specific, integrated circuit, and other programmable circuits, and these terms are used interchangeably herein. It should be understood that a processor and/or a control system can also include memory, input channels, and/or output channels.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of the wind turbine <b>10</b>. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> includes the nacelle <b>16</b> and the rotor <b>18</b> that is rotatably coupled to the nacelle <b>16</b>. More specifically, the hub <b>20</b> of the rotor <b>18</b> is rotatably coupled to an electric generator <b>42</b> positioned within the nacelle <b>16</b> by the main shaft <b>44</b>, a gearbox <b>46</b>, a high-speed shaft <b>48</b>, and a coupling <b>50</b>. In the example, the main shaft <b>44</b> is disposed at least partially coaxial to a longitudinal axis (not shown) of the nacelle <b>16</b>. A rotation of the main shaft <b>44</b> drives the gearbox <b>46</b> that subsequently drives the high-speed shaft <b>48</b> by translating the relatively slow rotational movement of the rotor <b>18</b> and of the main shaft <b>44</b> into a relatively fast rotational movement of the high-speed shaft <b>48</b>. The latter is connected to the generator <b>42</b> for generating electrical energy with the help of a coupling <b>50</b>. Furthermore, a transformer <b>90</b> and/or suitable electronics, switches, and/or inverters may be arranged in the nacelle <b>16</b> in order to transform electrical energy generated by the generator <b>42</b> having a voltage between 400V to 1000 V into electrical energy having medium voltage (10-35 KV) or higher voltage, e.g. 66 kV. Said electrical energy is conducted via power cables <b>160</b> from the nacelle <b>16</b> into the tower <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The gearbox <b>46</b>, generator <b>42</b> in transformer <b>90</b> may be supported by a main support structure frame of the nacelle <b>16</b>, optionally embodied as a main frame <b>52</b>.
