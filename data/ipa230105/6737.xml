Generally, a cable includes a plurality of cable cores, and a transmission medium connecting two devices may be included in a plurality of cable segments. Optical fibers are used as an example. As important communication media, optical fibers are widely used in communication systems such as high-speed, large-capacity, and low-delay communication systems. Optical fibers are thin and easy to break, and cannot be directly used for connecting devices. For an optical cable, a specific quantity of optical fibers form cable cores in a specific manner. A basic structure of the optical cable includes the cable cores, a reinforced steel wire, a filler, a protective sleeve, and other parts. The optical cable provides effective protection for the optical fibers, so that devices connected through the optical fibers have an engineering-feasible solution. However, as a distance increases, a volume, a weight, and the like of an optical cable increase accordingly. For long-distance transmission devices, a connected optical cable needs to be formed by splicing a plurality of optical cable segments. In addition, one segment of optical cable may include a plurality of optical fibers, and that different optical fibers may be connected to different devices may mean that different optical fibers lead to different directions. The optical fibers in the optical cable need to be split.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A transmission medium connecting two sites for communication is referred to as a communication path, and two communication paths may share a same cable segment. For example, if a communication path <b>1</b> includes a cable segment <b>1</b> and a cable segment <b>2</b>, and a communication path <b>2</b> includes the cable segment <b>2</b> and a cable segment <b>3</b>, the cable segment <b>2</b> is a cable segment shared by the communication path <b>1</b> and the communication path <b>2</b>. The shared cable segment may be referred to as a co-cable segment below. Moreover, once a fault occurs on the co-cable segment of the communication path <b>1</b> and the communication path <b>2</b>, for example, once the co-cable segment is cut off, bent, or pressed, a problem, for example, communication quality deterioration or even interruption, occurs on both the communication path <b>1</b> and the communication path <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an existing solution, information about a co-cable between cables is usually manually recorded when the cables are laid. However, manually recording the information about the co-cable may take a long time, resulting in problems such as low efficiency, high maintenance costs, or great maintenance difficulty. Therefore, how to efficiently and accurately determine a cable segment shared by paths becomes an issue to be urgently resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application discloses a co-cable probability detection method and an apparatus, to accurately and efficiently detect a probability that different transmission media share a cable segment, so that the cable segment shared by the transmission media can be determined in an accurate and timely manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, this application provides a co-cable probability detection method. The method includes a network device (a controller or a network element) obtains information about at least two first events in a first transmission medium and information about at least two second events in a second transmission medium, where information about at least two first events is obtained based on a first sounding signal transmitted in a first transmission medium, the information about the at least two second events is obtained based on a second sounding signal transmitted in a second transmission medium, the information about the at least two first events indicates at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium, and the information about the at least two second events indicates at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium, and the network device obtains, based on the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events, a probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment, where the co-cable segment is a cable segment shared by the first transmission medium and the second transmission medium.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be obtained based on the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events. In other words, the probability that the two transmission media share a cable segment is output based on the obtained event information. Therefore, maintenance costs of manual recording can be reduced, a probability that transmission media share a cable segment can be quickly and accurately output, and whether the transmission media share a cable segment can be further determined based on the probability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible implementation, the obtaining, based on the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events, a probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may include determining a distance between two adjacent first events in the first transmission medium and a distance between two adjacent second events in the second transmission medium, and matching a distance between any two adjacent first events in the first transmission medium with a distance between any two adjacent second events in the second transmission medium, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this implementation of this application, the distance between the two adjacent events in one of the two transmission media may be matched with the distance between the two adjacent events in the other transmission medium, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment. A distance between two adjacent events in a transmission medium may also be referred to as a distance between occurrence points of the two adjacent events on the transmission medium. It can be understood that each transmission medium is divided into a plurality of cable segments based on events in the transmission medium, a distance between two adjacent events may represent a length of one cable segment, and the probability that the at least one cable segment on one of the two transmission media and the at least one cable segment on the other transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be calculated based on a matching degree of lengths of cable segments on the two transmission media. A higher matching degree of the lengths of the cable segments on the two transmission media leads to a larger calculated probability value. Therefore, in this implementation of this application, the probability that the at least one cable segment on one of the two transmission media and the at least one cable segment on the other transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be calculated based on whether lengths of cable segments are close to or equal to each other. In this way, maintenance costs of manual recording can be reduced, a probability that transmission media share a cable segment can be quickly and accurately output, and whether the transmission media share a cable segment can be further determined based on the probability.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation, the obtaining, based on the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events, a probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may include calculating, based on event types of the at least two first events and event types of the at least two second events, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this implementation of this application, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be further calculated with reference to the types of the events in the two transmission media, to further improve accuracy of an obtained probability value.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, on a basis of matching the distance between the any two adjacent events in the first transmission medium with the distance between the any two adjacent events in the second transmission medium, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be calculated with reference to types of two adjacent events in the first transmission medium and types of two adjacent events in the second transmission medium, to further improve the accuracy of the calculated probability value.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the events in the first transmission medium and the second transmission medium may include major events, and the major events indicate that a confidence level of a cable segment is greater than or equal to a first preset threshold. The matching a distance between any two adjacent first events in the first transmission medium with a distance between any two adjacent second events in the second transmission medium, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may include matching a distance between any two adjacent major events included in the first transmission medium with a distance between any two adjacent major events included in the second transmission medium, to obtain a major-event similarity, and calculating, based on the major-event similarity, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this implementation of this application, the major events included in the events in the first transmission medium and the second transmission medium are screened, the major-event similarity between the two transmission media is calculated based on the distances between the adjacent major events, and the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is calculated based on the major-event similarity. Generally, due to an obvious characteristic of a major event, accuracy of detecting the major event is higher, and missed detection does not easily occur on the major event. Therefore, a probability value obtained based on a matching degree of the distances between the adjacent major events in the two transmission media is more accurate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a specific implementation, the major event is an event in which a reflection height is greater than a preset height or a loss value is greater than a preset loss value. In other words, the major event presents a more obvious characteristic and indicates a higher confidence level.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a possible implementation, the at least two events include minor events, and the minor events indicate that a confidence level of a cable segment is less than or equal to a second preset threshold. The matching a distance between any two adjacent first events in the first transmission medium with a distance between any two adjacent second events in the second transmission medium, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may include matching a distance between any two adjacent minor events included in the first transmission medium with a distance between any two adjacent minor events included in the second transmission medium, to obtain a minor-event similarity, and calculating, based on the minor-event similarity, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this implementation of this application, the events in the transmission media are classified into major events and minor events, and on a basis of calculating, based on the major-event similarity, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is further calculated more precisely with reference to the minor-event similarity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a specific implementation, the minor event is an event in which a reflection height is not greater than the preset height or a loss value is not greater than the preset loss value.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible implementation, after the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity are calculated, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is calculated based on the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Therefore, in this implementation of this application, a co-cable probability may be calculated with reference to the major events and the minor events, so that the obtained co-cable probability is more precise.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation, the obtaining, based on the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events, a probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment further includes the at least two first events and the at least two second events include a same reference event, and the reference event is an event generated by the first sounding signal and the second sounding signal at a same cable location, and matching a distance between at least one first event in the first transmission medium and the reference event with a distance between at least one second event in the second transmission medium and the reference event, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this implementation of this application, for a scenario in which the two transmission media have a same event, a distance between an event in one of the two transmission media and the same event may be further matched with a distance between an event in the other transmission medium and the same event. This can simplify co-cable probability calculation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a specific implementation, if the first sounding signal and the second sounding signal are corresponding to a same source node or a same sink node, a distance between each first event in the first transmission medium and a same node and a distance between each second event in the second transmission medium and the same node are calculated. The same node is a node common to the first sounding signal and the second sounding signal, and may be a same source node or a same sink node. If the two sounding signals are corresponding to both a same source node and a same sink node, either the source node or the sink node may be used as the same node. The distance between each first event in the first transmission medium and the same node is matched with the distance between each second event in the second transmission medium and the same node, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment. In this implementation of this application, if the two transmission media have a same source or a same sink, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be calculated based on the distances between the events in the two transmission media and the same node. In this way, a probability that the two transmission media include a co-cable segment in a same source or same sink scenario can be further calculated.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation, the matching a distance between at least one first event in the first transmission medium and the reference event with a distance between at least one second event in the second transmission medium and the reference event, to obtain the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may include matching the distance between the at least one first event in the first transmission medium and the reference event with the distance between the at least one second event in the second transmission medium and the reference event, to obtain at least one event similarity, and calculating, based on the at least one event similarity, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this implementation of this application, the distance between the at least one event in one of the two transmission media and the reference event may be matched with the distance between the at least one event in the other transmission medium and the reference event, to obtain the at least one event similarity, and the co-cable probability between the two transmission media may be calculated based on the at least one event similarity. In this way, a co-cable probability in a scenario in which the two transmission media have a same event can be accurately calculated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a specific implementation, two events may be determined from the at least one first event as a first start event and a first end event, and two events may be determined from the at least one second event as a second start event and a second end event. Then, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is calculated based on distances between the first start event in the first transmission medium and the same node and between the first end event in the first transmission medium and the same node, and distances between the second start event in the second transmission medium and the same node and between the second end event in the second transmission medium and the same node. A start event similarity is a similarity between the distance between the same node and the first start event in the first transmission medium and the distance between the same node and the second start event in the second transmission medium, and an end event similarity is a similarity between the distance between the same node and the first end event in the first transmission medium and the distance between the same node and the second end event in the second transmission medium. Afterwards, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is calculated based on the start event similarity and the end event similarity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It can be understood that if the two transmission media have a same source or a same sink, the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment may be calculated based on the distances between the start events in the two transmission media and the same node and the distances between the end events in the two transmission media and the same node.

It can be understood that if it is detected that the first transmission medium or the second transmission medium exists, or if it is detected that data transmitted in the first transmission medium or the second transmission medium satisfies a trigger condition, obtaining of the information about the at least two first events and the information about the at least two second events is triggered.

It is clear that the described embodiments are merely some but not all embodiments of this application. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on embodiments of this application without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of this application.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">First, a co-cable probability detection method provided in this application can be applied to various communication systems, such as electrical communication systems or optical communication networks, and is used to detect a cable segment shared by two transmission media. The electrical communication systems may include a digital subscriber line (DSL), an asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), a rate adaptive digital subscriber line (RADSL), and the like. The optical communication networks include but are not limited to any one or a combination of an optical transport network (OTN), an optical access network (OAN), a synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), and a passive optical network (PON), an Ethernet, a flexible Ethernet (FlexE), and a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) network.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">With reference to a communication network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the following uses an example to describe a communication system to which the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application is applied. The optical communication system may include a controller and at least one node connected to the controller. The at least one node is a node A, a node B, a node C, and a node D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The nodes are connected to each other through transmission media such as twisted pairs, coaxial cables, or optical fibers. Electrical cables such as twisted pairs or coaxial cables are used to transmit electrical signals, and optical fibers are used to transmit optical signals. Certainly, the four nodes herein are merely examples for description, and more or fewer nodes may be included in an actual application scenario. This is not limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller may be an independent device in the communication network, or the controller may be integrated into a server or a network management system in the communication network. For example, the controller may be integrated into a software defined network (SDN) controller or a path computation element (PCE). The node connected to the controller may be a network element in the communication network, for example, an optical network terminal (ONT), a multiplexer unit (MXU), an optical line terminal (OLT), a switch, or a router.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The controller is configured to detect a probability that at least one cable segment on one of at least two transmission media and at least one cable segment on another transmission medium in the at least two transmission media include a co-cable segment. The at least two transmission media may be optical fibers, conducting wires, or the like connected between two or more nodes in the communication network. The controller may be specifically configured to perform the co-cable probability detection method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">For ease of understanding, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the following uses an optical communication system as an example to describe a specific application scenario of the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application. The application scenario may include at least two optical communication devices, such as a device A, a device B, a device C, and a device D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The device A and the device C are connected to each other through an optical fiber, and the device B and the device D are connected to each other through an optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">An optical fiber is usually included in an optical cable. Because a length of one segment of optical cable is limited, a plurality of segments of optical cables may be connected to each other through a fiber distribution terminal or a junction box, or it can be understood that a fiber distribution terminal, a junction box, or the like divides an optical cable into a plurality of optical cable segments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the optical fiber connected between the device A and the device C may be included in an optical cable segment <b>1</b>, an optical cable segment <b>3</b>, and an optical cable segment <b>4</b>, and the optical fiber connected between the device B and the device D may be included in an optical cable segment <b>2</b>, the optical cable segment <b>3</b>, and an optical cable segment <b>5</b>. Therefore, the optical cable segment <b>3</b> is an optical cable segment shared by the optical fiber connected between the device A and the device C and the optical fiber connected between the device B and the device D.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although an optical cable protects optical fibers, once a fault occurs on the optical cable (for example, once the optical cable is cut off, bent, or pressed), faults occur on all optical fibers passing through the optical cable, and communication quality deterioration or even interruption, or the like occurs. Therefore, to improve communication reliability, active/standby protection is usually used. To be specific, there are a plurality of optical fibers connected between two devices, and when a fault occurs on an active path, service data may be switched to a standby path for transmission.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">However, when the active path and the standby path have a co-cable, if a fault occurs on a shared optical cable segment, for example, if the shared optical cable segment is cut off, bent, or pressed, data cannot be transmitted between the two devices, the active/standby protection fails, and the active path and the standby path cannot be protected. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a path <b>1</b> and a path <b>2</b> formed by optical fibers exist between a sending device and a receiving device. The path <b>1</b> and the path <b>2</b> have a co-cable segment. If a fault occurs on the co-cable segment, for example, if the co-cable segment is cut off, bent, or pressed, transmission on both the path <b>1</b> and the path <b>2</b> is interrupted, and data transmission between the sending device and the receiving device is affected or even cannot be performed. Therefore, to avoid a risk that the active/standby paths have a co-cable, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify a co-cable segment in a manner that can adapt to dynamic network changes. When the &#x201c;path&#x201d; mentioned herein is used to bear service data, the &#x201c;path&#x201d; may also be referred to as a &#x201c;service path&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Whether two optical fibers have a co-cable may be detected by using information that is about a geographic location for laying an optical cable and that is recorded during optical cable laying and information about a device in the optical cable, for example, information about an optical distribution frame (ODF), a fiber distribution terminal, a junction box, a pipe, or a pole. Then, based on the information about the device, matching is performed on the two optical fibers to determine whether a shared cable segment exists between the two optical fibers. However, if the information about the device that the optical cable passes through is manually recorded, high labor costs are needed, and when some devices in the optical cable or the optical cable are/is changed or updated, manual maintenance is needed. The updated devices or optical cable possibly cannot be manually recorded in a timely manner. As a result, an optical cable segment shared by the two optical fibers cannot be recorded in a timely manner, affecting data transmission between devices.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In view of this, this application provides a co-cable probability detection method, to automatically detect a probability that a shared cable segment exists between at least one cable segment on one of two optical transmission media and at least one cable segment on the other optical transmission medium, thereby reducing labor costs and detecting a co-cable probability in an accurate and timely manner.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For ease of understanding, the following interprets terms in this application.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">An optical fiber is a fiber made of glass or plastic and is used as an optical conduction means for transmitting data between transmission devices.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An optical cable is a communication cable used to transmit optical signals through its internal fiber cores to implement large-capacity information communication. Generally, as a distance increases, a volume and a weight of an optical cable increase accordingly. Therefore, for data transmission between devices with a long distance that cannot be implemented by using one segment of optical cable, a plurality of segments of optical cables need to be spliced together. In addition, one segment of optical cable may include one or more optical fibers, and the one or more optical fibers are wrapped with a protective sleeve or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example structure of a cross-section of an optical cable. The optical cable includes a protective sleeve <b>31</b>, and the protective sleeve <b>31</b> wraps four optical fibers <b>32</b>: an optical fiber <b>1</b>, an optical fiber <b>2</b>, an optical fiber <b>3</b>, and an optical fiber <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Moreover, other components such as a filler and a power cable are further disposed in the optical cable. In this application, only a structural relationship between the optical cable and the optical fiber is described herein, and other components included in the optical cable are not limited. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, electrical cables such as coaxial cables or twisted pairs may be alternatively included in a larger electrical cable, that is, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be alternatively electrical cables such as coaxial cables or twisted pairs in a larger electrical cable.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">An optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) is configured to detect information about an event in an optical fiber, and is specifically configured to detect information about a reflection event and a non-reflection event in the optical fiber. A working principle of the OTDR is similar to that of a radar. For example, the OTDR sends a test laser pulse, namely, an optical sounding signal, to the optical fiber. Then, a value of power of an echo signal returned (including Rayleigh scattering and Fresnel reflection) from each point on the optical fiber is obtained, to obtain echo power information. By analyzing echo characteristics in the echo power information, an event type of each event in the optical fiber (for example, an optical fiber head end, a splice point, a movable connector, a fracture, a mechanical connector, bending, or an optical fiber tail end) and a location of each event in the optical fiber can be obtained. It can be understood that, according to a backscattering principle and a Fresnel reflection principle of light, the OTDR obtains attenuation information by using backscattering light generated when light is propagated in the optical fiber. The OTDR may be configured to measure optical fiber attenuation or a splice loss, locate a fault point of the optical fiber, learn of a distribution of optical fiber losses along optical fiber lengths, or the like. The OTDR may be deployed in a node or the controller in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and is configured to collect information about events in the optical fiber connecting the nodes. In the following implementations of this application, the information about the events obtained by the OTDR may include locations of the events relative to the optical fiber head end, event types, event confidence levels, reflection heights, attenuation magnitudes, or the like.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of events in an optical fiber and echo characteristics. A laser is configured to transmit an optical sounding signal, and a detector is configured to detect an echo signal returned from each point on the optical fiber. The optical sounding signal is transmitted from an optical fiber head end, and there may be events such as splice points, a movable connector, a fracture, a mechanical connector, bending, or an optical fiber tail end in the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Event types of the optical fiber may include a reflection event and a non-reflection event. Generally, optical fiber splicing and bending may cause optical power attenuation, but do no cause a reflection phenomenon. Such events are collectively referred to as non-reflection events. A fixed mechanical connector, a movable connector, an optical fiber fracture, and the like all cause light reflection and attenuation, and a high reflection peak appears on an OTDR echo curve. Such events are collectively referred to as reflection events. The OTDR echo curve is a curve of power values of the echo signal. In addition, a high reflection peak also appears at an optical fiber head end or an optical fiber tail end on the OTDR echo curve. Such two types of events are also collectively referred to as reflection events. Generally, on the OTDR echo curve, a reflection event usually causes a reflection peak to appear on the OTDR echo curve, and a non-reflection event usually causes power attenuation. For example, a poorer manufacturing process of a splice point leads to greater attenuation.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The event types of the optical fiber may further include major events and minor events. The major event may be further an event in which a reflection height is greater than a preset height, a loss value is greater than a preset loss value, a negative gain is greater than a preset gain value, or the like. For example, an event in which the reflection height is greater than 0.3 dB, the attenuation value is greater than 0.2 dB, or the negative gain is greater than 0.3 dB is used as a major event. The minor event may be further an event in which a reflection height is not greater than the preset height, a loss value is not greater than the preset loss value, a negative gain is not greater than the preset gain value, or the like. For example, an event in which the reflection height is less than or equal to 0.3 dB, the attenuation value is less than or equal to 0.2 dB, or the negative gain is less than or equal to 0.3 dB is used as a minor event. A display result of a major event on the OTDR echo curve is more obvious than that of a minor event, and generally missed detection does not easily occur on the major event. Therefore, a detection confidence level of the major event is high, and endpoints of a cable can be accurately detected.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">An ODF is used for termination and distribution of trunk optical cables at a central office, and can facilitate connections, distribution, scheduling, and the like of optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">An FDT is short for a fiber distribution terminal, is a passive device, and is used to divide optical cables with a larger logarithm into optical cables with a smaller logarithm in different transmission directions.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Based on the foregoing descriptions, the following details the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the following describes a procedure for the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a distance between two adjacent events in each of optical fibers, namely, an optical fiber <b>1</b>, an optical fiber <b>2</b>, and an optical fiber <b>3</b>, is matched with a distance between two adjacent events in another optical fiber in the three optical fibers, and a probability that a shared optical cable segment exists between the optical fiber <b>1</b>, the optical fiber <b>2</b>, and the optical fiber <b>3</b> is calculated based on a matching result.

In this way, a probability that the optical cable segment on one of the two optical fibers and the optical cable segment on the other optical fiber are a shared optical cable segment can be obtained. Then, weighting calculation may be performed on probabilities that an optical cable segment is a shared optical cable segment, to calculate a probability that a shared optical cable segment exists between the two optical fibers.

The first preset threshold may be adjusted depending on an actual application. This is not limited herein. The major event may be further an event in which a reflection height is greater than a preset height, a loss value is greater than a preset loss value, a negative gain is greater than a preset gain value, or the like. Then, a co-cable probability between two optical fibers is calculated based on the distance between the two adjacent major events in each optical fiber.

Then, a co-cable probability between the two optical fibers is calculated based on major-event similarities, for example, by performing weighting calculation or a sum operation. Alternatively, when there are only two major events in one optical fiber, the major-event similarity is used as a co-cable probability, or the like. In addition, a smaller length difference between two adjacent major events indicates a higher similarity. Generally, there may be an error in a distance between two events, for example, an OTDR measurement error, or an error caused by different twist rates of different optical fibers in one optical cable or different fiber coiling lengths in a fiber splicing box. A major event can be understood as an event with a high confidence level, and generally missed detection does not easily occur on the major event. Therefore, accuracy of the co-cable probability obtained based on the major-event similarity is also higher. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, major events D<b>2</b> and D<b>5</b> in an optical fiber <b>1</b> and major events E<b>2</b> and E<b>5</b> in an optical fiber <b>2</b> are screened, and a difference between a distance between D<b>2</b> and D<b>5</b> and a distance between E<b>2</b> and E<b>5</b> is calculated. A smaller distance difference between the major events in the two optical fibers, that is, closer or equal distances between the major events in the two optical fibers, leads to a higher obtained major-event similarity, and a higher co-cable probability is obtained accordingly.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In another specific implementation, a distance between any two adjacent minor events in one of two optical fibers may be matched with a distance between any two adjacent minor events in the other optical fiber, to obtain a minor-event similarity.

The minor events are events whose confidence levels are less than or equal to a second preset threshold. The second preset threshold may be adjusted depending on an actual application scenario. This is not limited herein. For example, a difference between a distance between two adjacent minor events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and a distance between two adjacent minor events in the optical fiber <b>2</b> may be calculated. Then, the difference is calculated to obtain the minor-event similarity. A specific minor-event similarity calculation manner may be if the difference is within three times a standard variance, calculating an area in an integral method based on a location of the difference in a normal distribution, and using the area as the minor-event similarity. Then, weighting calculation is performed on a plurality of minor-event similarities between the two optical fibers, to obtain a co-cable probability that the two optical fibers share an optical cable segment.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Specifically, the minor event may be further an event in which a reflection height is not greater than the preset height, a loss value is not greater than the preset loss value, a negative gain is not greater than the preset gain value, or the like. Then, the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers is calculated based on the distance between the minor events in each optical fiber. For example, an event in which the reflection height is less than or equal to 0.3 dB or the attenuation value is less than or equal to 0.2 dB among events in each optical fiber may be used as a minor event.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In a more specific implementation, on a basis of calculating the co-cable probability based on the major-event similarity, a more precise co-cable probability may be further calculated with reference to the minor-event similarity. A distance between two adjacent minor events in one of two optical fibers may be matched with a distance between two adjacent minor events in the other optical fiber, to obtain a minor-event similarity. A final co-cable probability is calculated with reference to the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity. Specifically, different weight values may be set based on the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity. A higher similarity indicates a larger weight value, and a weight value corresponding to a major event is greater than a weight value corresponding to a minor event. Then, weighting calculation is performed on the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity based on the weight value corresponding to the major event and the weight value corresponding to the minor event, to obtain a more precise co-cable probability. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, major events in an optical fiber <b>1</b> include D<b>2</b> and D<b>5</b>, minor events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> include D<b>1</b>, D<b>3</b>, D<b>4</b>, and D<b>6</b>, major events in an optical fiber <b>2</b> include E<b>2</b> and E<b>5</b>, and minor events in the optical fiber <b>2</b> include E<b>1</b>, E<b>3</b>, E<b>4</b>, and E<b>6</b>. A difference between a distance between D<b>2</b> and D<b>5</b> and a distance between E<b>2</b> and E<b>5</b> is calculated, and a major-event similarity is obtained based on the difference. A smaller distance difference leads to a higher obtained major-event similarity. Then, a minor-event similarity between the two major events is calculated to improve accuracy of a co-cable probability. A difference between a distance between D<b>3</b> and D<b>4</b> and a distance between E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b> is calculated to obtain the minor-event similarity, and then weighting calculation is performed on the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity, to obtain a co-cable probability between the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b>. In addition, to further improve accuracy and efficiency of calculating the co-cable probability, the similarity between the two adjacent minor events located between the two major events may be calculated only when the calculated major-event similarity is greater than a similarity threshold, thereby avoiding meaningless calculation. The similarity threshold may be adjusted depending on an actual application scenario, and a larger similarity threshold leads to higher efficiency of calculating a co-cable probability. Moreover, in addition to matching the distance between the two adjacent minor events in one of the two optical fibers with the distance between the two adjacent minor events in the other optical fiber, a distance between a minor event and a major event in one of the two optical fibers may be further matched with a distance between a minor event and a major event in the other optical fiber. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, during calculation of the minor-event similarity, a difference between a distance between D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> and a distance between E<b>2</b> and E<b>3</b> and a difference between a distance between D<b>4</b> and D<b>5</b> and a distance between E<b>4</b> and E<b>5</b> are also calculated.

If optical fiber head ends of the first optical sounding signal and the second optical sounding signal are the same, the reference event may be the optical fiber head end of the first optical sounding signal and the second optical sounding signal. If optical fiber tail ends of the first optical sounding signal and the second optical sounding signal are the same, the reference event may be the optical fiber tail end of the first optical sounding signal and the second optical sounding signal. The reference event may be alternatively generated by an endpoint of an optical cable segment. The optical cable segment may be one endpoint of a manually identified co-cable segment on the first optical fiber and the second optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further, the distance between the event in the first optical fiber and the reference event may be matched with the distance between the event in the second optical fiber and the reference event, to obtain at least one event similarity, and the probability that the at least one cable segment on the first transmission medium and the at least one cable segment on the second transmission medium include a co-cable segment is calculated based on the at least one event similarity.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">For example, if source nodes (namely, the optical fiber head ends) or sink nodes (namely, the optical fiber tail ends) for sending the optical sounding signals in the two optical fibers are the same, the co-cable probability may be calculated in the second manner, or on a basis of the foregoing manner 1, the co-cable probability is updated more accurately with reference to this manner, to obtain a more precise co-cable probability.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Specifically, if the two optical fibers have a same source or a same sink, that is, if the source nodes or the sink nodes for sending the optical sounding signals in the two optical fibers are the same, distances between events in the two optical fibers and a same node (namely, the reference event) are calculated, the distance between the events in one of the two optical fibers and the same node is matched with the distance between the events in the other optical fiber and the same node, to obtain the at least one event similarity, and an operation, for example, weighting calculation or a sum operation, is performed on the at least one event similarity, to obtain the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers. A higher similarity between the distances between the events in the two optical fibers and the same node indicates a higher finally obtained co-cable probability. The same node may be a node common to the two optical fibers, and may be a same source node or a same sink node. When the two optical fibers are corresponding to both a same source node and a same sink node, the same node may be either the source node or the sink node.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">More specifically, a scenario in which the two optical fibers have a same source and a same sink is used as an example. Any two adjacent events in an optical fiber <b>1</b> are determined as a start event <b>1</b> and an end event <b>1</b>, where the start event <b>1</b> and the end event <b>1</b> can be understood as two ends of an optical cable segment on the optical fiber <b>1</b>. Any two adjacent events in an optical fiber <b>2</b> are determined as a start event <b>2</b> and an end event <b>2</b>, where the start event <b>2</b> and the end event <b>2</b> can be understood as two ends of an optical cable segment on the optical fiber <b>2</b>. Distances between the start event <b>1</b> and a source node of the optical sounding signal and between the end event <b>1</b> and the source node, and distances between the start event <b>2</b> and the source node and between the end event <b>2</b> and the source node are calculated. Then, a start event difference between the distance between the start event <b>1</b> and the source node and the distance between the start event <b>2</b> and the source node is calculated, and a start event similarity is calculated based on the start event difference. A smaller start event difference indicates a higher start event similarity. In addition, an end event difference between the distance between the end event <b>1</b> and the source node and the distance between the end event <b>2</b> and the source node is calculated, and an end event similarity is calculated based on the end event difference. A smaller end event difference indicates a higher end event similarity. Then, a probability that an optical cable segment between the start event <b>1</b> and the end event <b>1</b> and an optical cable segment between the start event <b>2</b> and the end event <b>2</b> are a same optical cable segment is calculated based on the start event similarity and the end event similarity. Afterwards, weighting calculation is performed on a probability that one or more optical cable segments on the optical fiber <b>1</b> and one or more optical cable segments on the optical fiber <b>2</b> are a co-cable segment, to obtain a co-cable probability between the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b>. It can be understood that if both the start event similarity and the end event similarity of one optical cable segment are higher than a specified threshold, that is, if locations of the start events in the two optical fibers are similar in the optical fibers and locations of the end events in the two optical fibers are similar in the optical fibers, a length of the optical cable segment between the start event and the end event in one of the two optical fibers is also similar to a length of the optical cable segment between the start event and the end event in the other optical fiber. In other words, the optical cable segments between the start events and the end events in the two optical fibers may be a same optical cable segment. Specifically, a probability that the optical cable segments corresponding to the start events and the end events in the two optical fibers are a same optical cable segment may be calculated based on the start event similarity and the end event similarity by using a preset mapping formula. In this way, the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers is obtained based on the probability that the optical cable segments corresponding to the start events and the end events are a same optical cable segment. The preset mapping formula may be adjusted depending on an actual application scenario, for example, may be p=f(x, y). f is the mapping formula, p is the probability that the optical cable segments corresponding to the start events and the end events are a same optical cable segment, and x and y are the start event similarity and the end event similarity. The greater x and y, the greater the obtained p is.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Moreover, when a start event and an end event in one optical fiber are determined, two adjacent major events may be selected as the start event and the end event, two adjacent minor events may be selected as the start event and the end event, or any two adjacent events may be selected as the start event and the end event. Specifically, an adjustment may be made depending on an actual application scenario.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, an optical fiber <b>1</b> and an optical fiber <b>2</b> have a same source, that is, head ends of the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b> are the same. Two adjacent events are selected as a start event and an end event separately in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b>. A distance between the start event and the optical fiber head end and a distance between the end event and the optical fiber head end in the optical fiber <b>1</b> are calculated, and a distance between the start event and the optical fiber head end and a distance between the end event and the optical fiber head end in the optical fiber <b>2</b> are calculated. Then, a difference between the start event distance of the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the start event distance of the optical fiber <b>2</b> is calculated, and a smaller difference indicates a higher start event similarity. In addition, a difference between the end event distance of the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the end event distance of the optical fiber <b>2</b> is calculated, and a smaller difference also indicates a higher end event similarity. Afterwards, a start event similarity is calculated based on the difference between the start event distances, and an end event similarity is calculated based on the difference between the end event distances. For calculation manners, refer to the foregoing calculation manners of the major-event similarity and the minor-event similarity. Next, a probability that optical cable segments between the start events and the end events in the two optical fibers are a same optical cable segment is calculated based on the start event similarity and the end event similarity. The probability that the optical cable segments between the start events and the end events in the two optical fibers are a same optical cable segment may be used as a co-cable probability between the two optical fibers. Alternatively, if probabilities that a plurality of optical cable segments corresponding to a plurality of pairs of start events and end events in the two optical fibers are a same optical cable segment are calculated, weighting calculation may be performed on the probabilities that the plurality of optical cable segments are a same optical cable segment, to obtain a co-cable probability between the two optical fibers. For a specific weighting calculation manner, refer to the foregoing manner 1. For the two optical fibers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, that the start event similarity and the end event similarity are high may mean that a location of the start event in the optical fiber <b>1</b> is similar to a location of the start event in the optical fiber <b>2</b>, and a location of the end event in the optical fiber <b>1</b> is similar to a location of the end event in the optical fiber <b>2</b>. In this case, a length of an optical cable segment <b>1</b> between the start event and the end event in the optical fiber <b>1</b> is also similar to a length of an optical cable segment <b>2</b> between the start event and the end event in the optical fiber <b>2</b>. In other words, the optical cable segment <b>1</b> and the optical cable segment <b>2</b> may be a same optical cable segment. Therefore, the co-cable probability calculation manner in a same source or same sink scenario is provided in the second manner, to precisely calculate the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">It should be understood that a scenario in which the two optical fibers have a same sink is similar to the foregoing scenario in which the two optical fibers have a same source, provided that source nodes in this scenario are replaced with sink nodes. For example, source nodes in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> may be replaced with sink nodes. Details are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, if the co-cable probability is calculated in the manner 1 and the manner 2 jointly, a probability that any two optical cable segments between the two optical fibers are a co-cable segment may be calculated in the manner 1, and a start event difference and an end event difference in the two optical fibers may be calculated in the manner 2. Then, different weight values are selected for the optical cable segments between the start events and the end events in the two optical fibers based on the start event difference and the end event difference. A smaller start event difference or end event difference indicates a larger weight value, or a closer distance between the start event or the end event and the source node indicates a larger weight value. Afterwards, weighting calculation is performed on the probability that the any two optical cable segments are a co-cable segment and that is calculated in the manner 1 and the weight values of the optical cable segments calculated in the manner 2, to obtain the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers. Therefore, on a basis of calculating the probability that the optical cable segments are a shared optical cable segment based on the distance between the adjacent events, and the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers is calculated more precisely with reference to the distance between each event in the same source or the same sink and the source node.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In a possible implementation, in addition to the co-cable probability calculation manners in the manner 1 and the manner 2, a co-cable probability may be further calculated with reference to types of events in the two transmission media. For example, whether types of two events in one of the two optical fibers match types of two events in the other optical fiber is determined. If the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> are splice points, and the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>2</b> that match those in the optical fiber <b>1</b> are movable connectors, a matching degree of the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b> is low, and accordingly the obtained co-cable probability is also low. In contrast, if the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> are splice points, and the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>2</b> that match those in the optical fiber <b>1</b> are also splice points, a matching degree of the types of the two events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b> is high, and accordingly the obtained co-cable probability is also high. For example, a weight value may be allocated for similarity matching between two adjacent events in the two optical fibers based on types of the events in the two optical fibers. If the two events that are in the two optical fibers and that are used for matching have a same type or similar characteristics, a weight value is larger. If the two events that are in the two optical fibers and that are used for matching have different types or differ greatly in characteristics, a weight value is smaller. Subsequently, weighting calculation may be performed on a similarity between the events in the two optical fibers based on the weight value, to obtain the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Moreover, the types of the events in one of the two optical fibers may be further matched with the types of the events in the other optical fiber, to calculate the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers. For example, it is assumed that the events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> sequentially include an optical fiber head end, a movable connector, a mechanical connector, bending, bending, bending, a splice point, and an optical fiber tail end, and the events in the optical fiber <b>2</b> sequentially include an optical fiber head end, a mechanical connector, bending, bending, bending, a splice point, a movable connector, a splice point, and an optical fiber tail end. The types of the events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> may be matched with the types of the events in the optical fiber <b>2</b>. In this case, types and a sorting order of events, namely, the mechanical connector, bending, bending, bending, and the splice point, in the optical fiber <b>1</b> have high similarities with those of events, namely, the mechanical connector, bending, bending, bending, and the splice point, in the optical fiber <b>2</b>. Then, a probability that optical cable segments corresponding to the mentioned events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> and the optical fiber <b>2</b> are a same optical cable segment may be calculated based on a similarity of each event, a quantity of consecutive similar events, and the like. It can be understood that the optical cable segments between the events in the optical fiber <b>1</b> that have a high type similarity with those in the optical fiber <b>2</b> may be a same optical cable segment.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In a possible implementation, after the co-cable probability between the two transmission media is calculated, that is, after step <b>502</b> is performed, if the co-cable probability is higher than a warning threshold, co-cable risk warning information is generated, and warning is issued based on the co-cable warning information. For example, if the co-cable probability between the two optical fibers is higher than 80%, it indicates that there is a high probability that a co-cable segment exists between the two optical fibers. In this case, the co-cable risk warning information may be generated, and the co-cable risk warning information may be displayed on a display interface, to inform a user that the probability that a co-cable segment exists between the two optical fibers is higher than 80%. In this way, an optical fiber for transmitting data is replaced in a timely manner for a device using the two optical fibers, or optical cable laying is adjusted, or the like.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In a possible implementation, after co-cable probabilities between transmission media in the communication network are detected, transmission media whose co-cable probability is higher than the warning threshold may be screened, and then a co-cable risk group, namely, the foregoing preset risk group, may be generated based on information about the transmission media whose co-cable probability is higher than the warning threshold. In this way, the transmission media at a co-cable risk in the communication network can be warned in a timely manner, to make a corresponding adjustment. This avoids sharing a cable segment by an active path and a standby path between devices, thereby providing stability of data transmission between the devices.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In this implementation of this application, the co-cable probability between the two transmission media may be calculated based on the detected information about the events in the two transmission media. Therefore, labor costs caused by maintenance of manual recording can be avoided, errors of manually recorded information can be reduced, and the co-cable probability between the two transmission media can be detected in a timely manner, to avoid a co-cable risk due to a failure in timely manual recording.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The foregoing describes the procedure for the co-cable probability detection method provided in this application.
