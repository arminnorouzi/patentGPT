Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a tractor that is provided with a three-point link mechanism to which a work apparatus is to be attached so as to be able to move upward and downward.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, the tractor disclosed in JP 2018-042530A is provided with a three-point link mechanism, and the three-point link mechanism is operated by a hydraulic unit (the &#x201c;hydraulic lifting/lowering device&#x201d; in JP 2018-042530A) so as to swing. The work apparatus is able to move upward and downward according to a tow load when the work apparatus is attached to the three-point link mechanism and is towed by the vehicle body to perform ground work. A load receiving section (the &#x201c;load detection member&#x201d; in JP 2018-042530A) that receives the tow load from the work apparatus is provided, and the load receiving section swings in response to the tow load from the work apparatus, and transmits an amount of operation for swinging the three-point link mechanism, to the hydraulic unit via the link mechanism. Also, an interlocking swing arm (the &#x201c;swing member&#x201d; in JP 2018-042530A) that can swing in conjunction with the load receiving section is provided. When the load receiving section swings by a predetermined amount or more, the interlocking swing arm swings, the amount of swing of the load receiving section is amplified by the interlocking swing arm, and the operation sensitivity of the three-point link mechanism is improved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the tractor disclosed in JP 2018-042530A, the interlocking swing arm does not swing unless the load receiving section swings by the predetermined amount or more. That is to say, the operation sensitivity of the three-point link mechanism is not improved unless the tow load reaches an amount that is no less than the predetermined amount. Therefore, there is room for improvement in improving the operation sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide tractors each capable of performing control to lift and lower a work apparatus with high sensitivity in response to a tow load.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A tractor according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a three-point link mechanism that is coupled to a rear portion of a vehicle body so as to be able to swing upward and downward, and to which a work apparatus is to be attached so as to be able to move upward and downward, a hydraulic drive to perform a swing operation to swing the three-point link mechanism, a load receiver to swing in response to a tow load being applied from the work apparatus when the work apparatus performs ground work while being towed by the vehicle body, and a link mechanism to transmit an amount of operation for the swing operation to the hydraulic drive according to an amount of swing of the load receiver, wherein the link mechanism includes, at a most upstream position, an interlocking swing arm to swing in conjunction with the swing of the load receiver, about a swing axis that is different from a swing axis of the load receiver, the load receiver includes a first portion to press the interlocking swing arm that includes a second portion contactable with the first portion so as to be pressed by the first portion, and a contact position of the first and second portions is changeable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the load receiver and the interlocking swing arm respectively swing about different swing axes, and the contact position of the first and second portions is changeable. Therefore, the link mechanism can amplify the amount of swing of the load receiver by changing the contact position. Also, the interlocking swing arm is provided at the most upstream position in the link mechanism, and therefore the interlocking swing arm starts swinging when the load receiver starts swinging. In this state, the contact position of the first and second portions can be changed. Therefore, the link mechanism can amplify the amount of swing of the load receiver from when the load receiver starts swinging. Therefore, the operation sensitivity of the three-point link mechanism is improved compared to a configuration in which the interlocking swing arm does not swing unless the load receiver swings by a predetermined amount or more. Thus, it is possible to realize a tractor capable of performing control to move a work apparatus upward and downward with high sensitivity according to the tow load.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that one of the first and second portions includes a swing, the other of the first and second portions includes a lock including a plurality of recessed portions to receive and lock the swing, and the swing is provided with a swing angle determiner to determine a swing angle when the swing is fitted into any of the plurality of recessed portions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With this configuration, the combination of the first and second portions includes the swing and the lock, and the swing fits into a recessed portion of the lock. Also, when the swing fits into one of the plurality of recessed portions, the swing angle of the swing is fixed by the swing angle determiner. Therefore, the contact position of the first and second portions is held without being displaced unintentionally. Thus, the interlocking swing arm can more desirably amplify the amount of swing of the load receiver.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that the swing angle determiner is operable to position the swing at an angle that is orthogonal to a swing angle of the load receiver.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this configuration, the angle at which the swing can be positioned includes an angle that is orthogonal to the swing angle of the load receiver. That is to say, the swing range of the swing is set so as to be a range that is close to the angle that is orthogonal to the swing angle of the load receiver. Therefore, the swing can reliably receive the reaction force from the lock. As a result, the swing can desirably press the lock. Note that the &#x201c;orthogonal angle&#x201d; referred to in the description of preferred embodiments of the present invention is not limited to a strict orthogonal angle, but may be a substantially orthogonal angle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that a free end of the swing is provided with a pin to be fitted into any of the plurality of recessed portions, the lock is provided with a common recess that includes a plurality of recessed portions so that the plurality of recessed portions are continuously lined up, and the pin is movable to a position over the common recess and to be fitted into one of the plurality of recessed portions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this configuration, a plurality of recessed portions are provided in the common recess, and the pin of the swing fits into the plurality of recessed portions. Also, the pin is movable over the common recess to be fitted into one of the plurality of recessed portions, and therefore the common recess includes gaps between the pin and the plurality of recessed portions. Therefore, it is possible to realize a configuration with which the pin swings between the gaps in the common recess when the operator changes the swing angle of the swing, and it is further easier to perform the operation to change the swing angle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that the link mechanism is provided with a sensitivity adjuster operable such that, as the load receiver swings toward a side where the tow load is larger, an amount of displacement of a mechanism that is located downstream thereof in the link mechanism increases.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The amount of swing of the load receiver increases as the tow load applied to the work apparatus increases. It is preferable that, when the tow load applied to the work apparatus increases, the work apparatus is actively controlled so as to move upward in order to reduce the tow load. With this configuration, as the amount of swing of the load receiver increases, the amount of displacement of a mechanism that is located downstream thereof in the link mechanism increases. As a result, the work apparatus is actively controlled so as to move upward, the tow load is quickly reduced, and damage to the work apparatus and engine stall due to an increase in the tow load can be desirably prevented.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that the link mechanism includes, at a position that is downstream of the interlocking swing arm, a link ratio adjuster to change a link ratio so that a link ratio change rate is smaller than a link ratio change rate of the first and second portions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, it is possible to finely adjust the amount of operation for the hydraulic drive.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The above and other elements, features, steps, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a right side view of a tractor to which a work apparatus is attached.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a right side view showing a draft control mechanism.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view showing the draft control mechanism.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear view showing the draft control mechanism.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view showing assembly of a load receiving section and an interlocking swing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of assembly of a link mechanism.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a V-V line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, showing the link mechanism.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the V-V line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, showing movement of the link mechanism in comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an enlarged side view showing a swing member (a first part) and a locking part (a second part).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional plan view showing the swing member (the first part), the locking part (the second part), a first coil spring, and a second coil spring.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a right side view showing swing of the load receiving section and the interlocking swing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a right side view showing the swing of the load receiving section and the interlocking swing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a right side view showing the swing of the load receiving section and the interlocking swing mechanism.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

The supply and discharge of hydraulic oil is controlled through the operation of a spool (not shown). A feedback link mechanism (not shown) operates in conjunction with the up-down movement of the work apparatus <b>15</b>. The feedback link mechanism adjusts the amount of hydraulic oil to be supplied to, or discharged from, the hydraulic actuator, based on the amount of operation of the height setting lever <b>23</b> and the swing angle of the lift arms <b>16</b>. When the work apparatus <b>15</b> reaches a control target height, the supply and discharge of hydraulic oil to and from the hydraulic actuator is stopped, and the up-down swing of the left and right lift arms <b>16</b> is stopped. In this way, the work apparatus <b>15</b> is attached to the three-point link mechanism <b>12</b> so as to be able to move upward and downward.

If the tow load is too large, the plow may be damaged or the engine E may stall. Therefore, the tractor according to the present preferred embodiment is provided with a mechanism to move the work apparatus <b>15</b> such as a plow upward and downward according to the tow load to adjust the tow load to be constant, i.e., a draft control mechanism.

Therefore, a tensile force acts from the work apparatus <b>15</b> to the top link <b>13</b> in a state where the work apparatus <b>15</b> is lifted or in a state where the work apparatus <b>15</b> is not performing ground work. Also, in such a state, a tensile force acts from the top link <b>13</b> to the receiving member <b>30</b>B, and the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings to the rearmost position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When a plow is coupled to the three-point link mechanism <b>12</b> as the work apparatus <b>15</b> and tillage work is performed using the plow, the larger the tillage depth is, the larger the reaction force from the ground that the plow receives is. This reaction force is the tow load, and the upward component of the reaction force acts on the top link <b>13</b> as a pressing force. This pressing force is transmitted to the receiving member <b>30</b>B via the top link <b>13</b>. When this pressing force is larger than the resultant force of the respective elastic forces of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E and the second coil spring <b>30</b>F, the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings forward resisting the resultant force of the respective elastic forces of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E and the second coil spring <b>30</b>F.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings forward, the first coil spring <b>30</b>E contracts.

The above-described spool is moved so that hydraulic oil is supplied to the hydraulic actuator, the lift arms <b>16</b> swings upward in conjunction with the swing of the interlocking swing part <b>35</b>, and the work apparatus <b>15</b> moves upward.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the work apparatus <b>15</b> is a plow, the reaction force applied from the ground to the plow decreases as the position of the plow moves upward, and thus the pressing force acting from the plow to the receiving member <b>30</b>B via the top link <b>13</b> also decreases. Thereafter, when the pressing force acting on the receiving member <b>30</b>B and the elastic force of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E are balanced, the swing of the receiving member <b>30</b>B, the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b>, the tillage depth adjustment cam <b>34</b>, and the interlocking swing part <b>35</b> is stopped, and the linkage rod <b>36</b> is no longer displaced. Thereafter, the supply and discharge of hydraulic oil to and from the hydraulic actuator is stopped by the above-described feedback link mechanism operating the spool, and the up-down swing of the left and right lift arms <b>16</b> is stopped.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the pressing force does not act on the receiving member <b>30</b>B, the receiving member <b>30</b>B stands still at the rearmost end of the front-rear swing range that is based on the front-rear length of the elongated hole <b>30</b><i>p. </i>At this time, the first link member <b>32</b>A and the second link member <b>32</b>B in the coupling link part <b>32</b> are loose, and therefore, even if the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b> swings, the tillage depth adjustment cam <b>34</b> does not move in conjunction with the swing of the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b>. In addition, the coil spring member <b>32</b>C is fitted onto the first link member <b>32</b>A in the coupling link part <b>32</b>. As a result, even if the receiving member <b>30</b>B that has swung forward swings abruptly to the rearmost end position and the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b> also swings abruptly, the impact caused by such an abrupt swing is absorbed by the expansion and contraction operation of the coil spring member <b>32</b>C. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the problem in that the tillage depth adjustment cam <b>34</b> and the interlocking swing part <b>35</b> unnecessarily swing due to the impact. At this time, the tillage depth adjustment cam <b>34</b> swings forward due to the elastic force of the tension spring <b>38</b>.

A thread groove is formed on the outer circumferential surface of a front portion of the boss member <b>60</b>, and a nut <b>63</b> engages with this thread groove. Note that a spacer is provided between a rear end portion of the boss member <b>60</b> and the nut <b>63</b>, and this spacer may include a plurality of washers (flat washers or spring washers). The nut <b>63</b> protrudes to a position that is forward of the bracket <b>30</b>A, and the position of the nut <b>63</b> is adjusted by the spacer. That is to say, the position of the nut <b>63</b> in a front-rear direction may be adjustable according to the length of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F. Note that the nut <b>63</b> and the spacer may be an integrated piece, or the nut <b>63</b> may be a double nut, with no spacer being provided. Also, the boss member <b>60</b> and the nut <b>63</b> may be integrally formed as one member, or the outer circumferential surface of the front portion of the boss member <b>60</b> may be configured without a screw groove.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">A protrusion <b>30</b><i>t </i>that protrudes forward is welded and fixed to a region of the receiving member <b>30</b>B where the first coil spring <b>30</b>E abuts, and a rod <b>61</b> is pivotally coupled to the protrusion <b>30</b><i>t </i>so as to be able to swing upward and downward. The rod <b>61</b> penetrates through the space inside the inner periphery of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E. The rod <b>61</b> penetrates through the hollow hole of the boss member <b>60</b> fitted into the through hole <b>30</b><i>q, </i>and a protruding leading end portion of the rod <b>61</b> protrudes to a position that is forward of the bracket <b>30</b>A.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The second coil spring <b>30</b>F is fitted onto the rod <b>61</b> at a position forward of the bracket <b>30</b>A with respect to the machine body. A flat washer <b>62</b> that has a diameter larger than the outer diameter of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F is fitted onto an end portion of the rod <b>61</b> on the side opposite to the side where the receiving member <b>30</b>B is located.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">A thread groove is formed in a protruding leading end portion of the rod <b>61</b>. Both sides of the flat washer <b>62</b> are fastened with nuts, and the flat washer <b>62</b> is sandwiched between the pair of nuts. The position of the flat washer <b>62</b> in a front-rear direction may be adjustable according to the length of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F. Also, the nut <b>63</b> has an opposite side diameter larger than the outer diameter of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F. That is to say, the two end portions of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F in the extending direction respectively abut against the nut <b>63</b> and the flat washer <b>62</b>. Also, the thread groove of the boss member <b>60</b> and the nuts sandwiching the flat washer <b>62</b> have an outer diameter that is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F. Therefore, the thread groove of the boss member <b>60</b> and the nuts sandwiching the flat washer <b>62</b> abut against the inner circumferential surface of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F without rattling.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings forward and rearward, the rod <b>61</b> is displaced forward and rearward while swinging relative to the receiving member <b>30</b>B. At this time, as the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings, the rod <b>61</b> is displaced in a top-bottom direction. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the rod <b>61</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the hollow hole of the boss member <b>60</b> from interfering with each other. Therefore, the hollow hole of the boss member <b>60</b> is formed as to have a diameter that is sufficiently larger than the cross-sectional diameter of the rod <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In response to the receiving member <b>30</b>B swinging forward and rearward, the separation distance between the bracket <b>30</b>A and the receiving member <b>30</b>B changes, and the separation distance between the nut <b>63</b> supported by the bracket <b>30</b>A and the flat washer supported by the receiving member <b>30</b>B with the rod <b>61</b> being interposed therebetween changes as well. As a result, the first coil spring <b>30</b>E expands and contracts. Also, in response to the receiving member <b>30</b>B swinging forward and rearward, the rod <b>61</b> is displaced forward and rearward, the separation distance between the nut <b>63</b> and the flat washer <b>62</b> changes, and the second coil spring <b>30</b>F expands and contracts.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As the first coil spring <b>30</b>E expands and the elastic energy of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E decreases, the second coil spring <b>30</b>F contracts and the elastic energy of the second coil spring <b>30</b>F increases. If the pressing force suddenly stops acting on the receiving member <b>30</b>B, the elastic energy of the first coil spring <b>30</b>E is released at once. Therefore, it is conceivable that the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings abruptly from the state in which the receiving member <b>30</b>B has swung forward, to the rearmost end of the front-rear swing range thereof that is based on the length of the elongated hole <b>30</b><i>p </i>in the front-rear direction. Even in such a case, the second coil spring <b>30</b>F contracts as the receiving member <b>30</b>B swings rearward, and the second coil spring <b>30</b>F stores the elastic energy. Thus, the first coil spring <b>30</b>E is prevented from abruptly expanding. As a result, the impact when the linkage pin <b>30</b>D abuts against the rearmost end of the elongated hole <b>30</b><i>p </i>is alleviated. In addition, the receiving member <b>30</b>B is prevented from chattering due to such abutting.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Other Preferred Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The present invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated in the above-described preferred embodiments, and the following illustrates other typical preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the above-described preferred embodiments, the load receiving section <b>30</b> is provided with the swing member <b>51</b> defining and functioning as the &#x201c;first portion&#x201d;, and the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b> is provided with the locking part <b>52</b> defining and functioning as the &#x201c;second portion&#x201d;.

However, the present invention is not limited to such preferred embodiments. For example, the coupling link part <b>32</b> may include a chain or a wire. That is to say, it is possible to use a configuration in which a chain or a wire that defines or functions as the coupling link part <b>32</b> is pulled by the interlocking swing arm <b>31</b> to be tense, and the chain or wire pulls and swings the tillage depth adjustment cam <b>34</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the chain or wire loosens when the pressing force does not act on the receiving member <b>30</b>B.
