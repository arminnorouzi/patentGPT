It includes an electro-mechanical system performing two major pumping functions. The left portions of the heart, including the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), draw oxygenated blood from the lungs and pump it to the organs of the body to provide the organs with their metabolic needs for oxygen. The right portions of the heart, including the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), draw deoxygenated blood from the body organs and pump it to the lungs where the blood gets oxygenated. These pumping functions result from contractions of the myocardium (cardiac muscles). In a normal heart, the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's natural pacemaker, generates electrical pulses, called action potentials, which propagate through natural electrical conduction pathways known as His-Purkinje system to various regions of the heart to excite the myocardial tissue of the heart. For example, the action potentials originated from the SA node propagate through the atrioventricular (AV) node, the His bundle (also known as Bundle of His), the bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers to reach the ventricular myocardium, resulting in coordinated contractions in both ventricles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coordinated delays in the propagation of the action potentials in a normal electrical conduction system cause the various portions of the heart to contract in synchrony to result in efficient pumping functions. A blocked or otherwise abnormal electrical conduction and/or deteriorated myocardium may cause dyssynchronous contraction of the heart, resulting in poor hemodynamic performance, including a diminished blood supply to the heart and the rest of the body. For example, an abnormal delay in the transmission of the action potentials in the His bundle can cause irregular or dyssynchronous contractions of the ventricles, resulting in an abnormal rhythm of the heart.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Artificial cardiac pacing system have been used to rectify cardiac dyssynchrony and to improve hemodynamic performance. The artificial cardiac pacing system can provide electrical stimulations to one or more portions of the heart such as to restore normal functioning of the heart to a certain extent. For example, right ventricular pacing via electrodes implanted in the apex of the RV have been used in both single ventricular and biventricular (BiV) pacing. RV apex pacing directly excites the ventricular myocardium, rather than propagating the action potentials through the natural conduction pathways. Studies have shown that, in some patients, long-term RV apex pacing may result in loss of synchronous mechanical contraction of RV and LV, partially due to the interventricular delay in impulse propagation to the left ventricle. Consequently, permanent changes in myocardial perfusion and structure may develop over time in these patients, which may further decrease cardiac output and deteriorate ventricular function. BiV pacing involves RV pacing via one lead, and LV pacing via another lead, and has been demonstrated to restore synchronous contraction of both ventricles. However, the potential adverse impact on ventricular function produced by the RV apex pacing may still exist in BiV pacing. Additionally, compared to cardiac depolarization through AV node activation and propagation through the natural conduction pathways, the BiV pacing may not produce similarly coordinated cardiac contractions. Moreover, the surgical procedure for placing the LV lead through the coronary sinus and into a vein on the left ventricular wall can be complex and challenging in some patients.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hemodynamic response to artificial pacing can depend on many factors, including pacing site selection and pacing configurations. Many patients receiving artificial pacing therapy have an intact His bundle and the natural cardiac electrical conduction system in the ventricles, and therefore having normal ventricular activation. Conventional cardiac pacing such as long-term RV apex pacing may cause a decrease in cardiac efficiency due to the uncoordinated contraction sequence, and eventually exhibit adverse long-term effects. Dyssynchronous contraction of the ventricles occurs during conventional right ventricular pacing because the activation sequence can be much slower and propagate slowly from the right to the left ventricle across the interventricular septum, thereby causing ventricular dyssynchrony. This sequence of activation results in an uncoordinated contraction which does not occur during biventricular activation through the natural conduction system of the heart. The cells of the natural conduction system can propagate an activation signal about four times faster than working myocardium.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">His-bundle pacing (HBP) is an alternative pacing therapy to conventional ventricular pacing in some patients. HBP may activate the heart's natural His-Purkinje system in some patients, and produce efficient and coordinated cardiac contractions. The potentially long-term harmful hemodynamic effects that may occur from continuous RV apex pacing may also be eliminated or reduced. An electrostimulation device that provides conventional ventricular pacing may be configured to deliver HBP. For example, pacing leads or electrodes used for RV pacing may be reconfigured and positioned at the His-bundle region to deliver HBP pulses. Some His-bundle stimulation devices are also capable of sensing cardiac activities, such as electrical activities at the His-bundle region. The detected His-bundle activity may represent His-bundle depolarization in response to an atrial sensed event (AS) (i.e., during a sinus rhythm) or an atrial paced event (AP), an evoked His-bundle response in response to HBP, or a far-field ventricular activity (e.g., a conducted R wave or a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) sensed at the His-bundle region). The His-bundle stimulation device may operate in a demand mode, and deliver HBP only as needed. For example, HBP may be delivered based on whether a His-bundle activity is detected within a predetermined time period following an atrial activity, such as an AP or AS event.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some patients receiving HBP therapy may have various degrees of heart block. In patients with intermittent heart block, a HBP system may be operated in a command-mode, where HBP pulses are delivered to restore synchronized ventricular activation only when heart block occurs. If there is no evidence of heart block, HBP may be inhibited. Such demand-mode HBP takes advantage of patient physiological conduction through the His-Purkinje system, and delivers pacing only as needed. The demand-mode HBP not only provides therapeutic benefits to the patient, but also improves device functionality such as conserving power of a HBP system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A challenge in the command-mode HBP is appropriately recognizing a valid inhibitory event indicative of an absence of heart block, such that HBP pulses may be safely inhibited without causing detriment to the patient. In some instances, the His-bundle activity detected at the His-bundle region may not represent a valid inhibitory event (e.g., a His-bundle depolarization or far-field ventricular depolarization including a conducted R wave or a PVC), but rather a far-field atrial activity. Because the electrodes for sensing His-bundle activity can be in close proximity to atrial myocardium, the His-bundle sensing channel may be interfered by atrial activation in the left or right atrium, also referred to as a far-field P-wave (FFPW). In some cases, the FFPW may be strong enough (e.g., a large signal amplitude) to exceed the sensing threshold of the His-bundle sensing channel, causing cross-channel over-sensing of the FFPW. The over-sensed FFPW may be misrecognized as a valid pacing-inhibitory event, causing the HBP therapy to be inappropriately inhibited. Loss of pacing therapy may potentially lead to critical consequences, particularly in patients with heart block and pacemaker dependent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For at least these reasons, the present inventors have recognized that there is an unmet need for an artificial pacing system that can more effectively detect and properly recognize the His-bundle activity, and deliver HBP therapy only as needed. Embodiments of the present subject matter provide systems, devices, and methods that improve command-mode HBP by distinguishing pacing-inhibitory events from far-field atrial activity. An exemplary medical system includes an electrostimulator to generate HBP pulses to stimulate a His bundle, and a cardiac event detector that may detect a His-bundle activity following an atrial activity. The cardiac event detector may use a cross-chamber blanking or an adjustable His-bundle sensing threshold to prevent over-sensing of far-field atrial activity and inappropriate inhibition of HBP therapy, the. A control circuit may program a demand-mode therapy to the electrostimulation circuit to deliver the HBP pulses if no His-bundle activity is detected within the time window, and withhold the HBP pulse if the His-bundle activity is detected within the time window.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Example 1 is a system for pacing a heart.

HBP may activate natural His-Purkinje system, thereby preserving ventricular synchrony and improving cardiac performance without structural and functional impairment to the heart. As discussed above, a recognized technological challenge in HBP, particularly the demand-mode HBP, is inappropriate inhibition of HBP due to over-sensing of atrial activity. Inappropriate HBP inhibition may be detrimental to pacemaker-dependent patients having heart block. The present document discusses various approaches to avoid or reduce inappropriate IMP inhibition, including an adjustable His-bundle sensitivity or a post-atrial cross-channel blanking to prevent FFPW over-sensing, or an event recognition circuit and method to distinguish a FFPW from a valid inhibitory event. With better HBP inhibition, the systems and methods discussed herein may improve HBP therapy efficacy with little to no additional cost or system complexity. The avoidance of cross-channel over-sensing of atrial activity; and improved recognition of FFPW, may allow for timely HBP therapy to meet patient needs. Additionally, improved recognition of valid pacing-inhibitory events may result in fewer unnecessary medical interventions, such as drugs; procedures, or device therapies, may be scheduled, prescribed, or provided to such patients. As a result, overall system cost savings may be realized.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The adjustable His-bundle sensing threshold and the recognition of FFPW and valid pacing-inhibitory events as discussed in this document may also improve the functionality of a cardiac pacing system or device. The adjustable sensing threshold expands the utility of the pacing device or system. For example, one pacing device may be configured to pace a ventricle, or to pace the His bundle. More efficient device memory usage may be achieved by storing information of clinical significance, such as the sensing thresholds and/or morphology templates for recognizing a valid inhibitory event or a FFPW. While the recognition of FFPW may prevent inappropriate inhibition of HBP therapy, the recognition of pacing-inhibitory events may help avoid unnecessary device therapies, thereby extending battery life and implantable device longevity. Additionally, device size may be reduced to achieve existing performance metrics.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">While His-bundle pacing is specifically discussed in this document, this is meant only by way of example and not limitation.

The cardiac event detector may use a cross-chamber blanking or an adjustable His-bundle sensing threshold to prevent over-sensing of far-field atrial activity and inappropriate inhibition of HBP therapy. The electrostimulation circuit may deliver command-mode HBP based on the detected presence or absence of the His-bundle activity. In some examples, the system may recognize the detected His-bundle activity as either a FFPW or a valid inhibitory event, and deliver or withhold HBP therapy based on the recognition of the His-bundle activity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an embodiment of a cardiac disease management system <b>100</b> and portions of an environment in which the system <b>100</b> may operate. The cardiac disease management system <b>100</b> may perform a range of activities, including remote patient monitoring, diagnosis of a disease condition, and providing a therapy to treat the disease condition and to improve patient outcome. In an example, the therapy may include His-bundle pacing (HBP). One or more of these activities may be performed proximal to a patient (e.g., in the patient's home or office), through a centralized server (e.g., in a hospital, clinic or physician's office), or through a remote workstation (e.g., a secure mobile computing device).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cardiac disease management system <b>100</b> may be coupled to a patient's heart <b>102</b>. The cardiac disease management system <b>100</b> includes an ambulatory medical device (AMID) and a lead system, configured to treat one or more cardiac diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia or heart failure. The AMD may be an implantable device subcutaneously implanted in a chest, abdomen, or other parts of the patient, a subcutaneous monitor or diagnostic device, or a wearable medical device such as a patch-based device or a smart wearable or accessory, among others. In the example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the AMD includes an implantable medical device (IMD) <b>104</b>. Examples of the IMD <b>104</b> may include a pacemaker, a pacemaker/defibrillator, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device, a cardiac remodeling control therapy device, a neuromodulator, a drug delivery device, a biological therapy device, or an implantable diagnostic device such as a cardiac monitor or a loop recorder, among other implantable devices.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lead system may include one or more transvenously, subcutaneously, or non-invasively placed leads or catheters. Each lead or catheter may include one or more electrodes. The arrangements and uses of the lead system and the associated electrodes may be determined by patient need and capability of the IMD <b>104</b>. The associated electrodes on the lead system may be positioned at the patient's thorax or abdomen to sense a physiological signal indicative of cardiac activity, or a physiological response to stimulation of a target tissue. The lead system may be surgically inserted into, or positioned on the surface of, a heart <b>102</b>. The electrodes associated with the lead system may be disposed in a target site in a right atrium (RA), a right ventricle (RV), a left atrium (LA), or a left ventricle (LV), or other body parts. Stimulation energy may be delivered to a target site via one or more of these electrodes. Some electrodes may be used for sensing cardiac activity, such as an intrinsic or evoked cardiac electrical activity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the illustrated example, the lead system may include a lead <b>106</b> having a proximal end <b>108</b> configured to be connected to the IMD <b>104</b>, and a distal end <b>110</b> that includes one or more electrodes configured to deliver stimulation energy, such as in a form of pacing pulses, to the His bundle <b>121</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates, by way of example and not limitation, two electrodes including a tip electrode <b>112</b>A and a ring electrode <b>112</b>B. Additional electrodes may be included in the lead <b>106</b> for sensing electrical activity or for delivering stimulation energy. The lead <b>106</b> may be placed such that one or more electrodes, such as <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B, are positioned in or on a His bundle <b>121</b>, a region distal to the blocked or slowly conducting AV node and in the AV septum, an interventricular septum region, or a right atrial region near the His-bundle <b>121</b>. As part of the natural electrical conduction system of the heart <b>102</b>, the His bundle <b>121</b> transmits the electrical impulses from the AV node <b>120</b> to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches via the left bundle branch <b>122</b> and the right bundle branch <b>123</b>. Each of the left and right branch bundles leads to the Purkinje fibers <b>124</b>, which provide electrical conduction to the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract. In some examples, the lead <b>106</b> may be placed such that one or more electrodes associated with the lead <b>106</b>, such as <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B, are positioned at or near other parts of the natural conduction pathways, such as one of the bundle branches <b>122</b> or <b>123</b>, the Purkinje fibers <b>124</b>, or other conductive tissue, in addition to or in lieu of a region at or near the His bundle <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example, the lead <b>106</b> may be a single pass lead having a plurality electrodes for stimulating multiple cardiac sites, including electrodes disposed at or near the His bundle (e.g., the electrodes <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B) and electrodes disposed in one or more of RA, RV, LA, or LV of the heart <b>102</b>. In some examples, in addition to the lead <b>106</b>, the lead system may include separate leads for placement in different heart chambers or sites, such as an RA lead having one or more RA electrodes to stimulate a portion of RA or to sense RA electrical activity, a RV lead having one or more RV electrodes to stimulate a portion of RV or to sense RV electrical activity, or an LV lead having one or more LV electrodes to stimulate a portion of LV or to sense LV activity. In various examples, the cardiac disease management system <b>100</b> may include one or more leadless stimulators/sensors untethered to a lead and in wireless communication with the IMD <b>104</b>. The leadless stimulators/sensors may deliver electrostimulation, sense a physiological signal, such as cardiac electrical signals in response to cardiac stimulation, and transmit the sensed data to the IMD <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The IMD <b>104</b> may include a hermetically sealed housing <b>116</b> that houses one or more of an electrostimulation circuit, a sensing circuit, a control circuit, a communication circuit, and a battery, among other components. In an example, the IMD <b>104</b> includes a His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> configured to generate His-bundle pacing (HBP) pulses to stimulate the His bundle <b>121</b>, such as via the lead <b>106</b> and the associated electrodes <b>112</b>A or <b>112</b>B. The His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may be programmed to deliver unipolar His-bundle pacing, where the pacing energy (current or voltage) is applied between one of the electrodes <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B (e.g., as a cathode) and the housing <b>116</b> (e.g., as an anode). Alternatively, the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may be programmed to deliver bipolar His-bundle pacing, where the pacing energy (current or voltage) is applied between two electrodes positioned at or near the His bundle, such as between the electrodes <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B. In some examples, electrodes used for unipolar or bipolar His-bundle pacing may be selected by a system user from a plurality of candidate electrodes from one or more leads of the lead system, and programmed into the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b>. In some examples, HBP pulses may be provide by a leadless device, such as a leadless cardiac pacemakers (LCP). One or more electrodes may be distributed on the body of the LCP and in contact with His-bundle region to deliver the HBP pulses.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may sense a physiological signal using one or more electrodes associated with the lead system or a physiological sensor. Examples of the physiological signal may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), an intracardiac electrogram (EGM) such as an atrial EGM, a ventricular EGM, or a His bundle EGM, an thoracic impedance signal, a cardiac impedance signal, an arterial pressure signal, a pulmonary artery pressure signal, a left atrial pressure signal, an RV pressure signal, an LV coronary pressure signal, a coronary blood temperature signal, a blood oxygen saturation signal, a heart sound signal, an intracardiac acceleration signal, a respiration signal, or a physical activity or exertion level signal, among others. In an example, the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may sense an atrial activity using one or more electrodes or physiologic sensors. The atrial activity may represent an intrinsic atrial electrical activity such as an atrial sensed event (AS) during a sinus rhythm, or an atrial paced event (AP). In an example, the sensed atrial activity may include an intra-atrial EGM sensed via an electrode positioned within or on the epicardial surface of the left or right atrium, such as an atrial electrode <b>111</b> associated with the lead <b>106</b> and positioned in the RA. The intra-atrial EGM may alternatively be sensed using an electrode on a dedicated atrial lead, such as an RA lead or an LA lead, as discussed above. In another example, the atrial activity may be detected from a surface ECG. For example, intrinsic atrial activity may be represented by P-waves on an ECG signal, and paced atrial activity may be detected using atrial pacing artifacts on an ECG signal. In various examples, atrial activities may include sensor signals indicative of atrial mechanical contraction. Examples of atrial mechanical signal may include impedance signal, heart sounds signal, or cardiac pressure signals, among others.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may sense a physiologic signal from the His-bundle region, and detect a His-bundle activity from the sensed physiologic signal. In an example, the physiologic signal may include a His-bundle EGM that may be sensed using one or more of the electrodes <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B, or other sensing electrodes separated from <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B. The His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may detect the His-bundle activity within a specified, such as a predetermined, time period following an atrial activity, such as an AS or an AP event. Detection may be based on a comparison between signal strength of the His-bundle activity and a His-bundle sensing threshold. The detected His-bundle activity may represent His-bundle depolarization in response to the intrinsic or paced atrial depolarization, an evoked His-bundle response in response to HBP at the His-bundle region, or a far-field ventricular activity such as a conducted R wave or a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) sensed at the His-bundle region. In some cases, the detected His-bundle activity may represent far-field atrial activity, such as a FFPW. This may occur when the His-bundle sensing electrodes (e.g., <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B or other dedicated His-bundle sensing electrodes) are in close proximity to atrial myocardium.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may deliver demand-mode HBP based on a presence or absence of the His-bundle activity within the time period following an atrial activity. In an example, HBP pulses are delivered, such as via the electrodes <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B, if no His-bundle activity is detected within the specific time period. HBP pulses are inhibited if a His-bundle activity is detected within the specific time period. To avoid or reduce inappropriate HBP inhibition such as caused by over-sensing of non-inhibitory events such as FFPW, the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may adjust the His-bundle sensitivity, or apply a cross-channel blanking period, to detect a His-bundle activity. Alternatively or additionally, the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b> may distinguish a FFPW from a valid inhibitory event, and inhibit HBP therapy only in the presence of a valid inhibitory event but not a FFPW. Examples of His-bundle activity detection and HBP inhibition are discussed below, such as with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The IMD <b>104</b> may be communicate with an external system <b>140</b> via a communication link <b>130</b>. The external system <b>140</b> may include a dedicated hardware/software system such as a programmer, a remote server-based patient management system, or alternatively a system defined predominantly by software running on a standard personal computer. The external system <b>140</b> may include a proximal external device such as a programmer device in proximity of the IMD <b>104</b>. A clinician may manage the patient <b>102</b> through the IMD <b>104</b> via the communication link <b>130</b>. This may include, for example, programming the IMD <b>104</b> to sense physiological signals, analyzing the physiological signals to detect a medical condition such as heart failure, assessing therapy efficacy, performing a self-diagnostic test, or initiating or adjusting a therapy such as HBP. Additionally, the external system <b>140</b> may receive device data from the IMD <b>104</b> via the communication link <b>130</b>. Examples of the device data may include real-time or stored physiological signals collected from the patient <b>102</b>, physiological response to therapies delivered to the patient <b>102</b>, or device operational status of the IMD <b>104</b> (e.g., battery status and lead impedance). The communication link <b>130</b> may be an inductive telemetry link, a capacitive telemetry link, or a radio-frequency (RF) telemetry link, or wireless telemetry based on, for example, &#x201c;strong&#x201d; Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11 wireless fidelity &#x201c;WiFi&#x201d; interfacing standards. Other configurations and combinations of patient data source interfacing are possible.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The external system <b>140</b> may monitor patient condition and the function of IMD <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, the external system <b>140</b> may include a user interface to display received information to the user, and receive user input for operation control of the IMD <b>104</b>. In an example, the external system <b>140</b> may allow a user to control the His-bundle activity detection and recognition, and program the IMD <b>104</b>, such as to configure a pacing vector (e.g., specifying anode and cathode electrodes) to deliver HBP, or to configure a sense vector to sense a physiological signal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The external system <b>140</b> may include a remote device in a location relatively distant from the IMD <b>104</b> and in communication with the proximal external device via a telecommunication network. The remote device can evaluate collected patient data and provide alert notifications, among other possible functions. In an example, the remote device may include a centralized server acting as a central hub for collected patient data storage and analysis. The server may be configured as a uni-, multi- or distributed computing and processing system. The server may include an alert analyzer circuit to evaluate the collected patient data to determine if specific alert condition is satisfied. Satisfaction of the alert condition may trigger a generation of alert notifications. In some examples, the alert conditions alternatively or additionally may be evaluated by the IMD <b>104</b>. By way of example, alert notifications may include a Web page update, phone or pager call, E-mail, SMS, text or &#x201c;Instant&#x201d; message, as well as a message to the patient and a simultaneous direct notification to emergency services and to the clinician. Other alert notifications are possible. In various examples, the remote device may additionally include one or more locally configured clients or remote clients securely connected over the telecommunication network to the server. Examples of the clients may include personal desktops, notebook computers, mobile devices, or other computing devices. System users, such as clinicians or other qualified medical specialists, may use the clients to securely access stored patient data assembled in the database in the server, and to select and prioritize patients and alerts for health care provisioning.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The external system <b>140</b> may output the detected medical events or therapy efficacy information (e.g. HBP delivery or HBP inhibition) to a system user such as the patient or a clinician, or to a process including, for example, an instance of a computer program executable in a microprocessor. In an example, the process may include an automated generation of recommendations for initiating or titrating a medical therapy or an electrostimulation therapy. In an example, the external device <b>120</b> or the remote device <b>124</b> may include a respective display unit for displaying the physiological signals, stimulation parameters, His-bundle activity detection and recognition information (e.g., His-bundle sensing thresholds and recognition of the His-bundle activity as a valid inhibitory event or a FFPW), among other intermediate analyses and computations. Alerts, alarms, emergency calls, or other forms of warnings to signal the detected medical event may also be generated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Portions of the IMD <b>104</b> or the external system <b>140</b> may be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof. Portions of the IMD <b>104</b> or the external system <b>140</b> may be implemented using an application-specific circuit that may be constructed or configured to perform one or more particular functions, or may be implemented using a general-purpose circuit that may be programmed or otherwise configured to perform one or more particular functions. Such a general-purpose circuit may include a microprocessor or a portion thereof, a microcontroller or a portion thereof, or a programmable logic circuit, a memory circuit, a network interface, and various components for interconnecting these components. For example, a &#x201c;comparator&#x201d; may include, among other things, an electronic circuit comparator that may be constructed to perform the specific function of a comparison between two signals or the comparator may be implemented as a portion of a general-purpose circuit that may be driven by a code instructing a portion of the general-purpose circuit to perform a comparison between the two signals.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of portions of a His-bundle pacing system <b>200</b>. The His-bundle pacing system <b>200</b> represents an embodiment of the His-bundle pacing system <b>118</b>, and may include one or more of an electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b>, a cardiac event detector <b>220</b>, a control circuit <b>230</b>, and a user interface <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may be configured to generate stimulation energy for delivery to the heart <b>102</b>, such as via one or more leads and the associated electrodes. The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may be configured to generate His-bundle pacing (HBP) pulses for delivery to a target pacing site at or near the His bundle such as via the lead <b>106</b> and one or more of the electrodes <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B. The target site may include an interventricular septum region or a right atrial region near the His-bundle, or other conductive tissue such as right or left bundle branches or fascicles, or Purkinje fibers. In an example, the HBP pulses may be delivered in multiple cardiac cycles, such that at least one pulse is delivered within each of the multiple cardiac cycles. In various examples, the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may additionally generate electrostimulation to stimulate non-cardiac tissue, such as nerve tissue, muscle tissue, or other excitable tissue.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may generate HBP pulses according to one or more stimulation parameters, such as provided by control circuit <b>230</b>. Examples of the stimulation parameters may include information about stimulation site, stimulation strength, stimulation mode, or stimulation timing, among other parameters. Stimulation site includes information about pacing site, pacing vector configuration (e.g., anode and cathode electrodes), unipolar or bipolar pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), BiV pacing, or synchronized left ventricle (LV)-only pacing, single site pacing of only one site of a heart chamber (e.g., the left ventricle), or multisite pacing (MSP) of two or more sites of a heart chamber within the same cardiac cycle, among others. Stimulation strength parameters determine the amount of energy delivered to the pacing site, and may include pulse amplitude, pulse width, pulse frequency, pulse waveform, duty cycle, or stimulation duration.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Stimulation mode includes, by way of example and not limitation, an atrial-Hisian (AH) pacing mode, a His-ventricular (HV) pacing mode, or an atrial-His-ventricular (AHV) pacing mode. In the AH pacing mode, the HBP pulses may be delivered only when intrinsic atrial activation (AS), or atrial pacing (AP), fails to produce propagatable depolarization of the AV node and the His bundle. The AH pacing mode may be suitable for patients with varying degrees of heart block or sick sinus syndrome. The HV pacing mode involves sequential pacing of the His bundle and the ventricle. The ventricular pacing may be provided in a demand mode, such that the ventricular pacing pulses are delivered only when the His pacing fails to produce propagatable depolarization of the ventricles. The HV pacing mode may be indicated for patients with persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation, or patients treated with atrioventricular node ablation to slow and regularize ventricular rhythm. The AHV pacing mode involves sequential atrial, Hisian, and ventricular pacing. One or more of the His-bundle pacing or the ventricular pacing may be delivered in a demand mode. The AHV pacing mode may be indicated for patients with cardiac dyssynchrony and having received cardiac resynchronization therapy, patients suffering from heart failure with left bundle branch block, heart failure induced by right ventricular pacing, long PR intervals with hemodynamic compromise, or pacemaker induced cardiomyopathy from conventional dual-chamber pacing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Stimulation timing parameters determine the timing and sequence of pacing pulses. For example, in demand AH pacing mode, the HBP pulses are timed relative to an AS or an AP event. An AH timing represents a latency period, within a cardiac cycle, from an intrinsic AS event or an AP event to the delivery of a HBP pulse. In demand HV pacing mode, the ventricular pacing pulses are timed relative to a His pacing event. An HV timing represents a latency period, within a cardiac cycle, from a His bundle event (e.g., a HBP pulse) to the delivery of ventricular pacing pulse. In an example, if the HBP pulse fails to induce ventricular depolarization, a backup ventricular pacing may be delivered at the end of the HV timing. The stimulation timing parameters may additionally include parameters associated with CRT or MSP therapy, such as atrial-ventricular delay (AVD) representing a latency period from an AS or AP event to ventricular pacing, an RV-LV interventricular pacing delay (VVD) representing a time delay between ventricular pacing at the left and right ventricles, or intra-ventricular pacing delay representing a time delay between pacing at multiple site of a ventricle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may be configured to provide selective pacing at a site with only a targeted tissue being directly excited, without substantial unintended and undesirable excitation of other non-targeted tissue. If the pacing directly causes intended excitation of the targeted tissue as well as unintended excitation of other non-targeted tissue, a non-selective pacing results. In the context of HBP, selective HBP causes only the excitation (depolarization) of the His bundle, without direct excitation of para-Hisian myocardium adjacent to the His bundle. Non-selective HBP directly causes excitation of both the His bundle and the para-Hisian myocardium. If the HBP pulses cause only excitation of the para-Hisian myocardium or other un-intended cardiac tissue, without direct excitation of the His-bundle fibers, then a para-Hisian pacing results. If no tissue excitation is induced by HBP (e.g., neither the para-Hisian myocardium capture nor the His-bundle capture), then a loss of capture (LOC) results.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may be capable of generating backup pacing pulses for delivery to the heart to excite the myocardium and prevent asystole. The backup pacing pulses may be delivered when a loss of capture is produced, or alternatively when para-Hisian capture is produced. The backup pacing may be delivered to a target ventricular site via a lead with associated electrodes disposed in or on a ventricle, such as a right ventricle. Additionally or alternatively, the backup pacing may be delivered to the His bundle, such as the site for delivering HBP pulses, via the same His-bundle pacing lead with associated electrodes. In an example, the backup pacing may include high-output pacing (HOP) pulses with higher pacing energy than conventional pacing pulses. The HOP pulse may be a biphasic or multiphasic waveform. In an example, the HOP pulse may have a peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of 5-8 volts, and a pulse duration of 50-70 milliseconds (msec). With higher amount of energy delivered to the myocardium, the HOP pulse may increase myocardial contractility and improve systolic function. However, chronic HOP pacing may overstress the heart and potentially be hazardous in some heart failure patients. According, in some examples, the HOP pulses may be delivered on an intermittent basis, such that the conventional pacing pulses are delivered in 3-5 cardiac cycles between the HOP pulses. In an example, the HOP pulses may be delivered when one or more physiologic sensors sense a deterioration in cardiac hemodynamics, in addition to the indication of loss of capture of para-Hisian capture. Arcot-Krishnamurthy et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8,588,907, entitled &#x201c;CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL OF INTERMITTENT EXCITATORY CARDIAC STIMULATION FOR THERAPEUTIC EFFECT,&#x201d; refers to high-output pacing that is excitatory and of sufficient energy to augment myocardial contractility, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may be coupled to one or more electrodes or physiologic sensors to sense a physiologic signal at the His-bundle region. Examples of the sensed signals may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), an electrogram (EGM) of a portion of the heart such as atrial EGM, ventricular EGM, or evoked His potential, an impedance signal, a heart sound signal, or a pressure signal, among other physiological or hemodynamic signals. The physiologic signal may represent a cardiac response, at the His-bundle region, to intrinsic atrial activation during normal sinus rhythm (AS) or to atrial pacing (AP), or an evoked response to the delivery of HBP. The physiologic signal may also represent far-field ventricular activity such as a conducted R wave or a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) sensed at the His-bundle region, or far-field atrial activity, such as a FFPW.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The sensing circuit <b>220</b> may include one or more of a sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> and a cross-channel blanking circuit <b>222</b>, each of which may prevent or reduce cross-channel over-sensing of FFPW at the His-bundle sensing channel, thus reducing the chances of inappropriately triggering HBP inhibition. The sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> may adjust a sensitivity level, such as an event-sensing threshold. The His-bundle activity detector <b>225</b> may detect a His-bundle activity from the sensed physiologic signal using the adjusted sensitivity level. In an example, the sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> may adjust the sensitivity level using a feedback mechanism, such as based on a characteristic of previously detected His-bundle activity by the His-bundle activity detector <b>225</b>. As to be discussed in the following with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the His-bundle activity detector <b>225</b> may recognize the detected His-bundle activity as a valid inhibitory event, or as a FFPW. To prevent over-sensing of FFPW, the sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> may adjust the sensitivity level based on the signal strength (e.g., amplitude) of the valid inhibitory event and/or the signal strength (e.g., amplitude) of the FFPW. In an example, the sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> may raise the event detection threshold to be greater than the amplitude of the FFPW, or a representative FFPW amplitude such as a central tendency of amplitudes of multiple FFPWs. Examples of His-bundle sensing using an adjustable sensitivity to avoid FFPW are discussed below, such as with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various examples, the sensitivity adjuster circuit <b>221</b> may adjust the sensitivity by selecting a sensitivity level from a plurality of predetermined distinct sensitivity levels. Each sensitivity level corresponds to a sensing mode. In an example, the cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may selectively operate in a first or a second sensing mode to detect a cardiac event. The first and second sensing modes may have different sensitivity levels, sensing electrode configurations (e.g., sensing vectors), or other sensing parameters. The second sensing mode may have a lower sensitivity, such as a higher detection threshold, than the first sensing mode. Because in some patients the FFPW sensed at the His-bundle sensing channel may have prominent amplitude, the cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may use the second sensing mode to sense the His-bundle electrical signal, and use the first sensing mode to sense a ventricular electrical signal. The less sensitive second sensing mode may help prevent over-sensing of FFPW, thereby avoiding inappropriate HBP inhibition. In an example, the second sensing mode corresponds to a detection threshold with a predetermined fixed threshold, such as approximately 10 millivolt in one example. Alternatively, the detection threshold of the second sensing mode may be determined based on previously detected FFPWs, as discussed above. In some examples, the first sensing mode includes a time-varying sensing threshold (e.g., the sensing threshold decays with time), and the second sensing mode includes a time-invariant sensing threshold. The time-invariant sensing threshold may be less sensitive than the time-varying sensing threshold in detecting a cardiac event.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may automatically switch between the first and second sensing modes, such as in response to a trigger event. In an example, the cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may switch to the second sensing mode (with a higher sensitivity) in response to an indication of HBP. By way of example, the indication of HBP may include an indication of placing a sensing electrode at the His bundle region. In another example, the cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may switch to the second sensing mode in response to a delivery of HBP pulses. In yet another example, the switching between the first and second sensing modes may be triggered by a user command.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The cross-channel blanking circuit <b>222</b> may apply a blanking period to the His-bundle sensing channel, such that the cardiac event detector <b>220</b> will be temporarily suppressed from sensing the physiologic signal (e.g., an EGM) from the His-bundle region during the blanking period. The blanking period is generally designed to avoid inference from certain intrinsic or artificially generated (e.g., paced) signal artifacts. In particular, the cross-channel blanking circuit <b>222</b> is instituted to promote appropriate sensing of His-bundle activities that represent a valid inhibitory event (e.g., His-bundle depolarization in response to AS or AP, or a far-field ventricular depolarization or PVC, etc.), and to prevent over-sensing of FFPW.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The cross-channel blanking, hereinafter referred to as post-atrial His-bundle channel blanking (PAHB), may be initiated by an AS or AP event. The cardiac event detector <b>220</b> may sense the AS or AP event such as by using electrode <b>111</b> on the lead <b>106</b>, or atrial electrodes associated with an atrial lead. Alternatively, the atrial activation signal may indicate atrial mechanical activity, which may be sensed using a physiologic sensor. The PAHB has a duration sufficiently long to cover the FFPW. The PAHB may have a fixed duration, such approximately 50-70 msec in an example. Alternatively, the PAHB duration may be determined based on patient FFPW timing information gleaned from the patient electrophysiological data, such as time intervals between an AS or AP event sensed at an atrium and a corresponding FFPW sensed at the His-bundle region. In some examples, the PAHB duration may be determined further using timing information of the valid inhibitory events, such as time interval between an AS or AP event and a valid inhibitory event. For example, because the His-bundle sensing electrodes are in closer proximity to right atrium than to left and right ventricles, FFPW may precede far-field ventricular depolarization in time. FFPW may also precede conducted His-bundle depolarization in response to AS or AP in time. The cross-channel blanking circuit <b>222</b> may apply a PAHB having a duration that ends in time between FFPW and a valid inhibitory event. Such a PAHB period is advantageous as it offer greater potential of avoiding not only the cross-channel over-sensing of FFPW but also under-sensing of a valid inhibitory event.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As an alternative to fixed PAHB duration, in some examples, a smart blanking may be instituted. The smart blanking combines a PAHB (which may have a shorter duration than the fixed PAHB period) and an automatic adjustment of His-bundle sensitivity, such as a sensing threshold. Distinct PAHB durations may be applied in accordance with the AS or AP event that triggers the blanking. For example, a first PAHB duration may be initiated by an AS event, and a second PAHB duration, longer than the first PAHB duration, may be initiated by an AP event. In an example, the first duration is approximately 15-20 msec, and the second duration is approximately 35-40 msec. The adjustable His-bundle sensing threshold following the PAHB period may reduce the possibility of under-sensing of a valid inhibitory event, such that HBP may be appropriately inhibited when valid inhibitory events are detected.

If no His-bundle activity is detected within the AH window, then at <b>540</b> a HBP therapy is delivered to a target site, such as upon expiration of the AH window. The target site may include a region at or near the His bundle <b>121</b>, such as a region distal to the blocked or slowly conducting AV node and in the AV septum, an interventricular septum region, or a right atrial region near the His-bundle <b>121</b>. The HBP pulse may be generated by the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b>, according to programmed stimulation parameters. Examples of the stimulation parameters may include stimulation site, stimulation mode, stimulation timing, or stimulation strength, among other parameters. The stimulation strength parameters determine the amount of energy delivered to the pacing site, and may include pulse amplitude, pulse width, pulse frequency, pulse waveform, duty cycle, or stimulation duration. In an example, the HBP pulses may be programmed with different stimulation strength values, such as pulse amplitudes. In an example, HBP pulses may be delivered in multiple cardiac cycles, such that at least one pulse is delivered within each of the multiple cardiac cycles.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating generally a method <b>600</b> for providing His-bundle pacing to a patient using FFPW characteristics. The method <b>600</b> represents a variant of the method <b>500</b>, and may be implemented in and executed by the IMD <b>104</b> or the His-bundle pacing system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The method <b>600</b> includes steps of sensing an atrial activity at <b>510</b>, and detecting a presence or absence of a His-bundle within an AH window at <b>520</b>, similar to the method <b>500</b> as discussed above. If the His-bundle activity is determined to be present at <b>530</b>, then the detected His-bundle activity may be recognized as either a valid inhibitory event or a FFPW, such as by using the His-bundle activity recognizer circuit <b>326</b>. The recognition may be based on timing, morphology, or frequency or spectral components of the detected His-bundle activity, as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. If the sensed His-bundle activity is recognized as a valid inhibitory event, such as a conducted His-bundle response, a far-field conducted R-wave, or a premature ventricular contraction, then HBP therapy may be withheld at <b>650</b>. If the sensed His-bundle activity is recognized as a FFPW, the HBP therapy may be delivered at <b>540</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At <b>660</b>, one or more His-bundle sensing parameters may be adjusted using the recognized FFPW, such as to update one or more of the His-bundle sensitivity or the cross-channel blanking (e.g., PAM period). In an example, the His-bundle sensitivity, such as a His-bundle sensing threshold, may be adjusted based on a signal strength (e.g., amplitude) of the recognized FFPW. For example, the His-bundle sensing threshold may be increased to a level of approximately a central tendency of the amplitudes of the recognized FFPWs, plus a specific margin. In another example, the PAHB period may be adjusted based on the timing of the recognized FFPW. For example, the PAHB period may be increased to a level of a central tendency of the time intervals between the AS or AP event to the FFPWs, plus a specific margin. Because in some instances the FFPW may precede a valid inhibitory event in time, the PAHB period may be determined such that the blanking period ends after the FFPW but before the valid inhibitory event. Such a PAHB period is advantageous as it may not only avoid or reduce cross-channel over-sensing of FFPW, but may avoid or reduce under-sensing of a valid inhibitory event as well. The adjusted His-bundle sensing parameters may be used to detect subsequent His-bundle activity at <b>520</b>. In some examples, His-bundle sensitivity or the cross-channel blanking may be adjusted when FFPWs are consistently detected.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some examples, His-bundle sensing parameters, such as the sensitivity level, may be adjusted using information about whether the patient is in a cardiac arrhythmia, such as detected by the arrhythmia detector circuit <b>327</b>. In an example, a more sensitive His-bundle sensing mode (e.g., a lower sensing threshold) may be used to sense the His-bundle activity in the presence of an atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. A higher sensitivity may help detect arrhythmias, and prevent hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening events. Similarly, in the presence of an atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia, a shorter PAHB period may facilitate arrhythmia detection at the His-bundle region. Upon arrhythmia termination, the His-bundle sensing threshold, or the PAHB period, may be increased to their respective pre-arrhythmia levels. In some examples, HBP therapy may be inhibited during the detected cardiac arrhythmia.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Various embodiments are illustrated in the figures above.
