In other words, a band resource of a user is allocated by resource unit instead of channel. For example, a 20 MHz channel may include a plurality of RUs, which may be a 26-tone RU, a 52-tone RU, and a 106-tone RU. Tone indicates a quantity of subcarriers. In addition, the RU may also be a 242-tone RU, a 484-tone RU, a 996-tone RU, or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Preamble puncture (preamble puncture) may also be referred to as preamble puncturing. For example, if a part of 20 MHz channels in an entire bandwidth is null, it may be understood as that there is a 20 MHz puncture hole in the entire bandwidth. For OFDMA transmission, discrete resources caused by puncturing may be allocated to different stations. For non-OFDMA transmission such as OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transmission, if preamble puncturing is used, remaining resources that are not punctured also form a plurality of RUs, which are aggregated as a whole and allocated to one station (station, STA) or one group of stations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, how to indicate the plurality of RUs for data transmission becomes an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of this application provide a data transmission method, a data transmission device, a chip system, and a computer-readable storage medium, to transmit a data packet based on preamble puncturing information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, this application discloses a data transmission method. In the method, a station may receive preamble puncturing indication information, and send or receive a data packet based on the preamble puncturing indication information. The preamble puncturing indication information includes one or more indicators, one indicator corresponds to one piece of preamble puncturing information, and the preamble puncturing information includes a size and location of preamble puncturing, or there is no preamble puncturing. The indicator may be an index corresponding to the preamble puncturing indication information, to learn of a status of preamble puncturing of the data packet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It can be learned that in this application, the station obtains the status of preamble puncturing of the data packet based on the preamble puncturing indication information, to learn of an allocated multiple resource unit. Compared with a current manner of directly indicating a multiple resource unit, the manner of indicating the status of preamble puncturing in this application can reduce signaling overheads.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an optional implementation, sending or receiving the data packet based on the preamble puncturing indication information includes: if the preamble puncturing indication information indicates that there is no preamble puncturing, sending or receiving the data packet in a bandwidth of the data packet; or if the preamble puncturing indication information indicates a size and location of preamble puncturing, sending or receiving the data packet on a resource unit in bandwidth of the data packet other than the size and the location of preamble puncturing. It can be learned that when there is preamble puncturing in the data packet, the manner of indicating the size and location of preamble puncturing can reduce indication signaling overheads compared with a manner of directly indicating discrete resource units obtained through preamble puncturing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For the preamble puncturing indication information, this application further provides several optional indication manners to indicate the preamble puncturing information. Descriptions are separately provided below.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an optional implementation, the preamble puncturing indication information includes one or more indicators, and one indicator corresponds to one piece of preamble puncturing information, or one indicator corresponds to an index of a status of preamble puncturing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an optional implementation, the indicator indicates one or more pieces of the following preamble puncturing information in a 160 MHz channel:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a 20 MHz subchannel in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by any two 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a 60 MHz subchannel formed by any three 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">an 80 MHz subchannel formed by any four 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel; or</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">there is no preamble puncturing in the 160 MHz channel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another optional implementation, the indicator indicates one or more pieces of the following preamble puncturing information in the 160 MHz channel:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a 20 MHz subchannel in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by any two adjacent 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a 60 MHz subchannel formed by any three adjacent 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">an 80 MHz subchannel formed by any four adjacent 20 MHz subchannels in the 160 MHz channel; or</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">there is no preamble puncturing in the 160 MHz channel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another optional implementation, the 160 MHz channel includes a highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel and a lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel, and the indicator indicates one or more pieces of the following preamble puncturing information in the 160 MHz channel:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">a 20 MHz subchannel in the 160 MHz channel;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by two lowest frequency 20 MHz subchannels in the lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by two highest frequency 20 MHz subchannels in the lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by two lowest frequency 20 MHz subchannels in the highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">a 40 MHz subchannel formed by two highest frequency 20 MHz subchannels in the highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">a lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">a highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel; or</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">there is no preamble puncturing in the 160 MHz channel. In this implementation, the size and location of preamble puncturing may correspond to a resource unit obtained through channel division, so that the allocated resource unit is determined based on the preamble puncturing indication information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The 160 MHz channel includes the highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel and the lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel. Optionally, the indicator may further indicate that the following preamble puncturing information or another index is reserved: a middle frequency 40 MHz subchannel in the highest frequency 80 MHz subchannel, or a middle frequency 40 MHz subchannel in the lowest frequency 80 MHz subchannel. It can be learned that this implementation supports a case in which a same index corresponds to different meanings, so that different index tables may be used based on different cases, for example, different locations of bandwidths or indicators in the preamble puncturing indication information. This reduces a quantity of required indexes, that is, reduces a quantity of bits for indication.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, the indicator indicates indexes respectively corresponding to the one or more pieces of preamble puncturing information in the 160 MHz channel. This helps the station determine the status of preamble puncturing of the data packet based on the preamble puncturing indication information.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bandwidth of the data packet is 320 MHz. The preamble puncturing indication information includes a first indicator and a second indicator.

The transmission mode indication information indicates a transmission mode of a data packet. For example, a station may determine, based on the transmission mode indication information, whether the data packet is transmitted in an OFDMA mode or a non-OFDMA mode. For non-OFDMA transmission, a plurality of discrete resource units caused by preamble puncturing are uniformly allocated to one user or one group of users. To be specific, a same quantity of resource units are usually allocated to each user. Therefore, compared with a manner in which the resource unit allocation subfield indicates the plurality of discrete resource units, the preamble puncturing indication information is used in this application. This can reduce signaling overheads for resource unit indication. For OFDMA transmission, a plurality of discrete resource units caused by preamble puncturing are allocated to different users. In other words, a resource unit allocated to a user is a part of these discrete resource units. In this case, the resource unit allocation subfield is used for indication, and low signaling overheads are needed.

In addition, for non-OFDMA transmission, content of preamble puncturing indication information in the M user fields of the per-station field may be the same.

The preamble puncturing indication information may also be referred to as a preamble puncturing indication subfield. The bandwidth of the data packet may also be in the U-SIG. For non-OFDMA transmission, content of the preamble puncturing indication subfields corresponding to the M user fields may be the same. An order in which user fields in a user-specific field appear is consistent with preamble puncturing information indicated by corresponding preamble puncturing indication subfields. The station may identify, by reading a station identifier (STA ID) in a user field, whether the user field belongs to the station. With reference to a location at which the user field appears and the corresponding preamble puncturing indication subfield, the station may learn preamble puncturing information of the station.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">For effective resource reuse, in a case of a bandwidth greater than or equal to 40 MHz, a manner of content channel (content channel, CC) 1 or CC2 may be used to represent content in an EHT-SIG or a field of a future-generation Wi-Fi standard. For example, when the bandwidth of the data packet is 40 MHz, there are two EHT-SIG content channels: a CC1 and a CC2. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a first EHT-SIG CC1 may include a first indicator in preamble puncturing indication information and a corresponding user field, and a second EHT-SIG CC2 includes a second indicator in the preamble puncturing indication information and a corresponding user field.

In OFDMA transmission, discrete resource units obtained after preamble puncturing need to be allocated to a plurality of different stations. Therefore, a resource unit allocation subfield in a trigger frame or a signaling field needs to be used to indicate a possible resource unit aggregation. As shown in Table 9, resource units corresponding to index numbers 0 to 67 are single resource unit, and resource units corresponding to index numbers 68 to 130 are a combination or integration of a plurality of resource units. It can be learned that for OFDMA transmission, the resource unit allocation subfield may indicate these indexes, to notify each station of a resource unit allocated to the station.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0309">In Table 9, corresponding to indexes 72 to 79, on a 20 MHz subchannel in an 80 MHz band range, in a combination solution of a 52-tone RU and a same-side adjacent 26-tone RU on the 20 MHz subchannel, &#x201c;same-side adjacent&#x201d; is related to a location of the 20 MHz subchannel in the 80 MHz band range.
