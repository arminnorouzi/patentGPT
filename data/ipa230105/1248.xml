The terminology used herein is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure generally relates to a fire sprinkler. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a fire sprinkler that includes a ridged sealing component that can provide one or more fluid seals within the fire sprinkler. Fire protection systems include sprinklers that can inhibit or permit flow of fluid (typically water, but also in some applications fire suppressant fluid) depending upon conditions. In the instance of a fire or detected conditions that may be indicative of a fire (e.g., increased heat, smoke, etc.), the sprinklers can permit the flow of fluid such that the fluid may contact a deflector and be dispersed so as to provide exposure protection to a window and/or wall. The sprinklers may disperse water or fire protection fluid over a specific area, for example a portion of a room or hallway, or a window or wall. In order to accomplish fire exposure protection for a given area (e.g., room, hallway, window, wall, etc.), sprinklers can include components that permit flow of fire protection fluid in response to activation of one or more fire sprinklers. For example, a fire sprinkler may include one or more components that provide a fluid seal, thus preventing passage of fire protection fluid when the fire sprinkler is in an inactivated state. However, these components may permit passage of fire protection fluid upon activation of the fire sprinkler, thus providing fire protection fluid to the given area.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Fire protection fluid can be supplied to a fire sprinkler via a fluid supply and/or a network of piping. A seal can be provided within the fire sprinkler so as to retain the fire protection fluid within the fluid supply and/or piping until the fire sprinkler is activated. The fire protection fluid can be stored in the fluid supply and/or piping in a pressurized state such that the fire protection will exit the fire sprinkler upon activation at a flow velocity and volumetric flow rate sufficient to provide fire protection or suppression for a desired area. One or more seals disposed within the fire sprinkler can provide a seal that retains the pressurized fire protection fluid. In various applications, the fire protection fluid may be stored at different pressures and, accordingly, the seals of the fire sprinkler can accommodate the pressurized fluid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a fire suppression system <b>100</b>. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can be a chemical fire suppression system. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can distribute a fire suppressant agent onto or nearby a fire, extinguishing the fire and preventing the fire from spreading. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can be used alone or in combination with other types of fire suppression systems (e.g., a building sprinkler system, a handheld fire extinguisher). Multiple fire suppression systems <b>100</b> can be used in combination with one another to cover a larger area (e.g., each in different rooms of a building).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can be used in a variety of applications. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can be used with a variety of fire suppressant agents, including but not limited to water (e.g., may use powders, liquids, foams, or other fluid or flowable materials).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can include or be coupled with a fluid supply <b>114</b>. The fluid supply <b>114</b> can define an internal volume filled (e.g., partially filled, completely filled) with fire suppressant agent. The fluid supply <b>114</b> can provide fluid from a remote location to a building in which the fire suppression system <b>100</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Piping <b>140</b> (e.g., one or more pipes, tubes, conduits) can be fluidly coupled with one or more sprinklers <b>142</b>. The sprinklers <b>142</b> can receive water or other fire suppressant agent from the fluid supply <b>114</b> via the piping <b>140</b>. The sprinklers <b>142</b> each define one or more outlets, through which the fire suppressant agent exits and contacts a deflector <b>125</b> (which may incorporate features of deflector <b>212</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), such as to form a spray of water or other fire suppressant agent that covers a desired area. The sprays from the sprinklers <b>142</b> then suppress or extinguish fire within that area. The deflectors <b>125</b> of the sprinklers <b>142</b> can be shaped to control the spray pattern of the fire suppressant agent leaving the sprinklers <b>142</b>. The sprinklers <b>142</b> can be used as concealed sprinklers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sprinklers <b>142</b> can include an activation element (e.g., thermal element) <b>123</b>. The activation element <b>123</b> can change from a first state that prevents fluid flow out of the sprinkler <b>142</b> to a second state that permits fluid flow of the sprinkler <b>142</b> responsive to a fire condition. For example, the activation element <b>123</b> can include a glass bulb including a fluid that expands responsive to an increase in temperature (e.g., responsive to heat provided to the fluid from a fire), such as to cause the glass bulb to break responsive to the temperature meeting or exceeding a threshold temperature.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> depict a sprinkler <b>200</b>. The sprinkler <b>200</b> can incorporate features of the sprinkler <b>142</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The sprinkler <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>202</b> that can be coupled with a body <b>204</b>. The housing <b>202</b> may be coupled with the body <b>204</b> through one or more coupling mechanisms, for example threading or a snap fit. The housing <b>202</b> may be releasably coupled with the body <b>204</b>, for example to facilitate installation and other processes for the sprinkler <b>200</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the body <b>204</b> is positioned around a sprinkler axis <b>206</b>. The housing <b>202</b> is coupled with the body <b>204</b> such that a portion of the housing <b>202</b> surrounds at least a portion of the body <b>204</b> in a lateral dimension. The body <b>204</b> includes a coupler <b>208</b> (which is depicted as a threading, but may comprise other couplers/coupling components) extending from the body (e.g., extending vertically from the body in the frame of reference depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and protruding from the housing. The coupler <b>208</b> is positioned around the sprinkler axis <b>206</b>, and can include an opening <b>207</b> disposed at an end of the coupler <b>208</b> opposite the housing <b>202</b>. The opening <b>207</b> can be adjacent to a channel <b>209</b>, where the channel is defined by inner walls of the body <b>204</b>. The channel <b>209</b> may extend into and through the body <b>204</b> along the sprinkler axis <b>206</b>. The channel <b>209</b> may have a cylindrical geometry, or may include portions in which the geometry of the channel is tapered or widened as defined by inner walls of the body <b>204</b>. When the sprinkler <b>200</b> is activated, fire suppression fluid may flow from a fluid supply through the channel <b>209</b>. In some aspects, fire suppression fluid may be retained within the channel <b>209</b> or a portion thereof when the sprinkler <b>200</b> is in an inactivated state. In an inactivated state, sprinkler <b>200</b> includes fluid seals within the body. Fluid seals within the body are formed by applying force to one or more sealing elements by frame arms and thermal elements of the sprinkler <b>200</b> to prevent fire suppression fluid from being communicated from a fluid supply line through the body <b>204</b> and dispersed over an area. In an activated state, frame arms and thermal elements applying force to sealing elements cease to apply force to sealing elements as thermal elements rupture in response to a condition (e.g., melting from heat exposure, rupture of volume in response to gas expansion, etc.) and thus frame arms lose contact with the body <b>204</b> of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. Responsive to activation of the sprinkler <b>200</b> (e.g., which can cause one or more seals to be released, such as seals formed between spring components (e.g., Belleville springs, etc.) and buttons, as well as seals formed between spring components and geometries within the body <b>204</b> of the sprinkler <b>200</b>) the fire suppression fluid can flow through the channel <b>209</b> past one or more seals released in response to the activation of the sprinkler <b>200</b> such that fire suppression fluid may be dispersed from the body <b>204</b> such that the fire suppression fluid may be distributed and/or deflected to an area.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The coupler <b>208</b> can couple with a fluid supply (e.g., a portion of a pipe system such as piping <b>140</b> and/or fluid supply <b>114</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, etc.). The opening <b>207</b> provides fluid communication between the body <b>204</b> (and components disposed within the body) and the fluid supply such that fire suppression fluid may be communicated from the fluid supply and into the body <b>204</b> of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. The fluid supply can provide fire suppression fluid to the sprinkler <b>200</b> via the opening <b>207</b>, such that the fire suppression fluid may be dispensed from the sprinkler <b>200</b> upon activation of the sprinkler <b>200</b> (e.g., in response to a fire).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sprinkler <b>200</b> is shown to include a frame <b>214</b> coupled with an inferior portion of the body <b>204</b>. As shown, the frame <b>214</b> is coupled with the body <b>204</b> via an exterior shoulder of the body <b>204</b>, where the exterior shoulder of the body <b>204</b> can extend in a radial direction outward from the body <b>204</b> such that the frame <b>214</b> may contact the exterior shoulder of the body to achieve coupling. In some aspects, the frame <b>214</b> may be coupled with the body <b>204</b> through other coupling mechanisms, for example threading or a snap-fit. The frame <b>214</b> includes an upper portion shown to be coupled with the inferior portion of the body <b>204</b>, where the upper portion of the frame <b>214</b> is substantially cylindrical. For example, as shown in the example aspect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the upper portion of the frame <b>214</b> coupled with the inferior portion of the body <b>204</b>, where the upper portion of the frame <b>214</b> has a cylindrical shape with an opening. As shown, the opening of the upper portion of the frame <b>214</b> is aligned with the sprinkler axis <b>206</b> such that fire suppression fluid may be communicated along the sprinkler axis <b>206</b> through a central portion of the frame <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The frame <b>214</b> includes a pair of legs <b>216</b> (with only one leg of the pair of legs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) extending in a distal direction from the portion of the frame <b>214</b> that is coupled with the inferior portion of the body <b>204</b>. The pair of legs <b>216</b> can be oriented in various manners relative to the frame <b>214</b> from one another, such as 180 degrees apart as depicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. The pair of legs <b>216</b> include a pair of feet <b>218</b> disposed at distal portions of each leg of the pair of legs <b>216</b>, with each foot of the pair of feet <b>218</b> including an aperture (not shown). The sprinkler <b>200</b> further includes a pair of guide pins <b>210</b>, where each of the guide pins <b>210</b> are coupled with a top surface of a deflector <b>212</b>. The guide pins <b>210</b> are sized such that they may be translated vertically within the apertures of the feet <b>218</b> such that the deflector <b>212</b> may be translated vertically below the frame <b>214</b>. Each of the guide pins <b>210</b> include a head <b>211</b>. The head <b>211</b> can have a lateral dimension greater than that of the apertures of the feet <b>218</b> such that the head <b>211</b> of each of the guide pins <b>210</b> defines a maximum distal position of the deflector <b>212</b> when the guide pins <b>210</b> are extending from the frame <b>214</b>. The lateral dimension of the guide pins <b>210</b> can be less than that of the apertures such that the guide pins <b>210</b> may be translated through the apertures, with the head <b>211</b> of each of the guide pins having a lateral dimension greater than that of the apertures such that the head <b>211</b> of the guide pins cannot pass through the apertures.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sprinkler <b>200</b> is shown to include a spring <b>228</b> arranged within an interior portion of the body <b>204</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In some aspects, the spring <b>228</b> may be a Belleville spring, or may be a spring other than a Belleville spring. The spring <b>228</b> may be annular (e.g., include a central opening extending through a cylindrical component), and may have a flat top surface and bottom surface. The top and bottom surfaces of the spring <b>228</b> may include a layer of laminate or other similar substance (e.g., PTFE, etc.). The laminate or other substance may include a thin layer on the top and/or bottom surfaces of the spring <b>228</b>, for example 0.002 inches of material and 0.0015 inches of adhesive. In some aspects, the laminate and/or adhesive may be compressible (e.g., the dimensions of the laminate and/or adhesive may decrease in response to an applied force from one or more other components/directions).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The top surface and the bottom surface of the spring <b>228</b> (which include the laminate or other material) can be flat and may interface with other components of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. For example, the bottom surface of the spring <b>228</b> can contact a first component (which may have a similar flat surface, or may have one or more extensions/protrusions) and the laminate or other material on the top surface can contact a second component (which also may have a similar flat surface, or may have one or more extensions/protrusions). Further to the previous example, the first and/or second components may be the geometry of the housing <b>202</b> or a portion thereof, or may be one or more other components of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. Such contact between the spring <b>228</b> and one or more other surfaces may provide a seal (e.g., seal one or more surfaces of the spring relative to the geometry of the body <b>204</b> and/or other components of sprinkler <b>200</b> to prevent fire suppression fluid from flowing out of the sprinkler <b>200</b>) such that fluid communication is prevented between a first side of the seal (e.g., fire suppression fluid and/or fluid supply) and a second side of the seal (e.g., a room or other area, or components of the sprinkler <b>200</b> that disperse fire suppression fluid over a given area). Such a seal may be formed by the laminate or other material and/or the adhesive deforming relative to the first and/or second surfaces as a force is applied thereby (e.g., a load/loading). The aforementioned seal may be formed by a force applied by the one or more surfaces to the spring <b>228</b> such that the laminate or other material and/or the adhesive are compressed. In some aspects, the magnitude of such a force may be directly proportional to the pressure of a fire suppression fluid which the seal can hold (e.g., if a greater force is applied to the laminate by the one or more other surfaces, the corresponding seal that is formed will be capable of withstanding a fire suppression fluid stored at a greater pressure than if a lesser force were applied to the laminate). Ultimately, the sealing capacity of the seal described previously is proportional to the force per unit area applied to the spring <b>228</b> via the laminate or other material and/or the adhesive.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sealing capacity of the seal can correspond to a force per unit area applied to the spring <b>228</b> via the geometry of the body <b>204</b> and/or other components of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. Accordingly, increasing the force applied to a constant area can increase the sealing capacity of such a seal. Similarly, if the area to which a constant force is applied decreases, the sealing capacity of such a seal would increase. The equation shown below includes the relationship between the applied force &#x201c;F&#x201d;, the area to which the force &#x201c;F&#x201d; is applied &#x201c;A&#x201d;, and the corresponding sealing capacity &#x201c;C&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C=F/A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The sprinkler <b>200</b> includes a button <b>226</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.

The extension <b>234</b> can have a curved geometry from the top surface <b>235</b> of the base <b>225</b>. The extension <b>234</b> can extend along the top surface of the base <b>225</b> around the upper portion <b>227</b> of the button <b>226</b> such that the extension <b>234</b> is arranged concentrically exterior relative to the upper portion <b>227</b>. The extension <b>234</b> can have various geometries, for example a square or triangular geometry extending upward from the top surface of the base <b>225</b>. The extension <b>234</b> can be spaced approximately equidistant from the upper portion <b>227</b> and the lateral edge of the top surface of the base <b>225</b>. The extension <b>234</b> can surround the upper portion <b>227</b> in a geometry other than a concentric configuration (e.g., a sinusoidal lateral geometry around the top surface of the base <b>225</b> while the extension <b>234</b> maintains a constant apex height). The top surface of the base <b>225</b> may include multiple extensions, one or more of which may be different than the extension <b>234</b>. For example, the top surface of the base <b>225</b> may include two extensions identical to the extension <b>234</b>, or a combination of extensions the same as and/or similar to the extension <b>234</b> with other extensions having various geometries relative to that of the extension <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The extension <b>234</b> can contact the bottom surface of the spring <b>228</b> to load the spring <b>228</b> (e.g., compress the spring <b>228</b> and deform the laminate upon the application of a force such that the laminate conforms to the extension <b>234</b>). Collectively, the extension <b>234</b> and the spring <b>228</b> can form a fluid seal. For example, the capacity of the seal formed by the extension <b>234</b> and the spring <b>228</b> can depend on a force per unit area exerted on the spring <b>228</b> by the extension <b>234</b>. For example, by applying a force to the spring from the extension <b>234</b> rather than the entirety of the top surface of the base <b>225</b> of the button <b>226</b>, the area over which the force is applied is decreased and thus the sealing capacity of the seal can be increased without increasing the magnitude of the force applied via the button <b>226</b>. By decreasing the area over which a force is applied to the spring <b>228</b> by the button <b>226</b> from the entirety of the top surface of the base of the button (which may be substantially flat) to the extension <b>234</b>, the sealing capacity of the seal created therebetween can be increased (e.g., while maintaining a constant force). With an increased sealing capacity, the sprinkler <b>200</b> may retain fire suppression fluid under a greater pressurization and, accordingly, provide more effective fire suppression to a given area and/or provide fire suppression for a greater area. For example, the extensions <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> can enable localized compression stress to remove the need for a higher compression force to increase the seal's maximum pressure limit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The body <b>204</b> is depicted to include a shoulder <b>230</b> disposed in an interior portion of the body <b>204</b> such that the shoulder is adjacent the channel <b>209</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the shoulder <b>230</b> includes an extension <b>232</b> adjacent an approximately 45-degree geometry of the body <b>204</b>. The shoulder <b>230</b> may include a right angle or other geometry. The extension <b>232</b> can be arranged such that the extension <b>232</b> protrudes from a surface <b>231</b> (e.g., first contact surface) of the shoulder <b>230</b> downward (e.g., toward the spring <b>228</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, or toward the frame <b>214</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the extension <b>232</b> includes a geometry the same as and/or similar to that of the extension <b>234</b> of the button <b>226</b>. For example, the extension <b>232</b> can be rounded and protruding from a substantially flat surface <b>231</b>. Additionally, the extension <b>232</b> (as well as the shoulder <b>230</b>) can extend around the perimeter of the interior of the body <b>204</b> (similar to the extension <b>234</b> arranged as a continuous structure about the top surface of the base <b>225</b> about the upper portion <b>227</b> of the button <b>226</b>). The shoulder <b>230</b> may include a plurality of extensions the same as and/or similar to the extension <b>232</b>. With reference to both the extension <b>232</b> and the extension <b>234</b>, the extensions may have a semi-circular cross section that defines a radius. The radius can be 0.01 inches (e.g., greater than or equal to 0.05 inches and less than or equal to 0.02 inches, between 0.007-0.015 inches, etc.). The extensions <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> can be ridges.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the extension <b>232</b> can contact the top surface of the spring <b>228</b> (e.g., opposite the surface of the spring <b>228</b> that is opposite the lower surface of the spring <b>228</b> contacted by the extension <b>234</b>). The extension <b>232</b> can apply a force against the spring <b>228</b> to drive the spring <b>228</b> upward (e.g., in the direction of the extension <b>232</b>) such that the extension <b>232</b> contacts the top surface of the spring <b>228</b>. As a force is applied to the button <b>226</b> (as described previously), the button <b>226</b> can be driven upward, which translates a force to the spring <b>228</b> (thus creating the seal between the spring <b>228</b> and the extension <b>234</b>) and drives the spring <b>228</b> upward to contact the extension <b>232</b>. Upon the application of a force to the spring <b>228</b>, the spring <b>228</b> can contact the extension <b>232</b> and deform so as to conform to the geometry of the extension <b>232</b> (e.g., a laminate layer of the spring <b>228</b> can deform). Accordingly, a seal can be formed similar to that described previously as being formed between the extension <b>234</b> and the spring <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The capacity of the seal formed between the extension <b>232</b> and the spring <b>228</b> as a result of the force applied to the spring <b>228</b> (and, subsequently, the resistive force applied to the spring <b>228</b> by the extension <b>232</b> thus forming the seal) can depend on the relationship between the applied force and the area over which said force is applied. For example, if the shoulder <b>230</b> did not include the extension <b>232</b>, then a force (e.g. applied by frame arms in conjunction with thermal elements) would be applied over the entire surface area of the flat portion of the shoulder <b>230</b> to the top surface of the spring <b>228</b>. However, given that the flat portion of the shoulder <b>230</b> includes the extension <b>232</b>, the extension <b>232</b> contacts the spring <b>228</b> thus decreasing the surface area over which the force is applied. Accordingly and as described previously, the sealing capacity of the seal formed between the extension <b>232</b> and the spring <b>228</b> can be directly proportional to the force applied per unit area. Thus, both increasing the force and decreasing the area over which any force is applied both increase the sealing capacity of the seal formed between the spring <b>228</b> and the extension <b>232</b>. Increasing the force applied for the seal to be formed presents numerous obstacles, for example machining a variety of new components to meet additional stress or strain parameters. However, the introduction of the extension <b>232</b> (and similarly, the extension <b>234</b>) increases the sealing capacity of the seal by decreasing the area over which the force is applied without increasing the applied force. Accordingly, the fire sprinkler can retain fire suppression fluid stored under a greater pressure. Higher pressurization of fire suppression fluid can enable the sprinkler <b>200</b> to provide improved fire suppression for an area or provide fire suppression for an increased area as the fire suppression fluid will be capable of having a greater flow velocity and/or volumetric flow rate when moving through and exiting the sprinkler <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">With reference to both the extension <b>232</b> and the extension <b>234</b>, it should be noted that the extensions may include various geometries. However, the geometry of the extensions may be determined so that the extensions perform effectively in cooperation with structural and material properties of the spring, such as laminate or other material and adhesive disposed on the top and bottom surfaces of the spring <b>228</b>. For example, the extensions <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> may require a geometry that will deform the laminate upon the application of a force such that the laminate conforms to the extensions <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>. However, the geometry of the extensions <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> should not cause the extensions <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> to pierce, sever, or otherwise compromise the structural integrity of the laminate or other material and adhesive. Accordingly, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the extension <b>232</b> and the extension <b>234</b> can include substantially smooth, rounded geometries. The sprinkler <b>200</b> may vary, for example the composition of the laminate or other material, the adhesive, and also the composition of the extension <b>232</b> and the extension <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the sprinkler <b>200</b> may include the extension <b>232</b> and include the extension <b>234</b>. The sprinkler <b>200</b> may include only the extension <b>232</b> or only the extension <b>234</b>. For example, in some applications the sprinkler <b>200</b> may not require a sealing capacity beyond a specific threshold. Accordingly, such an application may call for the sprinkler <b>200</b> to have one of the extension <b>232</b> or the extension <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The body <b>204</b> can include an connector <b>224</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, with the connector <b>224</b> disposed in an interior portion of the body <b>204</b>. The connector <b>224</b> includes a protrusion <b>223</b> on a top portion thereof that can couple the connector <b>224</b> with the button <b>226</b> via a recess <b>221</b> arranged on a bottom surface of the base <b>225</b> of the button <b>226</b>. The connector <b>224</b> can translate a force provided by a pair of arms <b>222</b>, which are releasably coupled with the interior of the housing (e.g., via a ledge, or other lever configuration) as well as coupled with an activation element <b>236</b>. The activation element <b>236</b> may be configured to activate the fire sprinkler according to one or more stimuli. For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the activation element <b>236</b> includes a thermal activation mechanism that undergoes a state change responsive to an external temperature being greater than a threshold temperature (e.g., as described with respect to activation element <b>123</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The activation element <b>236</b> can be coupled with each arm of the pair of arms <b>222</b> such that each of the arms <b>222</b> applies a force to the connector <b>224</b>, driving the connector <b>224</b> in an upward direction (such that said force is translated to the button <b>226</b>, the spring <b>228</b>, and the extensions <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> moving in a direction from the arms <b>222</b> toward the extension <b>232</b>). The activation element <b>236</b> can couple with each arm of the pair of arms <b>222</b> such that a tension force is applied, with said tension force translated through each arm of the pair of arms <b>222</b>. Accordingly, each arm of the pair of arms <b>222</b> can engage a portion of the interior of the body <b>204</b> (as described previously) such that the upward force is applied continuously to the connector <b>224</b>. The upward force results in the forming of a seal between the extension <b>232</b> and the top surface of the spring <b>228</b> and the formation of a seal between the extension <b>234</b> and the bottom surface of the spring <b>228</b>. Responsive to activation of the activation element <b>236</b>, tension between the pair of arms <b>222</b> is lost and, accordingly, the application of the upward force is lost. Thus, the seal formed between the extension <b>232</b> and the top surface of the spring <b>228</b> as well as the seal formed between the extension <b>234</b> and the bottom surface of the spring <b>228</b> are released (e.g., lost, broken, etc.). The combination of the connector <b>224</b>, the pair of arms <b>222</b> and the activation element <b>236</b> can retain the connector in a first state within the interior of the body <b>204</b> in which one or more seals are formed (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), and transition to a second state in which the seals are released and fire suppression fluid is allowed to flow through the body <b>204</b> responsive to activation of the activation assembly.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Responsive to releasing of the two seals (as described above), fire suppression fluid can be communicated along and through the channel <b>209</b> of the body <b>204</b> from the opening <b>207</b> on the upper portion of the body <b>204</b> and exits the channel <b>209</b> in a lower portion of the body <b>204</b>.

The deflector <b>212</b> can disperse the flow of the fire suppression fluid to provide fire protection and/or suppression for a given area. The deflector <b>212</b> may be shaped (e.g., include arrangements of tines) to disperse the fire suppression fluid in one or more desired directions.

The body <b>900</b> includes a frame <b>904</b>, which can incorporate features of the frame <b>214</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. While the frame <b>904</b> can be integral to the body <b>900</b>, the frame <b>904</b> can include a pair of legs <b>910</b> extending from the frame <b>904</b> in a direction opposite the coupler <b>908</b> (similar to the corresponding components of the sprinkler <b>200</b> relative to the frame <b>214</b>). The body <b>900</b> can include a bottom portion <b>903</b> disposed opposite the body <b>900</b> from the coupler <b>908</b>. The frame <b>904</b> includes a pair of apertures <b>922</b> disposed diametrically opposite the frame <b>904</b> and disposed on the frame adjacent each of the pair of legs <b>910</b> of the frame <b>914</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The body <b>900</b> can accommodate a pair of guide pins that incorporate features of the guide pins <b>210</b>. The body <b>900</b> may accommodate components in an interior portion thereof, for example the button <b>226</b>, the connector <b>224</b>, and the spring <b>228</b> as shown and described previously. The body <b>900</b> may be injection molded with integral components (e.g., the frame <b>904</b> and body <b>900</b>) that do not require coupling (e.g., the body <b>204</b> and the frame <b>214</b>). The body may include materials such as various polymers having material properties advantageous for fire sprinklers (e.g., heat resistance, lightweight, etc.) such as the sprinkler <b>200</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The body <b>900</b> can include a shoulder <b>930</b> and an extension <b>934</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The shoulder <b>930</b> and the extension <b>934</b> may incorporate features of the shoulder <b>230</b> and the extension <b>232</b> of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. For example, the extension <b>934</b> can extend from a flat surface of the shoulder <b>930</b> in a direction opposite the coupler <b>908</b>. Thus, the extension <b>934</b> can facilitate the forming of a fluid seal in a similar manner as described with reference to the spring <b>228</b> and the extension <b>232</b> (e.g., should the spring <b>228</b>, the button <b>226</b>, the connector <b>224</b>, the activation element <b>236</b>, and the pair of arms <b>222</b> be implemented in conjunction with the body <b>900</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref> depict a body <b>1100</b> that includes an upper portion <b>1104</b>. The body <b>1100</b> can incorporate features of the body <b>204</b> of the sprinkler <b>200</b>. The body <b>1100</b> includes a coupler <b>1108</b>. The coupler <b>1108</b> can include a threading. The coupler <b>1108</b> can use various coupling mechanisms, such as a snap to fit. The body <b>1100</b> can include an opening <b>1107</b> that extends into an interior portion of the body <b>1100</b> forming a channel <b>1109</b>. The channel <b>1109</b> can be disposed about a sprinkler axis <b>1106</b>. The body <b>1100</b> can include a step <b>1130</b> (e.g., a &#x201c;reverse step&#x201d;) disposed adjacent the channel <b>1109</b> on the interior of the body <b>1100</b>. The step <b>1130</b> may incorporate features of the shoulder <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.

The extension <b>1132</b> can incorporate features of the extension <b>232</b> of the body <b>204</b>. The extension <b>1132</b> can extend from the flat surface of the step <b>1130</b> in a direction opposite the coupler <b>1108</b>. Both the step <b>1130</b> and the extension <b>1132</b> are continuous in that the step <b>1130</b> and the extension <b>1132</b> extend about a circular lateral dimension in the interior of the body <b>1100</b>. The extension <b>1132</b> can include a curved geometry, for example with a radius of 0.01 inches. The body <b>1100</b> and the step <b>1130</b> thereof may include multiple extensions the same as and/or similar to the extension <b>1132</b>. Both the step <b>1130</b> and the extension <b>1132</b> can form a seal between the extension <b>1132</b> and a spring (e.g., the spring <b>228</b>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The body <b>1200</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> can include a surface <b>1234</b> adjacent the step <b>1230</b>. Both the step <b>1230</b> and the surface <b>1234</b> are continuous about a circular lateral dimension of the interior of the body <b>1200</b>. The combination of the step <b>1230</b> and the surface <b>1234</b> can cooperate to form a seal between the surface <b>1234</b> and a spring (e.g., the spring <b>228</b>). The surface <b>1234</b> can have a surface area that interfaces with and applies a force to the spring <b>228</b>. For example, by adjusting the surface area of the surface <b>1234</b> (e.g., decreasing, making smaller similar to the extensions as discussed previously), the sealing capacity of a seal formed therewith is thus adjusted accordingly. Thus, despite not having an extension feature, the surface <b>1234</b> can have a decreased surface area which thus increases the sealing capacity of a seal formed between, for example, the surface <b>1234</b> and a top surface of a spring the same as or similar to the spring <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">As utilized herein, the terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially&#x201d;, and similar terms are intended to include any given ranges or numbers +/&#x2212;10%.
