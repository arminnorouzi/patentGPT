The inkjet pen is typically configured to eject ink stored in a tank from nozzles. Such an inkjet pen is typically configured such that a liquid level of the ink stored in an ink cartridge is higher than openings of the nozzles. The ink cartridge may not have a gas layer connected to the outside, or may have a valve in the gas flow channel that connects the gas layer to the outside.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the position of the ink surface in the ink cartridge changes with ink consumption, a hydraulic head difference between a meniscus at the nozzle opening and the ink surface fluctuates. When the hydraulic head difference fluctuates, the quantity of droplets ejected from the nozzles fluctuates even if a pressurizing element is driven at a constant level. As a result, recorded image quality may be deteriorated or meniscus fluctuations at nozzles may become unstable.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to aspects of the present disclosure, there is provided a liquid ejection device, including a head having a nozzle, an element causing the nozzle to eject liquid, a reservoir configured to store the liquid to be supplied to the nozzle, and a controller.
