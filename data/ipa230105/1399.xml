However, the need for much greater detection sensitivity for dilute species has led to growing interest in hyperpolarization [Nikolaou et al., 2015; Hovener et al., 2018; Kovtunov et al., 2018], the generation of highly nonequilibrium population distributions of nuclear spins to dramatically increase the detectable magnetization. Various methods for hyperpolarization have been developed with an eye toward biomedical applications, including spin-exchange optical pumping [Walker and Happer, 1997; Goodson, 2002], dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization [Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003; Comment, 2016; Lee et al., 2014; Ardenkjar-Larsen, 2016], parahydrogen-induced polarization [Bowers and Weitekamp, 1987; Bowers, 2007; Duckett and Mewis, 2012], and signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) [Adams et al., 2009 (Science); Adams et al., 2009 (J Chem Phys); Rayner and Duckett, 2018]. In particular, SABRE along with its microtesla variant dubbed &#x201c;SABRE-SHEATH&#x201d; (for SABRE in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei) [Theis et al., 2015; Truong et al., 2015; Shchepin et al, 2015; Barskiy et al., 2017 (ChemPhysChem); Shchepin et al., 2017 (ChemPhysChem)] have garnered increasing attention because they are rapid and inexpensive to perform, scalable, and do not require major instrumentation. A growing range of biomolecules is amendable to SABRE-SHEATH [Hovener et al., 2018; Colell et al., 2017]. However, reliance on a heavy-metal (Ir-based) catalyst to mediate polarization transfer to a biocompatible substrate presents an obstacle to envisioned clinical applications because of that catalyst's presence in the same solution as the hyperpolarized (HP) agent. Efficient removal of the catalyst while preserving the HP state of the substrate is thus likely necessary before studies with human subjects can be considered.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generating a pure HP substrate via SABRE necessitates that the catalyst is either heterogeneous (enabling ready separation of the catalyst from the dissolved substrate) or that the homogeneous catalyst is removed somehow from the solution after hyperpolarization transfer to target nuclei. Although progress has been made [Shi et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Kovtunov et al., 2017; Iali et al, 2017; Manoharan et al., 2018; Mewis et al., 2015], each approach demonstrated so far has drawbacks and none have enabled the production of catalyst-free solutions with agents possessing nuclear spin polarizations of several percent. Indeed, such approaches are further complicated by the necessity of the HP nuclei to retain their HP state during (and following) catalyst removal, enabling it to survive all of the way through separation, agent administration, and ultimate MM detection. The present work is thus motivated by the desire for simple methods to efficiently remove standard SABRE catalysts from solution while retaining the HP state of the substrate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of the present disclosure is a method that embodies a simple and effective route to remove homogeneous catalysts from solutions wherein NMR/MM signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) or parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) is performed&#x2014;thereby significantly purifying the hyperpolarized substrate or agent while maintaining its hyperpolarized state. Thus, the present disclosure is directed to a method of removing a homogeneous catalyst from a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and a hyperpolarized agent, the method comprising contacting the solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized agent with a catalyst removal agent, wherein the catalyst removal agent comprises a sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom, and wherein the sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen atom of the catalyst removal agent bonds with homogeneous catalyst.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also provided herein is a method of removing a homogeneous catalyst from a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and a hyperpolarized agent, the method comprising subjecting a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and a hyperpolarization agent to SABRE or PHIP to obtain the solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized agent; contacting the solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized agent with a catalyst removal agent, wherein the catalyst removal agent comprises a sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom, and wherein the sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom of the catalyst removal agent bonds with the homogeneous catalyst; and removing the catalyst removal agent bonded to the homogeneous catalyst from the solution thereby providing a purified solution comprising the hyperpolarized agent, wherein the purified solution is substantially free of the homogeneous catalyst.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method is also described for recovering a homogeneous SABRE/PHIP catalyst to enable its reuse. For example, a method of recovering a homogeneous catalyst from a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and a hyperpolarized agent comprises contacting the solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized agent with a catalyst removal agent, wherein the catalyst removal agent bonds with the homogeneous catalyst; removing the catalyst removal agent bonded to the homogeneous catalyst from the solution thereby providing a purified solution comprising the hyperpolarized agent, wherein the purified solution is substantially free of the homogeneous catalyst; and recovering the homogeneous catalyst from the catalyst removal agent by performing at least one of: (1) applying a catalyst release agent to the catalyst removal agent, wherein the catalyst release agent reacts with the catalyst removal agent to break the bond between the catalyst removal agent and the homogeneous catalyst; or (2) applying energy to the catalyst removal agent, wherein the energy breaks the bond between the catalyst removal agent and the homogeneous catalyst.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following drawings form part of the present specification and are included to further demonstrate certain aspects of the present disclosure.

Spectra were taken on a 400 MHz Oxford magnet with Agilent DD2 spectrometer. The time shown with each spectrum refers to the total time after addition of the microparticles. 3-mercaptopropyl functionalized SiO2 microparticles:catalyst solutions with molar ratios of 10:1 (a), 20:1 (b), and 30:1 (c) show a decrease in 1H SABRE as a function of time, post-microparticle addition, whereas a solution with &#x201c;20:1&#x201d; (d) non-functionalized SiO2 microparticles does not (Note: the &#x201c;20:1&#x201d; ratio for unfunctionalized SiO2 microparticles refers to a microparticle loading (by mass) that matches that of the actual 20:1 loading for a sample with functionalized microparticles).

Experiments were performed as follows: A solution of the substrate (pyridine, 40 mM) and the Ir-catalyst (4 mM) in 600 &#x3bc;L deuterated methanol was placed in an NMR tube and attached to the para-H2 bubbler and pressurized to 75 psi. Following &#x2dc;15 min. of hydrogen bubbling to activate the catalyst, SABRE was performed by administering para-H2 bubbling for 15 s at &#x2dc;5.2 mT, after which the sample was rapidly transferred to 9.4 T for 1H acquisition at 400 MHz to obtain the &#x201c;pre-addition&#x201d; spectrum for a given sample (repeated in triplicate). The sample was de-pressurized to 1 atm and a specified amount of SiO2 microparticles (functionalized or non-functionalized) was carefully added to the solution. Upon microparticle addition, a timer was started and the sample was immediately re-connected to the para-H2 manifold and re-pressurized to 75 psi. Once re-pressurized, the sample was bubbled for 15 s at &#x2dc;5.2 mT and then rapidly transferred to 9.4 T for 1H acquisition.

A method is also described for recovering a homogeneous catalyst to enable its reuse.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One embodiment of the present disclosure is an approach for removing the homogeneous catalysts from a solution containing such catalysts, a hyperpolarized substrate or substrates, solvent molecules, and any other molecules that may or may not be commonly present in a SABRE or PHIP experiment. The homogeneous catalyst can be a SABRE or PHIP catalyst. Typically, the homogeneous catalyst contains at least one metal atom. The metal atom can be, for example, Ir, Rh, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Pd, Os, or Pt. Preferably, the metal atom is Ir or Rh.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The homogeneous catalyst is used to perform SABRE (or PHIP) enhancement of an ensemble of NMR-active nuclear spins (e.g. 1H, 2H, 13C, 15N, 19F, 31P, 129Xe, etc.) of a chosen substrate or agent. Thus, a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and a hyperpolarization agent is subjected to SABRE or PHIP to obtain a solution comprising the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized agent. Following hyperpolarization, a substance or substances (i.e., a catalyst removal agent) is/are added to rapidly bind up the catalyst and in so doing, take it out of solution in a single step&#x2014;leaving behind the substrate (without significant contamination from the catalyst), while it remains in a hyperpolarized state, sufficient for a desired application. That hyperpolarized agent is then administered to the sample or subject as desired.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to maintain the hyperpolarized state, in preferred embodiments, the methods disclosed herein are performed in a relatively quick time frame. For example, the removal of the homogeneous catalyst occurs in less than five minutes, less than four minutes, less than three minutes, less than two minutes, less than one minute, or less than thirty seconds.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively, after hyperpolarization, the solution (containing catalyst, hyperpolarized agent, solvent, etc.) is passed (or forced) through a separation apparatus containing a substance (i.e., a catalyst removal agent) that can rapidly bind up the catalyst, taking it out of solution. Then, the solution passes through the separation apparatus without significant quantities of the homogeneous catalyst (leaving it behind), allowing the remaining solution containing the purified agent or substrate to leave the separation apparatus with its hyperpolarized state intact. The solution containing the hyperpolarized agent or substrate would then be administered as desired to the sample or subject. The separation apparatus can comprise, for example, a column, a syringe, a filtration device, or any other suitable separation apparatus.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">These procedures provide a purified solution substantially free of the homogeneous catalyst. The term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; indicates that at least about 90 wt. %, at least about 93 wt. %, at least about 95 wt. %, at least about 97 wt. %, at least about 99 wt. %, at least about 99.5 wt. %, or at least about 99.9 wt. % of the homogeneous catalyst has been removed from the purified solution. For example, less than 100 ppb, less than 75 ppb, less than 50 ppb, less than 25 ppb, less than 10 ppb, less than 5 ppb, less than 3 ppb, less than 2 ppb, or less than 1 ppb of the homogeneous catalyst remain in the purified solution.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The catalyst removal agent may be an organic or inorganic species (e.g., complex) that chelates (or binds) the metal atom or atoms of the catalyst that renders the catalyst no longer soluble in the liquid phase containing the hyperpolarized substrate, forcing it to rapidly crash out of solution.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The catalyst removal agent may be a solid-phase particle or bead functionalized with surface moieties that are capable of binding or chelating the metal atom or atoms of the catalyst, thereby causing the catalyst to be removed from solution.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the catalyst removal agent can comprise a sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom. The sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom is capable of bonding with the homogeneous catalyst. Thus, the sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen atom contains at least one free binding site (e.g., one free binding site, two free binding sites, etc.). The free binding site comprises a lone pair of electrons that bond with the homogeneous catalyst.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the catalyst removal agent is functionalized on a solid-phase particle. The solid-phase particle can comprise SiO<sub>2 </sub>or polystyrene. For example, the solid-phase particle comprises SiO<sub>2</sub>. The solid-phase particle can comprise a bead (e.g., a resin bead) comprising SiO<sub>2 </sub>or polystyrene. Various sizes of beads may be preferable for various applications. In general, the bead can have an average diameter of, for example, from about 10 nm to about 1 mm, from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 1 mm, or from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m. As an example, the bead can have a diameter of about 100 &#x3bc;m. The skilled person will be able to readily determine the appropriate size of bead for the chosen application.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an example, the catalyst removal agent can comprise at least one of:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="85.09mm" wi="68.83mm" file="US20230001400A9-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Materials or substances placed in contact with solutions containing hyperpolarized species&#x2014;or where hyperpolarization would take place&#x2014;have minimal concentrations of paramagnetic centers that could compromise the hyperpolarized state of the agent or the purified spin order of the para-H2.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Appropriate magnetic or electromagnetic fields would be present (or applied) to either (1) ensure efficient transfer of spin order from either (a) para-H2 to a substrate spin; or (b) one substrate spin to another substrate spin; and/or (2) help maintain the hyperpolarized states of agents at one or more stages of the process.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">A molecule or substance capable of binding to both the catalyst and the solid-phase material can be added to the solution containing the homogeneous catalyst and the hyperpolarized substrate. The molecule in question may bind strongly to the metal atom or atoms of the catalyst, but by itself the catalyst would not come out of solution. However, once (for example) solid phase particles of an appropriate functionalization are added to the solution or once the solution is added to a separation apparatus containing the solid phase materials, the catalysts would bind to the particles (or other substances), taking them from the solution (and thus purifying the agent, with its hyperpolarized state intact).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Thus, the methods of the present disclosure function to remove the homogeneous catalyst from a solution comprising the hyperpolarize agent, wherein the hyperpolarized agent maintains its hyperpolarized state in the purified solution.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Another embodiment of the present disclosure is a general approach for recovering the catalysts from the separation medium, and so that they can be reused in additional homogeneous SABRE or PHIP experiments.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In one embodiment, the catalyst removal agent bonded to the homogeneous catalyst is contacted with a catalyst release agent which works to break the bond between the catalyst removal agent and the homogeneous catalyst, thereby returning the catalysts to solution. The free catalysts would then be separated and undergo solvent removal and/or other purification steps in preparation for subsequent re-use. Alternatively, or in addition to contacting the catalyst removal agent bonded to the homogeneous catalyst with the catalyst release agent, energy can be applied to the catalyst removal agent, wherein the energy breaks the bond between the catalyst removal agent and the homogeneous catalyst, thereby returning the catalysts to solution. Such energy can be in the form of, for example, heat, light, and/or electricity. The resulting solution is then treated to allow for solvent removal and/or other purification necessary for re-use of the catalyst.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the present disclosure.

Facile Removal of Homogeneous SABRE Catalysts for Purifying Hyperpolarized Metronidazole, a Potential Hypoxia Sensor</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The following Examples provide a simple and effective method to remove IrIMes homogeneous polarization transfer catalysts from solutions where NMR signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) has been performed, while leaving intact the substrate's hyperpolarized state. Following microtesla SABRE hyperpolarization of <sup>15</sup>N spins in metronidazole, addition of SiO<sub>2 </sub>microparticles functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyl or 2-mercaptoethyl ethyl sulfide moieties provides removal of the catalyst from solution well within the hyperpolarization decay time at 0.3 T (T<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;3 min) and enabling transfer to 9.4 T for detection of enhanced <sup>15</sup>N signals in the absence of catalyst within the NMR detection region. Successful catalyst removal from solution is supported by the inability to &#x201c;rehyperpolarize&#x201d; <sup>15</sup>N spins in subsequent attempts, as well as by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Record-high <sup>15</sup>N nuclear polarization of up to &#x2dc;34% was achieved, corresponding to &#x3e;100 000-fold enhancement at 9.4 T (or &#x3e;320,000-fold enhancement at 3.0 T), and approximately &#x215a;th of the <sup>15</sup>N hyperpolarization is retained after &#x2dc;20 s long purification procedure. Taken together, these results help pave the way for future studies, involving in vivo molecular imaging using agents hyperpolarized via rapid and inexpensive parahydrogen-based methods.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Metronidazole, a molecule that has a <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;3 min at 0.3 T [Shchepin et al., 2018], is relatively easy to hyperpolarize [Barskiy et al., 2016 (J Am Chem Soc); Shchepin et al., 2017 (J Phys Chem C)], and possesses biological significance (it is an FDA-approved antibiotic of interest for probing tissue hypoxia) [Barskiy et al., 2016 (J Am Chem Soc); Kizaka-Kondoh and Konse-Nagasawa, 2009], was utilized in the present study. Indeed, we note that metronidazole can be administered in relatively large dose (&#x2dc;2 g per patient [Erickson, 1981]). Moreover, metronidazole contains a nitroimidazole moiety, a structure which is frequently employed in positron emission tomography molecular probes for hypoxia sensing [Kizaka-Kondoh and Konse-Nagasawa, 2009; Procissi et al., 2007; Komar et al., 2008; Fleming et al., 2015; Masaki et al., 2015]. Correspondingly, it is anticipated that when hyperpolarized, this agent will potentially be able to distinguish between hypoxic and normoxic tissues via the <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift differences that are expected for structures in healthy versus pathological tissues.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Each sample utilized in this Example contains a 20 mM methanol-d<sub>4 </sub>solution of metronidazole and 1 mM Ir-catalyst precursor [IrCl(COD)(IMes)] (where IMes=1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene and COD=cyclooctadiene) [Vazques-Serrano et al., 2006; Cowley et al., 2011]; ca. 75-85% parahydrogen (at 75 psi) is administered via bubbling through a 5 mm NMR tube with a flow rate of 150 sccm using an experimental setup described elsewhere [Truong et al., 2014]. The catalyst was activated by bubbling for at least ca. 5-10 min prior to initial NMR acquisition.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">A SABRE-SHEATH mixing field of &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;T for <sup>15</sup>N was found to result in <sup>15</sup>N nuclear spin polarization of up to &#x2dc;34% for the Ir-binding nitrogen in the free substrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), which corresponds to an enhancement factor (&#x3b5;) of &#x2dc;103 000-fold at 9.4 T and 300 K.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">To the inventor's knowledge, such a value represents the greatest <sup>15</sup>N polarization yet reported among all hyperpolarization methods (moreover, if nearly 100% pH<sub>2 [</sub>Feng et al., 2012] was employed and assuming an original fraction of &#x2dc;85%, P of &#x2dc;42% and &#x3b5; of &#x2dc;129 000 would be achieved [Hovener et al., 2018]). At <sup>15</sup>N natural abundance (0.364%), HP <sup>15</sup>N signals from that nitrogen in catalyst-bound species and the adjacent imidazole nitrogen of free species was observed (8 and 0.6% polarization, respectively; see TABLE 1 below for a summary of calculations of polarization enhancement). With a long hyperpolarization lifetime [Shchepin et al., 2018] and high <sup>15</sup>N polarization values, metronidazole represents an ideal candidate to attempt catalyst removal after hyperpolarization. SABRE hyperpolarization of this compound in organic solvent (compared to that in aqueous medium) may be desirable because metronidazole and parahydrogen have significantly greater solubility in organic solvents, enabling preparation of highly concentrated and highly polarized liquids; such an HP liquid prepared in this fashion potentially can be diluted with isotonic buffer in a manner suitable for in vivo injection (e.g., 5 mg/mL solution) [Barskiy et al., 2016 (J Am Chem Soc); Truong et al., 2014].</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The functionalized SiO<sub>2 </sub>microparticles (3-mercaptopropyl and 2-mercaptoethyl ethyl sulfide) investigated here are commercially available (Sigma 538086 and Sigma 745111) and do not require post-synthetic modifications.

To provide a rough estimate of the amount of functionalized SiO<sub>2 </sub>microparticles necessary to complete catalyst removal, <sup>1</sup>H SABRE enhancement (several hundred fold) as a function of time (after SiO<sub>2 </sub>particle addition) was studied first, using 40 mM solutions of a test substrate (pyridine, also containing 4 mM catalyst in methanol-d<sub>4; </sub><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

The entire procedure from beginning of hyperpolarization to the end of the purification process requires less than 1.5 min. It is envisioned that the purified HP metronidazole organic solution can be transferred from the 5 mm NMR tube-based setup into a syringe partially filled with isotonic saline buffer via a catheter and particle filter for subsequent in vivo injection. Moreover, larger volumes with higher concentrations of catalyst, parahydrogen, and agent (as well as agent isotopic labeling) should be easily amenable to the present approach along with the use of other agents (including the recent demonstration of SABRE-hyperpolarized cleavable metabolic agents [Kidd et al., 2018]). Cartridges or other devices can also be developed that can be integrated with these setups to increase the efficiency of the process while minimizing polarization losses during catalyst removal and/or agent separation. These results, combined with observation of record <sup>15</sup>N polarization of up to 34% in metronidazole, bode well for a wide range of envisioned in vivo molecular imaging applications [Goodson et al., 2015].</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Calculation of SABRE Enhancement and Polarization Factors</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0063"><sup>1</sup>H SABRE and <sup>15</sup>N SABRE-SHEATH enhancements were calculated using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0066" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>&#x3b5;</mi>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>S</mi>       <mi>HP</mi>      </msub>      <msub>       <mi>S</mi>       <mi>REF</mi>      </msub>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>&#xd7;</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mi>REF</mi>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mi>HP</mi>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>&#xd7;</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>A</mi>       <mi>REF</mi>      </msub>      <msub>       <mi>A</mi>       <mi>HP</mi>      </msub>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0067" num="0000">where &#x3b5; is the calculated enhancement, S<sub>HP </sub>is the absolute integral of the signal from the hyperpolarized species, S<sub>REF </sub>is the absolute integral of the signal from a thermally polarized reference sample, [REF] is the concentration of the thermally polarized species providing the signal (here 0.5 M <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-imidazole, 1.0 M in spin), [HP] is the concentration of the hyperpolarized species (specifically, the concentration of the hyperpolarized spin in question), A<sub>REF </sub>is the cross-sectional area of the NMR tube of the thermally polarized reference sample, and A<sub>HP </sub>is the cross-sectional area of the NMR tube of the hyperpolarized sample (here A<sub>REF</sub>/A<sub>HP</sub>=1.12).

USA). Two separate samples were prepared using 15 mL each of a methanol solution containing 1 mM of the standard SABRE (Ir-IMes) catalyst and 20 mM of metronidazole as a substrate (thus amounts/volumes were scaled up by &#x2dc;25-fold compared to the NMR experiments). Each sample solution was placed in a simple reaction vessel comprising a piece of &#xbc;-inch o.d. PTFE tubing (with sufficient volume to accommodate the sample), stoppered at the bottom with a &#xbc;-inch push-to-connect fitting, and with a wye adapter attached at the top. The wye adapter allowed the reaction vessel to be connected to the H<sub>2 </sub>bubbler such that the gas could be delivered to the bottom of the liquid sample via 1/16-inch PTFE capillary tubing. The catalyst molecules in the solution were activated by bubbling with &#x2dc;75 psi of room-temperature, standard purity hydrogen for &#x2dc;1 hr. The longer activation/bubbling time used for these samples (compared to the NMR samples) was employed to help account for the much larger reaction volumes. Each sample solution was then decanted into a vial containing 1.775 g of 3-mercaptopropyl functionalized silica beads. This amount corresponds to a 142:1 molar ratio of bead functional groups to Ir (a number somewhat lower than that used in the NMR experiments with these particles, but equivalent to the ratio used with the other (2-mercaptoethyl ethyl sulfide) functionalized particles). The vial was shaken by hand for several minutes and the supernatant was removed and separated from the beads by first extracting the liquid with syringes, then extruding the contained liquid through syringe filters (0.2 &#x3bc;m, Sigma) into a round-bottom flask. The supernatant was then dried on a roto-evaporator and re-dissolved in 15 mL 10% HCl/milli-q water solution [Shi et al., 2016]. Both samples were then taken to the Carbondale Public Works Central Laboratory for analysis. Samples were then diluted to 50 mL and digested with hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.

Removal of the catalysts (iridium-based in the embodiments described herein) from solution occurs well within the hyperpolarization decay time at 0.3 T. The present catalyst removal technique enables transfer to 9.4 T for detection of enhanced <sup>15</sup>N signals in the absence of free catalyst molecules within the NMR detection region.

Known methods to bind platinum-family metals are generally not effective for iridium, with activated carbon being the only effective previously known scavenger for iridium.

Hyperpolarization techniques based on the use of parahydrogen (the nuclear spin isomer of a hydrogen molecule with total nuclear spin I=0), such as parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) and signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), are especially attractive [Bowers and Weitekamp, 1987; Adams et al., 2009 (Science)]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a schematic of the SABRE process. Indeed, PHIP and SABRE provide orders of magnitude NMR signal enhancement in seconds, without requirements of sophisticated equipment and without fundamental scalability difficulties. However, the main drawback that limits the widespread applicability of PHIP/SABRE in biomedicine is the presence of organometallic compounds (the polarization transfer catalysts) in the same solution with hyperpolarized contrast agents. These catalysts typically are complexes of the platinum-group metals; thus, their administration in vivo should be avoided. For the last decade, there have been numerous efforts to develop heterogeneous (HET) PHIP/SABRE catalysts [Koptyug et al., 2007; Kovtunov et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2014], typically in the form of solid particles which are able to facilitate hyperpolarization of liquids and gases mixed with parahydrogen. While the field of HET-PHIP/SABRE is under development, so far there are no reports of high (&#x3e;5%) polarization of relevant biomolecules, a threshold for biomedical applications [Golman and Petersson, 2006].</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">SABRE Catalyst Extraction and Filtration Results</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0069">Here two approaches of removing the polarization catalyst from the solution of a SABRE-hyperpolarized compound are demonstrated.

Rapid Catalyst Capture Enables Metal-Free Para-Hydrogen-Based Hyperpolarized Contrast Agents</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0075">Hyperpolarization techniques based on the use of para-hydrogen provide orders of magnitude signal enhancement for magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The main drawback limiting widespread applicability of para-hydrogen-based techniques in biomedicine is the presence of organometallic compounds (the polarization transfer catalysts) in solution with hyperpolarized contrast agents. These catalysts are typically complexes of platinum-group metals, and their administration in vivo should be avoided. Herein, extraction of a hyperpolarized compound from an organic phase to an aqueous phase combined with a rapid (less than 10 s) Ir-based catalyst capture by metal scavenging agents is shown and can produce pure para-hydrogen-based hyperpolarized contrast agents, as demonstrated by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The presented methodology enables fast and efficient means of producing pure hyperpolarized aqueous solutions for biomedical and other uses.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0076">Despite being immensely powerful tools for biomedical, chemical, and materials science applications, conventional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MM) methods are limited by inherently low sensitivity [Ernst, 1992; Nikolaou et al., 2015; Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2015; Barskiy et al., 2017 (Chem Eur J)]. This limitation can be overcome via hyperpolarization techniques, which allow orders of magnitude NMR/MRI signal enhancement. The most widely used hyperpolarization techniques employ polarization transfer from electrons (dynamic nuclear polarization) [Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., 2003], photons (spin exchange optical pumping) [Goodson, 2002], or para-hydrogen (para-hydrogen-induced polarization, PHIP) [Bower and Weitekamp, 1987; Natterer and Bargon, 1997]. The latter approach is particularly attractive: PHIP and its recent variant SABRE (signal amplification by reversible exchange) [Adams et al., 2009; Mewis et al., 2015] allow transfer of the 100% pure singlet spin order of para-hydrogen (para-H<sub>2</sub>) to a variety of nuclei (<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P, etc.) [Barskiy et al., 2017 (ChemPhysChem); Theis et al., 2015; Shchepin et al., 2017 (ChemPhysChem); Zhivonitko et al., 2015] in a wide range of molecular motifs, including metabolically relevant carboxylic compounds [Reineri et al., 2015; Shchepin et al., 2016 (Angew Chem Int Ed); Cavallari et al., 2017], antibiotics [Barskiy et al., 2016 (J Am Chem Soc), Schiff bases [Logan et al., 2016], and bioorthogonal molecular tags [Bae e al., 2018]. High polarization percentage, short signal build-up times, low cost, and scalability make PHIP and SABRE promising modalities for studying metabolism in vivo by magnetic resonance techniques [Hovener et al., 2018].</p><p id="p-0086" num="0077">Currently, the main obstacle to para-H<sub>2</sub>-based polarization techniques in biomedicine is the presence of heavy metal-based complexes (referred to below as catalysts) in solution with hyperpolarized contrast agents. These catalysts are typically Rh-based (PHIP) and Ir-based (SABRE) metal&#x2014;organic compounds, and they &#x201c;catalyze&#x201d; the polarization transfer of spin order from para-H<sub>2 </sub>to the substrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). Their presence in solution is necessary to provide polarization transfer from para-H<sub>2 </sub>to the substrate [Barskiy et al., 2016 (Phys Chem Chem Phys)]; however, their administration in vivo should be avoided. Despite efforts to synthesize heterogeneous (HET) PHIP/SABRE catalysts [Kovtunov et al., 2008; Kovtunov et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2014]&#x2014;typically in the form of solid particles facilitating hyperpolarization of liquids and gases mixed with para-H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;no discovery has been reported of high (&#x3e;5%) polarization of biologically relevant molecules, a threshold for biomedical applications [Golman and Petersson, 2006].</p><p id="p-0087" num="0078">A two-step method as demonstrated herein, involving phase extraction and catalyst capture, can effectively and rapidly separate heavy metal-based polarization transfer catalysts from the biologically relevant hyperpolarized substrates of interest (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>). This technique, on the time scale of seconds, produces para-H<sub>2</sub>-based hyperpolarized contrast agents that are effectively isolated from metal complexes (i.e., the metal concentration is less than 1 ppb), as shown by analysis from high-resolution NMR and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0079">In the present study, SABRE hyperpolarization technique and the most efficient to date polarization transfer catalyst, [Ir(IMes)H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3]</sub>Cl (1), obtained via activation of the established Ir catalyst precursor 2 [Ir(COD)(IMes)Cl] (IMes=1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene; COD=cyclooctadiene) [Cowley et al., 2011] are used. <sup>15</sup>N-labeled pyridine (98% <sup>15</sup>N, Sigma-Aldrich 486183) was used as a substrate (S). Detailed experimental procedures of the catalyst solution preparation and activation are further described below.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0080">For extraction experiments, the SABRE hyperpolarization technique was used with pyridine, the most studied SABRE substrate [Adams et al., 2009]. A homemade, automatically controlled polarizer executed the activation and transfer steps of the extraction method (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>). After hyperpolarization buildup via para-H<sub>2 </sub>bubbling in the organic phase, pyridine can be efficiently transferred to the aqueous phase, while 99.0-99.9% of the catalyst complex 1 remains in the organic phase; these results are verified by <sup>1</sup>H -NMR and ICP-AES data (see TABLE 7 below). This observation verifies recent findings [Iali et al., 2017] indicating that most of the SABRE catalyst tends to remain in the organic phase during the extraction process. However, there is still a measurable amount of catalyst in the aqueous phase solution (1-10&#x3bc;M), constraining the direct applications of this approach to biomedicine [Reineri et al., 2011]. While iridium complexes are generally considered to be &#x201c;slightly toxic&#x201d; (i.e., LD<sub>50 </sub>dosage is 500-5000 ppb) [Egorova and Ananikov, 2017], cytotoxicity studies performed with an activated SABRE reaction mixture showed a reduction in cell viability due to the presence of 1 [Manoharan et al., 2018]. One should note that the detectable presence of iridium in the aqueous phase after extraction is not surprising because studies of Truong et al. conclusively demonstrated water solubility of 1 after activation in methanol (while 2 is not soluble in water) [Truong et al., 2014]. Therefore, despite the fact that the extraction process allows removal of the main portion of the metal complex, additional filtration steps are necessary to achieve full biocompatibility.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0081">In order to prepare metal-free aqueous solutions containing hyperpolarized tracers, we propose a new catalyst capture technique. This technique involves the use of metal scavenging agents to completely eliminate metal quantities from aqueous solutions. Multiple metal scavenging agents' affinity for 1 were tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>). Remarkably, the commercially available mercaptopropyl silica (QuadraSil MP, Sigma-Aldrich 679526) and 2-mercaptoethyl ethyl sulfide silica (Sigma-Aldrich 745111) were shown to capture 1 most effectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>). The mercaptopropyl silica, however, showed better performance in capturing the Ir complex on a short time scale (under 10 s), shown below. This result is critical because hyperpolarized compounds must be cleared from the polarization transfer catalyst as quickly as possible to preserve high nuclear spin polarization after the capturing process. Lifetimes of several tens of minutes for <sup>15</sup>N hyperpolarized tracers have been successfully demonstrated Theis et al., 2016].</p><p id="p-0091" num="0082">Interestingly, despite some scavengers having similar functionality (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>), they perform quite differently (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>). Nitrogen-containing scavengers (#2 and #4) show generally poorer performance compared to sulfur-containing scavengers (#1, #3, and #6). However, the most striking difference is observed between somewhat similar scavengers #3 and #5. This difference can be attributed to the short hydrocarbon chain and different support structure (polystyrene) of #5, which sterically hinder interaction of the bulky complex 1 with &#x2014;SH groups.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0083">The ability of mercaptopropyl silica (scavenger #3) to rapidly capture the Ir complex from the aqueous solution was tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>). Treating 0.5 mL of the aqueous solution of 1 with only 10 mg of mercaptopropyl silica for less than 10 s reduces the metal amount by approximately 60% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>). Increasing the scavenger mass to 100 mg per 0.5 mL of solution allows complete capture of the Ir complex from solution (the measured Ir concentration is 0.3&#xb1;0.3 ppb, less than the ICP-AES detection sensitivity). This efficient capturing ability is due to the significant concentration of surface thiol groups relative to the concentration of Ir in solution. Indeed, the surface &#x2014;SH concentration is 1.0-1.5 mmol/g, while the amount of 1 in the studied solutions (0.5 mL) was only 2.0-3.0 &#x3bc;mol. Given the scavenger loading, this corresponds to a two orders of magnitude scavenger excess compared to the metal complex, a prerequisite for efficient and rapid metal capture.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0084">In order to demonstrate that hyperpolarization can survive the catalyst capture process, additional measurements were performed. Unfortunately, due to experimental limitations and the absence of the <sup>15</sup>N detection capabilities on the benchtop NMR spectrometer, it was not possible to perform automated catalyst capture using the setup described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. However, <sup>15</sup>N NMR measurements carried out with 100 mM pyridine-<sup>15</sup>N solution in methanol-d<sub>4 </sub>at 9.4 T with 21 mg of the added mercaptopropyl silica confirmed that the scavenger does not noticeably affect the hyperpolarization level and its lifetime. Indeed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>, E shows that the <sup>15</sup>N NMR signal of pyridine-<sup>15</sup>N is only decreased slightly (by &#x2dc;20%) due to the presence of the scavenger. This decrease can be attributed to the catalyst capture process rather than to accelerated <sup>15</sup>N relaxation induced by the presence of the scavenger. When the capturing process is complete, attempts to polarize the solution again do not lead to <sup>15</sup>N NMR signal observation, additionally confirming the efficacy of the capture process.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0085">Interestingly, the measured T<sub>1 </sub>is increased by a factor of &#x2dc;10 when the hyperpolarized sample is stored at an elevated field of 0.15 T after production in the &#x3bc;T field compared to storage in the Earth's field (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). This result is similar to the recent observation of the prolonged <sup>15</sup>N lifetime of metronidazole at &#x2dc;0.3 T [Shchepin et al., 2018]. This result indicates that the final design of the para-H<sub>2</sub>-based polarizer should include precise control of the magnetic field at the site where catalyst extraction and/or capture are performed.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0086">In conclusion, a new catalyst capture technique that can be used alone or concurrently with phase extraction has been demonstrated herein. When used in conjunction with phase extraction (i.e., when the initial catalyst concentration in water is less than 0.1 mM), one can completely remove the SABRE catalyst from solution in seconds (the Ir concentration is 0.3&#xb1;0.3 ppb as confirmed by ICP-AES). This result opens the path to produce metal-free aqueous boluses of hyperpolarized contrast agents for in vivo MRI detection. The presented methodology can be further upgraded by using capturing agents that allow recycling of polarization transfer catalysts. Two-step extraction and metal capture approaches can potentially enable higher polarization levels (due to higher solubility of para-H<sub>2 </sub>in the organic phase), which is synergistically compatible with bioorthogonal ligation strategies and, ultimately, biomedical translations.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Automated Polarizer</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0087">Experiments were carried out using a home-built, automatically controlled polarizer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>).

First, ICPAES was utilized to determine the best scavenger from 6 available scavengers (TABLE 4). Then, the performance of the best scavenger (capturing efficiency vs. mass of the added scavenger) was evaluated. Finally, the experiments were conducted to check if metal capture is possible by simply pushing the liquid through the syringe filled with the best scavenger.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0094">In the initial experiment (Catalyst Capture A), a solution of 4.0 mM non-activated Iridium catalyst and 55 &#x3bc;L pyridine in 4.0 mL of methanol was used to measure the Ir capture efficiency of multiple scavengers. 10.2 mg of iridium catalyst and 55 &#x3bc;L of pyridine were added to a 5.0 mL vial; 4.0 mL of methanol was then added. After the solution was mixed, it was transferred to a 10 mm NMR tube by micropipette for activation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0095">Continued experiments (Catalyst Capture B) measured iridium catalyst capture by adding varying masses of QuadraSil MP (Sigma Aldrich 679526) to aqueous solutions, shaking for 10 seconds and separating scavengers from the solution via centrifugation. The 4.4 mM iridium catalyst initial solution contained 11.3 mg of catalyst and 100 &#x3bc;L of pyridine in 4.0 mL of methanol. The solution was prepared in a 5.0 mL vial and transferred to a 10 mm NMR tube by micropipette for activation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0096">Catalyst Capture C experiments measured the Iridium catalyst capture efficiency using varying masses of QuadraSil MP loaded into syringes. 5 mM of non-activated iridium catalyst was prepared in 10 mL of 30:70 ethanol:water. 31.8 mg of the catalyst was first dissolved in 3 mL ethanol; sonication allowed complete dissolution of the catalyst. 7 mL of distilled water was added once the mixture was homogenous. The solution was then transferred to a 10 mm NMR tube for activation.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0097">For all catalyst capture experiments, activation was achieved by bubbling para-H2 through each sample for 40 minutes at a flow rate of 120 sccm and a pressure of 100 psi using the homebuilt automated polarizer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">ICP-AES Sample Preparation</heading><p id="p-0109" num="0098">For Catalyst Capture A, the activated catalyst sample was transferred to a beaker. Methanol was evaporated completely from the solution by blowing steady air on top of the solution surface while submerging the beaker in a water-bath held under 60&#xb0; C. The beaker was then refilled with 4.0 mL of distilled water. The solution was distributed into seven Eppendorf tubes (0.5 mL of the solution transferred into each tube). 10 mg of six different metal scavenging agents were put into each tube (TABLE 4). The control sample (vial #7) did not contain any metal scavenging agent. Each Eppendorf tube was vigorously shaken for 10 seconds and left for 12 hours. Then 0.45 mL of the liquid was transferred into a Corning Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube (Nylon membrane, pore size 0.22 &#x3bc;m, non-sterile) and centrifuged for 2 minutes to completely separate the QuadraSil MP microparticles from the aqueous solution. 0.375 mL of the liquid was extracted, transferred into a separate container, and diluted with 6 mL of 2% HNO<sub>3(aq) </sub>to give a total volume of 6.375 mL in each sample.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0099">For Catalyst Capture B, the activated sample was transferred into a beaker, and methanol was evaporated following the same procedure as Catalyst Capture A. The beaker was refilled with 4 mL of distilled water, and the solution was divided into eight small Eppendorf tubes to give a total volume of 0.475 mL in each tube. Varying masses of QuadraSil MP were added to the first seven tubes; vial 8 had no filter added. Each Eppendorf tube was vigorously shaken for 10 seconds and then 0.45 mL of the liquid was briefly transferred into a Corning Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 minutes to completely separate the QuadraSil MP microparticles from the aqueous solution. 0.375 mL of the solution was transferred into a test tube (15 mL centrifuge tubes, VWR International) for ICP testing after adding an additional 6 mL of 2% HNO<sub>3 </sub>(aq). The total volume for each of the eight samples was 6.375 mL.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0100">For Catalyst Capture C, five syringes were prepared, each containing a different mass of QuadraSil MP (TABLE 8).

Using a micropipette, 0.375 mL of each filtrate and 6 mL of 2% HNO<sub>3 </sub>were added to each corresponding test tube to create samples D1-D5 (TABLE 8).

This sample contained 3 mg of non-activated iridium catalyst ([IrCl(COD)(IMes)], lending a final concentration of 7.8 mM of the activated catalyst in methanol-d4. The sample was activated by bubbling parahydrogen at 30 sccm for &#x2dc;40 min under &#x2dc;7 atm hydrogen; flow rate was controlled by the mass flow controller (Sierra Instruments, Monterey, Calif.).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0104">The <sup>15</sup>N-SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization procedure was conducted similarly to that described earlier [Barskiy et al., 2016 (J Am Chem Soc)]. The sample solution was bubbled with parahydrogen (&#x2dc;50% para-fraction) at 120 sccm under &#x2dc;7 atm inside the magnetic shield for a period of 1 min. The additional &#x3bc;T magnetic field was created using a custom-built solenoid coil and a power supply. After stopping parahydrogen bubbling the sample was quickly transferred from the shield to the Earth's magnetic field followed by sample insertion and acquisition of the <sup>15</sup>N NMR spectrum via a 400 MHz Varian VNMRS console and 10 mm dual-channel broadband liquids probe (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>). Addition of 21 mg of the metal scavenger QuadraSil MP (Sigma Aldrich 679526) to the sample resulted in the decrease of the <sup>15</sup>N NMR signal of pyridine-<sup>15</sup>N (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>E</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">15N NMR Relaxation Measurements</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0105">Nuclear spin polarization decay measurements are described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0106">The following documents are referred to in the Description.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0107">Adams, R.
