For example, an actuator driven by a solenoid engages with a rotating member and applies a force in a return direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The accelerator pedal module has the rotating member driven by the actuator, and a physique thereof becomes large. Further, for example, when it is not necessary to operate the accelerator pedal such as in autonomous driving, it is conceivable to store the accelerator device under a vehicle floor in order to flatten the vehicle floor. However, if an actuator for storing the accelerator device is provided separately, the physique of the accelerator device will further increase. An object of the present disclosure is to provide an accelerator device capable of adjusting a reaction force of a pedal lever and storing at least a part of components of the accelerator device such as in autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An accelerator device includes an inner housing, a pedal lever, an urging member, and an actuator. The inner housing is supported to the outer housing by a support member. The pedal lever is rotatably supported to the inner housing in response to a stepping operation. One end of the urging member abuts on the inner housing and the other end abuts on the pedal lever to urge the pedal lever in a closing direction. The actuator drives the inner housing in an opening direction and the closing direction of the pedal lever. As a result, a reaction force of the pedal lever can be adjusted, and at least a part of the components can be stored in the outer housing during autonomous driving or the like.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, an accelerator device according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. Hereinafter, in a plurality of embodiments, a substantially equivalent configuration will be denoted by an identical reference, and explanation thereof will be omitted. A first embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an accelerator device <b>1</b> includes an inner housing <b>11</b>, an outer housing <b>12</b>, a pedal lever <b>20</b>, a motor <b>40</b> as an actuator, a power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the like show a state in which a cover (not shown) provided on a front side of the paper surface of the inner housing <b>11</b> is removed, and hatching is described in the parts that become the cross section on the cover surface side.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inner housing <b>11</b> houses an internal movable mechanism such as a pedal <b>35</b> inside. The inner housing <b>11</b> is attached to the outer housing <b>12</b> and can be driven with respect to the outer housing <b>12</b> by driving the motor <b>40</b>. The outer housing <b>12</b> is fixed to a floor panel FP that constitutes a part of a vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pedal lever <b>20</b> includes a pad <b>21</b>, an arm <b>31</b>, and a pedal <b>35</b>, and is integrally driven by a driver's step-on operation or the like. The pad <b>21</b> is provided to be operable by a driver's step-on operation. The pad <b>21</b> is rotatably supported to the inner housing <b>11</b> by a fulcrum member <b>23</b> provided on the inner housing <b>11</b>. The pedal lever <b>20</b> of the present embodiment is a so-called &#x201c;floor-placing type&#x201d; in which the pad <b>21</b> is provided so as to extend in a direction along one surface of the inner housing <b>11</b>. A wall portion of the inner housing <b>11</b> facing the pad <b>21</b> is referred to as a top wall <b>111</b>, and a wall portion of the inner housing <b>11</b> facing the top wall <b>111</b> is referred to as a bottom wall <b>112</b>. A side guard <b>24</b> is a member provided in a gap between the pad <b>21</b> and the inner housing <b>11</b> so that the driver's foot is not interposed between the pad <b>21</b> and the inner housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The arm <b>31</b> couples between the pad <b>21</b> and the pedal <b>35</b>. The top wall <b>111</b> of the inner housing <b>11</b> is formed with an opening through which the arm <b>31</b> is inserted. The opening through which the arm <b>31</b> is inserted is formed so as not to interfere with the arm <b>31</b> in the entire range of pedal operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The pedal <b>35</b> is housed in the internal space of the inner housing <b>11</b> and is rotatably supported to the inner housing <b>11</b>. One end of the pedal <b>35</b> engages the arm <b>31</b>. With this arrangement, the pad <b>21</b>, the arm <b>31</b>, and the pedal <b>35</b> are integrally driven by an operation of the pad <b>21</b> by the driver.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A pedal urging member <b>37</b> is a compression coil spring, one end of which is fixed to the pedal <b>35</b> and the other end of which is fixed to the bottom wall <b>112</b> to bias the pedal <b>35</b> toward the top wall <b>111</b>. When the pad <b>21</b> is not stepped by the driver, the arm <b>31</b> comes into contact with a fully closed stopper <b>17</b> formed inside the top wall <b>111</b>. Further, when the driver steps on the pad <b>21</b>, the pad <b>21</b> comes into contact with a fully open stopper (not shown) formed on an outside of the top wall <b>111</b>. Hereinafter, the state in which the arm <b>31</b> is in contact with the fully closed stopper <b>17</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;accelerator fully closed state&#x201d;, and the state in which the pad <b>21</b> is in contact with the fully open stopper is referred to as a &#x201c;accelerator fully open state&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> generates an accelerator opening signal according to a rotation angle of the pedal <b>35</b>. The accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> has a detection circuit including, for example, a Hall element that detects the direction of a permanent magnet embedded in a shaft portion (not shown) of the pedal <b>35</b>. As the accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b>, any sensor other than the Hall element may be used as long as it can detect the accelerator opening. The accelerator opening signal is output to an ECU <b>100</b> via a connector (not shown).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The motor <b>40</b> is, for example, a DC brushless motor, and is provided so as to be accommodated in the outer housing <b>12</b> together with the inner housing <b>11</b> and the like. The ECU <b>100</b> controls the drive of the motor <b>40</b> based on the detection values of an accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> and a housing position sensor <b>49</b>. The driving force of the motor <b>40</b> is transmitted to the outer housing <b>12</b> via a power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>. As a result, the inner housing <b>11</b> is driven by the driving force of the motor <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Since the accelerator device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is provided with the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, the accelerator device <b>1</b> is configured to be able to actively drive the inner housing <b>11</b> in an accelerator closing direction (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;returning direction&#x201d;) and in an accelerator opening direction (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;stepping direction&#x201d;) by the driving force of the motor <b>40</b>. The accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b>, the housing position sensor <b>49</b> described later, the ECU <b>100</b>, and the accelerator opening/closing direction are not shown except in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> includes a feed screw <b>51</b>, a female screw block <b>52</b>, a link mechanism <b>53</b>, and the like. The feed screw <b>51</b> is housed in a case <b>46</b>. The case <b>46</b> is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape and is fixed to the inner housing <b>11</b>. The feed screw <b>51</b> is a male screw and is rotationally driven by the motor <b>40</b> via a gear mechanism <b>410</b>. The gear mechanism <b>410</b> has a first gear <b>411</b> and a second gear <b>412</b>. The first gear <b>411</b> rotates integrally with the motor <b>40</b>, and the second gear <b>412</b> that meshes with the first gear <b>411</b> rotates integrally with the feed screw <b>51</b>. As a result, the feed screw <b>51</b> is driven by the motor <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The female screw block <b>52</b> is formed in a rectangular shape in a plan view, and a female thread that meshes with the feed screw <b>51</b> is formed inside. The female screw block <b>52</b> moves in an axial direction of the feed screw <b>51</b> due to the rotation of the feed screw <b>51</b>. The feed screw <b>51</b> side may be a female thread and the screw block side may be a male thread. The male and female threads according to the embodiments described later may also be replaced.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The link mechanism <b>53</b> includes a housing connecting member <b>531</b>, a link <b>532</b>, and a joint <b>533</b>. One end of the housing connecting member <b>531</b> is rotatably connected to the inner housing <b>11</b>, and the other end thereof is slidably connected to the outer housing <b>12</b>.

Therefore, as shown on the left side of the paper surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, the hysteresis loop is closer to the left side of the paper surface so that the reaction force with respect to the tread surface angle &#x3b8;d becomes larger according to the housing angle &#x3b8;2 as compared with the case where the inner housing <b>11</b> is in the initial position. As a result, the driver feels that the reaction force has increased, although the tread surface position Ta does not change. The upper limit of the reaction force applied to the pedal lever <b>20</b> is defined by the urging force of the pedal urging member <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The output V1 corresponding to the pedal angle &#x3b8;1 and the output V2 corresponding to the housing angle &#x3b8;2 are output to the ECU <b>100</b>.

As a result, the inner housing <b>11</b> and the pedal lever <b>20</b> and the like are integrally moved to a bottom wall <b>127</b> side of the outer housing <b>12</b>. Further, the outer housing <b>12</b> is formed with a pad contact portion <b>125</b> that can come into contact with the pad <b>21</b>.

It should be noted that &#x201c;same surface&#x201d; means that a step of about an assembly error is allowed. For example, by storing the accelerator device <b>1</b> during autonomous driving or the like, a large space under the driver's feet can be secured, so that comfort is improved.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the accelerator device <b>1</b> includes the inner housing <b>11</b>, the pedal lever <b>20</b>, the pedal urging member <b>37</b> as the urging member, and the motor <b>40</b> as the actuator.

The motor <b>40</b> is controlled based on the detection values of the accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> and the housing position sensor <b>49</b>.
