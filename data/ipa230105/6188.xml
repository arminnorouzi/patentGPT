The vent <b>32</b><i>a </i>protrudes from the vent plate <b>32</b> toward the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, and is electrically connected to the first auxiliary plate <b>34</b> by being in contact therewith through the through hole. The vent plate <b>32</b> may have a notch <b>32</b><i>b </i>around the vent <b>32</b><i>a </i>to guide breakage of the vent <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The vent <b>32</b><i>a </i>may cut off the electrical connection with the first auxiliary plate <b>34</b> by being broken under a predetermined pressure condition to release an internal gas to the outside. That is, when the internal pressure of the case <b>20</b> rises due to the generation of the gas, the notch <b>32</b><i>b </i>may be broken beforehand to allow the gas to be discharged to the outside through an exhaust port <b>31</b><i>d </i>to be described later, thereby preventing the rechargeable battery from exploding.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In addition, when the vent <b>32</b><i>a </i>is broken due to an abnormal reaction, the electrical connection between the vent plate <b>32</b> and the first auxiliary plate <b>34</b> is broken. Accordingly, the electrical connection between the cap plate <b>31</b> electrically connected to the vent plate <b>32</b> and the first auxiliary plate <b>34</b> is broken, and thus no more current flows.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">The cap plate <b>31</b> includes a center plate <b>31</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the center pin <b>60</b> which is the center of the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, a plurality of branch portions <b>31</b><i>b </i>extending from the center plate <b>31</b><i>a </i>toward the gasket <b>40</b>, and a coupling plate <b>31</b><i>c </i>inserted and coupled into the gasket <b>40</b> to connect ends of the branch portions <b>31</b><i>b. </i>The exhaust port <b>31</b><i>d </i>is formed between adjacent branch portions <b>31</b><i>b, </i>which are opened to the outside.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">The branch <b>31</b><i>b </i>is connected to the center plate <b>31</b><i>a </i>in a bent state from the coupling plate <b>31</b><i>c </i>so that a center of the cap plate <b>31</b> can protrude to the outside of the case <b>20</b>. The cap plate <b>31</b> may be electrically connected to the positive collector plate <b>11</b><i>d </i>through the vent plate <b>32</b>, the second auxiliary plate <b>38</b>, the first auxiliary plate <b>34</b>, and the lead tab <b>37</b>, so as to be used as a positive terminal of the rechargeable battery. Therefore, the connection with a terminal of an external device may be facilitated by forming the center of the cap plate <b>31</b> to protrude to the outside of the case <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">Meanwhile, a PTC element may be formed along a second plate of the cap plate <b>31</b>, and may be inserted and coupled into the gasket <b>40</b> while being stacked between the second plate of the cap plate and an edge of the vent plate.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">The positive temperature element <b>35</b> may be installed between the cap plate <b>31</b> and the vent plate <b>32</b> to control a current flow between the cap plate <b>31</b> and the vent plate <b>32</b> depending on an internal temperature of the rechargeable battery.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">When the internal temperature is within a predetermined range, the positive temperature element <b>35</b> acts as a conductor to electrically connect the cap plate <b>31</b> and the vent plate <b>32</b>. If the internal temperature exceeds the predetermined temperature, the positive temperature element <b>35</b> has electrical resistance that increases to infinity. As a result, the positive temperature element <b>35</b> may block the flow of a charged or discharged current between the cap plate <b>31</b> and the vent plate <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">The edge of the cap assembly <b>30</b> is inserted into the opening of the case <b>20</b> after being inserted into the gasket <b>40</b> in a form where the vent plate <b>32</b>, the positive temperature element <b>35</b>, and the cap plate <b>31</b> are stacked. Then, the cap assembly <b>30</b> is clamped to the opening of the case <b>20</b> through a clamping process. In this case, a beading portion <b>21</b> that is recessed in a radial central direction of the case <b>20</b> and a clamping portion <b>22</b> that clamps an outer circumference of the gasket <b>40</b> into which the cap assembly <b>30</b> is inserted may be formed on the case <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be practical exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the scope of the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0099"><b>10</b>: electrode assembly</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100"><b>11</b>: positive electrode</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101"><b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>13</b><i>a</i>: electrode active region</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102"><b>11</b><i>b, </i><b>13</b><i>b </i>: electrode uncoated region</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103"><b>11</b><i>aa: </i>positive composite material</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104"><b>11</b><i>aa</i><b>1</b>, <b>13</b><i>aa</i><b>1</b>: first composite material</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105"><b>11</b><i>aa</i><b>2</b>, <b>13</b><i>aa</i><b>2</b>: second composite material</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106"><b>11</b><i>ab: </i>first substrate</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107"><b>11</b><i>d</i>: positive current collecting plate</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108"><b>12</b>: separator</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109"><b>13</b>: negative electrode</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110"><b>13</b><i>aa</i>: negative composite material</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111"><b>13</b><i>ab</i>: second substrate</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112"><b>13</b><i>d</i>: negative current collecting plate</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113"><b>20</b>: case</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114"><b>21</b>: beading portion</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115"><b>22</b>: clamping portion</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116"><b>30</b>: cap assembly</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117"><b>31</b>: cap plate</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118"><b>31</b><i>a: </i>center plate</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119"><b>31</b><i>b</i>: branch</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120"><b>31</b><i>c</i>: coupling plate</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121"><b>31</b><i>d</i>: exhaust port</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122"><b>32</b>: vent plate</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123"><b>31</b><i>a: </i>vent</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124"><b>32</b><i>b</i>: notch</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125"><b>33</b>: insulating member</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126"><b>34</b>: first auxiliary plate</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127"><b>35</b>: positive temperature element</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128"><b>37</b>: lead tab</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129"><b>38</b>: second auxiliary plate</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130"><b>40</b>: gasket</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131"><b>50</b>: insulating plate</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132"><b>51</b>: opening</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133"><b>52</b>: insulating pad</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134"><b>60</b>: center pin</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
