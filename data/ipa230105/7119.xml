id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Aspects of the invention determining a threat score of a call traversing a telecommunications network by leveraging the signaling used to originate, propagate and terminate the call. Outer-edge data utilized to originate the call may be analyzed against historical, or third party real-time data to determine the propensity of calls originating from those facilities to be categorized as a threat. Storing the outer edge data before the call is sent over the communications network permits such data to be preserved and not subjected to manipulations during traversal of the communications network. This allows identification of threat attempts based on the outer edge data from origination facilities, thereby allowing isolation of a compromised network facility that may or may not be known to be compromised by its respective network owner. Other aspects utilize inner edge data from an intermediate node of the communications network which may be analyzed against other inner edge data from other intermediate nodes and/or outer edge data.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="140.72mm" wi="152.40mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="219.37mm" wi="154.26mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="219.37mm" wi="154.26mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="238.59mm" wi="162.81mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="245.19mm" wi="173.48mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="246.89mm" wi="176.02mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="246.46mm" wi="173.74mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="248.75mm" wi="185.50mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="248.75mm" wi="177.63mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="248.75mm" wi="177.72mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="197.44mm" wi="177.72mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="239.35mm" wi="173.14mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="239.35mm" wi="178.73mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="239.35mm" wi="178.73mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="239.35mm" wi="178.73mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="205.99mm" wi="156.38mm" file="US20230007120A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

This signaling began as audible tones sent along with the voice media (in-band signaling) and has become nearly entirely separated from the audible portion of a call (out-of-band signaling).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">There are several formal signaling recommendations, loosely called standards, which define the message structure, content, and interfaces that signaling systems can rely on to properly operate within the global communications networks. Predominantly, the two sets of recommendations used today are ITU-T's Q.700 series, globally, and as standardized by ANSI in North America. The signaling in fixed/wireline and mobile are similar, and mobile signaling has better standardization globally as interoperability for roaming and billing was paramount to its maturity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As per ITU-T Q.1200 series (Fixed networks&#x2014;INAP CS2) and CAMEL (Mobile networks&#x2014;CAP), communications signaling is able to be routed to a Service Control Point (SCP) from the Service Switching Point (SSP) or Mobile Switching Center (MSC), whereas the SSP/MSC is the initial (originating) and final (terminating) telephony facility nodes responsible for enabling a telephone call. Due to the complexity of the myriad network standards implementations in the fixed-line systems, signaling is based on a hand-off from one network node to the next along the way to the predefined destination SSP/MSC, with neither regard to nor certain knowledge about the previous or pending participating nodes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">This node-hopping approach is great at allowing for disparate networks to work independently for a call to cooperatively traverse their networks, regardless of the previous network participant and any pending participating network. However, this node-hopping also allows a caller's identity to be obfuscated due to lack of true origination, or total route taken, information being available; lack of authorization-verification of the information provided by the calling party (e.g. the caller's phone number is not validated for authorized usage by the calling party or their device); and lack of reliability that any validating information provided in the signaling, at any point in the call, will not be deleted or manipulated by any other point in the call prior to the destination SSP/MSC.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Since billing is the one core business function that all networks implement, the most mature aspect of the signaling networks is the billing integration at call origination and similar services such as re-routing (e.g. freephone <b>800</b> numbers, voicemail). Moreover, mobile networks, due to the nomadic nature of the devices used to expose billable subscribers to the network services, have had the opportunity to be significantly more mature in the areas of billing control and the standardization of billing interoperability.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While the billing systems of each network may be the most mature functions, they are typically the least exposed to other networks for interrogation, corroboration, or collaboration regarding the validity of the information provided, or not provided, in the call signaling messages. Thus there is a real potential for threats to exist from parties that are able to hide behind networks that have either fallen victim to unauthorized origination of a call with false data or that are known to remove identifying information when used as one of the potentially hundreds of nodes participating to deliver a telephone call to its destination.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment of the invention, details and statistics about the SSP/MSC utilized to originate the call (aka &#x201c;outer-edge data&#x201d;) are compared with historical, or third party real-time data, to determine the propensity of calls originating from those facilities to be categorized as a threat. Storing the outer edge data before the call is sent over the communications network permits such data to be preserved and not subjected to manipulations during traversal of the communications network. This allows identification of threat attempts based on the outer edge data from origination facilities, thereby allowing isolation of a compromised network facility that may or may not be known to be compromised by its respective network owner. The result of this embodiment allows for various actions to be taken such as the following: protection of called parties from obvious and potential threats before the call terminates within their network; informing of network owners of compromised network facilities; the informing of law enforcement and regulatory bodies of threat activity; and/or isolation of network traffic originating from a compromised network facility to further enrich threat detection capabilities. Other actions which may be taken include dynamic or pre-determined actions such as redirecting the telephone call to a new destination, such as high-skill agent, an IVR/VRU system for automated authentication, or voicemail; splitting off the audio to a recording, monitoring, or listening facility; and/or hanging-up on the caller.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment of the invention, analysis of the variance (ANOVA) of the accuracy of the details, of the caller and its device from the perspectives of the SSP/MSC utilized to originate the call and the SSP/MSC utilized to terminate the call are compared to identify the threat potential. This allows identification of variance between the data supplied from the less-trusted origination network facilities and the, potentially, more trusted termination network facilities. Through this variance it may be determined that information was either provided incorrectly via the origination network, and/or modified, or removed, while in-transit to the termination network. With further interrogation of network owners' systems, regulators' databases, and/or data-systems malicious variances may be isolated from the benign.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment of the invention, International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI), or equipment identifier, is tracked across calls as well as compared in real-time, or post-call, against third party data to determine threat levels. By tracking devices used across disparate calls and third party systems, validity of information supplied regarding the device of the caller may be assessed. With this information, statistical information about the usage of the device can be determined, and outliers such as time of day, repeat calling, location anomalies, and ownership status may be identified, thereby allowing protection of called parties, and their callers, from threat attempts made on the latter's devices or behalf. Additionally, by knowing the device type, internal and third party systems may be further interrogated for relevant data which may be matched against that device type.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment of the invention, the International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI), or subscriber identifier, is tracked across calls as well as validated against the presumed responsible carrier. This information may be requested by trusted networks. By knowing the unique subscriber identifier, internal and third party systems may be interrogated for relevant corroborating information against the accuracy of the data provided in the call by the signaling as well as the caller. For example, signaling data may indicate that the call is originating from a MSC that is serving base stations in northeastern Atlanta, Georgia, but the IMSI is used to interrogate the subscriber's carrier network to determine the subscriber is currently not in call and is attached to a MSC serving base stations in Reno, Nevada; with this information exposed to the call-center agent, which the phone call is directed to, the agent can see the conflicting information and casually ask the caller where they are calling from to determine corroboration, or further variance, and act accordingly.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment of the invention, a combination of IMEI and IMSI may be tracked to isolate obfuscation attempts of one call by a subscriber and/or device from a valid call by that same subscriber or device, allowing for the true identification of at least one participant in a threat attempt. With these two pieces of data available for some or all of the calls monitored as described herein, internal and third party real-time, historical, and caller-authentication information can be used to determine if the device and/or subscriber is part of an organized group perpetrating threats. For example, many &#x201c;burner phones&#x201d; may be used during an organized attack against victims across multiple channels such as email, phone, chat, and social messaging. By collecting and analyzing this data combination when available, both new and growing fraud rings, as well as false positives, may be identified. A good example is the case where a burner phone is used multiple times but with new subscriber identification module (SIM) cards. It may be determined that for a confirmed threat attempt, each SIM card that was ever used in the device is suspect, as is any future device in which the SIM card is used. Additionally, any appearance of a &#x201c;valid&#x201d; utilization of any portion of a suspected combination anytime between mismatched IMEI and IMSI threat attempts may be monitored, to uncover the real identity of a SIM card owner in possession of a fraud-suspected device, or vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The systems and methods described herein may be used during remaining portions of the call to more thoroughly detect the alleged threat, and additional information may be gathered. Further, media or law-enforcement may be involved.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Customized SCP functionality may be utilized to manage full signaling control of a portion of the call. The device, subscriber, content, and/or third party events may be analyzed to determine the potential for multi-call threat identification.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Signaling control may be routed to a dynamic signaling control system during call setup, prior to either party hearing ringing. The signaling control may be used to authenticate, authorize, and monitor both the communications signaling and media to provide any of the following: enhanced billing services, in conjunction with the explained invention; validation of the information supplied in a single call to assess the possibility of a malicious call; and/or analysis of the patterns and information supplied across multiple disparate calls&#x2014;and non-call derived events&#x2014;from multiple points in the call beyond just call-setup.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a path <b>100</b> of a typical telephone call in the conventional art.

The intelligent network application platform then stores the caller's outer-edge data (<b>1220</b>). Next, the intelligent network application platform analyzes the originating (from carrier facilities at the originating side of the call) outer edge data against historical or real time outer edge data to determine a threat score (<b>1260</b>). It is noted that &#x201c;threat score&#x201d; may be a single number indicating a degree of potential threat posed by the call but, in practice, the threat score encompasses an ensemble of parameters. This ensemble of parameters may include negative, positive, or neutral results of each of the points of analysis, such as network match, proximity match, time of day, social activity, multi-factor authentication, and other such items available now and in the future to corroborate the participants on the call.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Furthermore, the methods of determining threat score (<b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>, and <b>1266</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i></figref>), in and of itself, and known, conventional processes and all known and future developed threat score calculations are within the scope of the various inventions disclosed herein. Non-limiting examples of such conventional threat score calculation processes include determining the route that the call took to arrive at the monitored point in the call setup via point-codes, comparing the originating line type to the phone number type, comparing the p-asserted identity to the user provided calling party phone number, comparing the location of call origination to the current location of the phone number, comparing the calling party's phone number to public and private lists and systems for complaints, known telemarketers/robocallers, known call states, and known fake/unassigned numbers. Aspects of the present inventions greatly improve such threat score calculations by leveraging call signaling which provides a richer collection of and more reliable data for use in such threat score calculations.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Thereafter intelligent network application platform may take one or more actions (<b>1290</b>) such as providing real-time scoring data regarding the call to the called party, sending a signal to the carrier to terminate the call, send a signal to the carrier to route the call to law enforcement or otherwise notify law enforcement about the high threat score call, and/or inform network owners of potentially compromise network facilities. The actions may also include dynamic or pre-determined actions such as redirecting the telephone call to a new destination, such as high-skill agent, an IVR/VRU system for automated authentication, or voicemail; splitting off the audio to a recording, monitoring, or listening facility; and/or hanging-up on the caller.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates, for example, a case in which a call has been placed by phone <b>310</b> to carrier facilities <b>315</b> and the call has been received by an enterprise customer call center <b>355</b> or other node (terminal or intermediate). In addition to steps <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1290</b> which are described above the following additional steps may be performed. One optional step is the intelligent network application platform sending a resume message to the carrier signaling facilities at the originating side of the call (<b>1230</b>). The intelligent network application platform also receives a signal (e.g. SS7 request or MAP request or CAP request or API request) from the carrier signaling facilities at the terminating side of the call (<b>1240</b>). The intelligent network application platform may optionally send an instruction for call joining and/or event monitoring to the carrier signaling facilities at the terminating side of the call (<b>1250</b>). Next, the intelligent network application platform compares or otherwise analyzes the originating (from carrier facilities at the originating side of the call) outer edge data against the terminating-side outer edge data (<b>1262</b>) to determine a threat score (<b>1262</b>). Due to the data vulnerability within the communications network such outer edge data may be changed or otherwise compromised in some way. Thus, by analyzing the outer edge data from the originating side before malicious entities can change the outer edge data against the outer edge data from the terminating side one can detect any such changes or data compromises. It is further noted that this comparison/analysis (<b>1262</b>) may be performed using outer edge data from an intermediate node (e.g. carrier facilities <b>335</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and/or terminating node (e.g. enterprise customer call canter <b>355</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrates, for example, a case in which a call has been placed by phone <b>310</b> to carrier facilities <b>315</b> and the call has been received by an enterprise customer call center <b>355</b> or other node (terminal or intermediate).

Inner edge data may be collected from intermediate nodes. Inner edge data may include new data in combination or as a replacement to the outer edge data as well as any intermediate nodes that participated between the outer edge and the monitored inner edge. The accompanying outer edge or previous-participating-node data may be the exact, abstracted/translated, or different information that the respective data available in the outer edge and previous-node data. For example, the cell-id from which a mobile originated phone call may be available as the raw identifier (number) in the outer edge data, but the respective data in the inner edge data may have been transformed by an intermediary node to be the zipcode of where that cell-id resides or is closest to. Similarly intermediate-nodes may inject their own data or routing decisions, such as call forwarding, that results in the original called party data from the outer edge data to be included in a new field (e.g. original-called-party-number) and the intermediary-node-modified value for called-party-number being the forwarded-to number. For the inventive this variance is both expected to be possible and useful when it does and doesn't happen because aspects of the invention can use the relative statistical inconsistencies to help identify potential unexpected participants in a future call. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>c </i></figref>adds a receive step <b>1240</b> that receives, at the intelligent network application platform, a signal (e.g. SS7 request or MAP request or CAP request or API request) from the carrier signaling facilities of an intermediate node. In response, inner edge data is stored (<b>1245</b>). It is noted that multiple requests to multiple, different intermediate nodes (e.g. a loop of steps <b>1240</b> and <b>1245</b>) may be used to capture and store inner edge data from multiple intermediate nodes. Next, the intelligent network application platform compares or otherwise analyzes the originating (from carrier facilities at the originating side of the call and/or at a terminating side of the call) outer edge data against inner edge data (of one or more intermediate nodes) to determine a threat score (<b>1264</b>).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>d </i></figref>leverages inner edge data capture, storage and analysis at multiple intermediate nodes. First, an intelligent network application platform receives a signal (e.g. a SS7 request or MAP request or CAP request or API request) from the carrier signaling facilities of a first intermediate node (<b>1215</b>). The intelligent network application platform then stores the call's inner-edge data (<b>1220</b>) from that first intermediate node. The intelligent network application platform may then receive another signal (e.g. a SS7 request or MAP request or CAP request or API request) from the carrier signaling facilities of a second intermediate node (<b>1242</b>). The intelligent network application platform then stores the call's inner-edge data (<b>1245</b>) from that second intermediate node. It is noted aspect of the invention may conduct additional capture and storage of inner edge data from other (3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, . . . nth) intermediate nodes.
