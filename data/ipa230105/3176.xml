The use of high temperature resin systems is desired as such systems can impart high temperature strength to the resulting fiber reinforced polymeric structures. Unfortunately, when a high temperature resin is employed, processes are limited to articles that do not contain a heat sensitive material, such as a rocket propellant, because high oven temperatures are required to cure such resins and such elevated temperatures impart excessive thermal energy to the heat sensitive materials. Excessive thermal energy can lead to decomposition of heat sensitive materials or even auto ignition of such heat sensitive materials in the specific case of rocket propellant, creating the conditions for an explosive event.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Applicants recognized that the source of the problem was not only the amount of thermal energy provided by a curing oven but even more importantly the rate at which such thermal energy is applied. In short, Applicants recognized that the true source of the problem was the lack of thermal control afforded by typical resin curing methods. Applicants discovered that controlled thermal curing of resins systems having a broad range of curing temperatures could be achieved, without imparting excessive thermal energy to heat sensitive materials, by electromagnetic induction processes that are pulsed processes that can be optionally coupled with cooling steps between pulses.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, Applicants disclose electromagnetic induction processes that are pulsed processes that can be optionally coupled with cooling steps between pulses, fiber reinforced polymeric structural cases made by such processes, and articles comprising such cases, as well as methods of using such cases and articles.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to resin compositions, fiber reinforced polymeric structures, and electromagnetic induction processes for making same. Such electromagnetic induction processes may be pulsed processes that can be optionally coupled with cooling steps between pulses.

from preferred to more preferred to most preferred with i) being most preferred. Such resin systems improve the mechanical properties of composites made therefrom under conditions of elevated temperatures and high stress. Although nonylphenol is a conventionally utilized proton donor catalyst in the catalysis of cyanate esters due to its high boiling point, molecularly, it is a nine carbon aliphatic chain that often acts as a residual plasticizer in cured polycyanate networks, reducing resin and resultant mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The inventors discovered that when proton donor alcohols that are molecularly aromatic and smaller in size are used in substitute for nonylphenol, such as m-cresol, less could be used to solubilize a prescribed amount of metal chelate, and a lesser amount in concert with its smaller size significantly improves resin and resultant composite mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The inventors also discovered that the elevated temperature mechanical properties of resin and resultant composites can further be improved by blending dicyanate esters (type A or E) with novolac-type cyanate esters. Novolac-type cyanate esters impart a higher cured crosslink density which increases resin softening temperature and thus mechanical properties. The higher the ratio of novolac-type cyanate ester used, the higher the resultant elevated temperature properties, at the expense of resin toughness. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a graph showing the effect of cyanate ester resin composition and catalyst type on the interlaminar shear strength of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites at a testing temperature of 200 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0042">Bisphenol E dicyanate ester, bisphenol A dicyanate ester, and novolac cyanate ester can be obtained from Lonza, Inc., 412 Mt.

Rockets especially those fueled by solid propellant, often feature structural components such as cases manufactured from fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Such reinforcing fiber is designed to carry operational loads while the adhesive resin maintains fiber architecture and transfers associated stresses. A more recent advancement in the implementation of FRPs in rockets occurred in the <b>1990</b><i>s </i>with the application of Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEMs) in the strap-on solid boosters of Titan IV, known as the Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade (SRMU), resulting in a 25% increase in payload capability to orbit. GEMs and most other FRP composite rocket cases in production utilize resin systems, with softening (glass transition) temperatures under 200&#xb0; C., with most being under 100&#xb0; C. During operation, rocket components experience significant aerodynamic heating from friction with air and internal heating from the combustion of fuel and oxidizer. As such, FRP composites sometimes do not trade well with steel during the design stage of rocket components despite their higher strength-to-weight ratio, because in applications where significant thermal load is input to those components, high levels of protective insulation are required which incurs a volumetric and parasitic mass penalty.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046">FRP structural cases such as those used in the production solid fueled rockets are typically produced by the technique of filament winding, where continuous rovings of fibers impregnated with an adhesive polymeric resin are deposited onto an insulated sacrificial mandrel. After winding, the adhesive resin is typically cured through the use of a convection oven. The mandrel is then extracted, and the finished case product is loaded with propellant through a slurry casting process, and the nozzle and igniter are attached. This conventional manufacturing method limits the complexity of the design of the rocket, however, as it is difficult to incorporate propellant grain features beyond what can be poured into a cylinder, thrust diverting hardware, or other features that would enhance the performance of a rocket. Thus, in some instances it is advantageous to manufacture certain articles such as a rocket from the inside outwards. In the instance of a solid fueled rocket, this would entail fabrication of the solid fuel grain first and any associated propellant combustion management devices, followed by deposition of the structural case onto the propellant grain mandrel, and ultimately case cure. When filament winding is employed in the manufacture of the case, the process is termed case-on-propellant (CoP) or direct filament winding (DFW). To ensure safety and component survival during DFW, a low temperature curing resin is utilized as resin curing must be conducted in a manner which does not cause damage to the propellant, and in the worst case scenario, catalysis of an ignition event. The low temperature resin results in a low performance case requiring additional parasitic mass for fortification.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047">High temperature resins are typically avoided as high oven temperatures are required to cure such resins and such elevated temperatures impart excessive thermal energy to heat sensitive materials. Applicants recognized that the source of the problem was not only the amount of thermal energy provided by a curing oven but even more importantly the rate at which such thermal energy is applied. In short, Applicants recognized that the true source of the problem was the lack of thermal control afforded by typical resin curing methods.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048">Electromagnetic induction heating is a process where an article (workpiece), normally steel, is exposed to an oscillating magnetic field generated by an alternating current (AC) passing through a coil (inductor). The workpiece couples to the inductor and current is generated within, which is normally concentrated near the workpiece surface in proximity to the coil, and current depth can be tuned through modulation of the AC current's frequency. Due to the intrinsic resistance to the flow of electrical current within the workpiece, heat is generated, termed resistance heating. This process is normally relegated to the melting, sintering, or heat treating of steels that contain some concentration of iron atoms, as these are magnetically polarizable thus amenable to current generation through hysteresis. The process can be applied to any workpiece material that is conductive and somewhat magnetic in nature. A unique advantage of the induction process is that heat generation within a workpiece is instantaneous and can be turned off and on judiciously.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">Applicants recognized that electromagnetic induction processing would be advantageous in the thermal cure of FRP articles such as rocket components, in particular those that are filament wound. Applicants recognized that Graphite (carbon) fibers are reasonably good conductors of electrical current and bear an intrinsic resistance, therefore if electrical current could be passed through such fibers then they would be expected to generate heat, which in turn could be utilized to cure an adhesive resin system. Because of the instantaneous nature of the induction heating process, in contrast to oven cure which relies on much slower transport by conduction and convection, and because the heating source could be modulated judiciously, the process facilitates precise heat transfer control to underlying components, especially those that are heat sensitive. Applicants discovered that precisely controlled thermal curing of resin systems having a broad range of curing temperatures could be achieved, without imparting excessive thermal energy to heat sensitive materials by electromagnetic induction processes. Pulse processing that can be optionally coupled with cooling steps between pulses provide additional degrees of control, and various temperatures within the workpiece can be monitored and integrated into feedback loops to the induction system's power supply through measuring devices such as infrared cameras and thermocouples.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">Applicants disclose a fiber reinforced polymer composite structure, said fiber reinforced polymer composite structural case comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0051">a) at least one fiber, said fiber having an electrical resistivity of from about 1&#xd7;10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}-2 ohm-cm to about 1&#xd7;10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}&#x2212;4 ohm-cm and forming a continuous circuit within said fiber reinforced polymer composite structure; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0052">b) at least one resin having a glass transition temperature of greater than 200&#xb0; C., preferably from about 200&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C., most preferably from about 300&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C., said resin optionally comprising a catalyst, said catalyst increasing the rate of crosslinking in said resin;<br/>said fiber reinforced polymer composite structure being a filament wound or fiber placed fiber reinforced polymer composite structural case.

The low temperature resin results in a low performance case requiring additional parasitic mass for fortification and protection.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0062">In the present specification, Applicants disclose an improved process of making FRP composite structural cases and articles comprising such cases wherein an electromagnetic induction heating system which drives alternating (AC) electric current through a hollow metallic conducting coil at a frequency in the kHz regime is employed. The conducting coil may be fabricated from hollow copper tubing. Water may be flowed through the copper coil while it is energized to remove any heat that is generated from the intrinsic electrical resistivity of the copper. The coil can take the form of different architectures, including solenoid, pancake, and variants where they are conformed to the surface curvature of cylindrical or domed shaped CFRP as typical of rocket motor cases. With a solenoid type coil, the motor case is situated within the inner diameter of the coil, whereas in a pancake configuration, the coil is wound in a planar configuration and would be situated near the surface of the CFRP. The magnetic fields generated by both types of coils are different. The magnetic field generated by a pancake coil is situated in the vicinity of the coil, exponentially decaying in intensity away from the coil surface. In solenoid coils, on the other hand, the magnetic field is generated in a much larger area within the coil, as well as outside to a lesser degree. The magnetic field strength may be tuned by the number of turns in a solenoid coil. The greater number of turns, the higher the resultant field strength. Coils may be shaped by filling them with a medium such as sand to prevent crimping of the internal channel during winding. CFRP is deposited onto a mandrel which does not couple (generate heat) to the magnetic field. Non-coupling mandrels can be fabricated from aluminum, rubber, glass reinforced composite, solid rocket propellant, etc. The CFRP is deposited onto the cylindrical mandrel by the processes of filament winding, hand layup, and/or tow/tape placement. Once the CFRP is fully deposited onto the mandrel, the induction coil configuration of interest is situated near the CFRP structure. This can be accomplished by a number of ways. In one method, a solenoid coil is situated around the cylindrical portion of the motor case, and the solenoid can be conformed through tapering to be in close proximity to the dome regions of the case. In another method, a bank of pancake coils can be situated near the surface of the CFRP. If complete CFRP coverage cannot be achieved due to the size of the CFRP structure to be processed or because of power limitations with the induction heating system, then the coil and induction work head can be installed onto the filament winding machine, tow/tape placement machine, or lathe, and a coil of small dimensions relative to the CFRP structure can be translated back and forth over the CFRP to promote heating. This technique has been shown to be able to provide a consistent temperature across high length/diameter cylindrical CFRP and is highly useful when power limitations with an induction heating system are faced, at the expense of heating time to a prescribed temperature. Specifically, in one example, a solenoid coil of three turns rendering a length of 3 inches, with an inner diameter of 6 inches was utilized by this method to process a cylindrical CFRP section that was 30 inches in length and 5.75 inches in inner diameter, with a thickness of 0.060 inches (<b>6</b> hoop layers). Following a slow temperature ramp to 149 degrees Celsius, that temperature was consistently maintained for 12 hours by translating the coil back and forth over the CFRP. The electrical current can be applied to the coil in a programmed manner to achieve a complex curing cycle for the adhesive resin in the CFRP. Temperature ramps and dwells can be achieved if the carbon fiber response as a function of power input is well characterized. An infrared camera is used to monitor the CFRP surface temperature during the process for the sake of tuning and quality control. In the process of case-on-propellant manufacturing, pulse curing has been found effective to control heat transfer to the internal insulation interface with the solid propellant grain. For example, if the desired CFRP cure temperature is 250 degrees Celsius and the surface of the solid propellant grain cannot exceed 60 degrees Celsius, a pulse can be instituted such that the CFRP reaches 250 degrees Celsius rapidly, and is maintained until the solid propellant interface reaches 60 degrees Celsius, as measured by an embedded thermocouple situated at that interface (use of a metallic thermocouple that does not couple to a magnetic field such as Type E is preferred). At that time, the pulse is turned off, and to efficiently transfer the heat away from the solid propellant interface, a convective cooling gas can be flowed over the CFRP. The cooling gas can be generated from the evaporation of liquid nitrogen for a cold temperature source, or could be compressed air or inert gas. Once the solid propellant interface temperature drops back down to a lower temperature, the next pulse can be instituted. This process can be repeated for any number of cycles until the desired total CFRP cure time is achieved and can be controlled through programmed communication feedback loops between thermocouples, an IR camera, the induction heating system, and the cooling system. In the event the case mandrel is not sensitive to temperature, a constant temperature can be maintained in the CFRP until full cure is achieved. The CFRP resin system can be tailored to cure quickly through the aid of catalysts, or selected to respond favorably to pulse type curing. The efficiency of the carbon fiber to generate heat is a function of induction heater power, current frequency, and layup architecture. Increasing power and frequency (especially the latter), augments carbon fiber response. A coil will self-tune to a specific frequency so this is typically not a readily adjustable variable but is rather coil architecture dependent. It has been observed that CFRP configured in a 90 degree orientation relative to the mandrel axis are most efficient in generating heat in the presence of a traditional solenoid coil (coil is oriented in same direction as fiber windings), but heat is also generated in layups of lesser angles.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0063">An induction heating system that can generate suitable coil frequencies typically uses a resonant circuit including a generator (power supply), capacitor, and inductor, which may be parallel or in series. A radio-frequency (RF) power supply may be used to generate the desired frequency ranges. Suitable types of RF power supplies include vacuum tube and solid-state. The former provides frequencies ranging from 200-450 kHz while the latter ranges from 50-450 kHz. Solid-state power supplies are particularly suitable because they typically provide the greatest frequency range. Such power supply may be powered by Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) output devices.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0064">Suitable commercial induction heating systems include Ambrell Corporation of Rochester N.Y.

Furthermore, these are examples of reduction to practice of the present invention and confirmation that the principles described in the present invention are therefore valid but should not be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0082">Example 1. A solid rocket motor case mandrel assembly, used as a substrate to manufacture a fiber reinforced polymeric structural case, consisting of any number of discrete solid propellant grains, is situated onto a cylindrical metallic shaft. The forward and aft ends of the propellant grain sub-assembly are capped with metallic polar fittings (bosses) that facilitate the installation of an igniter and nozzle once the structural case of the solid rocket is manufactured. The discrete propellant grains may have been cast and cured into pre-molded rubber-based internal insulation, or the insulation may be deposited onto the pre-cured propellant grain assembly after their positioning onto the shaft. Any components associated with divert attitude control systems may also be incorporated into the propellant grain sub-assembly. Once the case mandrel is completely assembled, it is inserted into the vice chucks of a filament winding machine. Carbon fiber tows that are pre-impregnated with cyanate ester resin and a cure reaction rate enhancing catalyst are then filament wound onto the mandrel in any programmed sequence of polar, helical, and hoop layers. Hand layup of unidirectional 0 degree layers and/or braided sleeves may also be instituted. Once the filament winding process is complete, a coil comprised of hollow coper tubing, formed to a classical solenoid configuration, is situated over the filament wound rocket motor case (the workpiece) in close proximity to its surface (within 5 mm). The coil is connected to an induction heating machine comprised of a work head and power supply. The induction heating machine is programmed for a specific amperage/time cycle based on predetermined parameters known to not cause excessive heat transfer to the propellant grain. Alternatively, thermocouples are positioned at strategic locations at the propellant grain/internal insulation interface, with leads emanating from the mandrel assembly, which are connected to the induction heating machine's control software, facilitating a feedback loop for pulse power control. The induction coil is energized with alternating electrical current at the natural frequency of the coil and work head circuit, and for effective processing, the frequency should be above 50 kHz. The induction coil while energized creates a magnetic field of a strength determined by the current amperage, coil diameter, and number of coil turns. This magnetic field in turn generates an electrical current through any conductor within the workpiece, with the strongest generated current in close proximity to the coil. Therefore the strongest current is generated within the conductive carbon fiber. Because of the intrinsic electrical resistivity of the fiber, heat is generated as the current flows most effectively through the continuous carbon fiber. Due to the orientation of the solenoid coil, current is most effectively generated in the hoop layers (those oriented perpendicular to the shaft axis), and as such, those layers generate the most heat. Heat generated within the carbon fiber is transferred to the cyanate ester resin, precipitating its curing reaction. The cyanate ester is optimally cured at 150 degrees Celsius for one hour, followed by at least one hour at 220 degrees Celsius. However, the propellant grain-internal insulation interface should not be allowed to exceed 60 degrees Celsius for significant time. At the point that this interface temperature reaches 60 degrees Celsius, the electromagnetic pulse is terminated. The carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) structure is then allowed to cool either passively or actively. In active cooling, a stream of gaseous nitrogen is passed over the CFRP surface, and when the interface cools down to 30 degrees Celsius, the next electromagnetic pulse is initiated. The magnitude of the depth of pulse cooling drives the length of the next heating pulse. Electromagnetic pulse heating and cooling cycles are implemented until target extent of cure of the CFRP resin is achieved.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0083">Example 2. A process according to Example 1 is implemented, however in this Example 2, the coil is configured to have axial lobes that are parallel to the axis of the filament wound CFRP laminate. This type of coil will more so generate heat in the polar and helical layers, which form the domes. Further, a coil can be configured and implemented having both solenoid and axial elements.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0084">Example 3. A process according to Example 1 is implemented, however in this Example 3, a thermoplastic resin such as poly(ether-ether-ketone) is used as the CFRP adhesive resin. A shrink tape or film or other pressure intensifying medium such as silicone rubber is situated over the CFRP laminate. During induction heating processing of the CFRP, heat generation that is transferred to the pressure intensifying media enables a compaction force to the CFRP laminate which consolidates the thermoplastic matrix.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0085">Example 4. In another example, the filament winding mandrel is comprised of a metal. This mandrel is monolithic in structure. Ideally, the comprising metal is chosen to weakly couple to the magnetic field generated by the induction coil (for example, aluminum is a good candidate) such that the adhesive resin used in the filament winding process does not degrade due to excessive thermal exposure during processing. After the filament wound composite is deposited onto the mandrel and cured, the mandrel may be left in or it may be extracted. This process could be used in the manufacture of composite pipes, rods, poles, blades, etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0086">Example 5. In this example, the process illustrated in Example 4 is implemented, however, instead of processing discrete objects by batch methods, the process is utilized in a continuous manner. Long, continuous sections of filament wound composite are processed in a discrete section of induction coil to cure the composite resin. After passing through the induction coil element, the processed continuous article may be cut into discrete sections for the mass production of a specific part at a higher rate.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0087">Example 6. In this example, the process described in Example 4 is implemented, however in this application the mandrel is metallic and puzzle type, or comprised of plaster, or comprised of a water soluble tooling material (e.g. particulates bound by sodium silicate, polyvinyl alcohol, or polyvinylpyrrilidone, or a mandrel comprised of a water soluble salt). After induction cure of the filament wound composite on this type of mandrel, the mandrel is extracted. In the case of a metallic puzzle mandrel, it is disassembled through polar openings and extracted piece by piece. In the case of plaster, it is broken and the resultant pieces are extracted. In the case of water soluble tooling, the mandrel is washed out. Through use of this type of mandrel, more complex shapes may be manufactured, such as turbine blades and crankshafts.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0088">Example 7 Boat Mast: A preform having the desired inner geometry is made. Then, flat panels of defined dimensions are cut from carbon fiber unidirectional mat prepreg on a two dimensional routing table. The flat panels are laid up by hand onto the preform. After a prepreg layer is installed, plastic tape is deposited under tension onto the prepreg surface to compress, debulk, and remove creases. Prior to deposition of the next prepreg layer, the plastic tape is removed, unless it is the last layer, which is left on. After all prepreg is installed onto the preform, breather cloth is placed onto the surface of the plastic film. Typically, to cure the prepreg resin, the entire boat mast assembly is processed under vacuum and pressure in an autoclave. However, the magnetic induction cure process is implemented to eliminate such timely and costly step. To do so, once breather cloth is installed, the assembly is bagged in the same manner as would be done if autoclave processing, but a pressure intensifying medium silicone rubber sheeting is installed onto the breather cloth's surface, followed by winding of glass fiber under high tension onto the surface of the silicone. The part assembly could then be situated in a magnetic induction coil and the resin cured.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0089">Example 8 Piping/Tubing: Carbon fiber composite tubing and piping is made by first cutting prescribed patterns of unidirectional and/or woven prepreg with a Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machine. Those flat patterns are roll wrapped into tubes onto a mandrel. Once all prepreg layers are deposited, the outer surface of the prepreg is wrapped with a plastic layer of film under tension or compression tape which acts to compact the composite material during resin cure. The piping/tubing assembly is inserted into a magnetic induction coil and cured in a precise manner more quickly, than an oven to curing process thus improving unit throughput rate. After cure, the tape is removed and the mandrel is extracted to produce the finished parted.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0090">Example 9 Automotive Drive Shafts: Carbon fiber composite automotive drive shafts are made by first, mixing an adhesive resin for the carbon fiber filaments with particulate additives that provide another level of reinforcement. Continuous tows of carbon fibers are then drawn through a bath containing the resin mixture and deposited onto a mandrel having the prescribed inner dimensions of the shaft at prescribed angles by the process of wet filament winding. Once the winding is complete, compaction tape is deposited under tension to the composite surface to provide a compaction force during resin cure. The drive shaft assembly is cured in a more precise manner and more quickly, than can be achieved by oven curing, by situating a magnetic induction coil around the assembly while still on the filament winding machine, and the part is rotated by the winding machine chucks during resin cure. This processing step eliminates the need for an oven. Once the adhesive resin is cured, the compaction tape is removed, the mandrel is extracted, and metal ends are bonded to the ends of the drive shaft that will act as durable interfaces when installed into a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0091">Example 10 Adhesive Resin and Fiber Impregnation: a preferred resin system consisting of bisphenol E dicyanate ester and a novolac type cyanate ester resin, catalyzed by a combination of nonylphenol and a metal chelate such as copper(II)acetylacetonate, which is 70/30 bisphenol E dicyanate ester/novolac cyanate ester, and 2 phr nonylphenol and 360 ppm Cu<sup>2+</sup>, is prepared as follows: 700 grams of liquid bisphenol E dicyanate ester is added to a glass vessel. Then, 300 grams of liquid novolac type cyanate ester is added to the same vessel. The two cyanate ester components are heated to 80&#xb0; C., using a hot plate, immersion bath, or jacketed vessel, and stirred until the mixture is homogenous and phases cannot be distinguished. Mixing is conducted either by a large magnetic stir bar or overhead mechanical agitator. Homogenization typically takes up to three hours, and once completed, the mixture is cooled to room temperature. In a separate glass vessel, most preferably a scintillation vial, 30 grams of liquid nonylphenol is added. Also added is 0.022 grams of copper(II) acetylacetonate, in the form of a blue powder. A magnetic stir bar is immersed into the liquid in the vial. The vial is then situated on a hot plate and the mixture is heated to 60-100&#xb0; C. The mixture is then stirred until homogenization is completed, as evidenced by disappearance of any particulate copper(II)acetylacetonate. This process typically takes up to 12 hours, and process time decreases with increasing temperature. Once this step is complete, the catalyst mixture is allowed to cool. Lastly, 20.015 grams of the catalyst mixture is added to the cyanate ester mixture, at room temperature, and stirred in either by hand or mechanically. The resultant cyanate ester blend with catalyst is then used in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced polymer towpreg. Resin impregnation into carbon fiber tows is performed using a suitable continuous impregnation machine, consisting at minimum, a resin reservoir, a resin deposition system, an impregnation die, and a fiber takeup (re-spooling system), with a fiber tensioning device. Resin is continuously deposited onto continuous carbon fiber tows and drawn through the impregnation die, followed by resultant towpreg re-spooling.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0092">While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of one or more embodiments thereof and while these embodiments have been described in considerable detail, they are not intended to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
