Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of recycling and processing of polyurethane foam, and particularly relates to the method of recycling and reusing thermoset polyurethane foam waste into a high value-added photocurable resin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Polyurethane has a versatile structural design and tunable performance that is usually used as foam, elastomer, coating, adhesive, synthetic leather, fiber, etc. As an important synthetic material, it is widely used in many fields such as aerospace, construction, transportation, medical, and textile. According to previous reports, the global annual output of polyurethane in 2016 has reached 18 million tons. It is expected that the annual output will exceed 26 million tons by 2021, and the corresponding value will exceed 79 billion US dollars. Amongst, polyurethane foam, as an important product, accounts for 67% of the global polyurethane consumption. Its pollution caused by random disposal is more serious due to its low density and large volume. (Thesis: Green and sustainable polyurethanes for advanced Applications and Polyurethane foams: past, present, and future). The recycling of polyurethane foam has become the focus of current sustainable development.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyurethane foam is a type of thermosets with a permanent chemical cross-linked network, which cannot be traditionally reprocessed. Polyurethane foam contains a large number of urea bonds, urethane bonds, and ester bonds, which can be reversibly exchanged under certain conditions. Utilizing the reversible properties of urethane bonds, Dichtel et al. introduced dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst to realize the reprocessing of polyurethane in a twin-screw extruder (Thesis: Reprocessing postconsumer polyurethane foam using carbamate exchange catalysis and twin-screw extrusion). However, the material will inevitably undergo degradation, resulting in performance reduction, because reprocessing occurs in high temperatures and shear environments. Our group disclosed a polyester/polyurethane recycling method (Patent: CN 111690169A) that can reuse the wastes by adding additives with amino/hydroxyl groups and catalysts. The structure and composition of new materials are different from the original material and the performance is better. However, this type of method requires the addition of large molecule or small molecule reactive additives.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The polyurethane foam can also be chemically decomposed into monomers or oligomers using methods such as ammonolysis and alcoholysis (patent: CN107955206A). This type of method uses small molecular alcohol or ammonia as degrading agents and utilizes the dissociation of urethane bonds or ester bonds to produce small molecules or oligomers. After separation and purification, the recycled product can be used as a raw material. However, this type of method has a long reaction time, low recycle efficiency, high cost, high energy consumption, and low value-added. For instance, alcoholysis, which is the most reported, usually requires several hours of thermal treatment at a high temperature of 160-250&#xb0; C. In addition, its recycled products are usually similar products with low added value. These factors make it impossible to promote this method on a large scale. The present invention develops a method for recycling with low energy consumption, low cost, and high efficiency. The regenerated product is a high value-added photocurable resin, which is expected to be used in photocurable coatings and 3D printing. The price of photocurable resin is ten or even hundreds of times that of original polyurethane foam, so the present invention has extremely high economic value.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a method for recycling and reusing polyurethane foam.
