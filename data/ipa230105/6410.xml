In the following description, the same or corresponding elements are designated by the same reference numerals, and a description of the same or corresponding elements will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The optical amplifier of the optical communication systems described in the related art described above has a large operating current, and a resistance loss of the optical communication systems increases according to the operating current of the optical amplifier. For this reason, the optical amplifier is required to have a low operating current.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One object of the present disclosure is to provide an optical amplifier having a low operating current.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">First, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in the following. An optical amplifier according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes one or more rare earth element-doped optical fibers each including one or more cores, two or more excitation light sources per single core of the one or more rare earth element-doped optical fibers, configured to emit excitation light for exciting a rare earth element added to the one or more rare earth element-doped optical fibers according to a driving current, and a synthesizing part configured to synthetize the excitation light emitted from the two or more excitation light sources per single core. Two or more cores are provided in total, and the excitation light emitted from the two or more excitation light sources per single core is synthesized and input with respect to each core.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a number exceeding one per single core is denoted by K, the light emitted from each of the K excitation light sources of the optical amplifier is synthesized and input to one core to excite this one core. This configuration enables the driving current of the excitation light source, required to obtain the optical power to excite this one core, to be approximately 1/K, thereby providing the optical amplifier having a low operating current.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The optical amplifier refers to an amplifier that does not convert an optical signal into an electrical signal, but directly amplifies the optical signal in a light state. The one or more rare earth element-doped optical fibers each including one or more cores, include a single rare earth element-doped optical fiber having a single core, a single rare earth element-doped optical fiber having multiple cores, multiple rare earth element-doped optical fibers respectively having a single core, multiple rare earth element-doped optical fibers respectively having multiple cores, or the like. The rare earth element-doped optical fibers having multiple cores include coupled multicore optical fibers, few-mode optical fibers, uncoupled multicore optical fibers, or the like. In the following description, the term &#x201c;multicore optical fiber&#x201d; refers to at least one of the coupled multicore optical fiber, the few-mode optical fiber, and the uncoupled multicore optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The number K exceeding one per single core refers to an integer or a decimal. For example, in a case where the optical amplifier described above includes 4 excitation light sources per two cores, the number K exceeding one per single core is 2. In a case where the optical amplifier described above includes 3 excitation light sources per two cores, the number K exceeding one per single core is 1.5.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operating current of the optical amplifier refers to a current used to operate the optical amplifier to obtain a desired amplification factor. The driving current for driving the excitation light source is at least a portion of the operating current of the optical amplifier. As the driving current becomes smaller, the operating current of the optical amplifier becomes smaller.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the optical amplifier described above, the two or more excitation light sources per single core are driven by the driving currents supplied from a plurality of driving circuits connected in series. For example, in a case where the driving currents are supplied to K excitation light sources, and K driving circuits are connected in parallel, because approximately the same driving current I needs to be supplied to each of the K driving circuits, a total of K&#xd7;I driving currents are required, to thereby increase the operating current of the optical amplifier. Because the K driving circuits are connected in series, the K driving circuits in their entirety can be driven by the driving current I, and the driving current can be reduced to approximately 1/K compared to the case where K driving circuits are connected in parallel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the optical amplifier described above, the synthesizing part may synthesize the excitation light emitted from the two or more excitation light sources per single core, according to at least one of synthesizing methods including a polarization synthesizing method, a light injection synchronization method, a complex resonator method, and a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) method. The optical amplifier described above can synthesize the excitation light emitted from the two or more excitation light sources per single core, according to any one of the synthesizing methods, or according to a combination of at least two of the synthesizing methods.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The polarization synthesizing method refers to a method of synthesizing a plurality of different polarizations, using a polarizing element, such as a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) or the like. The polarization refers to an electromagnetic wave, such as light, radio wave, or the like having a regular direction of oscillation of electric and magnetic fields. The light injection synchronization method refers to a method of synthesizing a plurality of different light, using a light injection synchronization phenomenon. The light injection synchronization phenomenon refers to a phenomenon in which an oscillation wavelength of a semiconductor laser is synchronized to a wavelength of external light, when the external light having the wavelength close to the oscillation wavelength is input to the self-oscillating semiconductor laser.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The complex resonator method refers to a method of synthesizing a plurality of different light, using a complex resonator. The complex resonator refers to a resonator having a plurality of resonators connected along a predetermined direction. The MOPA method refers to a method of synthesizing a plurality of different light, using a MOPA. The MOPA independently controls a first main oscillator (or seed light) and a second high-output oscillator, and extracts from the second oscillator high-output light in which the light emitted from the first oscillator and the second oscillator are synthesized.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the optical amplifier described above, the two or more excitation light sources per single core may include, in at least a portion thereof, a semiconductor laser group including a plurality of semiconductor lasers connected in series, and the plurality of semiconductor lasers included in the semiconductor laser group may be driven by a common driving current. To &#x201c;include, in at least a portion thereof, a semiconductor laser group&#x201d;, that is, including the semiconductor laser group in at least a portion of the two or more excitation light sources per single core, includes both a case where the two or more excitation light sources per single core are formed by a plurality of the semiconductor laser groups, and a case where the semiconductor laser group is included in a portion of the two or more excitation light sources per single core.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, in a case where the driving circuit for driving the excitation light source includes a current source, because the current source includes a resistor, a voltage drop becomes large as the number of driving circuits becomes large, thereby increasing the operating current of the optical amplifier. On the other hand, the optical amplifier described above can reduce the number of driving circuits in correspondence with the number of semiconductor laser groups, by driving the plurality of semiconductor lasers included in the semiconductor laser group using the common driving current. For this reason, it is possible to reduce the voltage drop, and make the operating current of the optical amplifier small. In addition, the optical amplifier described above can also make an area in which the driving circuits are disposed small, by reducing the number of driving circuits.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the optical amplifier described above, the rare earth element-doped optical fiber is preferably a multicore optical fiber having a plurality of cores covered with a single cladding. This is because, when the optical amplifier includes the multicore optical fiber, the number of cores included in the optical amplifier increases, and as the number of cores increases, the effect of reducing the operating current of the optical amplifier per single core becomes large.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case where the rare earth element-doped optical fiber is the coupled multicore optical fiber, a power coupling coefficient between adjacent cores among the plurality of cores is preferably 10 [/m] or higher. In the optical amplifier having the rare earth element-doped optical fiber having practical properties, a length of the rare earth element-doped optical fiber is approximately 10 [m] or greater. In this case, it is possible to sufficiently reduce a mode dependent gain (MDG), using the coupled multicore optical fiber with the power coupling coefficient between the adjacent cores of 10 [/m] or higher. Due to a redundancy obtained by reducing the MDG, the optical amplifier described above can reduce a difference in gains between modes, even when the optical power of the excitation light input to each of the cores greatly deviates from an optimum state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The power coupling coefficient refers to a power ratio between powers of light to be synthesized to light propagating in a waveguide mode other than a predetermined waveguide mode, and light propagating in the predetermined waveguide mode, among the light propagating in the predetermined waveguide mode. The power coupling function can be defined as a coefficient of a power coupling equation, where [m] a unit indicating meters, and [/m] is a unit indicating an inverse of meters. In the following description, alphabets indicated in square brackets &#x201c;[ ]&#x201d; refer to a unit.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, an optical communication system according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes one or more optical fibers configured to transmit optical signals, and the optical amplifier described above configured to amplify the optical signals transmitted through the one or more optical fibers. In this optical communication system, by providing the optical amplifier described above, the operating current of the optical amplifier can be made small, and a resistance loss of the optical communication system can be made small. Further, it is possible to reduce a temperature rise of the elements, such as the excitation light source and a power transistor in the optical amplifier, and extend a serviceable life of each of the elements.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILS OF EMBODIMENTS OF PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specific examples of the optical amplifier according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings.
