id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and more particularly to preventing network failures caused by logical loops in information handling systems that are provided in a physical loop configuration.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some information handling systems provide networking nodes (e.g., switches, routers, gateways, and/or other networking devices) that may be configured in various topologies to form a layer-2 domain, and those various topologies may result in some or all of the networking nodes in the layer-2 domain forming one or more physical loops that can cause issues with the network. For example, while physical loops may provide benefits such as redundancy, layer-2 logical loops resulting from those physical loops can consume the majority of network resources due to, for example, the rebroadcasting of network traffic between the networking nodes in the physical loop configuration. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a layer-2 protocol that is often used to prevent network traffic from looping on networking nodes in a physical loop configuration. However, when STP on even one of the networking nodes malfunctions, a logical loop may result that causes frame flooding in the entire topology, which can lead to scenarios where the entire layer-2 domain becomes non-functional.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the STP may fail or be temporarily ineffective for various reasons such as software issues that result from programming the STP state improperly, interop issues that may occur when a new networking node is brought into the layer-2 domain with a different default STP protocol, hardware issues such as a hardware freeze in which the STP opens but the data plane is not disturbed, topology changes that may introduce intermittent loops that only settle once STP converges (with the frame flooding affecting the performance of the networking nodes during the time the STP takes to converge), and/or other STP issues known in the art. As such, logical loops like those discussed above may not only bring down a cluster of networking nodes and the applications they provide, but may also bring down the network as well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved loop prevention system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment, Information Handling System (IHS) includes a processing system; and a memory system coupled to the processing system and including instructions that, when executed by the processing system, cause the processing system to provide a loop prevention engine that is configured to: receive, via an edge link that is connected to a computing device that is outside of a first Layer Two (L2) domain, a first data frame; generate a first loop breaker data frame by tagging the first data frame with a first loop breaker tag; and forward, via at least one L2 domain link that is coupled to one or more of a plurality of networking devices that are coupled together to form the L2 domain and that are linked together in a loop configuration, the first loop breaker data frame.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of an information handling system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of a loop prevention system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of a loop prevention system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of a networking device that may be included in the loop prevention system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are flow charts illustrating an embodiment of a method of preventing loops.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>F</figref> are schematic views illustrating an embodiment of the loop prevention system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> operating during the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> are schematic views illustrating an embodiment of the loop prevention system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> operating during the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>F</figref> are schematic views illustrating an embodiment of the loop prevention system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> operating during the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a data frame used during the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a loop breaker data frame used during the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, calculate, determine, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, communicate, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes.

However, while a specific networking device <b>300</b> has been illustrated and described, one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that networking devices may include a variety of components other than those described above that provide for the performance of conventional networking device functionality, as well as the functionality discussed below, while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, an embodiment of a method <b>400</b> for preventing loops is illustrated. As discussed above, networking devices may be provided in a physical loop configuration via, for example, network connections between the networking devices that provide redundancy if one of the network connections is to fail. However, L2 logical loops may occur in such physical loop configurations and can result in the continuous provisioning of the same network traffic to each networking device, thus clogging or otherwise wasting the network bandwidth. Conventional loop prevention systems utilize protocols such as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) that prevent such L2 loops, but the STP may fail due to software issues, hardware issues, and/or interop issues with one or more of the networking devices included in an L2 domain, and/or the STP may take some time to converge while data frame flooding of the networking devices in the L2 domain reduces performance of the networking devices until the STP converges.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The loop prevention system of the present disclosure addresses the issues discussed above by designating at least one of the networking devices as a loop breaker node that tags L2 data frames with a unique identifier. As such, if networking devices designated as loop breaker nodes receive an L2 data frame with their unique identifier, those networking devices may drop that data frame and then notify a network administrator that a logical loop is present on the loop prevention system. In some embodiments, a loop prevention tag may be attached to L2 data frames as those L2 data frames enter the L2 domain on edge connections, the networking devices that are designated as loop breaker nodes may express their unique identifier by marking a respective bit in that loop prevention tag before providing the L2 data frame to other networking devices in the L2 domain, and when the L2 data frame that includes the loop prevention tag leaves the L2 domain via an edge connection, the networking device that is egressing that L2 data frame via an edge connection may remove the loop prevention tag. As such, while a logical loop may exist in the L2 domain due to issues with STP, the systems and methods of the present disclosure will prevent the entire cluster of networking devices and applications from going down by dropping frames that are in the logical loop until those issues with the STP have been corrected.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The method <b>400</b> begins at block <b>402</b> where a networking device in an L2 domain receives a first data frame via an edge connection. In an embodiment, at block <b>402</b>, a first data frame may enter the L2 domain <b>202</b>. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the networking device <b>204</b> may receive a data frame <b>502</b> via the edge connection <b>212</b><i>a </i>(as illustrated by the bolded arrow on network connection <b>212</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). In another example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the networking device <b>218</b> may receive a data frame <b>702</b> via the edge connection <b>212</b><i>a </i>(as illustrated by the bolded arrow on network connection <b>212</b><i>a </i>in Fi. <b>7</b>A). In a specific example, the data frame <b>502</b>/<b>702</b> may be provided by an Ethernet frame according to the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, which one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize may include a tagged frame having a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) tag (e.g., a 4-byte VLAN tag), or an untagged frame that does not include a VLAN tag.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> the data frame <b>502</b> and/or <b>702</b> may be provided by a tagged frame <b>800</b><i>a </i>if the computing device <b>212</b> is another networking device such as a switch that inserted the VLAN tag. The tagged frame <b>800</b><i>a </i>(also referred to herein as a VLAN data frame) may include a destination address field <b>802</b> that may be 6 bytes and that include a destination address (e.g., a Media Access Control (MAC) address of the destination computing device) for the frame, a source address field <b>804</b> that may be 6 bytes and that includes a source address (e.g., a MAC address of the source computing device) for the frame, a VLAN tag field <b>806</b> that may be 4 bytes and that includes VLAN information, a Length/Type Field <b>808</b> that may be 2 bytes and that indicates a length and type of the frame, a data field <b>810</b> that may be 46-1500 bytes and that includes the data being sent, and a Frame Checksum (FCS) field <b>812</b> that may be 4 bytes and that includes a hash of the destination address, the source address, the VLAN tag, and the data, which one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will appreciate allows a destination computing device to compute the hash value of the received frame and compare it to the hash value included in the FCS field in order to determine whether the frame <b>800</b> has been corrupted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the VLAN tag field <b>806</b> may include a Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) field <b>806</b><i>a </i>that may be 2 bytes and that indicates the frame type, a Priority (PRI) field <b>806</b><i>b </i>that may be 3 bits and that indicates the 802.1p priority of the tagged frame <b>800</b>, a Canonical Format Indicator (CFI) field <b>806</b><i>c </i>that may be 1 bit and that indicates whether a MAC address is encapsulated in canonical format over different transmission media (e.g., to ensure compatibility between Ethernet and token ring networks), and a VLAN Identifier (VID) field <b>806</b><i>d </i>that may be 12 bits and that indicates the VLAN to which the tagged frame <b>800</b> belongs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, in other embodiments where the computing device is a host device/user terminal, the data frame <b>502</b> and/or <b>702</b> may be an untagged frame which may be substantially the same as the tagged frame <b>800</b><i>a </i>but without including the VLAN tag field <b>806</b>. As such, upon receiving the data frame <b>502</b> and/or <b>702</b> that is untagged, the networking device <b>204</b> or <b>218</b> may add the VLAN tag field <b>806</b> and recalculate the hash in the FCS field <b>812</b>. However, while the data frame <b>502</b> and/or <b>702</b> may be an untagged Ethernet frame when entering the L2 domain <b>202</b>, the discussions herein assume that the data frame <b>502</b> and/or <b>702</b> is provided by the tagged frame <b>800</b><i>a </i>and is already tagged with the VLAN tag field <b>806</b> for clarity of discussion. Furthermore, while a specific data frame received by a networking device via an edge connection of the loop prevention system <b>200</b> has been illustrated and described, one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that data frames may include a variety of fields other than those described above, and may be provided by other protocols that provide for L2 communications, while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method <b>400</b> then proceeds to block <b>404</b> where a first loop breaker data frame is generated by tagging the first data frame with a first loop breaker tag. In an embodiment, at block <b>404</b>, the networking device included in the L2 domain <b>202</b> that receives the data frame via an edge connection may tag the first data frame with a loop breaker tag. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the networking device <b>204</b> may generate a loop breaker data frame <b>504</b> that includes the data frame <b>502</b> provided with a loop breaker tag <b>504</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the networking device <b>218</b> may generate a loop breaker data frame <b>704</b> that includes the data frame <b>702</b> and a loop breaker tag <b>704</b><i>a</i>. In various embodiments, the loop breaker tag <b>504</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>704</b><i>a </i>may include a second VLAN tag. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, a loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>is illustrated that may provide the loop breaker data frame <b>504</b> and/or <b>704</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>may include the destination address field <b>802</b>, the source address field <b>804</b>, the VLAN tag field <b>806</b>, the Length/Type field <b>808</b>, the data field <b>810</b>, and the FCS field <b>812</b> that are included in the data frame <b>800</b><i>a </i>discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In addition, the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>may include the VLAN tag <b>807</b> that may be the loop breaker tag <b>504</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>704</b><i>a </i>discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>7</b>B</figref>, respectively. For example, the VLAN tag <b>807</b> may be identical to the VLAN tag field <b>806</b>, and may be positioned between the VLAN tag field <b>806</b> and the Length/Type field <b>808</b>. As such, the VLAN tag <b>807</b> may be 2 bytes and include a TPID field <b>807</b><i>a </i>that may be 2 bytes, a PRI field <b>807</b><i>b </i>that may be 3 bits, a CFI field <b>807</b><i>c </i>that may be 1 bit, and a VID field <b>807</b><i>d </i>that may be 12 bits. However, while specific loop breaker data frames <b>504</b> and <b>704</b> are illustrated and described, one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that other loop breaker tagged data frames may be provided while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The method <b>400</b> then proceeds to decision block <b>406</b> where the method <b>400</b> proceeds depending on whether the networking device is designated as a loop breaker node. In an embodiment, at decision block <b>406</b>, the method <b>400</b> may proceed depending on whether the networking device in the L2 domain <b>202</b> that received the data frame via the edge connection in block <b>402</b> and that generated the loop breaker frame in block <b>404</b> is designated as a loop breaker node. In some embodiments, prior to method <b>400</b>, an administrator may designate one or more of the networking devices <b>204</b>-<b>210</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, or one or more of the networking devices <b>204</b>-<b>210</b> and <b>218</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, as loop breaker node(s). For example, the administrator may access the networking devices <b>204</b>-<b>210</b>/<b>300</b> and/or <b>218</b>/<b>300</b> via the management device <b>216</b> to enable or disable a loop breaker node setting in the configuration settings <b>306</b><i>a </i>in the loop prevention database <b>306</b> of that networking device. In specific examples, the administrator may know which networking devices <b>204</b>-<b>210</b> and/or <b>218</b> are provided in a physical loop and may cause a logical loop if the STP were to fail, and may designate one or more of the networking devices in each physical loop as a loop breaker node. In some embodiments, each networking device designated as a loop breaker node may also be assigned a tag value in the configuration settings <b>306</b><i>a</i>. For example, because the loop breaker tag <b>504</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>704</b><i>a </i>may be provided by a VLAN tag <b>807</b> that includes 4 bytes (e.g., 32 bits) and the TPID field <b>807</b><i>a </i>may be used to identify the tag protocol as VLAN such that the frame is not dropped, the administrator may assign a bit of the remaining 16 bits provided by the VLAN tag <b>807</b> (e.g., the 16 bits provided by the PRI field <b>807</b><i>b</i>, the CFI field <b>807</b><i>c</i>, and the VID field <b>807</b><i>d</i>) to that loop breaker node. As such, in the embodiments described herein, up to 16 networking devices included in the L2 domain <b>202</b> may be designated as loop breaker nodes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">If, at decision block <b>406</b>, the networking device is designated as a loop breaker node, then the method <b>400</b> may proceed to block <b>408</b> where that networking device inserts a tag value in the first loop breaker tag associated with that networking device prior to the forwarding of the first loop breaker data frame via at least one L2 domain connection. In an embodiment, at block <b>408</b>, the networking device that received the data frame via the edge connection in block <b>402</b>, that generated the loop breaker frame in block <b>404</b>, and that is designated as a loop breaker node at decision block <b>406</b>, may provide a tag value in the loop breaker tag according to the tag value that networking device was assigned by an administrator. For example, the tag value may be associated with a bit of the loop breaker tag (e.g., the VLAN tag <b>807</b> of the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b</i>), and that networking device may set that bit (e.g., in the VLAN tag <b>807</b>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the networking device <b>204</b> may be designated as a loop breaker node, and may have been assigned a tag value of &#x201c;2&#x201d; that may be associated with the second bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> (which may be the second bit in the VID field <b>807</b><i>d</i>). In another example, the tag value assigned to the networking device <b>204</b> may be &#x201c;3&#x201d; that may be associated with the third bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> (which may be the second bit in the VID field <b>807</b><i>d</i>). As such, the tag value assigned to the networking device <b>204</b> may be any of &#x201c;1&#x201d;-&#x201c;16&#x201d; that may be associated with respective first to sixteenth bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a specific example, if there are three networking devices are designated as loop breaker nodes where the first networking device is assigned a tag value of &#x201c;7&#x201d;, the second networking device is assigned a tag value of &#x201c;3&#x201d;, and the third networking device is assigned a tag value of &#x201c;9&#x201d;, then the seventh bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> is set when the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>is received by the first networking device, the third bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> is set when the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>is received by the second networking device, and the ninth bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> is set when the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>is received by the third networking device. With reference to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the networking device <b>204</b> may insert a tag value <b>504</b><i>b </i>into the loop breaker tag <b>504</b><i>a </i>included in the loop breaker data frame <b>504</b>. Specifically, the networking device <b>204</b> may be assigned a tag value of &#x201c;2&#x201d;, and thus may mark/set the second bit of the VLAN tag <b>807</b> (e.g., by setting a logical &#x201c;0&#x201d; to a logical &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the second bit of VLAN tag <b>807</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If, at decision block <b>406</b>, the networking device is not designated as a loop breaker node, then the method <b>400</b> may proceed to block <b>410</b> where the networking device forwards the first loop breaker data frame via the at least one L2 domain connection. In an embodiment, at block <b>410</b>, the networking device included in the L2 domain <b>202</b> that received the data frame via the edge connection in block <b>402</b>, that generated the loop breaker frame in block <b>404</b>, and that is not designated as a loop breaker node at decision block <b>406</b>, may forward the first loop breaker data frame using conventional L2 forwarding techniques known in the art. For example, the networking device may reference the forwarding table <b>306</b><i>b</i>, along with the source address field <b>804</b> and the destination address field <b>802</b> in the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b</i>, to determine whether any of ports on that networking device are associated with a destination MAC address in the destination address field <b>802</b>. If a port is associated with the destination MAC address, the networking device may then forward the loop breaker data frame via that port, while if no ports are associated with the destination MAC address, the networking device may forward (e.g., flood) the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b </i>on all of its ports but the ingress port (e.g., the port on which the data frame/loop breaker data frame was received by the networking device). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the networking device <b>218</b> may forward the loop breaker data frame <b>704</b>, which is unmarked, via the L2 domain connection <b>218</b><i>a </i>(as illustrated by the bolded arrow on network connection <b>218</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Similarly, block <b>410</b> may be performed following block <b>408</b> such that the loop breaker data frame <b>800</b><i>b</i>, which includes a tag value from the networking device that is designated as a loop breaker node, is forwarded via at least one L2 domain connection of that networking device.
