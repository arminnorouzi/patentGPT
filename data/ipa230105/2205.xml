Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">An aspect of the present invention relates to a stacker crane.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-91157, a stacker crane, of which an elevation portion (elevating platform) to transfer an article is movable vertically along a mast extending in a direction, is known. When the stacker crane is used, for example, in a clean room, it is required to prevent transfer or spreading of dust generated by vertical movements of an elevation portion along a mast.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to solve this problem, in a mast including a channel member that has a web part which is an elevation surface and a pair of flange portions which are side surfaces, a covering member that covers an elevation area of the elevation portion moving vertically along the elevation surface is considered to be attached integrally to the flange portions. With this configuration, the covering member is required to be attached so as not to interfere with the elevation portion so that a space between the covering member and the elevation portion can be as small as possible. However, the covering member could interfere with the elevation portion or the space between the covering member and the elevation portion could be larger due to a distortion of the mast itself or an attachment error of the mast. Therefore, a mast in which a position of the covering member that can be easily adjusted with respect to the elevation portion is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide stacker cranes each including a mast capable of easily adjusting a position relative to an elevation portion of a cover integrally attached at a side surface portion of the mast.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A stacker crane according to an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a mast including an elevation surface defining portion including an elevation surface extending in a first direction in which an elevation portion is movable up and down and in a second direction perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the first direction and a pair of side surface portions extending in a third direction perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the first direction and the second direction from both edges of the elevation surface defining portion in the second direction toward an opposite side to a side at which the elevation portion is located. The pair of side surface portions are structured such that a cover to cover an elevation area of the elevation portion is integrally attachable to the pair of side surface portions. The mast includes a reinforcement portion between the pair of side surface portions in the second direction, extending in the third direction from the elevation surface defining portion toward the opposite side to the side at which the elevation portion is located, and having a higher stiffness than that of the pair of side surface portions and an adjuster located to provide a clearance relative to the elevation surface defining portion in the third direction, the adjuster being capable of extending in the second direction, and provided so that both edges thereof contact with the reinforcement portion and the pair of side surface portions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the stacker crane with this configuration, the adjuster, which includes a telescopic structure and is between the side surface portion and the reinforcement portion having a higher stiffness than that of the side surface portion, is extended, so that the side surface portion of the mast is pushed out. The adjuster is shrunk, so that the side surface portion of the mast is pulled. In the mast with this configuration, an intersection angle &#x3b1; of the side surface portion with respect to the elevation surface defining portion is adjusted by pushing or pulling the side surface portion. Therefore, states (location and posture) of the cover attached integrally to the side surface portion are also changed (moved) according to the intersection angle. As a result, in the stacker crane including the mast including the pair of the side surface portions, a position relative to the elevation portion of the cover attached integrally to the side surface portion can be adjusted easily.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a stacker crane according to an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a portion of the mast may include the elevation surface defining portion, the pair of side surface portions and the reinforcement portion has an E shape or an approximate E shape in a plan view seen from the first direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a stacker crane according to an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mast include a pair of flange portions connected to each other and standing up from both edges of a web portion provided on two channels, thus enabling the mast including the elevation surface defining portion, the pair of side surface portions, and the reinforcement portion to be formed easily.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A stacker crane according to an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention may further include the cover provided so as to cover the elevation area of the elevation portion and attached integrally to the pair of side surface portions, thus enabling to prevent transfer or spreading of dust when the elevation portion moves up and down.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a stacker crane according to an aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a fan filter may be provided in a recessed space defined by the elevation surface defining portion, the pair of side surface portions, and the reinforcement portion in a plan view seen from the first direction. With this configuration, the fan filter can be located between portions of the mast, thus allowing the total size of the mast to be compact.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to aspects of preferred embodiments of the present invention, in stacker cranes each including a mast, a position relative to an elevation portion of a cover attached to side surface portions of the mast is able to be adjusted easily.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above and other elements, features, steps, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional view showing a stocker including a stacker crane according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view showing a mast and a cover unit of the stacker crane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an adjusting member of the mast shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> are views showing states of side surface portions of the mast and the cover unit changed by the adjusting member.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, with reference to the drawings, preferred embodiments of aspects of the present invention will be described in detail.
