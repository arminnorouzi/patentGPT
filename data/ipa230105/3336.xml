Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to sensor systems, and more particularly to magnetic soft stops for limiting rotation of gimbals in sensor systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Camera systems, such as cameras carried by vehicles like aircraft, are commonly used to image scenes. The camera system generally includes a camera which is mounted to a gimbal. The gimbal typically rotates such that the camera field of view sweeps across the scene to be imaged while the camera collects image data. The image data is then communicated from the camera to an off-gimbal device for further processing or analysis. Where the camera communicates digitally roll-flex cabling is commonly used to connect the movable camera to static structure. Typically, mechanical hard stops are employed to limit rotation of the gimbal. The mechanical hard stop prevents the rotation of the gimbal from damaging the cabling and/or other structures in the camera system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One challenge to mechanical hard stops is that the contact between the gimbal and the hard stop can potentially damage the camera system, such as from forces exerted on the camera system by acceleration and/or shock during flight. Mechanical hard stops can also impose limitations on the imaging capability of camera systems employing more than one camera with differently sized fields of view.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such conventional methods and systems have generally been considered satisfactory for their intended purpose. However, there is still a need in the art for improved gimbal arrangements, sensor systems, and imaging methods. The present disclosure provides a solution for this need.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A gimbal arrangement includes a static structure, a gimbal supported for rotation relative to the static structure, an actuator operably connected to the gimbal and configured to rotate the gimbal relative to the static structure, and a magnetic soft stop. The magnetic soft stop is connected between the static structure and the gimbal to limit rotation of the gimbal relative to the static structure to within a predetermined range.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments the magnetic soft stop can include an electromagnet. The electromagnet can be fixed relative to the static structure. The electromagnet can be fixed relative to the gimbal. The magnetic soft stop can include a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet can be fixed relative to the static structure. The permanent magnet can be fixed relative to the gimbal. It is contemplated that the magnetic soft stop can include a ferromagnetic body. The ferromagnetic body can be fixed relative to the static structure or the gimbal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with certain embodiments, there can be no mechanical hard stop arranged between the gimbal and the static structure. The magnetic stop can conform in fit and form to a mechanical hard stop for a DB-110 sensor system. A controller can be operably connected to the magnetic soft stop. The controller can be disposed in communication with a memory having instructions recorded on the memory to activate the magnetic soft stop and limit rotation of the gimbal relative to the static structure to a predetermined range. A sensor, such as an imaging sensor can be fixed relative to the gimbal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is contemplated that the gimbal can be arranged about a roll axis relative to the static structure. The gimbal can be arranged about a pitch axis relative to the static structure. The gimbal can be a first gimbal and the gimbal arrangement can include a second gimbal. The magnetic soft stop can be a first magnetic soft stop and the gimbal arrangement can include a second magnetic soft stop. The second soft stop can be connected between the second gimbal and the first gimbal to limit rotation of the second gimbal relative to the first gimbal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A sensor system includes a gimbal arrangement as described above. A sensor is fixed relative to the gimbal. A controller is operably connected to the magnetic soft stop and is disposed in communication with a memory having instructions recorded on the memory to activate the magnetic soft stop and limit rotation of the gimbal relative to the static structure to a predetermined range. In certain embodiments the magnetic soft stop can include an electromagnet fixed relative to one of the static structure and the gimbal. A permanent magnet can be fixed relative to the other of the static structure and the gimbal. There can be no mechanical hard stop arranged between the gimbal and the static structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An imaging method includes, at a gimbal arrangement as described above, activating the magnetic soft stop and limiting rotation of the gimbal relative to the static structure to a predetermined range using the activated magnetic soft stop. It is contemplated that strength of opposition between an electromagnet fixed relative to one of the gimbal and the static structure can be increased as the gimbal rotates toward a limit of the predetermined range limit deceleration of the gimbal as the gimbal reaches the limit of the predetermined range.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features of the systems and methods of the subject disclosure will become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">So that those skilled in the art to which the subject disclosure appertains will readily understand how to make and use the devices and methods of the subject disclosure without undue experimentation, embodiments thereof will be described in detail herein below with reference to certain figures, wherein:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is side elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of a sensor system constructed in accordance with the present disclosure, showing a gimbal arrangement of the sensor system;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side elevation view of the sensor system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the faring removed, schematically showing the gimbal arrangement and a magnetic soft stop;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a axial end view of the sensor system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the faring removed, schematically showing first and second sensors carried by a roll gimbal with the magnetic soft stop arranged to limit rotation of the roll gimbal about a roll axis;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are axial end view of the sensor system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the faring removed, showing the gimbal in first and second positions;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>13</b></figref> are sectional views of the gimbal arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, schematically showing the magnetic soft stop implemented with permanent magnets and electromagnets;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a schematic view of the sensor system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, schematically showing a controller operatively connected to an electromagnet; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a block diagram of an imaging method, showing operations of the imaging method.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals identify similar structural features or aspects of the subject disclosure.

The systems and methods described herein can be used in intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems, such as in sensor systems having two or more sensors, though the present disclosure is not limited to ISR systems or to sensor systems having two or more sensors.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, sensor system <b>102</b> is shown. Sensor system <b>102</b> includes gimbal arrangement <b>100</b> and is enveloped within the interior of a faring <b>104</b>. Faring <b>104</b> includes a window <b>106</b> which provides a viewing area for data collection from a scene <b>10</b> located outside of faring <b>104</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment window <b>106</b> is a first window and faring <b>104</b> includes at least one second window, e.g., a second window <b>108</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and a third window <b>110</b>. It is contemplated that sensor system <b>102</b> be arranged as an ISR sensor system, such as an ISR system carried by an aircraft <b>12</b>. Examples of suitable ISR sensor systems include dual-band ISR sensor systems, such as DB-110 sensor systems, available United Technologies Aerospace Systems of Charlotte, N.C.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, gimbal arrangement <b>100</b> is shown. Gimbal arrangement <b>100</b> includes a static structure <b>112</b>, a roll gimbal <b>114</b>, and pitch gimbal <b>116</b>. Faring <b>104</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is fixed relative to static structure <b>112</b> and is supported thereby. Roll gimbal <b>114</b> is connected to static structure <b>112</b> and is supported thereby for rotation about a roll axis <b>118</b>. Rotation of roll gimbal <b>114</b> about roll axis <b>118</b> is effected by a roll resolver/drive arrangement <b>120</b>, which is operably connected to roll gimbal <b>114</b> for rotating roll gimbal <b>114</b> about roll axis <b>118</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> a controller <b>122</b> is disposed in communication with roll resolver/drive arrangement <b>120</b> through cabling <b>124</b>, through which controller <b>122</b> controls rotation of roll gimbal <b>114</b> about roll axis <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Pitch gimbal <b>116</b> is connected to roll gimbal <b>114</b> and is supported thereby for rotation about a pitch axis <b>126</b>. Rotation of pitch gimbal <b>116</b> about pitch axis <b>126</b> is effected by a pitch resolver/drive arrangement <b>128</b>, which is operably connected to pitch gimbal <b>116</b> for rotating pitch gimbal <b>116</b> about pitch axis <b>126</b> and which is itself carried by roll gimbal <b>114</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> controller <b>122</b> is disposed in communication with pitch resolver/drive arrangement <b>128</b> through cabling <b>124</b>, through which controller <b>122</b> also controls rotation of pitch gimbal <b>116</b> about pitch axis <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Pitch gimbal <b>116</b>, and therethrough roll gimbal <b>114</b>, carry a first sensor <b>130</b> and a second sensor <b>132</b>. Second sensor <b>132</b> is arranged on a side of roll axis <b>118</b> opposite first sensor <b>130</b>, either (or both) first sensor <b>130</b> and second sensor <b>132</b> being disposed in communication with controller <b>122</b> for receiving data from either (or both) first sensor <b>130</b> and second sensor <b>132</b>. Data from first sensor <b>130</b> and second sensor <b>132</b> is provided through cabling <b>124</b>, which provides connectivity for digital data communication between the sensors and controller <b>122</b>. In certain embodiments cabling <b>124</b> is roll-flex type cabling.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Controller <b>122</b> is fixed relative to static structure <b>112</b>. Since cabling <b>124</b> runs between movable structures, e.g., pitch resolver/drive arrangement <b>128</b>, first sensor <b>130</b>, and second sensor <b>132</b>, it is necessary to limit the movement of one or more of the movable structures relative to static structure <b>112</b>. This prevents damage on cabling <b>124</b> that could otherwise occur from rotation of roll gimbal <b>114</b>. Limitation of movement of roll gimbal <b>114</b> is effected by a magnetic soft stop <b>134</b>. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the present disclosure, the disadvantages otherwise associated with having to manage cabling <b>124</b> can be offset by the advantages provided by the quality of the data communication connection provided by cabling <b>124</b>, which allows first sensor <b>130</b> and second sensor <b>132</b> to communicate image data with the data loss that could otherwise accompany the use of a slip ring or other type of data communication interface. Although a particular magnetic soft stop arrangement is shown, e.g., magnetic soft stops connected to static structure and a fixed stop member connected to a gimbal, it is to be understood and appreciated that other arrangements are possible within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, magnetic soft stops can be carried by the gimbal. Further, pitch gimbal <b>14</b> can alternatively/additionally stopped using one or more magnetic soft stops, as suitable for an intended application.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, sensor system <b>102</b> is shown in an axial end view.

Second sensor field of view <b>172</b> is smaller than a field of view <b>162</b> of first sensor <b>130</b>. In certain embodiments first sensor <b>130</b> can be a wide field of view sensor, such as optical waveband sensor. Examples of optical waveband sensors include cameras and telescopes.

Mechanical hard stops have the advantage that the they can prevent movement of the gimbal from outside of the intended movement range of gimbal, e.g., outside of predetermined movement range, such as due acceleration and/or shocks that can be experienced by an aircraft carrying a sensor system carrying the sensor system. For example, the hard stop can physically interfere with the rotation of a gimbal beyond a certain amount of angular rotation about the rotation axis about which the gimbal is supported, potentially preventing damage to the sensor system and/or gimbal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While generally satisfactory for their intended purpose mechanical hard stops can potentially impose a shock on the sensor itself, such as when the gimbal strikes the hard stop. Mechanical hard stops also typically prevent use of the full range of rotation of the gimbal about the rotation about the rotation axis. This can potentially limit the sensing capability of the sensor system, such as when a sensor with a relatively wide field of view carried by the gimbal is replaced with a sensor having a relatively narrow field of view, the sensor with the narrow field of view having a smaller field of regard than the sensor with the wide field of regard for a given mechanical hard stop position. To limit end of travel shock and/or allow for adjustability of end travel gimbal arrangement <b>100</b> includes magnetic soft stop <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Magnetic soft stop <b>134</b> includes a first magnetic body <b>140</b> and a second magnetic body <b>142</b>. First magnetic body <b>140</b> is fixed relative to roll axis <b>118</b> and can include, for example a permanent magnet <b>140</b> (P), a ferromagnetic body <b>142</b> (F<sub>e</sub>). or an electromagnet. e.g., electromagnet <b>146</b>. Second magnetic body <b>142</b> is similar to first magnetic body <b>140</b> with the difference that second magnetic body <b>142</b> is movable relative to roll axis <b>118</b>. e.g., is carried by roll gimbal <b>114</b>. It is contemplated that magnetic force F between first magnetic body <b>140</b> and second magnetic body <b>142</b> limit movement of roll gimbal <b>114</b> to prevent rotary movement of roll gimbal <b>114</b> beyond a predetermined movement range, illustrated in an exemplary way in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> as about 180 degrees. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the present disclosure, this can eliminate the need for a mechanical hard stop to limit rotary movement of roll gimbal <b>114</b>.

Because the magnitude of magnetic force F corresponds to separation between first permanent magnet <b>140</b> and second permanent magnet <b>144</b>, this has the effect a decelerating rotational speed of roll gimbal <b>114</b> as second permanent magnet <b>144</b> approaches first permanent magnet <b>140</b>&#x2014;limiting the shock exerted on roll gimbal <b>114</b> as it reaches first position <b>136</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or second position <b>138</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, it is contemplated that magnetic soft stop <b>134</b> include an electromagnet <b>146</b>.
