The invention is capable of other independent embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate a string trimmer head <b>10</b> for use on an exemplary string trimmer <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Such a trimmer <b>1</b> generally includes a shaft <b>2</b> with a handle <b>4</b> toward one end and a motor housing <b>6</b> enclosing an electric motor <b>8</b> with a motor-driven output, or drive shaft, <b>5</b> for connection to a trimmer head <b>10</b> on the other end. Various powered trimmers (e.g., battery-powered, gas-powered, etc.) may be used with the trimmer head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the illustrated trimmer head <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>14</b> rotatable about an axis A and a spool <b>18</b> for retaining one or more lines. Line is wound around the spool <b>18</b> and extends through opposed eyelets <b>22</b> to cut vegetation (e.g., grass, weeds, etc.). In the illustrated embodiment, the trimmer head <b>10</b> is mounted to the trimmer drive shaft <b>5</b> via the spool <b>18</b>. In other words, the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the drive shaft. In particular, a nut <b>26</b> configured to be drivingly connected to the drive shaft <b>5</b> may be insert molded into the spool <b>18</b>. However, in some embodiments, the nut <b>26</b> may alternatively be secured to the spool <b>18</b> via alternative fastening methods (e.g., press-fit, slip-fit with retaining rings, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The housing <b>14</b> includes a main body <b>30</b> and a top plate, or cap, <b>34</b>. The top plate <b>34</b> is spaced above the spool <b>18</b> and is keyed to the nut <b>26</b>. The spool <b>18</b> and the top plate <b>34</b> are thus fixed to one other rotatably and axially via the nut <b>26</b>. The main body <b>30</b> defines a cavity <b>38</b> for receiving the spool <b>18</b>. A retainer ring <b>42</b> is positioned at the upper end of the main body <b>30</b>. The retainer ring <b>42</b> is located on the nut <b>26</b> and is captured with axial and rotational play between the top plate <b>34</b> and an upper end of the spool <b>18</b>. A spring is located at a lower end of the spool <b>18</b> to bias against a lower end of the housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the nut <b>26</b> minimizes overall vibration within the trimmer head <b>10</b> during operation. As described above, various components of the housing <b>14</b> (e.g., the top plate <b>34</b>, the spool <b>18</b>, the retainer ring <b>42</b>) are all coupled to the nut <b>26</b>. As a result, the clearance between the housing components is minimized, thereby decreasing overall vibration in the trimmer head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment, the top plate <b>34</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a center boss <b>46</b> having an aperture <b>50</b> extending through the boss <b>46</b>. The aperture <b>50</b> is shaped and sized to fixedly receive the nut <b>26</b>. An outer rim <b>54</b> of the top plate <b>34</b> covers an end of a sidewall <b>58</b> of the main body <b>30</b> to enclose the cavity <b>38</b>. A series of teeth <b>60</b> are positioned on an inner surface of the top plate <b>34</b> and are engageable with a corresponding series of teeth positioned on the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The main body <b>30</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a second end <b>30</b><i>b </i>opposite the first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and a longitudinal axis <b>62</b> extending from the first end <b>30</b><i>a </i>to the second end <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The longitudinal axis <b>62</b> is collinear to the rotational axis A. The main body <b>30</b> additionally includes the sidewall <b>58</b> and a base wall <b>70</b>. The sidewall <b>58</b> defines a pair of eyelet openings <b>74</b> and a pair of retainer openings <b>78</b>. The eyelet openings <b>74</b> are shaped and sized to receive the eyelets <b>22</b>, and the retainer openings <b>78</b> are shaped and sized to receive at least a portion of the retainer <b>42</b>. An inner surface of the base wall <b>70</b> includes a center boss <b>82</b> and one or more ribs <b>86</b>. The center boss <b>82</b> is shaped and sized to receive a portion of the nut <b>26</b>. The ribs <b>86</b> axially extend from the base wall <b>70</b> and are configured to interface with the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, an edge <b>90</b> is formed on an outer surface of the main body <b>30</b> at a junction between the sidewall <b>58</b> and the base wall <b>70</b>. More specifically, the edge <b>90</b> is generally chamfered. An outer surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the base wall <b>70</b> includes a first wear ring <b>94</b> and a second wear ring <b>98</b>. The first and second wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are generally circular and protrude from the base wall <b>70</b>. The wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are concentrically positioned on the base wall <b>70</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. More specifically, the first wear ring <b>94</b> includes a greater diameter than the second wear ring <b>98</b>, such that the second wear ring <b>98</b> is positioned within the first wear ring <b>94</b>. In some embodiments, the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> may include alternative shapes and sizes. For example, in some embodiments, at least one of the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> may include a rectangular shape. In such instances, the wear ring(s) <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> may mate with a corresponding aperture and/or groove in a winding tool. More specifically, the winding tool may include a rectangular groove shaped and sized to receive at least one of the rectangular wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>. In order to turn the housing <b>14</b> (e.g., to wind line through the trimmer head <b>10</b>), the user aligns the winding tool adjacent to the base wall <b>70</b> such that the wear rings(s) <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are positioned within the groove(s). Then, the user manually turns the tool relative to the trimmer head <b>10</b>. As a result, because the wear ring(s) <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are engaged with the groove(s), the housing <b>14</b> turns in a direction opposite to a feed direction relative to the top plate <b>34</b>, thereby winding line through the trimmer head <b>10</b> and onto the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The outer surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the base wall <b>70</b> additionally includes ribs <b>102</b> protruding from the main body <b>30</b>. The ribs <b>102</b> are positioned between the first wear ring <b>94</b> and the second wear ring <b>98</b> and are equidistantly spaced around the base wall <b>70</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the main body <b>30</b> includes four ribs <b>102</b>. However, in alternative embodiments, the main body <b>30</b> may include fewer or additional ribs. The wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> and chamfered edge <b>90</b> prevent damage to the housing <b>14</b> of the trimmer head <b>10</b>, regardless of the angle at which the base wall <b>70</b> is oriented relative to the work surface, when the trimmer head <b>10</b> is bumped against a work surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the retainer <b>46</b> includes a ring <b>106</b> defining a central opening <b>110</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> includes a first series of teeth <b>114</b> positioned on an upper surface of the ring <b>106</b>, and a second series of teeth <b>118</b> positioned on a lower surface of the ring <b>106</b>. The first series of teeth <b>114</b> are engageable with the teeth <b>60</b> positioned on the top plate <b>34</b> of the housing <b>14</b>. Flexible retainer arms <b>122</b> extend from the ring <b>106</b>, each having a retainer member <b>126</b> engageable in the associated retainer openings <b>78</b> to connect the main body <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the spool <b>18</b> includes a generally cylindrical, central body <b>130</b> including a through bore extending through the spool <b>18</b> along an axis <b>136</b> generally collinear to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. An aperture <b>138</b> extends through the central body <b>130</b> for receiving line, such that the aperture <b>138</b> extends along an axis <b>140</b> substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The through bore is shaped and sized to receive the nut <b>26</b>. The nut <b>26</b> is positioned within the through bore and includes a threaded opening <b>144</b> shaped and sized to receive the shaft <b>5</b> of the string trimmer <b>1</b>. In order to couple the trimmer head <b>10</b> to the shaft <b>5</b>, the nut <b>26</b> is tightened around the drive shaft <b>5</b>. A distal end <b>26</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the nut <b>26</b> protrudes through the spool <b>18</b> and is received within the central boss <b>82</b> of the main body <b>30</b> of the housing <b>14</b>. The nut <b>26</b> additionally includes an aperture <b>148</b> that extends through the nut <b>26</b> along an axis generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. Specifically, the aperture <b>148</b> of the nut <b>26</b> aligns with the aperture <b>138</b> of the spool <b>18</b>, thereby forming a passageway for line to be fed through the housing <b>14</b>, the spool <b>18</b>, and the nut <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The central body <b>130</b> of the spool <b>18</b> includes a first, upper flange <b>152</b> and a second, lower flange <b>156</b>. The first and second flanges <b>152</b>, <b>156</b> are arranged in parallel planes. In some embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> may include additional flanges. Teeth <b>160</b> are formed on the upper flange <b>152</b> and are selectively engageable with the second series of teeth <b>118</b> on the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed above, the spring is located at the lower end of the spool <b>18</b> to bias against the housing <b>14</b>. In the biased position, the retainer <b>42</b> and housing <b>14</b> are biased downwardly by the spring and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the second series of teeth <b>118</b> located on the lower surface of the retainer <b>42</b> cooperating with the teeth <b>160</b> on the upper flange <b>152</b> of the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>, each eyelet <b>22</b> includes a body <b>162</b> received in a pocket of the main body <b>30</b> and includes ears <b>166</b> limiting movement into the pocket. A passage <b>170</b> is defined through each eyelet <b>22</b>. An inner portion <b>174</b> of the passage <b>170</b> has a first shape (e.g., an oval shape, as illustrated) with a length generally along the axis A greater than its width. The passage <b>170</b> transitions to an outer portion having a second shape (e.g., a circular shape) provided in a projection <b>178</b> (e.g., a cylindrical projection) received in the eyelet opening <b>74</b> of the main body <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the inner portion <b>174</b> of the passage <b>170</b> has an alternative shape with similar dimensions (e.g., a length generally along the axis A greater than its width, such as, for example, a rectangular shape). Similarly, the outer portion provided in the projection <b>178</b> may have an alternative shape, such that at least its length generally along the axis A (and, potentially, its width) is less than a length (and, potentially, a width) of the passage <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To assemble the trimmer head <b>10</b>, the central body <b>130</b> of the spool <b>18</b> is coupled to the retainer <b>42</b>. Specifically, the retainer <b>42</b> is captured between the top plate <b>34</b> and the spool <b>18</b>. The eyelets <b>22</b> are received in the eyelet pockets, with each outer projection <b>178</b> extending through the eyelet openings <b>74</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> is then snap-fit to the main body <b>30</b>, with the retainer arms <b>122</b> biasing each retainer member <b>126</b> into a retainer opening <b>78</b>. The spool <b>18</b> is thus captured between the main body <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>46</b>, and the trimmer head <b>10</b> is assembled as a unit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To install line, an end of a single line is fed through the passageway in one eyelet <b>22</b>, into and through the aperture <b>138</b> of the spool <b>18</b> and the aperture <b>148</b> of the nut <b>26</b>. The end of the line is then fed through the passageway in the other eyelet <b>22</b>, such that an equal amount of line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>. The line is centered and then wound onto the spool <b>18</b> (e.g., by turning the housing <b>14</b> in a direction opposite to a feed direction while holding the top plate <b>34</b>) until sufficient line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, the trimmer <b>1</b> is operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b> and, thereby, the spool <b>18</b>. As mentioned above, in the biased, initial position, the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> are biased downwardly via the biasing spring, and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the plurality of cooperating teeth <b>118</b>, <b>160</b> located on the retainer <b>42</b> and the top end of the spool <b>18</b>. As a result, the trimmer <b>1</b> can be operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b>, thereby rotating the spool <b>18</b> (along with the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>) and the cutting line so that the line may cut vegetation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the trimmer head <b>10</b> is being operated, the head <b>10</b> may be &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; against the work surface, for example, to dispense additional cutting line.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> move axially on the insert molded nut <b>18</b> against the spring bias to disengage the cooperating interfaces (e.g., teeth <b>160</b>, <b>118</b>) on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b>. With these cooperating interfaces <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> to dispense additional line. The housing <b>14</b> may be depressed until the retainer <b>42</b> engages the top plate <b>34</b>. At this time, a plurality of cooperating interfaces (e.g., ramps, or teeth, <b>114</b> formed on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b> and ramps, or teeth, <b>60</b> formed on the top of the retainer <b>42</b>) engage with one another to momentarily drivingly connect the housing <b>14</b> with the spool <b>18</b>. Once the housing <b>14</b> disengages the surface, the spring biases the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> downwardly into the biased position. As the cooperating interfaces <b>114</b>, <b>60</b> on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b> and the top of the retainer <b>42</b> are disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is again free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> to dispense additional line until the cooperating interfaces <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b> become engaged in the biased position. Because the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> are positioned on the bottom of the base wall <b>70</b> of the main body <b>30</b>, the wear rings <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> contact the work surface rather than the base wall <b>70</b>. Therefore, the housing <b>14</b> is protected from wear against the ground.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although aspects of the invention have been described in detail with reference to certain preferred constructions, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
