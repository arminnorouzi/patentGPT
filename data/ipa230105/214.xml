The hook and eye closure has a long history and is still used today, primarily on brassiere.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mass production of hook and eye closure was made possible in 1800s by an innovator who commissioned the creation of a machine that automated the formation of hook and eye fasteners. Since that wired hook and eye are sewed onto the garment to function as closures. The fasteners were eventually manufactured in the form of hook-and-eye tape, consisting of two tapes, one with hooks and the other with eyelets. The tapes are sewed onto either side of a garment closure such that they can be connected side-by-side closing the garment closure. Nowadays, the hook-and-eye closures come as individual straps or as ready-to-cut tapes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each tape is a laminated structure made of various materials. Each layer of material is functionally specific and has different physical characteristics. As such, each layer may be formed from a different material to provide the required physical characteristic. For example, the backing member is there to support the hooks or eyelets. It has to be strong and rigid. As for the outermost layer behind the backing member, it has to be soft and comfortable as a layer that touches the skin of a user. A cushioning layer may be applied between the backing member and the outermost layer to mask the hardness of the hooks or eyelets. The cushioning layer is flexible and relatively thick. The hooks and eyelets are sewed onto the backing member and different layers are sewed onto the hooks and eyelets for fixing the relative positions between them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The manufacturing of a hook and eye tape is a complication process and procedurally cumbersome. Furthermore, all of the different materials in the tape add on to the difficulties in recycling of the tape for the sake of our environment. The extra costs and efforts required to recycle the hook and eye tapes are the main deters.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention seeks to eliminate or at least to mitigate such shortcomings by providing an improved hook and eye tape.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a hook or eye tape comprising: a body including a backing member; a connector arranged on the body and the connector has a first part; and a main seamless connection formed between the first part of the connector and a corresponding portion of the backing member to secure the connector at a desired position on the body; Preferably, the body is a laminated body including a cover member, the first part of the connector is sandwiched between the cover member and the backing member; more preferably, the main seamless connection joins the first part of the connector to corresponding portions of the backing member and the cover member such that the first part of the connector is sandwiched there between; it is preferable that the seamless connection further includes an auxiliary seamless connection formed between corresponding portions of the backing member and the cover member at a position peripheral to the main seamless connection; Advantageously, at least one of the main seamless connection and the auxiliary seamless connection comprises a weld; more advantageously, the main seamless connection is a weld that joins the corresponding portions of the backing member and the cover member thereby fixing the position of the first part of the connector on the body; yet more advantageously, the backing member, the cover member as well as the first part of the connector are fused at the weld; yet more advantageously, the welds are ultrasonic welds formed by way of ultrasonic welding; it is preferable that the main seamless connection comprises an attachment region that involves the application of adhesive at the attachment region; preferably, the adhesive is a heat sensitive adhesive; more preferably, at least one of the backing member and the cover member comprises a layer of heat sensitive adhesive material; yet more preferably, the hook or eye tape includes at least two connectors each being secured to the body via respective main seamless connections which are spatially separated from each other on the body which is laminated; more preferably. the main seamless connection has a well-defined boundary that runs in proximity to and around the first part of the connector; advantageously, the auxiliary seamless connection is provided between two main seamless connections for fixing the cover member to the backing member; more advantageously, an opening is formed between the backing member and the cover layer via which a second part of the connector protrudes; yet more advantageously, the opening is formed at an edge of the cover member, along which an auxiliary seamless connection is provided to fix the cover layer to the backing member adjacent the opening; preferably, the cover member includes an outer cover layer with preformed apertures via which a second part of the connector protrudes; more preferably, the body includes two opposite ultrasonically welded edges, the cover member further includes an outermost cover layer provided underneath the backing member, the outermost cover layer conceals the welded edges of the body; yet more preferably, the outer cover layer is attached to the cover member and the backing member via respective adhesive layers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a hook or eye tape comprising the step of: arranging a hook or an eye on a backing member, and seamlessly connecting the hook or eye on the backing member; preferably the method further comprising the step of arranging a cover member on top of the backing member for sandwiching at least a first portion of the hook or eye therebetween; yet more preferably, the first portion is seamlessly connected to the backing member and the cover member; it is preferable that the method, further comprising the step of providing an outer cover layer on which apertures are preformed, placing the outer cover layer on the cover member and inserting a second portion of the hook or eye through the aperture; preferably, the hook or eye is seamlessly connected by way of ultrasonic welding; more preferably, the hook or eye is seamlessly connected to the backing member by an adhesive.
