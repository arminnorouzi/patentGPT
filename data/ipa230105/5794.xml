Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In current semiconductor industry, polysilicon has been widely used as a gap-filling material for fabricating gate electrode of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors. However, the conventional polysilicon gate also faced problems such as inferior performance due to boron penetration and unavoidable depletion effect which increases equivalent thickness of gate dielectric layer, reduces gate capacitance, and worsens driving force of the devices. In replacing polysilicon gates, work function metals have been developed to serve as a control electrode working in conjunction with high-K gate dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, part of the spacer, part of the contact etch stop layer (CESL), and even part of the interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer may be removed when gate material layer made of polysilicon is removed during current fabrication of metal gate transistor so that conductive materials such as work function metal layer and low resistance metal layer deposited afterwards may form short circuit with adjacent contact plugs thereby affecting the performance of the device. Hence, how to resolve this issue has become an important task in this field.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for fabricating a semiconductor device includes the steps of forming a metal gate on a substrate, a spacer around the metal gate, and a first interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer around the spacer, performing a plasma treatment process to transform the spacer into a first bottom portion and a first top portion, performing a cleaning process to remove the first top portion, and forming a second ILD layer on the metal gate and the first ILD layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes a metal gate on a substrate, a spacer adjacent to the metal gate, a source/drain region adjacent to the spacer, and a contact etch stop layer (CESL) around the spacer.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate <b>12</b> is first provided, in which the substrate could be a silicon substrate or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. A transistor region, such as a PMOS region or a NMOS region could be defined on the substrate <b>12</b>. At least a fin-shaped structure <b>14</b> and an insulating layer (not shown) are formed on the substrate <b>12</b>, in which the bottom portion of the fin-shaped structure <b>14</b> is surrounded by the insulating later or shallow trench isolation (STI) preferably made of material such as silicon oxide. It should be noted that even though this embodiment pertains to the fabrication of a non-planar FET device such as FinFET device, it would also be desirable to apply the content of the following process to a planar FET device, which is also within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the fin-shaped structure <b>14</b> could be obtained by a sidewall image transfer (SIT) process. For instance, a layout pattern is first input into a computer system and is modified through suitable calculation. The modified layout is then defined in a mask and further transferred to a layer of sacrificial layer on a substrate through a photolithographic and an etching process. In this way, several sacrificial layers distributed with a same spacing and of a same width are formed on a substrate. Each of the sacrificial layers may be stripe-shaped. Subsequently, a deposition process and an etching process are carried out such that spacers are formed on the sidewalls of the patterned sacrificial layers. Next, sacrificial layers can be removed completely by performing an etching process. Through the etching process, pattern defined by the spacers can be transferred into the substrate underneath, and through additional fin cut processes, desirable pattern structures, such as stripe patterned fin-shaped structures could be obtained.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alternatively, the fin-shaped structure <b>14</b> could also be obtained by first forming a patterned mask (not shown) on the substrate, <b>12</b>, and through an etching process, the pattern of the patterned mask is transferred to the substrate <b>12</b> to form the fin-shaped structure. Moreover, the formation of the fin-shaped structure could also be accomplished by first forming a patterned hard mask (not shown) on the substrate <b>12</b>, and a semiconductor layer composed of silicon germanium is grown from the substrate <b>12</b> through exposed patterned hard mask via selective epitaxial growth process to form the corresponding fin-shaped structure. These approaches for forming fin-shaped structure are all within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, at least a gate structures <b>16</b> or dummy gate is formed on the substrate <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the formation of the gate structure <b>16</b> could be accomplished by a gate first process, a high-k first approach from gate last process, or a high-k last approach from gate last process. Since this embodiment pertains to a high-k last approach, a gate dielectric layer or interfacial layer, a gate material layer, and a selective hard mask could be formed sequentially on the substrate <b>12</b>, and a pattern transfer process is then conducted by using a patterned resist (not shown) as mask to remove part of the gate material layer and part of the gate dielectric layer through single or multiple etching processes. After stripping the patterned resist, a gate structure <b>16</b> composed of patterned gate dielectric layer <b>18</b> and patterned material layer <b>20</b> are formed on the substrate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Next, at least a spacer <b>22</b> is formed on the sidewalls of the gate structure <b>16</b>, a source/drain region <b>24</b> and/or epitaxial layer (not shown) is formed in the substrate <b>12</b> adjacent to two sides of the spacer <b>22</b>, and a selective silicide layer (not shown) could be formed on the surface of the source/drain region <b>24</b>. In this embodiment, the spacer <b>22</b> could be a single spacer or a composite spacer, such as a spacer including but not limited to for example an offset spacer <b>26</b> and a main spacer <b>28</b>. Preferably, the offset spacer <b>26</b> and the main spacer <b>28</b> could include same material or different material. It should be noted that even though the offset spacer <b>26</b> in this embodiment preferably includes silicon carbon nitride (SiCN) according to other embodiments of the present invention both the offset spacer <b>26</b> and the main spacer <b>28</b> could also be made of material including but not limited to for example SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, SiON, SiCN, or combination thereof. The source/drain region <b>24</b> could include n-type dopants or p-type dopants depending on the type of device being fabricated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a contact etch stop layer (CESL) <b>30</b> is formed on the substrate <b>12</b> surface and the gate structure <b>16</b>, and an interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer <b>32</b> is formed on the CESL <b>30</b> afterwards. Next, a planarizing process such as a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is conducted to remove part of the ILD layer <b>32</b> and part of the CESL <b>30</b> to expose the gate material layer <b>20</b> composed of polysilicon so that the top surfaces of the gate material layer <b>20</b> and ILD layer <b>32</b> are coplanar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a replacement metal gate (RMG) process is conducted to transform the gate structure <b>16</b> into a metal gate. For instance, the RMG process could be accomplished by first performing a selective dry etching or wet etching process using etchants including but not limited to for example ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH) or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to remove the gate material layer <b>20</b> or even gate dielectric layer <b>18</b> from gate structure <b>16</b> for forming recesses <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> in the ILD layer <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It should be noted that etching process conducted at this stage preferably removes all of the gate material layer <b>20</b> and at the same time removing part of the spacer <b>22</b>, part of the CESL <b>30</b>, and even part of the ILD layer <b>32</b> (not shown) to form the recesses <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, in which the larger recess <b>34</b> exposes the surface of the substrate <b>12</b> while the recesses <b>36</b> on adjacent two sides expose the remaining spacer <b>22</b> and the CESL <b>30</b>. Moreover, the etching process conducted at this stage also removes less spacer <b>22</b> and more CESL <b>30</b> as a result of different selectivity between the two elements <b>22</b>, <b>30</b> so that the depth of the recess <b>36</b> directly on top of the CESL <b>30</b> is slightly deeper than the depth of the recess <b>36</b> directly on top of the spacer <b>22</b>. Viewing from another perspective, the top surface of the remaining CESL <b>30</b> is slightly lower than the top surface of the remaining spacer <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, selective interfacial layer <b>38</b> or gate dielectric layer (not shown), a high-k dielectric layer <b>40</b>, a work function metal layer <b>42</b>, and a low resistance metal layer <b>44</b> are formed in the recesses <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and a planarizing process such as CMP is conducted to remove part of low resistance metal layer <b>44</b> to form a metal gate <b>46</b>. It should be noted that each of the high-k dielectric layer <b>40</b>, work function metal layer <b>42</b>, and low resistance metal layer <b>44</b> are deposited into the recesses <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> at the same time to fill the recesses <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> completely. In other words, each of the recesses <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are filled with the same material.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this embodiment, the high-k dielectric layer <b>40</b> is preferably selected from dielectric materials having dielectric constant (k value) larger than 4. For instance, the high-k dielectric layer <b>40</b> may be selected from hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), hafnium silicon oxide (HfSiO<sub>4</sub>), hafnium silicon oxynitride (HfSiON), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), lanthanum oxide (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), strontium titanate oxide (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>), zirconium silicon oxide (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>), hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO<sub>4</sub>), strontium bismuth tantalate (SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, SBT), lead zirconate titanate (PbZr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, PZT), barium strontium titanate (Ba<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1-x</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>, BST) or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this embodiment, the work function metal layer <b>42</b> is formed for tuning the work function of the later formed metal gates to be appropriate in an NMOS or a PMOS. For an NMOS transistor, the work function metal layer <b>42</b> having a work function ranging between 3.9 eV and 4.3 eV may include titanium aluminide (TiAl), zirconium aluminide (ZrAl), tungsten aluminide (WAl), tantalum aluminide (TaAl), hafnium aluminide (HfAl), or titanium aluminum carbide (TiAlC), but it is not limited thereto. For a PMOS transistor, the work function metal layer <b>42</b> having a work function ranging between 4.8 eV and 5.2 eV may include titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), tantalum carbide (TaC), but it is not limited thereto. An optional barrier layer (not shown) could be formed between the work function metal layer <b>42</b> and the low resistance metal layer <b>44</b>, in which the material of the barrier layer may include titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum (Ta) or tantalum nitride (TaN). Furthermore, the material of the low-resistance metal layer <b>44</b> may include copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), titanium aluminum (TiAl), cobalt tungsten phosphide (CoWP) or any combination thereof. Since the process of using RMG process to transform dummy gate into metal gate is well known to those skilled in the art, the details of which are not explained herein for the sake of brevity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a plasma treatment process <b>48</b> is conducted to transform the spacer <b>22</b> into a first bottom portion <b>50</b> and a first top portion <b>52</b> and at the same time transforming the CESL <b>30</b> into a second bottom portion <b>54</b> and a second top portion <b>56</b> around or adjacent to two sides of the metal gate <b>46</b>. Specifically, the plasma treatment process <b>48</b> is s accomplished by injecting a reacting gas such as nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) to react with the conductive material directly on top of the spacer <b>22</b> and CESL <b>30</b> as well as the top portions of the spacer <b>22</b> and the CESL <b>30</b>.

Next, conductive materials including a barrier layer selected from the group consisting of titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum (Ta), and tantalum nitride (TaN) and a metal layer selected from the group consisting of tungsten (W), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), titanium aluminide (TiAl), and cobalt tungsten phosphide (CoWP) are deposited into the contact holes, and a planarizing process such as CMP is conducted to remove part of aforementioned barrier layer and low resistance metal layer for forming contact plugs <b>64</b> electrically connecting the source/drain region <b>24</b>. This completes the fabrication of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> further illustrates a structural view of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the semiconductor device includes at least a metal gate <b>46</b> disposed on the substrate <b>12</b>, a spacer <b>22</b> surrounding the metal gate <b>46</b>, a source/drain region <b>24</b> disposed adjacent to two sides of the spacer <b>22</b>, a CESL <b>30</b> around the spacer <b>22</b>, an ILD layer <b>32</b> around the CESL <b>30</b>, and another ILD layer <b>62</b> disposed on the metal gate <b>46</b> and the ILD layer <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Viewing from a more detailed perspective, the spacer <b>22</b> and the CESL <b>30</b> preferably include different heights, in which the top surface of the CESL <b>30</b> is lower than the top surface of the spacer <b>22</b>, the top surface of the CESL <b>30</b> is lower than the top surface of the metal gate <b>46</b>, and the top surface of the spacer <b>22</b> is lower than the top surface of the metal gate <b>46</b>. The ILD layer <b>62</b> further includes a bottom portion <b>66</b> disposed between the metal gate <b>46</b> and the ILD layer <b>32</b> and a top portion <b>68</b> disposed directly on the metal gate <b>46</b> and the ILD layer <b>32</b>, in which the bottom portion <b>66</b> contacts the spacer <b>22</b> and the CESL <b>30</b> directly and the bottom surface of the bottom portion <b>66</b> directly contacting the CESL <b>30</b> is lower than the bottom surface of the bottom portion <b>66</b> directly contacting the spacer <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Typically, part of the spacer, part of the contact etch stop layer (CESL), and even part of the interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer may be removed when gate material layer made of polysilicon is removed during current fabrication of metal gate transistor. This forms recesses <b>36</b> extending outward to the top region above the source/drain region so that conductive materials such as work function metal layer and low resistance metal layer may be deposited into these recesses to form laterally extended metal gate, which easily results in short circuit with adjacent contact plugs thereby affecting the performance of the device. To resolve this issue, the present invention first forms a metal gate on a substrate, conducts a plasma treatment process to transform the conductive material extended directly above the spacer and CESL into a dielectric portion <b>58</b>, performs a cleaning process to completely remove this dielectric portion, and then conducts forms an upper level ILD layer. By utilizing this approach, it would be desirable to prevent contact between excessive low resistance metal layer and work function metal layer from the laterally extended metal gate and adjacent contact plugs thereby ensuring the performance of the device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.
