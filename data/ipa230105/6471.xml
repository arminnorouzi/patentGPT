The mat part <b>10</b> may be in any suitable shape and size and is able to accommodate the coil layer <b>20</b>. A connection module <b>30</b> is electrically connected between the coil layer <b>20</b> and an external power source, such that the coil layer <b>20</b> can receive electricity via the connection module <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this embodiment, the mat part <b>10</b> may at least include a first layer <b>11</b> and a second layer <b>12</b>. The first layer <b>11</b> may be made of any suitable soft and flexible material, such as silicone or rubber. The second layer <b>12</b> may be made of any material suitable for providing a surface for moving a mouse, such as Mylar, polyester, rubber, paper, or glass.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second layer <b>12</b> is stacked on the first layer <b>11</b>. The first layer <b>11</b> has a contact surface <b>111</b> used to be attached to the second layer <b>12</b>. The contact surface <b>111</b> may be adhered to the second layer <b>12</b> by using adhesive or any suitable means. The coil layer <b>20</b> includes one or more coils <b>21</b> embedded in a recess <b>112</b> at the contact surface <b>111</b>. The coil <b>21</b> is a typical charging coil that may be in any suitable material, size, and shape. The coil <b>21</b> is arranged along the recess <b>112</b> so that the coil layer <b>20</b> forms a pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown, the coil <b>21</b> is arranged between the first layer <b>11</b> and the second layer <b>12</b> so as to be embedded within the mat part <b>10</b>. Note that the configuration of the recess <b>112</b> secures the position of the coil <b>21</b> without additionally providing adhesive for fixing it.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In specific, please further refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to focus on the recess <b>112</b> of the first layer <b>11</b>, as shown, the recess <b>112</b> may have a slot area <b>1121</b> recessed downward from the contact surface <b>111</b> and a coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> recessed further downward from the bottom corner of the slot area <b>1121</b>. In other words, the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> is connected to the contact surface <b>111</b> via the slot area <b>1121</b>, and the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> is located at one corner of the slot area <b>1121</b> relatively away from the contact surface <b>11</b>. The coil <b>21</b> is allowed to be placed into the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> via the slot area <b>1121</b> and therefore to be fixed in the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this embodiment, the slot area <b>1121</b> has a first opening O<b>1</b> at the contact surface <b>111</b> (that is, the contact surface <b>111</b> has a first opening O<b>1</b> to expose the slot area <b>1121</b>), the slot area <b>1121</b> has a second opening O<b>2</b> directly connected to the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> (that is, the slot area <b>1121</b> and the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> have a second opening O<b>2</b> inbetween), the slot area <b>1121</b> may have a cross-section in a quadrilateral shape, the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> may have a cross-section in round shape. Herein, the first opening O<b>1</b> has a first width of W<b>1</b>, the second opening O<b>2</b> has a second width of W<b>2</b>, the cross-section of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> may have a third width of W<b>3</b>, and the coil <b>21</b> has a fourth width of W<b>4</b> (i.e., the diameter of the cross-section of the coil <b>21</b>).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above widths satisfy the following conditions: W<b>1</b>&#x2265;W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>&#x3e;W<b>2</b>. Optionally, the above widths may further satisfy one of the following conditions: W<b>1</b>&#x3e;W<b>3</b>, W<b>1</b>&#x2248;W<b>3</b>, and W<b>1</b>&#x3c;W<b>3</b>. In addition, in one embodiment, W<b>3</b> may be substantially the same as W<b>4</b>, that is, W<b>3</b>&#x2248;W<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In detail, the space defined by the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> has a shape and size substantially matching and fitting the coil <b>21</b>, that is, W<b>3</b> may be slightly larger than, smaller than, or substantially the same as W<b>4</b>. This ensures that the inner surface of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> is able to cover and contact the surface of the coil <b>21</b> to firmly secure the coil <b>21</b> in the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b>. In the case that the cross-sections of both the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> and the coil <b>21</b> are in round shape, W<b>3</b> and W<b>4</b> may indicate the diameter of the respective cross-section. In the case that the cross-section of the coil accommodation area is not in a round shape (e.g., polygonal shape or oval shape), the third width means the maximum width of the cross-section defined by the coil accommodation area.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The configuration that the first width W<b>1</b> is larger than the third width W<b>3</b> facilitates the placement of the coil <b>21</b> into the slot area <b>1121</b> through the first opening O<b>1</b>. In other embodiments, the first width W<b>1</b> may be substantially equal to or smaller than the third width W<b>3</b>, the flexibility of the first layer <b>11</b> still allows the coil <b>21</b> to be put into the slot area <b>1121</b> via the first opening O<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The configuration that the second width W<b>2</b> is at least smaller than the third width W<b>3</b> limits the surface of the coil <b>21</b> that is exposed from the accommodation area <b>1122</b>, ensuring that the inner surface of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> can firmly hold the coil <b>21</b> in position and can prevent the coil <b>21</b> from coming out of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> due to external force.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sizes of the first opening O<b>1</b> and the second opening O<b>2</b> not only can facilitate the placement of the coil <b>21</b> but also can improve the yield rate of the recess <b>112</b>. In detail, to manufacture a first layer <b>11</b> with a recess <b>112</b>, an injection mold corresponding to the required shape of the recess <b>112</b> is needed, during the manufacturing process of the first layer <b>11</b> using the injection mold, high heat and pressure are involved to inject molten material inside the mold, thus the sizes of the first opening O<b>1</b> and the second opening O<b>2</b> have to ensure that the portion of the mold for forming the slot area <b>1121</b> has a sufficient thickness to sustain the high pressure without breaking. In other words, the portion of the mold for forming the area between the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> and the contact surface <b>111</b> shall have a certain thickness, otherwise it may be broken or deformed by high pressure during injection process. According to experimental results, when the first opening O<b>1</b> is larger than the second opening O<b>2</b> (i.e., the first width W<b>1</b> is larger than or equal to the second width W<b>2</b>), the slot area <b>1121</b> will have a width that ensures the portion of the mold for forming the slot area <b>1121</b> to have a thickness sufficient to withstand the high pressure without deformation or breaking.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the second width W<b>2</b> is too small, the portion of the mold for forming the second opening O<b>2</b> may have a thickness insufficient to withstand the high pressure. When the second width W<b>2</b> is too large, the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> may be unable to firmly hold the coil <b>21</b> therewithin. To avoid these problems, the second width W<b>2</b> is needed to be smaller than the fourth width W<b>4</b> and may be set to be a value that exposes <b>1</b>/<b>4</b> of the circumference of the cross-section of the coil <b>21</b>, i.e., W<b>2</b>&#x2248;&#x221a;2&#xd7;(W<b>4</b>/<b>2</b>). In the case of W<b>3</b>&#x2248;W<b>4</b>, W<b>2</b>&#x2248;&#xb0;2&#xd7;(W<b>3</b>/<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, to prevent the coil <b>21</b> from coming out of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> when the first layer <b>11</b> is deformed or experiencing external force, the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> in different portions of the first layer <b>11</b> may be arranged at different sides of the recess <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> at the left side of the drawing may be arranged at the bottom left corner of the slot area <b>1121</b> while the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> at the right side of the drawing may be arranged at the bottom right corner of the slot area <b>1121</b>. This arrangement provides restriction in different directions to different portions of the coil <b>21</b> so as to help prevent the coil <b>21</b> from coming out of the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b> due to deformation of the first layer <b>11</b> or external force.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed, the coil <b>21</b> may be firmly positioned in the first layer <b>11</b> by the coil accommodation area <b>1122</b>, thus there is no need to additional provide adhesive for covering and fixing the coil <b>21</b>, thereby saving the cost of adhesive and relevant process. In such a case, the slot area <b>1121</b> of the recess <b>112</b> may remain empty and is absent of any adhesive or solid or liquid substance. But it is noted that the slot area may be filled with adhesive if there is no need to consider the cost. Meanwhile, the slot area <b>1121</b> has a certain width to avoid the portion of the mold for forming the slot area <b>1121</b> from breaking.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Note that the slot area of the recess may be in any other shape as required as long as the conditions of W<b>1</b>&#x2265;W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b>&#x3e;W<b>2</b> are satisfied. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to avoid repeat illustration, only the differences between a first layer <b>11</b>&#x2032; and the first layer <b>11</b> will be described in detail below.

In such a configuration, the coil <b>21</b> still can be firmly positioned without involving additional adhesive, and the slot area <b>1121</b>&#x2032; still has a width ensuring that the portion of the mold for forming the slot area <b>1121</b>&#x2032; will not be broken due to high pressure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, to avoid repeat illustration, only the differences between a first layer <b>11</b>&#x2033; and the first layer <b>11</b> will be described in detail below.
