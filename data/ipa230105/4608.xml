In some of these prior art processes and systems, there is a limited degree of automation in the generation of recommendations of people that might be of interest to potentially meet online or offline, or to potentially include in a contact group. These automated recommendations rely on determining the degree to which information within profiles that are explicitly provided by users of the system have similarities. This approach is limited by the amount of information that is, or can be, explicitly provided by the respective parties, and by the quality and sincerity of the information provided by the parties.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in prior art online people matching processes, one of the parties has to overtly make contact with, or express interest in, a second party of interest. There can be an embarrassment factor for one or both parties that can inhibit such overt and transparent acts of expressing an interest in making contact, as a party's overture may be rejected. Or the overture may be accepted by the second party, but only for the purposes of not embarrassing the first party. In other words, acceptance may potentially be insincere, which is an uncomfortable situation for both parties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These problems with prior art systems and processes both inhibit the development of contacts and relationships that would be mutually rewarding, as well as creating &#x201c;contact inflation&#x201d; of &#x201c;mercy&#x201d; relationships that have little or no value to one or both of the parties.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the embodiments described herein, a method and system are disclosed for an automated mutual commit people matching process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure may apply the adaptive and/or recombinant methods and systems as described in PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US2004/37176, entitled &#x201c;Adaptive Recombinant Systems,&#x201d; filed on Nov. 4, 2004, and may apply the adaptive and/or recombinant processes, methods, and/or systems as described in PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US2005/011951, entitled &#x201c;Adaptive Recombinant Processes,&#x201d; filed on Apr. 8, 2005.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other features and embodiments will become apparent from the following description, from the drawings, and from the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a mutual commit people recommendation process, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer-based mutual commit people matching process, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram of a usage behavior framework, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of a user communities and associated relationships, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of usage behavior information and inferences function, according to some embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of alternative computing topologies of the mutual commit people matching process, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present disclosure.

Many variations of this two-step integrated approach may be applied, as will be discussed in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure has several advantages over prior art people matching methods and systems. First, the automated recommender system of the present disclosure introduces a &#x201c;third party&#x201d; (the computer-based recommender) to the match making; a third party that generates recommendations on people of interest based on information and logic that may be non-obvious to the recommendation recipient. Such an approach introduces a level of intrigue (because of the non-obviousness of the logic of the recommendation) and credibility (because inferences from behaviors are more credible than inferences solely from self-described attributes) that is missing from simple self-description-based profile matching. In some embodiments, the computer-based recommender system may provide an explanation of why a first party was recommended to the second party. This may provide an enhanced level of perceived authority associated with the recommendation. Further, the &#x201c;third party&#x201d; recommender reduces embarrassment for recommended parties as the parties can &#x201c;blame&#x201d; the recommender system for suggesting the parties should connect, thus, at least in part, removing the onus or responsibility from the parties themselves. This enables many more valuable connections to be made than non-recommender system-based approaches, or with recommender systems based solely on information explicitly provided by the parties.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Second, the delivery of a people recommendation is made, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, so as to shield the expression of interest of a first party for a second party unless the second party also expresses an interest in the first party. Further, the system may choose, either by randomization or deterministic means, to not necessarily deliver bilateral recommendations to two parties, so that a party is not guaranteed that if they receive a recommendation of a second party, that the second party will receive a recommendation for the first party. This method reduces the potential for feelings of rejection if an expression of interest is not reciprocated, since it is not guaranteed that both parties received a recommendation for the other party.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments not all the details (for example, name, organization, contact information) of the parties may be delivered by the recommender system, to reduce biases, or to reduce the risk of one of the parties contacting another party that has not expressed reciprocating interest.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a flow chart of the mutual commit people recommendation process, according to some embodiments. A recommendation of a second party is delivered to a first party <b>2010</b>. The recommendation may be generated by a computer-based system based, at least in part, on behavioral-based inferences associated with the two parties. The recommendation may be one among a plurality of other people recommendations and/or recommendations of content (content may include, but is not limited to, web pages, documents, audio, video, and interactive applications). The recommendation delivery may include an explanation of why the recommendation was made, including indicating inferences of relevant or common interests, for expected bilateral interests, and the explanation may be accessed interactively by the recommendation recipient. The explanation may include reasoning based on behavioral-based information where the behavioral information may be associated with one or more usage behavior categories of Table 1.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the same time, or at a later time, a recommendation of the first party may be delivered to the second party <b>2020</b>. This recommendation may also be generated by a computer-based system based, at least in part, on behavioral-based inferences associated with the two parties.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An expression of interest is detected <b>2030</b> for each of the two parties for each other. The detection may be through an overt online indication such as, for example, marking a checkbox or any other type of overtly indicative behavior, or the detection may be based, at least in part, on inferences from non-overt behaviors. In other words, the indication of interest in a second party may be explicit and conscious by a first party, or it may be inferred by a computer-based system from implicit, unconscious and/or involuntary behaviors or responses of a party. As just one example, a physiological response (that is presumably involuntary) may be monitored by the computer-based system, as described in Table 1, and be used to infer interest in another party. In some embodiments, the expression of interest by one party toward another party, whether implicit or explicitly, may be determined by degree; for example, from low to high.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The existence of a mutual expression of interest is determined <b>2040</b>. If there is a mutual expression of interest, or sufficient level of bilateral interest, then the mutual expression of interests are revealed to both parties <b>2050</b>.

Contact information may be provided to each party so that they can make contact with one another. An explanation of why each party was recommended to the other may be included.

System navigation and access behaviors include usage behaviors <b>920</b> such as accesses to, and interactions with computer-based applications and content such as documents, Web pages, images, videos, TV channels, audio, radio channels, multi-media, interactive content, interactive computer applications, e-commerce applications, or any other type of information item or system &#x201c;object.&#x201d; Such content or objects may be representations of people, and may include, such representations of people may include, but are not limited to, pictures of the person, videos of the person, voice recordings, biographical documents, interests, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">These process usage behaviors may be conducted through use of a keyboard, a mouse, oral commands, or using any other input device. Usage behaviors <b>920</b> in the system navigation and access behaviors category may include, but are not limited to, the viewing or reading of displayed information, typing written information, interacting with online objects orally, or combinations of these forms of interactions with computer-based applications. This category includes the explicit searching for information, using, for example, a search engine. The search term may be in the form of a word or phrase to be matched against documents, pictures, web-pages, or any other form of on-line content. Alternatively, the search term may be posed as a question by the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">System navigation and access behaviors may also include executing transactions, including commercial transactions, such as the buying or selling of merchandise, services, or financial instruments. System navigation and access behaviors may include not only individual accesses and interactions, but the capture and categorization of sequences of information or system object accesses and interactions over time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">A second category of usage behaviors <b>920</b> is known as subscription and self-profiling behaviors. Subscriptions may be associated with specific topical areas or other elements of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, or may be associated with any other subset of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. Subscriptions may thus indicate the intensity of interest with regard to elements of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. The delivery of information to fulfill subscriptions may occur online, such as through electronic mail (email), on-line newsletters, XML feeds, etc., or through physical delivery of media.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Self-profiling refers to other direct, persistent (unless explicitly changed by the user) indications explicitly designated by the one or more users regarding their preferences and/or intentions and interests, or other meaningful attributes. A user <b>200</b> may explicitly identify interests or affiliations, such as job function, profession, or organization, and preferences and/or intentions, such as representative skill level (e.g., novice, business user, advanced). Self-profiling enables the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> to infer explicit preferences and/or intentions of the user. For example, a self-profile may contain information on skill levels or relative proficiency in a subject area, organizational affiliation, or a position held in an organization. Self-profiling may also include information on interests with regard to meeting other people online or offline. For example, they may include criteria for location, age, education, gender, physical features and the like pertaining to people the user may wish to meet or connect with. A user <b>200</b> that is in the role, or potential role, of a supplier or customer may provide relevant context for effective adaptive e-commerce applications through self-profiling. For example, a potential supplier may include information on products or services offered in his or her profile. Self-profiling information may be used to infer preferences and/or intentions and interests with regard to system use and associated topical areas, and with regard to degree of affinity with other user community subsets. A user may identify preferred methods of information receipt or learning style, such as visual or audio, as well as relative interest levels in other communities.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">A third category of usage behaviors <b>920</b> is known as collaborative behaviors. Collaborative behaviors are interactions among the one or more users. Collaborative behaviors may thus provide information on areas of interest and intensity of interest. Interactions including online referrals of elements or subsets of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, such as through email, whether to other users or to non-users, are types of collaborative behaviors obtained by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Other examples of collaborative behaviors include, but are not limited to, online discussion forum activity, contributions of content or other types of objects to the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, or any other alterations of the elements, objects or relationships among the elements and objects of one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. Collaborative behaviors may also include general user-to-user communications, whether synchronous or asynchronous, such as email, instant messaging, interactive audio communications, and discussion forums, as well as other user-to-user communications that can be tracked by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">A fourth category of process usage behaviors <b>920</b> is known as reference behaviors. Reference behaviors refer to the marking, designating, saving or tagging of specific elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> for reference, recollection or retrieval at a subsequent time. Tagging may include creating one or more symbolic expressions, such as a word or words, associated with the corresponding elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> for the purpose of classifying the elements or objects. The saved or tagged elements or objects may be organized in a manner customizable by users. The referenced elements or objects, as well as the manner in which they are organized by the one or more users, may provide information on inferred interests of the one or more users and the associated intensity of the interests.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">A fifth category of process usage behaviors <b>920</b> is known as direct feedback behaviors. Direct feedback behaviors include ratings or other indications of perceived quality by individuals of specific elements or objects of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, or the attributes associated with the corresponding elements or objects. The direct feedback behaviors may therefore reveal the explicit preferences and/or intentions of the user. In the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, the recommendations <b>910</b> may be rated by users <b>200</b>. This enables a direct, adaptive feedback loop, based on explicit preferences and/or intentions specified by the user. Direct feedback also includes user-written comments and narratives associated with elements or objects of the computer-based system <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">A sixth category of process usage behaviors is known as physiological responses. These responses or behaviors are associated with the focus of attention of users and/or the intensity of the intention, or any other aspects of the physiological responses of one or more users <b>200</b>. For example, the direction of the visual gaze of one or more users may be determined. This behavior can inform inferences associated with preferences and/or intentions or interests even when no physical interaction with the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> is occurring. Even more direct assessment of the level of attention may be conducted through access to the brain patterns or signals associated with the one or more users. Such patterns of brain functions during participation in a process can inform inferences on the preferences and/or intentions or interests of users, and the intensity of the preferences and/or intentions or interests. The brain patterns assessed may include MRI images, brain wave patterns, relative oxygen use, or relative blood flow by one or more regions of the brain.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Physiological responses may include any other type of physiological response of a user <b>200</b> that may be relevant for making preference or interest inferences, independently, or collectively with the other usage behavior categories. Other physiological responses may include, but are not limited to, utterances, gestures, movements, or body position. Physiological responses may also include other physical response phenomena such as, but not limited to, breathing rate, heart rate, temperature, perspiration, blood pressure, or galvanic response.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">A seventh category of process usage behaviors is known as environmental conditions and physical location behaviors. Physical location behaviors identify physical location and mobility behaviors of users. The location of a user may be inferred from, for example, information associated with a Global Positioning System or any other positionally or locationally aware system or device, or may be inferred directly from location information input by a user (e.g., a zip code or street address), or otherwise acquired by the computer-based systems <b>925</b>. The physical location of physical objects referenced by elements or objects of one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> may be stored for future reference. Proximity of a user to a second user (including a first person that will be, or has already been, recommended to a second person), or to physical objects referenced by elements or objects of the computer-based application, may be inferred. The length of time, or duration, at which one or more users reside in a particular location may be used to infer intensity of interests associated with the particular location, or associated with objects that have a relationship to the physical location. Derivative mobility inferences may be made from location and time data, such as the direction of the user, the speed between locations or the current speed, the likely mode of transportation used, and the like. These derivative mobility inferences may be made in conjunction with geographic contextual information or systems, such as through interaction with digital maps or map-based computer systems. Environmental conditions may include the time of day, the weather, lighting levels, sound levels, and any other condition of the environment around the one or more users <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In addition to the usage behavior categories depicted in Table 1, usage behaviors may be categorized over time and across user behavioral categories. Temporal patterns may be associated with each of the usage behavioral categories. Temporal patterns associated with each of the categories may be tracked and stored by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. The temporal patterns may include historical patterns, including how recently an element, object or item of content associated with one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. For example, more recent behaviors may be inferred to indicate more intense current interest than less recent behaviors.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Another temporal pattern that may be tracked and contribute to preference inferences that are derived, is the duration associated with the access or interaction with the elements, objects or items of content of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, or the user's physical proximity to physical objects (including people) referenced by system objects of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, or the user's physical proximity to other users. For example, longer durations may generally be inferred to indicate greater interest than short durations. In addition, trends over time of the behavior patterns may be captured to enable more effective inference of interests and relevancy. Since delivered recommendations <b>910</b> may include one or more elements, objects or items of content of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, the usage pattern types and preference inferencing may also apply to interactions of the one or more users with the delivered recommendations <b>910</b> themselves, including accesses of, or interactions with, explanatory information regarding the logic or rational that the one more computer-based systems <b>925</b> used in deliver the recommendation <b>910</b> to the user.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">User Behavior and Usage Framework</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a usage framework <b>1000</b> for performing preference and/or intention inferencing of tracked or monitored usage behaviors <b>920</b> by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.

Recall that a community may include a single user or multiple users. Sub-communities may likewise include one or more users. Thus, the individual usage patterns <b>1004</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may also be described as representing the usage patterns of a community or a sub-community. For the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, usage behavior patterns may be segmented among communities and individuals so as to effectively enable adaptive advertising delivery <b>910</b> for each sub-community or individual.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The communities identified by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> may be determined through self-selection, through explicit designation by other users or external administrators (e.g., designation of certain users as &#x201c;experts&#x201d;), or through automatic determination by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. The communities themselves may have relationships between each other, of multiple types and values. In addition, a community may be composed not of human users, or solely of human users, but instead may include one or more other computer-based systems, which may have reason to interact with the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. Or, such computer-based systems may provide an input into the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, such as by being the output from a search engine. The interacting computer-based system may be another instance of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The usage behaviors <b>920</b> included in Table 1 may be categorized by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> according to the usage framework <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, categories of usage behavior may be captured and categorized according to the entire community usage patterns <b>1002</b>, sub-community usage patterns <b>1006</b>, and individual usage patterns <b>1004</b>. The corresponding usage behavior information may be used to infer preferences and/or intentions and interests at each of the user levels.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Multiple usage behavior categories shown in Table 1 may be used by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> to make reliable inferences of the preferences and/or intentions and/or intentions of a user with regard to elements, objects, or items of content associated with the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. There may be different preference inferencing results for different users.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">By introducing different or additional behavioral characteristics, such as the duration of access of an item of content, on which to base updates to the structure of one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, more adaptive and relevant people recommendations are enabled. For example, duration of access will generally be much less correlated with navigational proximity than access sequences will be, and therefore provide a better indicator of true user preferences and/or intentions and/or intentions. Therefore, combining access sequences and access duration will generally provide better inferences and associated system structural updates than using either usage behavior alone. Effectively utilizing additional usage behaviors as described above will generally enable increasingly effective system structural updating. In addition, the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> may employ user affinity groups to enable even more effective system structural updating than are available merely by applying either individual (personal) usage behaviors or entire community usage behaviors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Furthermore, relying on only one or a limited set of usage behavioral cues and signals may more easily enable potential &#x201c;spoofing&#x201d; or &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. &#x201c;Spoofing&#x201d; or &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> refers to conducting consciously insincere or otherwise intentional usage behaviors <b>920</b>, so as to influence the costs of recommendations <b>910</b> of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. Utilizing broader sets of system usage behavioral cues and signals may lessen the effects of spoofing or gaming. One or more algorithms may be employed by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> to detect such contrived usage behaviors, and when detected, such behaviors may be compensated for by the preference and interest inferencing algorithms of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In some embodiments, the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> may provide users <b>200</b> with a means to limit the tracking, storing, or application of their usage behaviors <b>920</b>. A variety of limitation variables may be selected by the user <b>200</b>. For example, a user <b>200</b> may be able to limit usage behavior tracking, storing, or application by usage behavior category described in Table 1. Alternatively, or in addition, the selected limitation may be specified to apply only to particular user communities or individual users <b>200</b>. For example, a user <b>200</b> may restrict the application of the full set of her process usage behaviors <b>920</b> to preference or interest inferences by one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> for application to only herself, and make a subset of process behaviors <b>920</b> available for application to users only within her workgroup, but allow none of her process usage behaviors to be applied by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> in making inferences of preferences and/or intentions and/or intentions or interests for other users.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">User Communities</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0056">As described above, a user associated with one or more systems <b>925</b> may be a member of one or more communities of interest, or affinity groups, with a potentially varying degree of affinity associated with the respective communities. These affinities may change over time as interests of the user <b>200</b> and communities evolve over time. The affinities or relationships among users and communities may be categorized into specific types. An identified user <b>200</b> may be considered a member of a special sub-community containing only one member, the member being the identified user. A user can therefore be thought of as just a specific case of the more general notion of user or user segments, communities, or affinity groups.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the affinities among user communities and how these affinities may automatically or semi-automatically be updated by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> based on user preferences and/or intentions which are derived from user behaviors <b>920</b>. An entire community <b>1050</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The community may extend across organizational, functional, or process boundaries. The entire community <b>1050</b> includes sub-community A <b>1064</b>, sub-community B <b>1062</b>, sub-community C <b>1069</b>, sub-community D <b>1065</b>, and sub-community E <b>1070</b>. A user <b>1063</b> who is not part of the entire community <b>1050</b> is also featured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Sub-community B <b>1062</b> is a community that has many relationships or affinities to other communities. These relationships may be of different types and differing degrees of relevance or affinity. For example, a first relationship <b>1066</b> between sub-community B <b>1062</b> and sub-community D <b>1065</b> may be of one type, and a second relationship <b>1067</b> may be of a second type. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first relationship <b>1066</b> is depicted using a double-pointing arrow, while the second relationship <b>1067</b> is depicted using a unidirectional arrow.)</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">The relationships <b>1066</b> and <b>1067</b> may be directionally distinct, and may have an indicator of relationship or affinity associated with each distinct direction of affinity or relationship. For example, the first relationship <b>1066</b> has a numerical value <b>1068</b>, or relationship value, of &#x201c;0.8.&#x201d; The relationship value <b>1068</b> thus describes the first relationship <b>1066</b> between sub-community B <b>1062</b> and sub-community D <b>1065</b> as having a value of 0.8.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The relationship value may be scaled as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (e.g., between 0 and 1), or may be scaled according to another interval. The relationship values may also be bounded or unbounded, or they may be symbolically represented (e.g., high, medium, low).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The user <b>1063</b>, which could be considered a user community including a single member, may also have a number of relationships to other communities, where these relationships are of different types, directions and relevance. From the perspective of the user <b>1063</b>, these relationship types may take many different forms. Some relationships may be automatically formed by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>, for example, based on interests or geographic location or similar traffic/usage patterns. Thus, for example the entire community <b>1050</b> may include users in a particular city. Some relationships may be context-relative. For example, a community to which the user <b>1063</b> has a relationship could be associated with a certain process, and another community could be related to another process. Thus, sub-community E <b>1070</b> may be the users associated with a product development business to which the user <b>1063</b> has a relationship <b>1071</b>; sub-community B <b>1062</b> may be the members of a cross-business innovation process to which the user <b>1063</b> has a relationship <b>1073</b>; sub-community D <b>1065</b> may be experts in a specific domain of product development to which the user <b>1063</b> has a relationship <b>1072</b>. The generation of new communities which include the user <b>1063</b> may be based on the inferred interests of the user <b>1063</b> or other users within the entire community <b>1050</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Membership of communities may overlap, as indicated by sub-communities A <b>1064</b> and C <b>1069</b>. The overlap may result when one community is wholly a subset of another community, such as between the entire community <b>1050</b> and sub-community B <b>1062</b>. More generally, a community overlap will occur whenever two or more communities contain at least one user or user in common. Such community subsets may be formed automatically by the one or more systems <b>925</b>, based on preference inferencing from user behaviors <b>920</b>. For example, a subset of a community may be formed based on an inference of increased interest or demand of particular content or expertise of an associated community. The one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> is also capable of inferring that a new community is appropriate. The one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> will thus create the new community automatically.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">For each user, whether residing within, say, sub-community A <b>1064</b>, or residing outside the community <b>1050</b>, such as the user <b>1063</b>, the relationships (such as arrows <b>1066</b> or <b>1067</b>), affinities, or &#x201c;relationship values&#x201d; (such as numerical indicator <b>1068</b>), and directions (of arrows) are unique. Accordingly, some relationships (and specific types of relationships) between communities may be unique to each user. Other relationships, affinities, values, and directions may have more general aspects or references that are shared among many users, or among all users of the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>. A distinct and unique mapping of relationships between users, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, could thus be produced for each user by the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">The one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> may automatically generate communities, or affinity groups, based on user behaviors <b>920</b> and associated preference inferences.

Thus, the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> utilizes automatically generated and manually generated communities.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The communities, affinity groups, or user segments aid the one or more computer-based systems <b>925</b> in matching interests optimally, developing learning groups, prototyping process designs before adaptation, and many other uses.
