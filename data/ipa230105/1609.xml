Also, throughout the specification, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; means to be located above or below a target portion, and does not necessarily mean that the target portion is located on the upper side with respect to the gravitational direction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">All terms including technical terms and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. Commonly used predefined terms are further interpreted as having a meaning consistent with the relevant technical literature and the present disclosure, and are not to be construed as ideal or very formal meanings unless defined otherwise.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, in some embodiments, well-known techniques are not specifically described to avoid an undesirable interpretation of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For decorating switch buttons in vehicles, metallic aluminum, metallic paint, matte coating, ion plating, and in-mold film are used. The ion plating and the metallic paint are used for providing metallic texture to switch buttons, but since there is a difference between feeling when seeing them with the naked eye and feeling when touching them, there is a detriment in terms of marketability. Thus, alternatively, a method of plating a metal on a button surface of a polymer material may be used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In metal plating method, there are two types. A first type thereof is a multiple injection partial plating method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of the multiple injection partial plating method. In this method, different materials are injected into and bonded to a plating area and a non-plating area for the partial plating. A polycarbonate material is firstly injected so that a shape of a desired symbol (character or pattern) is formed for the formation of the non-plating area, and a metal-platable ABS or PC+ABS material is injected onto a surface thereof. In this method, molten ABS or PC+ABS is bonded to a PC material. Thereafter, when wet chrome plating (chemical plating+electroplating) is performed, a plating layer is formed only on an ABS or PC+ABS surface, and the PC material becomes a non-plating area.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to this method, since a new mold is required every time the symbol is changed, a mold investment increases, and plating failure occurs when injection failure occurs due to insufficient flowability during injection molding.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A second type thereof is a laser cutting partial plating method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a laser cutting partial plating method. A plastic plating process includes a sequential process in which conductivity is imparted to a non-conductive injection material by chemical plating and then a metal layer is formed by electroplating, and this equally applies to the above-described plastic plating.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The laser cutting partial plating method is a method of forming a symbol, a pattern, etc. on a product surface by partially removing a chemical plating layer by using laser cutting after chemical plating and then performing electroplating.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, in the laser cutting partial plating including the sequential process, it would be difficult to take out a product from a plating jig after the chemical plating, laser-cutting the product, and then mount it again on the plating jig to perform the electroplating thereon.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In view of the foregoing, a metal plating method that may more effectively form symbols on plastics is desired.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An embodiment of the present invention provides A manufacturing method of a symbol button for a vehicle, including: preparing a button body comprising a side portion, a top portion formed of a metal-platable polymer material on which a metal is able to be plated; forming an electrically conductive layer on an outside of the button body using a conductive polymer material; forming a plating shielding layer or plating blocking layer in a form of a symbol using a material on which a metal is not able to be plated on the electrically conductive layer; and performing metal plating on the outside of the button body having the plating shielding layer. By embodying the symbol through the region where the plating shielding layer is present, the driver can distinguish the symbol with the naked eye, and the metal appearance and the metal cool touch feeling can be given to the button for the automobile through the metal plating layer.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since a button according to an embodiment of the present invention includes an electrically conductive layer below the plating shielding layer, when the electroplating is performed, the enclosed symbol inner area and the outer area are energized through the electrically conductive layer. Therefore, it is possible to form a metal plating layer not only on the outside of the symbol having the closed shape of the outside but also on the closed symbol inside area.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, there is no need to change the symbol for the energization of the closed form symbol inside area, and the sign visibility can be improved.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the electrically conductive layer and the plating shielding layer are made of a material having optical transparency, the portion where the metal plating layer is formed is shielded from light and the illumination is implemented through the region where the plating shielding layer exists at night. Accordingly, the visibility of the symbol button for the automobile can be secured.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a symbol button for a vehicle, including: a button body comprising a side portion, a top portion; and a symbol display portion positioned on the top portion;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">wherein, the symbol display portion comprises an electrically conductive layer positioned on the top portion and a plating shielding layer positioned on the electrically conductive layer, and wherein, a metal plating layer is disposed in an outside the button except the plating shielding layer.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of manufacturing a button according to an embodiment of the present invention. An embodiment of the present invention provides A manufacturing method of a symbol button for a vehicle, including: preparing a button body comprising a side portion, a top portion formed of a polymer material on which a metal is able to be plated; forming an electrically conductive layer on an outside of the button body using a conductive polymer material; forming a plating shielding layer in a form of a symbol using a material on which a metal is not able to be plated on the electrically conductive layer; and performing metal plating on the outside of the button body having the plating shielding layer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The top portion is required to a metal-platable material on which a metal is able to be plated. In addition, the top portion may be a semi-transparent or transparent material. In other words, it can be made of a material having light transmittance, and in this case, night view visibility can be ensured by implementing illumination. Specifically, it may be made of ABS, PC+ABS or PC material having metal plating ability.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the step of preparing the button body, the side portion and the top portion may be manufactured by a single material injection method through which the side portion and the top portion is made of a same material or a double material injection method through which the side portion and the top portion is made of a different material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> show a button body manufactured by a single material injection method. In this case, the side portion may be made of a polymer material that can be plated with the same material as the top portion. When a button body is made of a polymer material capable of being metal-plated as described above, there is a problem that a metal plating layer is formed inside the button body when the electroplating is performed in a subsequent process so that light is not transmitted. Also, there may arise a problem electrically energizing with an illumination configuration (LED or the like) located inside the button body. Therefore, a plating preventing portion is formed by using a material that is not able to be plated with metal at the lower end of the side portion, thereby preventing a metal plating layer from being formed inside the button body. The plating preventing portion may be removed after the button manufacturing is completed, or may be used without being removed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The step of forming the plating preventing portion may be performed by dipping or pad printing a plating shielding composition or by plating after attaching a film of PVC, TPU, or PP, which does not react with plating chemicals. At this time, the material of the film may be PVC, TPU, PP film, but preferably PVC film is the most excellent. For example, the PVC material <b>3</b>M Automotive Grade high adhesion Scotchcal&#x2122; can be used.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> shows a button body manufactured by a different material injection method. In this case, the side portion may be a polymer material that is not able to be plated with metal, so that a metal plating may be prevented from being formed inside the button without forming the plating preventing portion separately. By maintaining the gap between the PCB circuit and the metal plating layer, it is possible to prevent the circuit damage by energization during the electrostatic discharge. Further, the side portion may be made of a material having no light transmittance. In this case, it is possible to block the light leakage to the side. Specifically, the side portion may be made of a material selected from the group consisting of PC, TPU, and a mixture thereof, on which the metal is not plated. However, when the top portion is a PC, the side portion may be limited to the TPU.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The button body may have a thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm. When the thickness is too thin, the moldability at the time of injection may be deteriorated. When the thickness is too thick, the light transmittance is lowered to 5 or less, and the HAZE is 95 or more, so that lighting is difficult to implement.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The step of forming the electrically conductive layer may be performed by printing a conductive polymer material on the top portion.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The electrically conductive layer enables energization of the enclosed form inside and outside, thereby enabling formation of an electroplating layer in the closed form of the symbol. When it is made of a material having light transmittance, the light can be transmitted, thereby ensuring visibility at night.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The step of forming the electrically conductive layer may be performed by printing the electrically conductive composition on the top portion. The conductive composition may be composed of a polymer material having light transmittance. In one embodiment herein, an electrically conductive layer was formed using Henkel's LOCTITE&#xae; ECI 5005 transparent conductive ink. In this case, it is possible to form a light-transmitting electrically conductive layer having a conductivity as high as &#x2dc;55 ohm/sq at 305/34 mesh and a light transmittance of 90% or more and a HAZE of 2% or less by a simple process.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The electrically conductive layer may have a thickness of 5 to 15 &#x3bc;m. When the thickness is too thin, the electrical conductivity is lowered, and a metal plating layer may not be formed in the closed area of the closed form in plating. If it is too thick, the printing quality may be lowered due to ink flow after printing.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the step of forming the electrically conductive layer, the electrically conductive layer may be formed in a closed symbol shape in which the inside and the outside are separated. In this case, even if the area of the electrically conductive layer is reduced, the outer region and the inner region in the closed symbol form can be energized, and a metal plating layer can be formed in the inner region of the closed symbol type. Accordingly, a manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The step of forming the plating shielding layer may be performed by a method of printing the plating shielding composition in the form of a symbol display portion on the electrically conductive layer. The printing method may be performed by pad printing, screen printing, laser printing, or the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the plating shielding composition is printed, the plating shielding composition can be cured by drying at a temperature of 60 to 80&#xb0; C. for 0.5 to 2.0 hours.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The plating shielding composition may include a PVC resin, a solvent, and an antistatic agent.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The plated shielding composition should have properties such that it is not eroded or peeled off by the plating agent during the plating process.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">PVC resin has excellent chemical resistance against sulfuric acid, chromic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like in the etching step of the subsequent metal plating process, and the metal is not plated even when the metal plating process is performed. Specifically, the PVC resin may have a molecular weight of 15,000 to 25,000 Mw. More specifically the PVC resin may have a molecular weight of 2000 to 3000 Mw.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The composition may contain 3 to 7% by weight of solvent based on 100% by weight of the plating shielding composition. The solvent is used to control the viscosity of the plating shielding composition and to disperse the resin, thereby ensuring the printing workability. Specific examples of the solvent include Acetonitrile, ISOPHORONE, XYLENE, and the like. The viscosity of the plated shielding composition may be 2000 cP to 5000 cP. If the amount of the solvent is too large, the viscosity of the plating shielding composition is lowered to less than 2000 cP, printing spreading becomes severe, and it may be difficult to secure the film thickness. If the amount of the solvent is too small, the viscosity becomes too high, the dispersibility may deteriorate, and the plating shielding composition may remain on the pad without being printed smoothly during printing, resulting in deterioration of printability.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The plating shielding composition may further comprise a curing agent. If a curing agent is further included, the durability properties such as chemical resistance, heat resistance, adhesion and the like, can be increased. Specifically, the curing agent may be included in an amount of 10 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the plating shielding composition. If too much curing agent is included, the printability may be degraded and the pot life of the plating shielding composition due to air exposure may be shortened. If the amount of the curing agent is too small, cracking of the coating film due to over-curing may occur.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The plating shielding composition may be composed of a material having light transparency. In this case, since a metal plating layer is not formed in a portion where the plating shielding layer is formed, illumination through the plating shielding layer can be realized. Therefore, night visibility of the symbol button for automobile can be secured.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The plating shielding layer may have a thickness of 5 to 15 &#x3bc;m and an electrical resistance of 50 to 75 ohm/sq. When the above range is satisfied, a formation of a metal plating layer on the plating shielding layer region can be suppressed. If the thickness of the plating shielding layer is too thin, it may be eroded or peeled off by the acid solution in the subsequent plating process, and if it is too thick, the printing quality may be deteriorated or the appearance of the finished product may be deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the step of forming a plating shielding layer in a form of a symbol using a material on which a metal is not able to be plated on the electrically conductive layer, the plating shielding layer may be formed in the same symbol shape with a width equal to or less than the width of the electrically conductive layer formed in the closed symbol shape. If the plated shielding layer is formed to have the same width as the width of the electrically conductive layer, the amount of expensive transparent conductive ink used can be reduced to reduce the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the plated shielding layer is formed to be narrower than the width of the electrically conductive layer, alignment of the symbol shape is easy. In addition, plating defects due to printing defects of the plating shielding layer and/or the electrically conductive layer, and product defective ratio can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The step of performing the metal plating on the outside of the button body having the plating shielding layer may be an electroplating method. Specifically, wet chrome plating can be performed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Wet chromium plating can be roughly divided into an etching step, a chemical plating step, and an electroplating step.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The etching step (pretreatment) serves to dissolve the butadiene component by using chromic acid or sulfuric acid on the surface of ABS or PC+ABS, and to form an anchor hole, thereby realizing the plating adhesion.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Chemical plating is a process for imparting conductivity to the surface of a non-conductive plastic injection material to form a thin chemical nickel plating layer (1 &#x3bc;m).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Electroplating implements copper/nickel/chrome sequentially by applying electricity to the product surface.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0000">In the case of the plating shielding layer, since the PVC material is not dissolved in chromic acid or sulfuric acid, a chemical nickel plating layer is not formed, and a plating layer is not formed in the electroplating.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">The electrically conductive layer and the plating shield layer may have a light transmittance of 80% or more. In this case, since an illumination member such as an LED or the like is disposed inside the button, lighting can be implemented through the portion where the plating shielding layer exists, and night visibility can be ensured. If the light transmittance is too low, visibility at night may be insufficient.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Hereinafter, examples and comparative examples will be described.
