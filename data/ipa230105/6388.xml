A shorting terminal is contactably arranged to face the shorting terminal facing portion, whereby the shorting terminal can be prevented from entering into the bottoms of the recesses. Thus, a conductive state of the terminal fitting and the shorting terminal can be satisfactorily realized and the connection reliability of the terminal fitting and the shorting terminal can be secured.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(2) Preferably, a part of the bead between the both front and rear end parts in the base wall portion is thicker than the both front and rear end parts of the bead. By pressing the outer surface of the base wall portion by a press, the recesses can be formed in the both front and rear end parts of the bead. By designing press parts such that a material in both front and rear end parts of the bead moves toward the part of the bead between the both front and rear end parts during pressing, the part of the bead between the both front and rear end parts can be thickened. By pressing, the shorting terminal facing portion located outwardly of the bottoms of the recesses can be easily formed between the both front and rear end parts of the bead in the outer surface of the base wall portion. By thickening the part of the bead between the both front and rear end parts, the rigidity of this part can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(3) Further, the connector of the present disclosure is provided with the terminal fitting configured as described above and a housing for accommodating a pair of the terminal fittings and a shorting terminal, the shorting terminal having a pair of contact surfaces facing the shorting terminal facing portions in the pair of terminal fittings. According to this configuration, since the pair of contact surfaces of the shorting terminal can face and contact the shorting terminal facing portions, the connection reliability of the terminal fittings and the shorting terminal can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(4) The recesses may be arranged in a widthwise central part of the outer surface of the base wall portion, and a widthwise central part of the contact surface may be arranged at a position deviated in a width direction from the widthwise central part of the outer surface of the base wall portion. According to this configuration, the shorting terminal is less likely to enter the recesses and the connection reliability of the terminal fittings and the shorting terminal can be more improved.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Details of Embodiment of Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Specific examples of a terminal fitting and a connector of the present disclosure are described below with reference to the drawings.

The receiving surface <b>310</b> of a receiving portion has a recessed surface portion <b>311</b> corresponding to the lower surface of the bead <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Subsequently, a press surface <b>410</b> of a press die <b>400</b> is pressed against the upper surface of the base of the base wall portion <b>14</b>. The press surface <b>410</b> of the press die <b>400</b> is shaped to correspond to the upper surface shape of the base wall portion <b>14</b>. The press surface <b>410</b> of the press die <b>400</b> has a curved surface part corresponding to the upper surface of the bead <b>28</b>. The curved surface part of the press die <b>400</b> includes projections <b>411</b> having a convex curved surface at positions corresponding to the front and rear recesses <b>31</b>, and an escaping portion <b>412</b> having a concave curved surface at a position corresponding to the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b>. The escaping portion <b>412</b> is recessed to a depth larger than a height from the bottoms <b>36</b> of the recesses <b>31</b> to the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The press die <b>400</b> presses the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b>, whereby both front and rear end parts of the bead <b>28</b> are compressed between the projections <b>411</b> of the press die <b>400</b> and the recessed surface portion <b>311</b> of the receiving die <b>300</b> and the recesses <b>31</b> are formed in the upper surface of the bead <b>28</b>. Simultaneously, the material on the sides of the recesses <b>31</b> moves toward the escaping portion <b>412</b> of the press die <b>400</b>, and a part of the bead <b>28</b> between both end parts of the front end is raised to form the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> in the upper surface of the bead <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the material moves from both front and rear end sides of the bead <b>28</b> toward a front-rear central side by the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> being pressed as described above. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the part including the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> between the both front and rear end parts becomes thicker than the both front and rear end parts including the recesses <b>31</b> in the bead <b>28</b>. Further, the part of the bead <b>28</b> between the both front and rear end parts is also thicker than a part of the base wall portion <b>14</b> on the side of the reference surface <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">&#x3c;Connection Structure of Terminal Fittings and Shorting Terminals&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In assembling, the shorting terminals <b>60</b> are accommodated into the shorting terminal accommodating portions <b>83</b> and the terminal fittings <b>10</b> are accommodated into the cavities <b>81</b>. Out of these, a pair of the terminal fittings <b>10</b> are in contact with the resilient pieces <b>63</b> of the shorting terminal <b>60</b> facing the cavities <b>81</b> while being inserted in the cavities <b>81</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In other words, the pair of resilient pieces <b>63</b> are in contact with the terminal fittings <b>10</b> inserted into the cavities <b>81</b> while applying resilient reaction forces to the terminal fittings <b>10</b>. In this way, the pair of terminal fittings <b>10</b> are electrically shorted via the shorting terminal <b>60</b>. Note that a shorted state of the pair of terminal fittings <b>10</b> is released by an unillustrated releasing portion when the housing <b>80</b> and the unillustrated mating housing are properly connected.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the case of this embodiment, the contact surfaces <b>64</b> of the pair of resilient pieces <b>63</b> are arranged in regions corresponding to the beads <b>28</b>, out of the upper surfaces of the base wall portions <b>14</b>, for reasons relating to the setting of the connector.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, the upper surface of the bead <b>28</b> includes the recesses <b>31</b> in the both front and rear end parts and the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> between the front and rear ends. Thus, the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> can face and contact the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). A recess amount of the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> is sufficiently less than those of the recesses <b>31</b>. Therefore, the resilient piece <b>63</b> does not excessively drop into the bead <b>28</b> and a satisfactory contact load is secured between the shorting terminal <b>60</b> and the terminal fitting <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in the case of this embodiment, a widthwise central part of the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> is set at a position deviated in the width direction from the widthwise central part of the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Then, the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> is in contact with one widthwise side (widthwise inner side on the side of a partition wall <b>86</b> partitioning between the adjacent cavities <b>81</b> in the case of this embodiment) of the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> in a biased manner. The one widthwise side of the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> is constituted by the reference surface <b>29</b>. Thus, the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> can stably contact the reference surface <b>29</b> of the base wall portion <b>14</b> along the width direction.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the other hand, if the widthwise central part of the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> and the widthwise central part of the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> coincide in the width direction unlike this embodiment, there is a concern that the resilient piece <b>63</b> drops into the recess <b>31</b> when the resilient piece <b>63</b> is positionally deviated in the width direction due to an assembling error, vibration or the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In that respect, according to the above configuration, the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> can widely contact the reference surface <b>29</b> of the base wall portion <b>14</b> on the one widthwise side of the upper surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b>. As a result, the concern that the resilient piece <b>63</b> drops into the recess <b>31</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, according to this embodiment, the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> of the shorting terminal <b>60</b> is contactably arranged to face the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b>, whereby the entry (drop) of the contact surface <b>64</b> of the resilient piece <b>63</b> into the bottom <b>36</b> of the recess <b>31</b> can be prevented. Thus, a conductive state of the terminal fitting <b>10</b> and the shorting terminal <b>60</b> can be satisfactorily realized and the connection reliability of the terminal fitting <b>10</b> and the shorting terminal <b>60</b> can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, in the case of this embodiment, the recesses <b>31</b> can be formed in the both front and rear end parts of the bead <b>28</b> by pressing the outer surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b> by the press and, further, the material on the sides of the recesses <b>31</b> can move, whereby the part of the bead <b>28</b> between the both front and rear end parts can be formed thick. Simultaneously, the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b> can be formed at a position higher than the bottoms <b>36</b> of the recesses <b>31</b> in the outer surface of the base wall portion <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">By forming the part of the bead <b>28</b> between the both front and rear end parts thicker than the both front and rear end parts of the bead <b>28</b>, sufficient durability can be ensured for the shorting terminal <b>60</b> when the shorting terminal <b>60</b> contacts the shorting terminal facing portion <b>32</b>.
