Jun. 30, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates generally to decomposition chambers for an exhaust aftertreatment system of an internal combustion engine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For internal combustion engines, such as diesel engines, nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) compounds may be emitted in exhaust. It may be desirable to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>emissions to comply with environmental regulations, for example. To reduce NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, a reductant may be dosed into the exhaust by a dosing system and within an aftertreatment system. The reductant facilitates conversion of a portion of the exhaust into non-NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, such as nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and water (H<sub>2</sub>O), thereby reducing NO<sub>x </sub>emissions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exhaust and reductant react within a component of the aftertreatment system. This component is typically configured to attain a specific conversion of the exhaust into non-NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. However, this configuration typically decreases performance and efficiency of the aftertreatment system. For example, this configuration may cause an increase in back pressure on an internal combustion engine which can cause decreased efficiency of the internal combustion engine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a decomposition chamber for an exhaust aftertreatment system includes an inlet conduit centered on an inlet conduit axis and configured to receive exhaust, a decomposition conduit coupled to the inlet conduit, an endcap coupled to the decomposition conduit, and an injector coupled to the endcap and configured to provide reductant into the decomposition conduit along an injection axis. The decomposition chamber includes a guide swirl mixer coupled to at least one of the inlet conduit or the endcap. The guide swirl mixer includes a first portion disposed within the inlet conduit, and a second portion disposed within the decomposition conduit such that the inlet conduit axis extends through the second portion. The second portion extends at least partially around the injection axis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a decomposition chamber for an exhaust aftertreatment system includes a decomposition conduit, an endcap, an injector, and a guide swirl mixer.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of, methods, apparatuses, and for decomposing constituents of exhaust in an exhaust aftertreatment system of an internal combustion engine. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of a number of ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Internal combustion engines (e.g., diesel internal combustion engines, etc.) produce exhaust that contains constituents, such as NOR, Na, CO<sub>2</sub>, and/or H<sub>2</sub>O. In some applications, an exhaust aftertreatment system is utilized to dose the exhaust with a reductant so as to reduce NOR emissions in the exhaust. These exhaust aftertreatment systems may include a decomposition chamber within which the reductant is provided and mixed with the exhaust.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Enhancing mixing of the reductant and exhaust can increase desirability of an exhaust aftertreatment system. However, enhancing mixing of the reductant and exhaust can lead to increasing the backpressure of the decomposition chamber (e.g., on an internal combustion engine having the exhaust aftertreatment system, etc.), thereby decreasing desirability of the exhaust aftertreatment system (e.g., because performance of the internal combustion engine is negatively impacted by the increased backpressure, etc.). Additionally, the reductant may form deposits within the exhaust aftertreatment system, such as on internal surfaces of the decomposition chamber, which can decrease desirability of the decomposition chamber because the backpressure of the decomposition chamber is increased, and/or because NOR emissions cannot be desirably reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Current systems include an inlet downpipe and a horizontal decomposition chamber, such that exhaust from the inlet downpipe enters the decomposition chamber through a tangential interface. However, this configuration causes the exhaust to flow to the outer diameter of the decomposition chamber, which leads to a cyclonic vortex being generated across the length of the decomposition chamber.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It thus is desirable to interface the inlet pipe with the decomposition chamber along a centerline of the decomposition chamber rather than tangentially. An internal guide swirl mixer is provided along an internal surface to provide additional downstream mixing. For instance, the decomposition chamber includes an inlet conduit (e.g., the inlet downpipe) centered on an inlet conduit axis configured to receive exhaust and coupled to a decomposition conduit (e.g., the horizontal decomposition chamber). An endcap may be coupled to the decomposition conduit, and an injector coupled to the endcap to provide reductant into the decomposition conduit along an injection axis. The guide swirl mixer may be coupled to at least one of the inlet conduit or the endcap. The guide swirl mixer includes a first portion disposed within the inlet conduit, and a second portion disposed within the decomposition conduit such that the inlet conduit axis extends through the second portion. The second portion extends at least partially around the injection axis. For instance, the guide swirl mixer may be a &#x201c;C&#x201d; shaped plate. In some embodiments, the swirl mixer may be a &#x201c;J&#x201d; shaped plate. These configurations cause the exhaust to swirl within the decomposition conduit and creates a low pressure region within the decomposition conduit so as to facilitate desirable mixing of the exhaust and the reductant upstream of the SCR catalyst member when the reductant is provided into the low pressure region. The decomposition chamber is thus thermally efficient, compact, and lightweight, with low back pressure, low deposit, and high NO<sub>x </sub>performance.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II. Example Exhaust Aftertreatment System</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> having an example reductant delivery system <b>102</b> for an exhaust conduit system <b>104</b> (e.g., pipe system, tube system, etc.). The exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> includes the reductant delivery system <b>102</b>, a particulate filter (e.g., a diesel particulate filter (DPF), etc.) <b>106</b>, a decomposition chamber <b>108</b> (e.g., decomposition reactor, reactor pipe, decomposition tube, reactor tube, etc.), and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst member <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The particulate filter <b>106</b> is configured to remove particulate matter, such as soot, from exhaust flowing in the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>. The particulate filter <b>106</b> includes an inlet, where the exhaust is received, and an outlet, where the exhaust exits after having particulate matter substantially filtered from the exhaust and/or converting the particulate matter into carbon dioxide. In some implementations, the particulate filter <b>106</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The decomposition chamber <b>108</b> is configured to convert a reductant into ammonia. The reductant may be, for example, urea, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), Adblue&#xae;, a urea water solution (UWS), an aqueous urea solution (e.g., AUS32, etc.), and other similar fluids. The decomposition chamber <b>108</b> includes an inlet fluidly coupled to (e.g., fluidly configured to communicate with, etc.) the particulate filter <b>106</b> to receive the exhaust containing NO<sub>x </sub>emissions and an outlet for the exhaust, NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, ammonia, and/or reductant to flow to the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reductant delivery system <b>102</b> includes a dosing module <b>112</b> (e.g., doser, etc.) configured to dose the reductant into the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> (e.g., via an injector). The dosing module <b>112</b> is mounted to the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> such that the dosing module <b>112</b> may dose the reductant into the exhaust flowing in the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>. The dosing module <b>112</b> may include an insulator interposed between a portion of the dosing module <b>112</b> and the portion of the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> on which the dosing module <b>112</b> is mounted.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The dosing module <b>112</b> is fluidly coupled to a reductant source <b>114</b>. The reductant source <b>114</b> may include multiple reductant sources <b>114</b>. The reductant source <b>114</b> may be, for example, a diesel exhaust fluid tank containing Adblue&#xae;. A reductant pump <b>116</b> (e.g., supply unit, etc.) is used to pressurize the reductant from the reductant source <b>114</b> for delivery to the dosing module <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the reductant pump <b>116</b> is pressure controlled (e.g., controlled to obtain a target pressure, etc.). The reductant pump <b>116</b> includes a reductant filter <b>118</b>. The reductant filter <b>118</b> filters (e.g., strains, etc.) the reductant prior to the reductant being provided to internal components (e.g., pistons, vanes, etc.) of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. For example, the reductant filter <b>118</b> may inhibit or prevent the transmission of solids (e.g., solidified reductant, contaminants, etc.) to the internal components of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. In this way, the reductant filter <b>118</b> may facilitate (e.g., allow, permit, etc.) prolonged desirable operation of the reductant pump <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the reductant pump <b>116</b> is coupled to (e.g., attached to, fixed to, welded to, integrated with, etc.) a chassis of a vehicle associated with the exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The dosing module <b>112</b> includes at least one injector <b>120</b>. Each injector <b>120</b> is configured to dose the reductant into the exhaust (e.g., within the decomposition chamber <b>108</b>, etc.). In some embodiments, the reductant delivery system <b>102</b> also includes an air pump <b>122</b>. In these embodiments, the air pump <b>122</b> draws air from an air source <b>124</b> (e.g., air intake, etc.) and through an air filter <b>126</b> disposed upstream of the air pump <b>122</b>. Additionally, the air pump <b>122</b> provides the air to the dosing module <b>112</b> via a conduit. In these embodiments, the dosing module <b>112</b> is configured to mix the air and the reductant into an air-reductant mixture and to provide the air-reductant mixture into the decomposition chamber <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the reductant delivery system <b>102</b> does not include the air pump <b>122</b> or the air source <b>124</b>. In such embodiments, the dosing module <b>112</b> is not configured to mix the reductant with air.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The dosing module <b>112</b> and the reductant pump <b>116</b> are also electrically or communicatively coupled to a reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b>. The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> is configured to control the dosing module <b>112</b> to dose the reductant into the decomposition chamber <b>108</b>. The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> may also be configured to control the reductant pump <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> includes a processing circuit <b>130</b>. The processing circuit <b>130</b> includes a processor <b>132</b> and a memory <b>134</b>. The processor <b>132</b> may include a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc., or combinations thereof. The memory <b>134</b> may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providing a processor, ASIC, FPGA, etc. with program instructions. This memory <b>134</b> may include a memory chip, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), flash memory, or any other suitable memory from which the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable programming language. The memory <b>134</b> may include various modules that include instructions which are configured to be implemented by the processor <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In various embodiments, the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> is configured to communicate with a central controller <b>136</b> (e.g., engine control unit (ECU)), engine control module (ECM), etc.) of an internal combustion engine having the exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the central controller <b>136</b> and the reductant delivery system controller <b>128</b> are integrated into a single controller.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the central controller <b>136</b> is communicable with a display device (e.g., screen, monitor, touch screen, heads up display (HUD), indicator light, etc.). The display device may be configured to change state in response to receiving information from the central controller <b>136</b>. For example, the display device may be configured to change between a static state (e.g., displaying a green light, displaying a &#x201c;SYSTEM OK&#x201d; message, etc.) and an alarm state (e.g., displaying a blinking red light, displaying a &#x201c;SERVICE NEEDED&#x201d; message, etc.) based on a communication from the central controller <b>136</b>. By changing state, the display device may provide an indication to a user (e.g., operator, etc.) of a status (e.g., operation, in need of service, etc.) of the reductant delivery system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The decomposition chamber <b>108</b> is located upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>. As a result, the reductant is injected by the injector <b>120</b> upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> such that the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> receives a mixture of the reductant and exhaust. The reductant droplets undergo the processes of evaporation, thermolysis, and hydrolysis to form non-NO<sub>x </sub>emissions (e.g., gaseous ammonia, etc.) within the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> and/or the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> is configured to assist in the reduction of NO<sub>x </sub>emissions by accelerating a NO<sub>x </sub>reduction process between the reductant and the NO<sub>x </sub>of the exhaust into diatomic nitrogen, water, and/or carbon dioxide. The SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> includes an inlet fluidly coupled to the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> from which exhaust and reductant are received and an outlet fluidly coupled to an end of the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> may further include an oxidation catalyst (e.g., a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC)) fluidly coupled to the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b> (e.g., downstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> or upstream of the particulate filter <b>106</b>) to oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, the particulate filter <b>106</b> may be positioned downstream of the decomposition chamber <b>108</b>. For instance, the particulate filter <b>106</b> and the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b> may be combined into a single unit. In some implementations, the dosing module <b>112</b> may instead be positioned downstream of a turbocharger or upstream of a turbocharger.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> has been shown and described in the context of use with a diesel internal combustion engine, it is understood that the exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> may be used with other internal combustion engines, such as gasoline internal combustion engines, hybrid internal combustion engines, propane internal combustion engines, and other similar internal combustion engines.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Example Decomposition Chamber with Guide Swirl Mixer</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b></figref> illustrate the decomposition chamber <b>108</b> according to an example embodiment. The decomposition chamber <b>108</b> includes an inlet assembly <b>200</b> (e.g., mixing assembly, etc.). As is described in more detail herein, the inlet assembly <b>200</b> is configured to receive the exhaust and to facilitate mixing of the exhaust and the reductant.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The inlet assembly <b>200</b> includes an inlet fitting <b>202</b> (e.g., connector, coupling, etc.). The inlet fitting <b>202</b> is configured to receive the exhaust from a portion of the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b> that is upstream of the decomposition chamber <b>108</b>. For example, the inlet fitting <b>202</b> may receive the exhaust after the exhaust has flowed through the particulate filter <b>106</b>. The inlet fitting <b>202</b> may be coupled to, or integrally formed with, a portion of the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b> and <b>34</b></figref>, the inlet fitting <b>202</b> comprises a flange that is configured to be coupled to a flange of an upstream conduit of the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The inlet assembly <b>200</b> also includes an inlet conduit <b>204</b> (e.g., pipe, tube, etc.).

The inlet conduit <b>204</b> is fluidly coupled to the inlet fitting <b>202</b> and configured to receive the exhaust from the inlet fitting <b>202</b>. In various embodiments, the inlet fitting <b>202</b> and the inlet conduit <b>204</b> cooperate to facilitate redirection of the exhaust from a first direction to a second direction different from the first direction.

In some embodiments, the inlet conduit <b>204</b> may have multiple bends creating a &#x201c;twisted&#x201d; pipe.

For example, the inlet conduit <b>204</b> is coupled to a cylindrical surface of the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> in various embodiments. The decomposition conduit <b>209</b> is fluidly coupled to the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and is configured to receive the exhaust from the inlet conduit <b>204</b>. As is explained in more detail herein, the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> facilitates mixing of the exhaust and the reductant, and provision of the exhaust and reductant to the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The decomposition conduit <b>209</b> is centered on a decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> (e.g., center line, etc.). In various embodiments, the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> intersects the inlet conduit axis <b>208</b> and the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> and the inlet conduit axis <b>208</b> extend along a reference plane. As a result, the exhaust does not flow tangentially from the inlet conduit <b>204</b> into the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. Additionally, the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> and the inlet conduit axis <b>208</b> are separated by an angular separation &#x3b1; measured along the reference plane.

The endcap <b>214</b> is coupled to the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> such that the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> extends through the endcap <b>214</b>. The endcap <b>214</b> encloses the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> such that all exhaust flowing through the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> is received from the inlet conduit <b>204</b>. The inlet conduit <b>204</b> does not provide the exhaust into the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> via the endcap <b>214</b>. Thus, rather than receiving the exhaust axially, such as along an axis that is parallel to the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b>, the exhaust can only enter the inlet conduit <b>204</b>, which is coupled to an outer surface of the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>, rather than the endcap <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The decomposition chamber <b>108</b> also includes a guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> (e.g., plate, baffle, etc.). A first portion of the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> is disposed within the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and a second portion of the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> is disposed within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. As a result, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> extends within both the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. In various embodiments, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> may be constructed from steel (e.g., stainless steel, SS439, SS436L, etc.).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As is explained in more detail herein, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> is configured to cooperate with the inlet conduit <b>204</b> to concentrate (e.g., funnel, etc.) the exhaust prior to the exhaust being provided to the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. By concentrating the exhaust in this way, the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> may increase a velocity of the exhaust as the exhaust flows towards the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. The guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> is also configured to cooperate with the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> and the endcap <b>214</b> to cause the exhaust to concentrate the exhaust and cause the exhaust to swirl within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. Specifically, a portion of the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> extends along the endcap <b>214</b> and this portion cooperates with the endcap <b>214</b> and the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> to form a channel within which the exhaust flows. The portion of the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> that extends along the endcap <b>214</b> may extend spirally along the endcap <b>214</b> or may extend along a circular arc along the endcap <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">After the exhaust exits this channel (e.g., flows past the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b>, etc.), the exhaust is imparted with a rotation within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. As is explained in more detail herein, the exhaust aftertreatment system <b>100</b> harnesses this rotation to facilitate desirable mixing of the exhaust and the reductant upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>. For example, the exhaust is caused to swirl within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. Additionally, the rotation creates a low pressure region within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. As is explained in more detail herein, the reductant may be provided into this low pressure region so as to facilitate desirable mixing of the exhaust and the reductant upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>. In these ways, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> enables desirable mixing of the exhaust and the reductant upstream of the SCR catalyst member <b>110</b>. As used herein, a &#x201c;low pressure region&#x201d; is a region where pressure of the exhaust is less than 50% (e.g., less than 41%, less than 40%, less than 35%, less than 25%, etc.) of a pressure of the exhaust within the inlet conduit <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> includes a first portion <b>218</b>. The first portion <b>218</b> extends into the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and may be coupled to the inlet conduit <b>204</b>. The first portion <b>218</b> may be straight and angled away from a wall of the inlet conduit <b>204</b> and toward the inlet conduit axis <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> also includes a second portion <b>220</b>.

The second portion <b>220</b> may be coupled to the endcap <b>214</b> and include a portion that is curved relative to the first portion <b>218</b>. The first portion <b>218</b> and the second portion <b>220</b> cooperate to facilitate directing the exhaust from the straight portion <b>207</b> to the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> by the first portion <b>218</b> (e.g., a deflector).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In various embodiments, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second portion <b>220</b> includes a straight segment <b>222</b>. The straight segment <b>222</b> may be aligned with the first portion <b>218</b>. For instance, the straight segment <b>222</b> may be formed as an extension of the first portion <b>218</b> and contiguous with the first portion <b>218</b>, such that the straight segment <b>222</b> extends into the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In these embodiments, the second portion <b>220</b> also includes a curved segment <b>224</b>. The curved segment <b>224</b> may be contiguous with the straight segment <b>222</b>. The curved segment <b>224</b> may extend at least partially around the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b>. Thus, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> may form a &#x201c;C&#x201d; or &#x201c;J&#x201d; shape to generate the swirl of the exhaust within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. In some embodiments, the plane along which the inlet conduit axis <b>208</b> and the decomposition conduit axis <b>210</b> extends insects the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> at two locations. For example, the plane may intersect the straight segment <b>222</b> and also intersect the curved segment <b>224</b>. The curved segment <b>224</b> may have various diameters in various embodiments. For instance, as shown, the curved segment <b>224</b> may for a relatively full &#x201c;C&#x201d; shape (i.e., generally a semicircular configuration). However, in some embodiments, a reduced diameter may be used. For instance, the curved segment <b>224</b> may have a more open configuration (i.e., generally a partial oval configuration). A reduced diameter of the curved segment <b>224</b> may reduce backpressure in the exhaust conduit system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The exhaust thus flows between the curved segment <b>224</b>, the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>, and the endcap <b>214</b> which increases the velocity of the exhaust. This arrangement also causes the exhaust to swirl within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> downstream of the curved segment <b>224</b>. This swirl extends around a low pressure region (e.g., the swirl creates a vorticity, etc.). By variously configuring the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> and locating the injector <b>120</b>, the reductant may be injected into the low pressure region. This enables the reductant to travel further downstream within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> prior to becoming entrained in the swirling exhaust within the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>, which enhances mixing of the reductant and the exhaust.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> includes a slot <b>225</b> (e.g., aperture, window, etc.) formed in the second portion <b>220</b>. The slot <b>225</b> may be disposed on the curved segment <b>224</b>. The second portion <b>220</b> is located proximate the endcap <b>214</b> such that the exhaust flows between the second portion <b>220</b> and the endcap <b>214</b> via the slot <b>225</b>. The slot <b>225</b> facilitates separation of a portion of the exhaust flowing within the second portion <b>220</b> from a remainder of the exhaust flowing within the second portion <b>220</b>. The portion of the exhaust that flows through the slot <b>225</b> is imparted with a rotation due to the second portion <b>220</b>, and this portion of the exhaust uses this rotation to swirl between the second portion <b>220</b> and the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> after flowing through the slot <b>225</b>. In this way, the slot <b>225</b> provides additional swirl, and therefore facilitates additional mixing of the reductant and the exhaust.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The slot <b>225</b> functions as an exhaust assist feature which enables a portion of the exhaust to flow from between the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> and the endcap <b>214</b>, through the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b>, and into the low pressure region. This portion of the exhaust assists in propelling the reductant along the injection axis into the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> and creates a second swirl of the exhaust. The second swirl extends within the low pressure region created by the first swirl of the exhaust (e.g., created by the exhaust that does not flow through the slot <b>225</b>, etc.). In some embodiments, the slot <b>225</b> provides the exhaust across a tip of the injector <b>120</b>. In this way, the slot <b>225</b> mitigates formation of deposits proximate the tip of the injector <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> also includes a window <b>226</b> (e.g., slot, aperture, etc.) formed in the second portion <b>220</b>. The window <b>226</b> may be disposed on the curved segment <b>224</b>. The window <b>226</b> is configured to facilitate passage of the exhaust through the second portion <b>220</b> independent of slot <b>225</b>. In various embodiments, the window <b>226</b> is aligned with the slot <b>225</b>. The window <b>226</b> facilitates separation of a portion of the exhaust flowing within the second portion <b>220</b> from a remainder of the exhaust flowing within the second portion <b>220</b>. The portion of the exhaust that flows through the window <b>226</b> is imparted with a rotation due to the second portion <b>220</b>, and this portion of the exhaust uses this rotation to swirl between the second portion <b>220</b> and the decomposition conduit <b>209</b> after flowing through the window <b>226</b>. In this way, the window <b>226</b> provides additional swirl, and therefore facilitates additional mixing of the reductant and the exhaust. The swirl provided by the window <b>226</b> may enhance the swirl provided by the slot <b>225</b>, and the swirl provided by the slot <b>225</b> may enhance the swirl provided by the window <b>226</b>. By locating the window <b>226</b> at various distances from the endcap <b>214</b>, the location of the swirl provided by the window <b>226</b> can be tailored for a target application. For example, the window <b>226</b> may be located at a distance from the endcap <b>214</b> that is selected based on a characteristic (e.g., spray cone geometry, etc.) of the injector <b>120</b>. The window <b>226</b> decreases backpressure provided by the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> and, similar to the slot <b>225</b>, functions as an exhaust assist feature which enables a portion of the exhaust to flow through the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> and into the low pressure region. This portion of the exhaust assists in propelling the reductant along the injection axis into the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Additionally, the slot <b>225</b> and/or the window <b>226</b> may function to mitigate recirculation near a tip of the injector <b>120</b> and therefore reduce deposit formation. The window <b>226</b> may be located in such a manner that a spray cone of the injector <b>120</b> (e.g., a volume within which the injector <b>120</b> sprays the reductant, etc.) does not impinge on an internal surface of the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b>. As a result, the window <b>226</b> may reduce formation of deposits and provide an additional decrease in backpressure.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In various embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the straight segment <b>222</b> is not tangential to the curved segment <b>224</b>.

Instead, the curved segment <b>224</b> extends from the straight segment <b>222</b> so as to cause the exhaust to flow radially outwards and towards the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>. This arrangement may result in further concentration of the exhaust between the curved segment <b>224</b>, the decomposition conduit <b>209</b>, and the endcap <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, the first portion <b>218</b> is not coupled to or integrally formed with the second portion <b>220</b>.

The portion of the exhaust that flows through the gap <b>223</b> may not be imparted with rotation and may instead provide a sheer flow against the swirl generated by the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b>. The sheer flow may mitigate flow of the exhaust from the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b> between the first portion <b>218</b> and the straight portion <b>207</b> due to the swirl generated by the guide swirl mixer <b>216</b>.
