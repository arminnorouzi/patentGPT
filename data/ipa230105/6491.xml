The electrical energy is provided to a battery, which is used to power various sources in automotive applications and stationary engines. An alternator, typically, includes a rotor, a stator, a shaft, a regulator, and a rectifier. The rotor rotates about a fixed axis and includes a coil (referred to as rotor windings) wound around a rotationally disposed iron core. The stator surrounds the rotor and is fixed and is formed by a set of copper coils (hereinafter referred to as stator windings) wound around a fixed core.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The shaft is coupled to the rotor and is rotatable about the fixed axis to rotate the rotor with respect to the stator. A pulley is mounted on the shaft and a belt is mounted on the pulley which is coupled to an engine. During running of the engine, the pulley is rotated by a belt which causes the shaft and the rotor to rotate. As the rotor rotates with respect to the stator windings, a magnetic field, caused due to magnetic poles of the rotor, cuts through the stator windings, varying as it so does, producing electrical current in the stator windings which is of alternating nature, i.e., an alternating current (NC), owing to the variation in the magnetic field. To power components in applications, such as automobiles, the NC output may have to be converted to direct current (D/C) using, for example, a rectifier. Further, a regulator may regulate an output voltage of the alternator and the alternator include a fan to cool the stator during operation of the alternators.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the conventional alternators, the stator windings are made of copper. This is because copper has high conductivity and low resistivity. However, copper is an expensive material and the usage of copper for the stator windings increases the cost of the alternators. Further, copper, being a high-grade material, may not have to be used to meet the requirements for an alternator, and may be reserved for other applications, such as for applications related to alternative source of energy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Materials, such as enameled aluminum, may be used as an alternative to copper for stator winding wires. However, since aluminum has conductivity less than that of copper, such as only 61% of the conductivity of copper, a larger diameter of aluminum may have to be used to compensate for the loss in conductivity. For instance, resistivity of copper 1.68&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>ohm and that of aluminum is 2.85&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>ohm. Hence, to obtain a resistance same as that of 1 mm diameter of copper wire, aluminum wire of diameter 1.3 mm may have to be used. However, such increase in size of stator winding wires may cause an increase in the overall size of the alternator. As a result, the weight of the alternator increases.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the winding wires are wound in specialized slots created in the stator. In the conventional alternators that use copper as stator winding wires, a slot fill factor in stator with copper winding wires is around 80%, i.e., 80% of the slot is filled with copper. However, since the cross section of aluminum wire to be used is higher than that of the copper wire, it may be difficult to accommodate the aluminum wire in the specialized slots of the stator. For instance, cross sectional area for 1 mm diameter copper wire is 0.785 Sq. mm while cross-sectional area of the 1.3 mm diameter aluminum wire is 1.324 Sq. mm. Therefore, aluminum wire having the same resistance as that of the copper wire has a cross-sectional area that is 1.7 times more than that of copper wire, which may be difficult to be accommodated in the existing stator slots. Therefore, if aluminum wire is to be used as the stator winding wire, a larger slot may have to be used for the winding wires. This may further cause an increase in the size of stator.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, since the heat resistivity of aluminum is higher, the heat generated of the aluminum may be higher than that of copper. The increase in heat generation may reduce the efficiency and performance of the alternator. The performance of the alternator is defined by an output current at a specified voltage and a specified RPM of the alternator.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present subject matter relates to alternators for use in vehicles and that use aluminum wires in stator assemblies. With the implementations of the present subject matter, aluminum can be used as stator wire in the alternators without increasing the size of the stator slot, and thereby, without increasing the size of the alternator. The alternator may include a stator assembly, a rotor, a casing, and a shaft. The stator assembly is fixed, i.e., does not rotate, and includes a stator frame and a stator winding that is wound on the stator frame. The stator windings, as mentioned above, are made of aluminum.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The rotor is enclosed inside the stator. The rotor has a first end and a second end. The second end is opposite the first end. The rotor rotates about a fixed axis. The casing may enclose both the rotor and the stator assembly. The shaft is disposed in the casing with the ends of the shaft extending beyond the casing. The rotor is fixedly disposed on the shaft and the shaft is rotatable about the fixed axis. Therefore, as the shaft rotates, the rotor also rotates. In an example, a pulley may be disposed on the shaft and may be connected to an engine of the vehicle through a belt. During the operation of the engine, the shaft is rotated by the engine through the belt and the pulley arrangement. This rotates the rotor. The rotation of the rotor may cause production of output voltage in the stator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The alternator may include an external fan mounted on the shaft and disposed outside the casing and may include, disposed internal to the casing, a first internal fan and a second internal fan. The first internal fan may be mounted on the shaft and may be disposed inside the casing at a first end of the rotor. The second internal fan may be mounted on the shaft and may be disposed inside the casing. During operation, large amount of heat may be generated due to heating of the aluminum stator windings. With the provision of three fans, i.e., one external fan and two internal fans, the heat generated in the aluminum windings is effectively dissipated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, by effectively dissipating the heat generated by aluminum winding and providing cooling, the conductivity of the aluminum is increased. Therefore, with the present subject matter, aluminum winding with diameter and thereby, cross-sectional area, same as that of copper winding used in conventional alternators, can be used to obtain same performance as that of the conventional alternators. The present subject matter eliminates the usage of copper wire for stator winding. Therefore, the present subject matter eliminates the problems associated with usage of copper for the stator windings, such as high cost and the difficulty in availability of copper. At the same time, since the same cross-sectional size of the aluminum windings as that of the conventional copper windings is usable, the present subject matter ensures that the same stator used in conventional alternators can be used for in the alternator of the present subject matter, in other words, without requiring additional tooling and cost for manufacturing the stator. Further, the cost of aluminum is lesser than that of copper and the usage of aluminum winding results in substantial savings of costs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the weight of the aluminum winding is less than that of the copper winding of same specification. For instance, aluminum winding is one-third the weight of the copper winding of same specification. Therefore, by replacing the copper winding with aluminum winding, weight of the alternator reduces which cause reduction in the weight of the engine and the fuel efficiency of the engine is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present subject matter is further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref><i>f</i>.

The alternator <b>100</b> may be used for a vehicle. Hereinafter, the alternator <b>100</b> may be explained with reference to usage in a vehicle. The alternator <b>100</b> may include a rotor <b>102</b> and a stator assembly <b>104</b>.

The second end <b>103</b>-<b>2</b> may be opposite the first end <b>103</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The stator assembly <b>104</b> may surround the rotor <b>102</b> and may be fixed, i.e., the stator assembly <b>104</b> does not rotate. The stator assembly <b>104</b> may include a stator winding <b>108</b> and a stator frame <b>110</b>. The stator winding <b>108</b> may be wound on the stator frame <b>110</b>. As the rotor <b>102</b> rotates within the stator winding <b>108</b>, the magnetic field of the rotor <b>102</b> cuts through the stator winding <b>108</b>, varying as it so does, producing electrical current in the stator winding <b>108</b>, which is of alternating nature. In other words, an alternating current (NC), owing to the variation in the magnetic field, may be produced. In an example, the stator winding <b>108</b> may be made of aluminum. In an example, the diameter of the stator frame <b>110</b> may be at least 100 millimeter (mm) and the diameter of the stator winding <b>108</b> is at least 1.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The alternator <b>100</b> may include a casing <b>112</b>. The casing <b>112</b> may enclose the rotor <b>102</b> and the stator assembly <b>104</b>. In an example, the casing <b>112</b> may include a first member <b>114</b> and a second member <b>116</b>. The first member <b>114</b> and the second member <b>116</b> may be bolted together. The first member <b>114</b> may include a first opening (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and the second member <b>116</b> may include a second opening (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The alternator <b>100</b> may include a shaft <b>118</b> on which the rotor <b>102</b> is mounted.

The shaft <b>118</b> may be rotatably supported by the casing <b>112</b> by a plurality of brackets (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The alternator <b>100</b> may be coupled to an engine (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the vehicle by a belt (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and a pulley <b>122</b>. The pulley <b>122</b> may be disposed on and fastened to the shaft <b>118</b> on a first end of the alternator <b>100</b> (hereinafter referred to as drive end (DE) side). Therefore, during running of the engine, the engine may transfer rotational torque to the rotor <b>102</b>. For instance, the engine may cause the belt and the pulley <b>122</b> to rotate, which causes the shaft <b>118</b> and the rotor <b>102</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The alternator <b>100</b> may include slip rings <b>124</b> on an end of the alternator <b>100</b>. Particularly, the slip rings <b>124</b> may be fastened to the second end <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> of the shaft <b>118</b>. An end (i.e., a second end) of the alternator <b>100</b> where the slip rings <b>124</b> are disposed may be referred to as the slip ring end (SRE) side. As will be understood, the drive end side is opposite to the SRE side. Further, a pair of brushes <b>126</b> may be housed in a brush holder (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) disposed inside the casing <b>112</b> such that the pair of brushes <b>126</b> slide in contact with the slip rings <b>124</b> to supply electric current to the rotor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The alternator <b>100</b> may include a regulator <b>128</b> to regulate the output voltage of the alternator <b>100</b>. The regulator <b>128</b> has two inputs and one output. The inputs are field current supply and a control voltage input, and the output is the field current to the rotor <b>102</b>. The regulator <b>128</b> may use the control voltage input to control the amount of field current input that is allowed to pass through to the rotor winding. The regulator <b>128</b> is coupled to a battery (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). If a voltage of the battery drops, the regulator <b>128</b> senses this and allows more of the field current input to reach the rotor <b>102</b>, which increases the magnetic field strength, thereby increasing the voltage output of the alternator <b>100</b>. Conversely, if the battery voltage goes up, less field current goes through to the rotor windings, and the output voltage is reduced.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The alternator <b>100</b> includes a rectifier <b>130</b> to convert NC output induced in the stator assembly <b>104</b> to direct current (D/C) output and thereby, may be used to power components in the vehicle. In an example, the rectifier <b>130</b> may include a plurality of diodes for instance, six diodes, i.e., a pair for each stator winding <b>108</b>. The rectifier <b>130</b> may include a rectifier wiring <b>131</b>. The rectifier wiring <b>131</b> may be, for example, made of copper.

Thus, the same performance characteristic can be achieved with the alternator of the present subject matter having the same stator configuration as the stator of the conventional alternator. Further, an improved cooling efficiency is obtained with the alternator of the present subject matter. The present subject matter, by improving the cooling efficiency, also improves the efficiency of the engine.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0045">With the provision of three fans, i.e., one external fan and two internal fans, the heat generated in the aluminum windings is effectively dissipated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0046">Further, by effectively dissipating the heat generated by aluminum winding and providing cooling, the conductivity of the aluminum is increased. Therefore, with the present subject matter, aluminum winding with diameter and thereby, cross-sectional area, same as that of copper winding used in conventional alternators, can be used to obtain same performance as that of the conventional alternators. The present subject matter eliminates the usage of copper wire for stator winding. Therefore, the present subject matter eliminates the problems associated with usage of copper for the stator windings, such as high cost and the difficulty in availability of copper. At the same time, since the same cross-sectional size of the aluminum windings as that of the conventional copper windings is usable, the present subject matter ensures that the same stator used in conventional alternators can be used for in the alternator of the present subject matter, in other words, without requiring additional tooling and cost for manufacturing the stator. Further, the cost of aluminum is lesser than that of copper and the usage of aluminum winding results in substantial savings of costs.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0047">In addition, the weight of the aluminum winding is less than that of the copper winding of same specification. For instance, aluminum winding is one-third the weight of the copper winding of same specification. Therefore, by replacing the copper winding with aluminum winding, weight of the alternator reduces which cause reduction in the weight of the engine and the fuel efficiency of the engine is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0048">Although the present subject matter has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the subject matter, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the subject matter.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I/We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
