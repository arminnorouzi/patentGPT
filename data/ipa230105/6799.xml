The 3GPP may define specifications for next generation mobile networks, systems and devices.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the name given to a project to improve the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone or device standard to cope with future requirements. In one aspect, UMTS has been modified to provide support and specification for the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At least some aspects of the systems and methods disclosed herein may be described in relation to the 3GPP LTE, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) and other standards (e.g., 3GPP Releases 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and/or 15). However, the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited in this regard. At least some aspects of the systems and methods disclosed herein may be utilized in other types of wireless communication systems.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wireless communication device may be an electronic device used to communicate voice and/or data to a base station, which in turn may communicate with a network of devices (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), the Internet, etc.). In de-scribing systems and methods herein, a wireless communication device may alternatively be referred to as a mobile station, a UE, an access terminal, a subscriber station, a mobile terminal, a remote station, a user terminal, a terminal, a subscriber unit, a mobile device, etc. Examples of wireless communication devices include cellular phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, netbooks, e-readers, wireless modems, etc. In 3GPP specifications, a wireless communication device is typically referred to as a UE. However, as the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited to the 3GPP standards, the terms &#x201c;UE&#x201d; and &#x201c;wireless communication device&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein to mean the more general term &#x201c;wireless communication device.&#x201d; A UE may also be more generally referred to as a terminal device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In 3GPP specifications, a base station is typically referred to as a Node B, an evolved Node B (eNB), a home enhanced or evolved Node B (HeNB) or some other similar terminology. As the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to 3GPP standards, the terms &#x201c;base station,&#x201d; &#x201c;Node B,&#x201d; &#x201c;eNB,&#x201d; &#x201c;gNB&#x201d; and &#x201c;HeNB&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein to mean the more general term &#x201c;base station.&#x201d; Furthermore, the term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; may be used to denote an access point. An access point may be an electronic device that provides access to a network (e.g., Local Area Network (LAN), the Internet, etc.) for wireless communication devices. The term &#x201c;communication device&#x201d; may be used to denote both a wireless communication device and/or a base station. An eNB may also be more generally referred to as a base station device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be noted that as used herein, a &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be any communication channel that is specified by standardization or regulatory bodies to be used for International Mobile Telecommunications-Advanced (IMT-Advanced) and all of it or a subset of it may be adopted by 3GPP as licensed bands (e.g., frequency bands) to be used for communication between an eNB and a UE. It should also be noted that in E-UTRA and E-UTRAN overall description, as used herein, a &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be defined as &#x201c;combination of downlink and optionally uplink resources.&#x201d; The linking between the carrier frequency of the downlink resources and the carrier frequency of the uplink resources may be indicated in the system information transmitted on the downlink resources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The 5th generation communication systems, dubbed NR (New Radio technologies) by 3GPP, envision the use of time/frequency/space resources to allow for services, such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broad-Band) transmission, URLLC (Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication) transmission, and eMTC (massive Machine Type Communication) transmission. And, in NR, transmissions for different services may be specified (e.g., configured) for one or more bandwidth parts (BWPs) in a serving cell and/or for one or more serving cells. A user equipment (UE) may receive a downlink signal(s) and/or transmit an uplink signal(s) in the BWP(s) of the serving cell and/or the serving cell(s).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order for the services to use the time, frequency, and/or space resources efficiently, it would be useful to be able to efficiently control downlink and/or uplink transmissions. Therefore, a procedure for efficient control of downlink and/or uplink transmissions should be designed. Accordingly, a detailed design of a procedure for downlink and/or uplink transmissions may be beneficial.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various examples of the systems and methods disclosed herein are now described with reference to the Figures, where like reference numbers may indicate functionally similar elements.
