The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. The implementations described below are merely examples and are not intended to limit the implementations to the precise forms disclosed. Instead, the implementations were selected for description to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the implementations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Multiple vertical-emitting devices may be arranged to form an array. For example, multiple vertical-emitting devices (herein referred to as emitters) may be arranged to form a VCSEL array, such as a grid VCSEL array (e.g., where multiple emitters are uniformly spaced and oxidation trenches may be shared by two or more emitters), a non-grid VCSEL array (e.g., where multiple emitters are not uniformly spaced and each emitter requires a set of oxidation trenches which may or may not be shared), or the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One factor when designing a VCSEL array is a density of emitters within the VCSEL array. Increasing the density of emitters within the VCSEL array (i.e., reducing space between the emitters) may allow for a reduction in a size and/or a reduction in cost of an integrated circuit (IC) on which the VCSEL array is constructed (e.g., while achieving a same power output as a VCSEL array without reduced spacing). For a non-grid VCSEL array (e.g., where the emitters are arranged at non-uniform distances and/or angles with respect to each other) that includes emitters of a prior design (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;prior emitters&#x201d;), each emitter may need a separate set of oxidation trenches. This may introduce a limit on minimum spacing between emitters of the VCSEL array (e.g., for a given set of design rules associated with manufacturing the VCSEL array), thereby limiting the density of the non-grid VCSEL array.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One technique by which the spacing between the emitters in the non-grid VCSEL array may be reduced is by decreasing widths of one or more emitter layers, such as a trench layer (i.e., a set of oxidation trenches), a P-Ohmic metal layer, a dielectric via opening, or the like. However, such a reduction may be difficult and/or impossible due to fabrication limitations associated with manufacturing the emitters and/or design considerations associated with the emitters.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Implementations described herein may provide a compact emitter design that may allow spacing between emitters of a VCSEL array to be reduced (e.g., as compared to a prior emitter design), thereby allowing for increased emitter density within the VCSEL array (e.g., as compared to a VCSEL array using prior emitters). Moreover, the compact emitter design may allow for increased emitter density while achieving a same level of performance as compared to the prior emitter design. In other words, the compact emitter design allows for the size of emitters, included in the VSCEL array, to be reduced without sacrificing performance (e.g., in terms of an output power, wavelength, emission profile, reliability, etc.) as compared to the prior emitter design.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the reduction in emitter spacing may be achieved by using a split architecture for one or more emitter layers, such as a P-Ohmic metal layer (e.g., a metal layer), an implant isolation layer (e.g., formed by an isolation material), a dielectric via opening, or the like. The split architecture may allow spaces between oxidation trenches to be utilized by causing the one or more emitter layers (e.g., the P-Ohmic metal layer and the dielectric via opening) to be interdigitized with the oxidation trenches (e.g., such that extended portions of the one or more layers lie partially between respective oxidation trenches, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). Due to the utilization of the spaces between the oxidation trenches, a size of the emitter may be reduced (e.g., by approximately 20% as compared to a prior emitter design), thereby allowing for increased emitter density in a non-grid VCSEL array.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, alignment tolerances between emitter layers and/or minimum widths of the emitter layers may not be affected by use of the split architecture, which may prevent manufacturing and/or design considerations, associated with the emitter, from being impacted. In other words, widths of and/or spacing between emitter layers may be the same as corresponding widths and spacing of the prior emitter design. This may allow the compact emitter design to have performance characteristics that match performance characteristics of the prior emitter design, as described above, while allowing a size of the emitter to be reduced and an array density to be increased.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are diagrams depicting top-views of a design for an emitter <b>100</b> (e.g., a prior emitter design) and a design for an example compact emitter <b>150</b>, respectively.

Similarly, the inner radius of P-Ohmic metal layer <b>154</b> may the same as the inner radius of P-Ohmic metal layer <b>104</b> of emitter <b>100</b>. As described elsewhere herein, maintaining such widths and spacing may allow compact emitter <b>150</b> to match a performance of emitter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown by the white polygons or disconnected concentric arcuate segments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, compact emitter <b>150</b> may include a set of oxidation trenches <b>162</b> (e.g., each of a partial ring-shape) that are positioned partially between dielectric via openings <b>156</b>, the extended portions of P-Ohmic metal layer <b>154</b>, and the extended portions of implant isolation layer <b>152</b>. While oxidation trenches <b>162</b> are shown as being formed in a partial ring-shape, in some implementations, oxidation trenches may be formed in another shape, such as the irregular polygon shape of oxidation trenches <b>112</b>. As shown, an overall width of compact emitter <b>150</b>, from an outer edge of an oxidation trench <b>162</b> to an outer edge of an oppositely positioned oxidation trench <b>162</b>, is a width D&#x2032;. In some implementations, the width D&#x2032; is less than 40 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) (i.e., the width D of emitter <b>100</b>). In some implementations, the width D&#x2032; is less than 35 &#x3bc;m. In some implementations, the width D&#x2032; is approximately 32.4 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By allowing spaces between oxidation trenches <b>162</b> to be utilized, the split architecture of compact emitter <b>150</b> may result in a reduction in overall size (e.g., as compared to emitter <b>100</b>). For example, the overall width of compact emitter <b>150</b> may be 7.6 &#x3bc;m smaller (e.g., 40.0 &#x3bc;m&#x2212;32.4 &#x3bc;m=7.6 &#x3bc;m), or approximately 20% smaller, than the overall width of emitter <b>100</b> (e.g., [(40.0 &#x3bc;m&#x2212;32.4 &#x3bc;m)/40 &#x3bc;m]&#xd7;100%=19%). This increases emitter density when used in a non-grid VCSEL array, thereby reducing a size and/or a cost of an IC on which the non-grid VCSEL array is constructed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Notably, alignment tolerances and/or minimum widths of the emitter layers may not be altered with compact emitter <b>150</b>, which may minimize or eliminate any impact to manufacturing and/or design considerations. For example, a spacing between an outer edge of dielectric via opening <b>156</b> and an outer edge of P-Ohmic metal layer <b>154</b> (e.g., on a particular &#x201c;tooth&#x201d;) may be the same as (or more than) a minimum width of one or more corresponding layers of emitter <b>100</b>. As another example, a size of oxidation aperture <b>160</b> of compact emitter <b>150</b> may match a size of oxidation aperture <b>110</b> of emitter <b>100</b>. This may allow performance characteristics (e.g., power, wavelength, emission profile, reliability) of compact emitter <b>150</b> to match performance characteristics of an equivalent emitter of prior emitter design <b>100</b>, while reducing a size of compact emitter <b>150</b> (e.g., as compared to emitter <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The number and arrangement of layers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> are provided as an example.
