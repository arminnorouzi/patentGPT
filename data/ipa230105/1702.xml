The liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b> includes a conveyance unit <b>1</b> configured to convey a print medium <b>2</b> and a linear liquid ejection head <b>3</b> arranged substantially orthogonal to a conveyance direction of the print medium <b>2</b>, and is a linear printing apparatus which performs continuous printing while conveying a plurality of print media <b>2</b> continuously or intermittently. The print medium <b>2</b> is not limited to cut paper, but may be continuous roll paper. The liquid ejection head <b>3</b> is capable of full-color printing with CMYK inks (cyan: C, magenta: M, yellow: Y, black: K). As will be described later, a liquid supply means, a main tank, and a buffer tank (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to be described later), which are supply paths for supplying the liquid to the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>, are fluidly connected. Further, an electric control unit configured to transmit power and an ejection control signal to the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> is electrically connected to the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>. A liquid path and an electric signal path in the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> will be described later.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a first circulation path which is one form of a circulation path applied to the liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b> of the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, a description will be given of the liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b> in which a liquid such as ink is circulated between a buffer tank <b>1003</b> and the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>, but the apparatus may be in another form. For example, two tanks may be provided on an upstream side and downstream side of the liquid ejection head without circulating a liquid such as ink to flow the ink from one tank to the other tank, so that the ink in a pressure chamber is flowed. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows only a path through which ink of one color of the CMYK inks flows in order to simplify a description.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b>, the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>, a first circulation pump <b>1002</b>, and the buffer tank <b>1003</b> are fluidly connected. A liquid ejection unit (liquid supply member) <b>300</b> is provided with a common supply path <b>211</b>, a common collecting flow path <b>212</b>, and an individual supply flow path <b>213</b><i>a </i>and an individual collecting flow path <b>213</b><i>b </i>in communication with respective print element substrates. The individual supply flow path <b>213</b><i>a </i>is in communication with the common supply path <b>211</b>, and the individual collecting flow path <b>213</b><i>b </i>is in communication with the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>. Thus, a portion of a liquid flowed with the first circulation pump <b>1002</b> flows from the common supply flow path <b>211</b> through an inner flow path of the print element substrate <b>10</b> to the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>. This is because a pressure difference is provided between a pressure adjusting mechanism H connected to the common supply flow path <b>211</b> and a pressure adjusting mechanism L connected to the common collecting flow path <b>212</b> and the first circulation pump <b>1002</b> is connected only to the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this way, in the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b>, the flow of the liquid passing through the common collecting flow path <b>212</b> and a flow from the common supply flow path <b>211</b> through each print element substrate <b>10</b> into the common collecting flow path <b>212</b> occur. Thus, heat generated in each print element substrate <b>10</b> can be discharged to the outside of the print element substrate <b>10</b> by the flow from the common supply flow path <b>211</b> to the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>. Further, such a configuration can cause an ink flow even in an ejection port or a pressure chamber where printing is not performed while printing is performed by the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>, so that an increase in viscosity of the ink can be suppressed at that portion. Additionally, the thickened ink and foreign matter in the ink can be discharged to the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>. Therefore, the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> of the present embodiment enables high-speed and high-quality printing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are perspective views showing the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> in the present embodiment. The liquid ejection head <b>3</b> is a linear liquid ejection head in which 15 print element substrates <b>10</b>, each of which can eject inks of a plurality of colors alone, are arranged on a straight line in an arranging direction. The liquid ejection head <b>3</b> includes each print element substrate <b>10</b>, a signal input terminal <b>91</b> and a power supply terminal <b>92</b> electrically connected via a flexible wiring board <b>40</b> and an electric wiring board <b>90</b>. The signal input terminal <b>91</b> and the power supply terminal <b>92</b> are electrically connected to the control unit of the liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b> and supply the print element substrate <b>10</b> with power required for an ejection drive signal and ejection, respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A plurality of print elements are mounted on the print element substrate <b>10</b>. Each of the print elements is an element that generates energy for ejecting a liquid. In the present embodiment, a heating element that generates heat is employed as a print element, and a thermal method of causing a heating element to generate bubbles in a liquid to eject the liquid is employed. However, the print element is not limited to this, and the present invention can also be applied to liquid ejection heads in which a piezoelectric method and various other liquid ejection methods are employed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Integrating wires with an electric circuit in the electric wiring board <b>90</b> can reduce the number of signal output terminals <b>91</b> and power supply terminals <b>92</b> to less than the number of print element substrates <b>10</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the liquid connection portion <b>111</b> provided on one side of the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> is connected to the liquid supply system of the liquid ejection apparatus <b>1000</b>.

The liquid supply unit <b>220</b> is supplied with a liquid from the buffer tank <b>1003</b>, and the liquid that has passed through the filter <b>221</b> in the liquid supply unit <b>220</b> is supplied to negative pressure control units <b>230</b> arranged on the supply unit <b>220</b> corresponding to respective colors.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The negative pressure control units <b>230</b> are units including a pressure adjustment valve for each color, and a valve, a spring member, and the like are provided inside each of the units.

As a result, a negative pressure change on the downstream side (liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> side) from the negative pressure control unit <b>230</b> can be stabilized within a certain range. Two pressure adjustment valves for each color are built in the negative pressure control unit <b>230</b> of each color (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The two pressure adjustment valves are set to different control pressures. Via the liquid supply unit <b>220</b>, a high pressure side pressure adjustment valve is in communication with the common supply flow path <b>211</b> in the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> and a low pressure side pressure adjustment valve is in communication with the common collecting flow path <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The housing <b>80</b> includes a liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> and an electric wiring board support portion <b>82</b>, supports the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> and the electric wiring board <b>90</b>, and secures the rigidity of the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>.

A frame portion around the opening <b>131</b> has the function of capping the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> during print standby as a contact surface of a cap member. Therefore, it is preferable that closed space be formed while the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> is capped by applying an adhesive, a sealing material, a filler, or the like along the periphery of the opening <b>131</b> to fill unevenness and a gap on an ejection port surface of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> supported by the liquid ejection unit support portion (support member) <b>81</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along VI-VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The flow path member (joint member) <b>210</b> is made by laminating a first flow path member <b>50</b> and a second flow path member <b>60</b>, distributes the liquid supplied from the liquid supply unit <b>220</b> to each ejection module <b>200</b>, and returns the liquid recirculated from the ejection module to the liquid supply unit <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the liquid ejection head <b>3</b>, a long flow path forming member is laminated to supply ink to each of the plurality of ejection ports for ejecting a liquid, thereby forming a hollow flow path, and the ejection module is arranged on the flow path forming member. As a method of forming the above-described hollow liquid supply path, a method in which a plurality of components are separately molded and then assembled by ultrasonic welding, adhesion with an adhesive, or the like to form a liquid supply path is commonly known. In the present embodiment, a plurality of flow paths <b>51</b> include the box-shaped flow path member <b>50</b> joining the ejection modules <b>200</b> and the plate-shaped flow path member <b>60</b> that serves as a lid for the box-shaped flow path member <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flow path member <b>210</b> in the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> of the present embodiment is molded into the state of being warped due to a shrinkage difference during molding. That is, the flow path member <b>210</b> is formed into a state where the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is warped. The direction of the warpage is a direction such that the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is convex in an arrow X direction and is molded into the state of being warped convexly in a predetermined amount in the arrow X direction. The liquid ejection head <b>3</b> repeatedly ejects a liquid, so that the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is warped due to the heat of the heating element. The warpage in this case is warpage convex in the arrow &#x2212;X direction. Then, the liquid ejection head <b>3</b> of the present embodiment includes a liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> warped convexly in the arrow X direction at room temperature, and the warpage at room temperature is offset by the warpage of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> convex in the arrow &#x2212;X direction during liquid ejection. In this way, performing printing in the state of suppressing the warpage of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> implements a liquid ejection apparatus capable of printing of high print quality. The method will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The box-shaped flow path member <b>50</b> forms a shape warped convexly in the arrow X direction in a center portion in an arrow Y direction due to a shrinkage difference during injection molding by adjusting a balance among the wall thickness t<b>1</b> of the joint surface of the ejection module <b>200</b>, the wall thickness t<b>2</b> of the side wall in contact with the joint surface, and the wall thickness t<b>3</b> of a wall between respective flow paths. In the present embodiment, the warpage of the flow path member <b>50</b> as a single member is generated due to a shrinkage difference between the joint surface and the side wall of the print element substrate <b>10</b> during injection molding. Thus, setting the wall thickness of each wall of the flow path member <b>50</b> makes it possible to stably form a flow path member that warps convexly in the arrow X direction. Further, the plate-shaped flow path member <b>60</b> has a wall thickness t<b>4</b> and can be warped by, for example, making a temperature difference between molds on a front surface and a back surface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The two molded in this way can be joined to obtain a desired warpage amount C. One example of a warpage amount during printing is that in a case where ink whose temperature has been adjusted to 20&#xb0; C. is supplied to the flow path member <b>50</b> and circulated and heat generated from the ejection modules <b>200</b> is at 40&#xb0; C., the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> generates warpage which is about 50 &#x3bc;m convex in the arrow &#x2212;X direction in the center portion in the arrow Y direction. Thus, for injection molding, also in consideration of a joint between the flow path member <b>50</b> and the flow path member <b>60</b>, after the joint, the wall thicknesses t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, t<b>4</b> are balanced such that the center portion of the ejection module <b>20</b> in the arrow Y direction is warped convexly by about 50 &#x3bc;m with respect to the arrow X direction to set molding conditions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specifically, the flow path member <b>50</b> has a length of 400 mm, a wall thickness t<b>1</b> of 2.5 mm, a wall thickness t<b>2</b> of 2.5 mm, and a wall thickness t<b>3</b> of 2 mm, and the center portion in the arrow Y direction is warped convexly by 0.2 mm in the arrow X direction by injection molding. Additionally, the flow path member <b>60</b> has a wall thickness t<b>4</b> of 3 mm, and the center portion in the arrow Y direction is warped convexly by 0.1 mm in the arrow &#x2212;X direction by injection molding. Thus, the flow path member <b>50</b> and the flow path member <b>60</b> molded by being warped in opposite directions are adhered and fixed in a flatly straightened state, and finally the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> in which the center portion of the ejection module <b>20</b> is warped convexly by about 50 &#x3bc;m in the arrow X direction is formed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present embodiment, it has been described that the flow path member <b>50</b> and the flow path member <b>60</b> have warpage in opposite directions, but the direction of the warpage is not limited to them. That is, it is only required that, by being joined to each other, the flow path member <b>50</b> and the flow path member <b>60</b> be warped in a direction that offsets the warpage of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> due to a temperature rise caused by ejection.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is provided with hole portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>at four corners of the flow path member <b>60</b>. At the four corners, a fixing member <b>62</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> at a predetermined height h<b>1</b>, and a biasing member <b>63</b><i>a </i>biases the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b>. Therefore, at the four corners of the flow path member <b>60</b>, the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> and the flow path member <b>60</b> are separated from each other. The predetermined height h<b>1</b> is, for example, 50 &#x3bc;m in a case where the assumed value of the warpage amount is 50 &#x3bc;m, that is, just about a sum of the thickness of the basing member <b>63</b><i>a </i>in a shrunk state and the thickness of the flow path member <b>60</b>. Further, a biasing force of the biasing member <b>63</b><i>a </i>is only enough to eliminate a rattle between a hole portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the head of the fixing member <b>62</b><i>a </i>and is not a force enough to correct the warpage of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixing member <b>62</b><i>a </i>set to a predetermined height and the biasing member <b>63</b><i>a </i>can absorb variations in the warpage amount of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> and keep them within a desired range.

That is, in the center portion, the flow path member <b>60</b> is fixed to be inseparable from the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> supported by the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> during printing. The liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> warps convexly in the arrow &#x2212;X direction due to a temperature rise during printing. However, since the center portion of the liquid ejection unit in the arrow Y direction is fixed to the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> by the fixing member <b>62</b><i>b</i>, both end portions of the liquid ejection unit are formed along the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> and the biasing member <b>63</b><i>a </i>extends to eliminate the rattle with the head of the fixing member <b>62</b><i>a</i>. Since the warpage amount of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> at room temperature is set to be the same as a warpage amount generated by the temperature rise during printing, the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is substantially parallel to the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> during printing and the ejection surface is almost flat. In the present invention, the center portion of the liquid ejection unit refers to an area located in the center in a case where the liquid ejection unit is divided into three equal parts in the arrow Y direction. Additionally, in the present invention, both end portions of the liquid ejection unit refer to areas located at both ends in a case where the liquid ejection unit is divided into three equal parts in the arrow Y direction.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the method of the present embodiment, since the temperature rise relating to printing reduces the warpage generated due to the shrinkage difference during molding, the warpage can be restored in a natural manner. As the ejection surface becomes flat, an ink ejection direction becomes orthogonal to a print medium, and a distance from the print medium also becomes uniform, so that high-quality printing can be performed. In a case where the position reference of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is in the center portion, a position change is small and this form is specifically effective.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the example has been described in which in a case where the temperature rise due to the ejection makes the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> convex in the liquid ejection direction, the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is formed by being warped in a direction opposite to the liquid ejection direction, but the present invention is not limited to this. That is, it is only required that the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> have warpage that offsets the warpage of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> due to the temperature rise caused by the ejection.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this way, both end portions in the arranging direction of the print element substrate of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> having warpage convex in a predetermined direction are fixed to the liquid ejection unit support portion <b>81</b> with the fixing member and the biasing member which is combined with the fixing member and can bias an object to be fixed by the fixing object.

At that time, in the case of being fixed with no gap by the fixing member <b>62</b><i>b </i>in the center portion of the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> in the arrow Y direction as in the first embodiment, the liquid ejection unit <b>300</b> is warped convexly in the arrow &#x2212;X direction between the fixing member <b>62</b><i>a </i>and the fixing member <b>62</b><i>b</i>.
