Moreover, a slurry composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode that is produced using the presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode can suitably be used in formation of an electrode of a non-aqueous secondary battery such as a lithium ion secondary battery. Furthermore, a feature of the presently disclosed non-aqueous secondary battery is that the presently disclosed electrode for a non-aqueous secondary battery is used therein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">Note that the presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode and slurry composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode can suitably be used, in particular, in formation of a positive electrode of a non-aqueous secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">(Binder Composition for Secondary Battery Electrode)</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">The presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode is a binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode that contains a polymer &#x3b1; and a polymer as a binder component and that also contains a plasticizer and an organic solvent. Features thereof are that the polymer &#x3b1; is an insoluble polymer that includes a (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer unit and an ethylenically unsaturated acid monomer unit and that the polymer &#x3b2; is a highly soluble polymer that includes a nitrile group-containing monomer unit and either or both of an amide group-containing monomer unit and a (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer unit having an alkyl chain carbon number of not less than 1 and not more than 6, wherein the proportional content of the nitrile group-containing monomer unit is not less than 70 mass % and not more than 95 mass % and the total proportional content of the amide group-containing monomer unit and the (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer unit is not less than 0.1 mass % and not more than 20 mass % when all monomer units forming the polymer &#x3b2; are taken to be 100 mass %, in total. The presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode preferably further contains, as the binder component, a polymer &#x3b3; that is a polymer having specific properties, in addition to the polymers &#x3b1; and &#x3b2;. Moreover, the presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode may contain other binder components that differ in terms of contained components to the binder component described above. Polymers that can correspond to the polymers &#x3b1; to &#x3b3; are not included among such other binder components.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">The presently disclosed binder composition for a non-aqueous secondary battery electrode (hereinafter, also referred to simply as a &#x201c;binder composition&#x201d;) enables the formation of an electrode having excellent flexibility and uniformity and the enhancement of rate characteristics and cycle characteristics of a secondary battery including the obtained electrode as a result of containing a plasticizer and the polymers &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; that satisfy the chemical composition and property conditions set forth above. Although the reason for this is not clear, it is presumed to be as follows.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">Firstly, the polymer &#x3b1;, which is a polymer that is insoluble in an organic solvent (i.e., is present in a particulate form in an organic solvent and a formed electrode), can function to maintain the flexibility of an electrode and to effectively adhere adherend components to one another by causing point adhesion of adherend components such as an electrode active material in an electrode mixed material layer. Accordingly, the polymer &#x3b1; can contribute to increasing the flexibility of a formed electrode mixed material layer. Moreover, the polymer &#x3b2; contributes to imparting appropriate viscosity to a slurry composition in a situation in which a slurry composition is produced. Accordingly, the polymer &#x3b2; contributes to increasing the uniformity and peel strength of an electrode obtained using that slurry composition and can also act to relieve concentration of stress and resistance in the electrode and to ultimately enhance the rate characteristics and cycle characteristics of an obtained secondary battery. Furthermore, the plasticizer can function to increase the flexibility of an obtained electrode and to thereby enhance the rate characteristics and cycle characteristics of a secondary battery. This is thought to be due to the plasticizer acting to lower the crystallinity and glass-transition temperature of the polymer &#x3b1; and the polymer &#x3b2;. When a plasticizer has been combined with a conventional binder component such as polyvinylidene fluoride instead of the polymer &#x3b2;, there have been instances in which degradation of an active material has occurred and in which battery characteristics such as cycle characteristics and rate characteristics have deteriorated. However, in a situation in which a plasticizer is used in combination with the polymers &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; that satisfy specific chemical compositions and properties in the present disclosure, it is possible to obtain an electrode that has high flexibility and uniformity and to effectively enhance battery characteristics such as rate characteristics and cycle characteristics.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">&#x3c;Polymer &#x3b1;&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">The polymer &#x3b1; is a component that, in an electrode produced by forming an electrode mixed material layer on a current collector using a slurry composition that contains the binder composition, holds components contained in the electrode mixed material layer so that they do not detach from the electrode mixed material layer (i.e., functions as a binder). The polymer &#x3b1; is an insoluble polymer that is insoluble in an organic solvent and is a particulate polymer that is present in a particulate form in an organic solvent and a formed electrode. It is possible to confirm that the polymer &#x3b1; is insoluble in an organic solvent and has a &#x201c;particulate form&#x201d; in an electrode by methods described in the EXAMPLES section. When the polymer &#x3b1; is referred to as being &#x201c;insoluble&#x201d; in an organic solvent, this means that when dry polymer &#x3b1; is left for 72 hours in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone having a temperature of 60&#xb0; C. and is then filtered at 200 mesh, the dry mass of insoluble content that is obtained is 70 mass % or more relative to the total mass of the dry polymer &#x3b1; that is used. The polymer &#x3b1; is a component that can display adhesive capability through point adhesion of an adherend in an electrode. Consequently, the polymer &#x3b1; can display adhesive capability in an electrode while also increasing the flexibility of the electrode.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">[Chemical Composition of Polymer &#x3b1;]</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">The polymer &#x3b1; is required to include a (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer unit and an ethylenically unsaturated acid monomer unit as repeating units.
