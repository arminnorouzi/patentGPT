More specifically, the present invention relates to a rebounding device to be used against a stationary surface for generating a rebounding motion.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rocking is a familiar part of everyday human life. Numerous proven benefits of rocking have been established for centuries, while new motivations and added reasons for rocking are being discovered regularly. One of the most well-known uses for rocking is to calm a baby. The gentle bouncing motion mimics the movement the baby felt inside the mother's womb and can soothe infants, aid in lulling children to sleep or while nursing, and reduce crying in colic episodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rocking for personal benefit is a safe activity and option for those that live an otherwise sedentary lifestyle or for people with limited physical motion, including many aging adults, individuals suffering with injuries or chronic ailments, or those seated for long periods of time in a chair or at a desk. The act of rocking has proven benefits such as the easing of arthritis and back pain, improved muscle tone, improved balance, and increased circulation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Studies have revealed that rocking causes an increase in psychological well-being for those suffering from dementia, anxiety, and depression due to released endorphins that elevate the mood. Additional studies suggest benefits of rocking can provide comfort and add to the positive treatment of anxiety, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism. NASA has reported that rocking was the most effective procedure to combat Autonomic Nervous System Disorders for astronauts returning to earth from low-earth orbit. Rocking may also be a low-energy movement to increase blood flow for those experiencing physical restrictions, such as elderly and handicapped people. Health experts recommend some form of motion to increase circulation and muscle movement when sitting for long periods in office chairs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, prolonged rocking in a seated position cannot be performed comfortably without an external device such as a rocking chair to assist in repeating the motion for even a short period of time, let alone hours on end. A continuous rocking motion for long durations without assistance also creates significant strain on muscles and joints. Existing solutions are extremely limited in their embodiments, versatility, and flexibility of use. The operating conditions and other utility requirements often prohibit users from being able to use existing apparatuses when and where rocking assistance is needed most. The use of conventional rocking furniture is limiting in that it cannot easily be moved from room to room or accompany the user during travel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, conventional rocking solutions require a large amount of floor space and are therefore not suitable for use in small rooms and can be difficult to store when not in use. While some hospitals and nurseries equip parents, staff, and caregivers with rockers or gliders, providing a rocker or glider in each room is expensive, which becomes problematic for facilities operating with a limited budget. Smaller options for rocking infants include bassinets, bouncers, or cradles, but in these options the infant is separated from the caregiver, limiting the ability to simultaneously hold, nurse, or easily feed the infant while rocking.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, conventional rocking solutions cannot be combined with other existing furniture such as a sofa or bed, thus preventing users from utilizing such furniture when needing to hold and nurse or calm an infant with rocking. Many mothers prefer to nurse while sitting in an upright position in bed, especially at night, but must choose between the comfort of a bed and the functionality of a rocking device because nothing exists to allow both simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need for a portable, compressible rebounding device that may be used against a stationary surface for generating a rocking motion while in a seated position, as described herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To meet the needs described above and others, the present disclosure provides a rebounding device that includes a spring mechanism between a front member and a rear member. During use, the user positions the rear member of the rebounding device against a stationary object such as a chair or a wall. The user rests his back against the front member and applies pressure to generate a gentle rocking motion. The rebounding device exerts a biasing force when compressed that gently propels the user's upper body forward while maintaining a seated position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the rebounding device includes a front member, a rear member, and a spring mechanism positioned between the front and rear members. The spring mechanism includes first and second elongate spring elements, each spring element including front and rear planar surfaces integral with a rounded portion. Each spring element operates as a leaf spring with the front and rear planar surfaces moving toward and away from one another about the rounded portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each of the front planar surfaces of each spring element is twisted inwardly toward the rear planar surfaces so as create a curvature for receiving the user's back. The front member is secured to the front planar surfaces of the spring elements and includes a curvature that complements the curvature of the front planar surfaces. The rear member is secured to the rear planar surfaces of the spring element. During use, the user's back rests comfortably against the curved front member and the angled front planar surfaces while the rear member and the rear planar portions rest against the stationary surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the front and rear members include a front and rear flexible material extending between the pairs of front and rear planar surfaces, respectively, of the first and second spring elements. The front and rear flexible materials are tightly stretched between the front and rear pairs of the front planar portions and the rear planar portions, respectively, of the first and second members so that pressure applied to the material causes the front planar portions to move toward the respective rear planar portions. A foam padding or other thick material may be secured to each of the front and rear members and/or flexible material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further embodiment, a rebounding device includes a housing having front and rear members containing a spring mechanism. The housing is comprised of a foam material that allows for compression. During use, the user positions the rebounding device between his back, preferably the middle to lower portions of the back, and a supporting surface such as a headboard, an airplane seat, or a wall. The rebounding device exerts a biasing force when compressed that propels the user's upper body forward while maintaining a seated position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Specifically, each of the front and rear members of the housing includes a planar surface surrounded by a wall that has a greater thickness at a base and narrows near the planar surface, creating an outer side surface. The bases of the front and rear members are adjoined together by fastening means. A spring mechanism positioned between the front and rear members includes spring elements that bias against the planar surfaces of the front and rear members. The spring mechanism may be any elastic object(s) storing mechanical energy that creates an opposing force when compressed, such as a plurality of helical springs. The internal distributed structuring of the springs provides an even spring sensation for the user without the need for a central spring. Other suitable spring mechanisms may be used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The housing may be comprised of a compressible material such as a ventilated foam, which also allows for breathability and minimizes the weight of the device. The rebounding device may also include a cover or casing that surrounds the housing.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rebounding device <b>100</b> includes a front member <b>102</b>, a rear member <b>104</b>, and a spring mechanism <b>106</b> positioned between the front and rear members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. During use, the rear member <b>104</b> rests against a solid surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>19</b></figref>. The user positions his back against the front member <b>102</b> and applies pressure to create a gentle, rocking motion. During use, the user positions the rebounding device <b>100</b> between his back and a supporting surface such as the headboard of a bed, the back of a sofa, an airplane seat, or a wall. The rebounding device <b>100</b> exerts a biasing force when compressed that propels the user's upper body forward while maintaining a seated position. The combination of the biasing force of the rebounding device <b>100</b> against the weight of the user generates a momentum that allows continued bouncing while rocking an infant or oneself for personal relaxation, activity, or comfort, while requiring little effort for hours on end.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustrated embodiment, the spring mechanism <b>106</b> includes first and second spring elements <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, each having an elongate shape including a length L and a width W, the length L being greater than the width W, and extending between a front end <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and a rear end <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Each elongate spring element <b>108</b> curves around an axis C<sub>L </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The axis C<sub>L </sub>is parallel to the width W of the respective spring element <b>108</b> and is spaced apart from a midpoint along the length L, separating the length L of the spring element <b>108</b> into a front planar surface <b>114</b> and a rear planar surface <b>116</b> by a rounded portion <b>118</b>. The front planar surfaces <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b </i>and the rear planar surfaces <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b </i>extend adjacent to but slightly angled away from each other when in a resting position. The rounded portion <b>118</b> functions as the spring leaf mechanism that enables the rebounding device <b>100</b> to provide a rebounding motion.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the front end <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>of each front planar surface <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b </i>is twisted relative to a juncture <b>120</b> at which the front planar surface <b>114</b> meets the rounded portion <b>118</b>. An inner edge <b>122</b> of the front end <b>110</b> is offset relative to an inner edge <b>124</b> at the juncture <b>120</b>, while the outer edge <b>126</b> of the front end <b>110</b> and the outer edge <b>128</b> of the juncture <b>120</b> are aligned, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Each inner edge of each front planar surface is twisted inwardly toward the respective rear planar surface to form a cradle for receiving the back of the user as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. Further, as seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>E, and <b>7</b>G</figref>, a rear end of the rear planar surface of the second spring element is offset from the front end of the front planar surface of the second spring element. In other words, the rear planar surfaces <b>116</b> are angled slightly inwardly towards one another as they extend outwardly from the rounded portion <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first and second spring elements <b>108</b> may be comprised of any material that provides sufficient elasticity to enable repeated rebounding motions while being sufficiently strong to structurally support a person's weight. Example metallic materials include aluminum, an aluminum alloy preferably but not necessarily having a T6 temper, such as 6061T6, steel, and a steel alloy such as AISI 5160.

The rear member <b>104</b> comprises a metallic material, such as aluminum. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the rear planar surfaces <b>116</b> of each spring member <b>108</b> are flat and co-planar relative to each other in order to apply an equal distribution of pressure onto the stationary surface. During use, the user's back rests comfortably against the front member <b>102</b> and angled front planar surfaces <b>114</b> while the rear planar surfaces <b>116</b> rest against the stationary surface.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, each elongate spring element <b>108</b> may have a width W that ranges between about 1.5 in. and about 2.5 in., although the width may vary as desired and may vary throughout the length L.

The user can then lean against the rebounding device <b>100</b>, creating the rocking motion without the need for a piece of furniture or other structural support.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The dimensions of the rebounding device <b>100</b> may be modified in order to tailor the device to a specific use. For example, the width of the first and second spring elements <b>108</b> of the rebounding device <b>100</b> may be wider than illustrated herein in order to accommodate for usage with a wheelchair or a hospital bed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, a further embodiment of a rebounding device <b>200</b> is provided. The rebounding device <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>202</b> having adjacent front and rear members <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> that contains a spring mechanism <b>208</b>. The housing <b>202</b> is made of an easily compressible material. During use, the user positions the rebounding device <b>200</b> between his back, preferably anywhere along the thoracic and lumbar regions of the back, and a supporting surface such as a wall.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the front member <b>204</b> of the housing <b>202</b> includes a planar front surface <b>210</b> surrounded by a front wall <b>212</b>. A thickness of the front wall <b>212</b> is wide at a front base <b>214</b> and is narrow adjacent to the planar surface <b>210</b>, forming a sloped outer surface <b>216</b>. Similarly, the rear member <b>206</b> includes a planar rear surface <b>218</b> surrounded by a rear wall <b>220</b> having a greater thickness at a rear base <b>222</b> than near the planar rear surface, forming a sloped outer surface <b>223</b>, <b>218</b>. Each of the front and rear wall may include material having an accordion-like shape that allows for each compression. While both of the planar surfaces <b>210</b>, <b>218</b> and the surrounding walls <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> are comprised of a compressible material, the density of the planar surfaces <b>210</b>, <b>218</b> is greater than the density of the surrounding walls <b>212</b>, <b>220</b>. During use, the front and rear bases <b>214</b>, <b>222</b> of the front and rear members <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are adjoined together by a bonding means such as fusion, a solvent, welding, or any suitable process for bonding.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In some embodiments, the housing <b>202</b> may be comprised of a compressible material such as a foam or a rubber such as natural latex, which also allows for breathability and minimizes the weight of the device. Other materials that may be used include soft plastics or a polyester material. The rebounding device <b>200</b> may also include a cover or casing (not shown) that surrounds the housing <b>202</b>. The cover may be a washable, upholstery material with or without a textured surface. Heating or cooling elements may be incorporated into the housing <b>202</b> and/or the cover.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">The spring mechanism <b>208</b> is positioned between the front and rear members <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the spring mechanism <b>208</b> comprises a first plurality <b>224</b> of helical spring elements and a second plurality <b>226</b> of helical spring elements secured to a base surface <b>228</b>. The pluralities <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> of helical spring elements bias against the planar front and rear surfaces <b>210</b>, <b>218</b>. The distributed structuring of the springs <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> provides an even spring sensation for the user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Any suitable spring mechanism <b>208</b> having any type, form, or shape of a spring may be used, such as a leaf spring mechanism <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The leaf spring mechanism <b>300</b> includes a central core <b>302</b> having a first plurality of leaf spring elements <b>304</b> extending from a first side <b>306</b> and a second plurality of leaf spring elements <b>308</b> extending from a second side <b>310</b>. Each leaf spring <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> includes a planar end <b>312</b> attached to a body <b>314</b> extending from the respective surface <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> at an angle. The planar end <b>312</b> of each leaf spring element <b>204</b>, <b>208</b> contacts the front or rear planar surface <b>210</b>, <b>218</b> of the front and rear members <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, respectively, during use.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">An alternative spring may include a Z-shape spring <b>400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The parallel sides <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> of the spring <b>400</b> contact the front or rear planar surface <b>210</b>, <b>218</b> of the front and rear members <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, respectively, during use. A base member <b>406</b> extending at an angle between the parallel sides <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> compresses to create the rebounding motion.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">As described above, the rebounding device <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> can be used in a variety of applications, from rocking an infant to sleep to the comfort and benefit for those with conditions such as dementia, anxiety, and autism.
