A well log is a detailed and sequential collection of one category of data (e.g., gamma ray, sonic, porosity, resistivity, density, etc.) for a geological formation by using a logging tool along the path of a well borehole in the ground. A well log may be collected by visual inspection of rock samples brought to the surface or on physical measurements made by a logging tool lowered into the borehole. However, well logs may be missing or poor in quality because of a failed or malfunctioned logging tool. Sometimes, operators may turn off recording equipment at the wrong time.

However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, embodiments of the disclosure relate to a system and a method for a physics-constrained machine learning (PCML) workflow to correct and predict sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest. The PCML workflow may be performed in two sections. In the first section, the PCML workflow may use well logs (e.g., gamma ray (GR), density (ZDEN), neutron porosity (NPHI), depth (measured depth (MD) or true vertical depth (TVD)) as input parameters to predict and correct sonic logs (e.g., compressional sonic travel time (DTC) and shear sonic travel time (DTS)). The PCML workflow uses the predicted sonic logs to determine valid rock mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (v)) based on rock physics equations. However, the predicted sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest may have non-physical values. For example, the predicted mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) have negative values that are not consistent with field measurements. As such, some embodiments address these problems by applying an objective function within a PCML algorithm which includes both a sonic log prediction error (e.g., mean square error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE)) and a physics constraint directed loss. For example, the physics constraint directed loss is defined in terms of the validity of the mechanical properties of interest.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some example embodiments, in the second section, the PCML workflow corrects the predicted sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest based on a breakout model. Breakouts are caused by the local shear failure around a borehole due to horizontal compression when the compressive stress at the borehole wall exceeds the rock strength (e.g., unconfined compressive strength (UCS)). The stress-induced wellbore breakouts are important indicators of the direction of horizontal principal stresses. A breakout model characterizes the correlation of breakout data (e.g., breakout angle, width, azimuth, and depth) with independent stress measurements and other mechanical properties. For example, breakout data characterize the variation in circumferential stress as a function of the breakout angle with respect to the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) with knowledge of mechanical properties (e.g., the least horizontal compressive stress (Shmin), the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax), UCS, pore pressure (Pp), transgressive surface (TS), cohesion, formation pore pressure, borehole fluid pressure, friction angle (FANG), etc.). Particularly, the breakout width which is twice the angle of breakout initiation with respect to the least horizontal compressive stress (Shmin) may be characterized by mechanical properties (e.g., UCS, Shmin, SHmax, formation pore pressure, borehole fluid pressure, etc.). The breakout azimuth which coincides with the direction of Shmin may be affected by the changes in mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio). The breakout depth is associated with mechanical properties (e.g., transgressive surface).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the PCML workflow calculates breakout data (e.g., breakout angle, width, azimuth, and depth) based on the predicted sonic logs and mechanical properties from the first section and other parameters obtained from the field (e.g., Shmin, SHmax, UCS, pore pressure (Pp), cohesion, formation pore pressure, borehole fluid pressure, etc.). The calculated breakout data is compared with field data (e.g., breakout angle, width, azimuth, and depth) to generate final predicted sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest which are essential to build accurate mechanical earth models frequently used to optimize mud weight during drilling. The final predicted sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest may complete missing segment and/or clean up poor quality sonic logs due to bad borehole conditions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a well environment (<b>100</b>) that may include a well (<b>102</b>) having a wellbore (<b>104</b>) extending into a formation (<b>106</b>). The wellbore (<b>104</b>) may include a bored hole that extends from the surface into a target zone of the formation (<b>106</b>), such as a reservoir. The formation (<b>106</b>) may include various formation characteristics of interest, such as gamma ray, neutron porosity, depth (measured depth or true vertical depth), caliper (CAL), spontaneous potential (SP), sonic, neuron (CNC), resistivity (e.g., shallow resistivity (LLS and ILD), medium resistivity (HRM), deep resistivity (HRD)), photo-electric absorption factor (PE), density (ZDEN), transgressive surface, cohesion, formation pore pressure, borehole fluid pressure, SHmax, Shmin, friction angle, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, formation UCS, formation porosity, formation permeability, rock type, unconstrained sonic velocity, stiffness, water saturation and the like. Gamma ray may indicate the rock and/or sediment for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Neutron porosity may indicate correct porosity assuming that the pores are filled with fresh water for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. True vertical depth may indicate the vertical depth from the surface down to a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Measured depth may indicate the total length of the wellbore measured along the actual well path to a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Caliper may indicate cave ins or shale swelling within a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Spontaneous potential may indicate small electric potentials between depths within the borehole for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest and a grounded electrode at the surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, sonic may indicate a formation's transit time which is a measure of how fast elastic seismic compressional and shear waves travel through a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Sonic logs provide a formation interval transit time, which is typically a function of lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity. Neuron indicates the amount of moisture or volatile matter for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Resistivity indicates how strongly rock and/or fluid within the formation (<b>106</b>) opposes the flow of electrical current which provide information about the porosity of a formation, water saturation, and the presence of hydrocarbons matter for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Photo-electric absorption factor indicates the rock matrix properties for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Density indicates the bulk density along the length of a borehole for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Transgressive surface is marine flooding surface that forms the first significant flooding surface in a sequence and it marks the onset of the period when the rate of creation of accommodation space is great than the rate of sediment supply. Cohesion indicates the inherent shear strength for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Formation pore pressure indicates the pressure of the fluid in the pore space of a rock for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Borehole fluid pressure indicates the pressure of the fluid in the borehole. SHmax indicates an independent normal stress with the maximum magnitude on the horizontal plane with no shear stress in which it is applied for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Shmin indicates an independent normal stress with the minimum magnitude on the horizontal plane with no shear stress in which it is applied for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Friction angle indicates the formation porosity and volume of a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, Young's modulus indicates the tensile stiffness of a solid material in the relationship between tensile stress (force per unit) and axial strain (proportional deformation) for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Poisson's ratio indicates the deformation (expansion or contraction) of a rock material in directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading. For example, Poisson's ratio may have an appropriate value between &#x201c;0.04&#x201d; and &#x201c;0.3&#x201d; for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. UCS indicates the maximum axial compressive stress that a particular rock sample for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest can bear under zero confining stress. Porosity indicates how much space exists in a particular rock within an area of interest in the formation (<b>106</b>), where oil, gas, and/or water may be trapped. Unconstrained sonic velocity indicates the compressional velocity (Vp) and shear velocity (Vs) for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Stiffness indicates the elasticity for a formation (<b>106</b>) within the area of interest. Permeability indicates the ability of liquids and gases to flow through the rock within the area of interest. Water saturation indicates the fraction of water in a given pore space.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the well environment (<b>100</b>) includes a drilling system (<b>110</b>), a logging system (<b>112</b>), a control system (<b>114</b>), and an artificial intelligence (AI) module (<b>160</b>). The drilling system (<b>110</b>) includes at least a drill string, a drill bit, a mud circulation system and/or the like for use in boring the wellbore (<b>104</b>) into the formation (<b>106</b>). The control system (<b>114</b>) may include hardware and/or software for managing drilling operations and/or maintenance operations. For example, the control system (<b>114</b>) may include one or more programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that include hardware and/or software with functionality to control one or more processes performed by the drilling system (<b>110</b>). Specifically, a PLC may control valve states, fluid levels, pipe pressures, warning alarms, drilling parameters (e.g., torque, WOB, SPP, RPM, etc.) and/or pressure releases throughout a drilling rig. In particular, a PLC may be a ruggedized computer system with functionality to withstand vibrations, extreme temperatures, wet conditions, and/or dusty conditions, for example, around a drilling rig.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Without loss of generality, the term &#x201c;control system&#x201d; may refer to a drilling operation control system that is used to operate and control the equipment, a drilling data acquisition and monitoring system that is used to acquire drilling process and equipment data and to monitor the operation of the drilling process, or a drilling interpretation software system that is used to analyze and understand drilling events and progress.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The logging system (<b>112</b>) may include one or more logging tools (<b>113</b>) (e.g., an impulse hammer geomechanical probe, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, a resistivity logging tool, an acoustic transducer, an acoustic borehole televiewer, etc.) for use in generating well logs (<b>166</b>), sonic logs (<b>168</b>), breakout data (<b>172</b>), core samples (<b>178</b>) and mechanical properties (<b>180</b>) of the formation (<b>106</b>). The logging tools (<b>113</b>) provide a powerful way to characterize the fine scale petrophysical properties (e.g., gamma ray, neutron porosity, depth, caliper, spontaneous potential, compressional sonic travel times, shear sonic travel times, neuron, shallow resistivity, medium resistivity, deep resistivity, photo-electric absorption factor, UCS, unconstrained sonic velocities, density, porosity, Young's modulus, stiffness, Poisson's ratio, etc.). For example, the impulse hammer logs measure the reduced Young's modulus by measuring the force-time response at the tip of a small instrumented sensor dropped on a core surface from a specified height and sampling interval. The measurement of reduced Young's modulus may be used to determine other elastic properties for a plurality of core samples (e.g., whole core, slabbed core, viewing slabs, and the ends of small plug samples). More specifically, the impulse hammer logs measure mechanical variations in two dimensions, and measure both elastic stiffness and hardness.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, as another example, an NMR logging tool may measure the induced magnetic moment of hydrogen nuclei (e.g., protons) contained within the fluid-filled pore space of porous media (e.g., reservoir rocks). Thus, NMR logs may measure the magnetic response of fluids present in the pore spaces of the reservoir rocks. In so doing, NMR logs may measure both porosity and permeability, as well as the types of fluids present in the pore spaces. Thus, NMR logging may be a subcategory of electromagnetic logging that responds to the presence of hydrogen protons rather than a rock matrix. Because hydrogen protons may occur primarily in pore fluids, NMR logging may directly or indirectly measure the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of pore fluids. As another example, an acoustic transducer may measure an acoustic impulse signal periodically generated by a transmitter and picked up by a receiver mounted on a support for movement through the length of the well bore. The transmitter and receiver are spaced apart by a fixed distance and as the support is moved through the well bore. The amplitudes of the received signals are correlated with the depth in the well bore to provide a log indicating the qualities (e.g., acoustic velocity Vp and Vs) of the cement bonding to the bore over the length of the well. As another example, an acoustic borehole televiewer is an ultrasonic well-logging tool to detect stress-induced wellbore breakouts and measure angle, width, azimuth, and depth of stress-induced breakouts in the well. The televiewer is used to image a breakout in depth by scanning the borehole wall using a rotating acoustic transducer that emits a focused beam pulse at a very high rate when it rotates and moves vertically up the borehole.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, a logging tool (<b>113</b>) may be lowered into the wellbore (<b>104</b>) and/or in the laboratory to acquire measurements (e.g., well logs (<b>166</b>), sonic logs (<b>168</b>), breakout data (<b>172</b>)), core samples (<b>178</b>) and mechanical properties (<b>180</b>) as the tool traverses a depth interval (<b>130</b>) (e.g., a targeted reservoir section) of the wellbore (<b>104</b>). The plot of the logging measurements versus depth may be referred to as a &#x201c;log&#x201d; or &#x201c;well log&#x201d;. Well logs (<b>166</b>) may provide depth measurements of the well (<b>102</b>) that describe such reservoir characteristics as formation porosity, formation permeability, resistivity, density, water saturation, total organic content (TOC), volume of kerogen, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and the like. The resulting logging measurements may be stored and/or processed, for example, by the control system (<b>114</b>), to generate corresponding well logs (<b>166</b>) for the well (<b>102</b>). A well log may include, for example, a plot of a logging response time versus true vertical depth (TVD) across the depth interval (<b>130</b>) of the wellbore (<b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reservoir characteristics may be determined using a variety of different techniques. For example, certain reservoir characteristics can be determined via coring (e.g., physical extraction of rock samples) to produce core samples and/or logging operations (e.g., wireline logging, logging-while-drilling (LWD) and measurement-while-drilling (MWD)). Coring operations may include physically extracting a rock sample from a region of interest within the wellbore (<b>104</b>) for detailed laboratory analysis. For example, when drilling an oil or gas well, a coring bit may cut plugs (or &#x201c;cores&#x201d; or &#x201c;core samples&#x201d;) from the formation (<b>106</b>) and bring the plugs to the surface, and these core samples may be analyzed at the surface (e.g., in a lab) to determine various characteristics of the formation (<b>106</b>) at the location where the sample was obtained.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To determine porosity in the formation (<b>106</b>), various types of logging techniques may be used. For example, the logging system (<b>112</b>) may measure the speed that acoustic waves travel through rocks in the formation (<b>106</b>). This type of logging may generate borehole compensated (BHC) logs, which are also called sonic logs. In general, sound waves may travel faster through high-density shales than through lower-density sandstones. Likewise, density logging may also determine density measurements or porosity measurements by directly measuring the density of the rocks in the formation (<b>106</b>). Furthermore, neutron logging may determine porosity measurements by assuming that the reservoir pore spaces within the formation (<b>106</b>) are filled with either water or oil and then measuring the amount of hydrogen atoms (i.e., neutrons) in the pores. In some embodiments, gamma ray logging is used to measure naturally occurring gamma radiation to characterize rock or sediment regions within a wellbore. In particular, different types of rock may emit different amounts and different spectra of natural gamma radiation. For example, gamma ray logs may distinguish between shales and sandstones/carbonate rocks because radioactive potassium may be common to shales. Likewise, the cation exchange capacity of clay within shales also results in higher absorption of uranium and thorium further increasing the amount of gamma radiation produced by shales.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Keeping with the various types of logging techniques, resistivity logging may measure the electrical resistivity of rock or sediment in and around the wellbore (<b>104</b>). In particular, resistivity measurements may determine a type of fluid present in the formation (<b>106</b>) by measuring how effective these rocks are at conducting electricity. Because fresh water and oil are poor conductors of electricity, they have a high resistivity measurement. As such, resistivity measurements obtained via such logging can be used to determine corresponding reservoir water saturation (S<sub>w</sub>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, while electromagnetic waves propagate without losing energy in a vacuum, electromagnetic waves in porous reservoir rocks are attenuated and phase shifted during transmission through the rock medium. Porosity measurements from various logs (e.g., density log, neutron log, sonic log, or an NMR log) may estimate the total porosity in reservoir rocks. In contrast, a multi-frequency dielectric logging tool may determine a value of the water-filled porosity in the reservoir rock.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, geosteering may be used to position the drill bit or drill string of the drilling system (<b>110</b>) relative to a boundary between different subsurface layers (e.g., overlying, underlying, and lateral layers of a pay zone) during drilling operations. In particular, measuring rock properties during drilling may provide the drilling system (<b>110</b>) with the ability to steer the drill bit in the direction of desired hydrocarbon concentrations. As such, a geosteering system may use various sensors located inside or adjacent to the drilling string to determine different rock formations within a well path. In some geosteering systems, drilling tools may use resistivity or acoustic measurements to guide the drill bit during horizontal or lateral drilling.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the AI module (<b>160</b>) includes hardware and/or software with functionality to pre-process well logs (<b>166</b>), sonic logs (<b>168</b>) and the breakout data (<b>172</b>). For example, the pre-processing module (<b>174</b>) assesses well logs (<b>166</b>) and sonic logs (<b>168</b>) for missing or poor data due to bad borehole conditions. Particularly, the pre-processing module (<b>174</b>) calculates one or more mechanical properties (<b>180</b>) (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) using compressional and shear sonic travel times as input parameters based on a breakout model. The pre-processing module (<b>174</b>) calculates a breakout angle, width, azimuth, and depth using the predicted and real mechanical properties based on a breakout model.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the AI module may run on any suitable computing device which has processors and memory for storing AI data. Thus, the AI module (<b>160</b>) includes hardware and/or software (e.g., a processor, memory) with functionality to apply more or more machine learning (ML) algorithms (<b>162</b>) (e.g., a supervised ML algorithm, a DL algorithm) for generating one or more ML models (<b>170</b>) for use in assessing the well logs (<b>166</b>) to correct and predict sonic logs (<b>168</b>) in the formation (<b>106</b>) that has missing or poor sonic data due to bad borehole conditions for an existing well or a new well. For example, the AI module (<b>160</b>) may assess the well logs (e.g., gamma ray, density, neutron porosity, depth, etc.) and partition the well logs into a training data set, a validation data set and a testing data set stored in a databased (<b>176</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one or more embodiments, the AI module (<b>160</b>) is configured to train a ML model (<b>170</b>) using a ML algorithm (e.g., a supervised ML algorithm, a DL algorithm) based on the training data set to predict one or more mechanical properties (<b>180</b>) (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) based on the predicted sonic logs (<b>168</b>) and rock physics equations. Thus, different types of ML models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron layers, decision trees, inductive learning models, deductive learning models, supervised learning models, etc.) may be trained for various formations of interest. In some embodiments, the AI module (<b>160</b>) may generate augmented or synthetic data to produce a large amount of interpreted data for training a particular model.

As such, the control system (<b>114</b>) may generate one or more control signals for drilling equipment based on an updated well path design and/or a geological model. In some embodiments, the AI module (<b>160</b>) determines one or more formation top depths from seismic data and/or well log data. The AI module (<b>160</b>) may use these formation top depths to adjust the well path of the wellbore (<b>104</b>) accordingly.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of generating a model to determine one or more sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest based on multiple well logs in accordance with one or more embodiments. The following example is for explanatory purposes only and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a neural network model X (<b>251</b>) is trained using one or more PCML algorithms (<b>200</b>) for predicting sonic logs (e.g., DTC (<b>250</b>) and DTS (<b>255</b>)) and mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus (<b>260</b>) and Poisson's ratio (<b>265</b>)). The neural network model X (<b>251</b>) obtains multiple input well logs (e.g., depth (<b>205</b>), GR (<b>210</b>), ZDEN (<b>215</b>), NPHI (<b>220</b>), and other data (<b>225</b>)) to determine the predicted outputs represented by the output layer consisting of predicted sonic logs DTC (<b>250</b>) and DTS (<b>255</b>) and mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus (<b>260</b>) and Poisson's ratio (<b>265</b>)). However, other embodiments are contemplated that use other input variables, such as resistivity, porosity, spontaneous potential, caliper, NMR, spectral noise, mud, core scans, seismic data, core image data, data that has been preprocessed with a quality control operation, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the neural network model X (<b>251</b>) includes six hidden layers (i.e., hidden layer A (<b>281</b>), hidden layer B (<b>282</b>), hidden layer C (<b>283</b>), hidden layer D (<b>284</b>), hidden layer E (<b>285</b>), hidden layer F (<b>286</b>)), which may be a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer, a softmax layer, a regressor layer, a dropout layer, and/or various other hidden layer types. These hidden layers can be arranged in any order as long as they satisfy the input/output size criteria. Each layer comprises of a set number of image filters. The output of filters from each layer is stacked together in the third dimension. This filter response stack then serves as the input to the next layer(s).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, each hidden layer is a combination of a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a ReLU layer in a multilayer architecture. For example, each hidden layer (e.g., hidden layer A (<b>281</b>), hidden layer B (<b>282</b>), hidden layer C (<b>283</b>), hidden layer D (<b>284</b>), hidden layer E (<b>285</b>), hidden layer F (<b>286</b>)) has a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a ReLU layer. The hidden layer A (<b>281</b>) and the hidden layer B (<b>282</b>) may be down-sampling blocks to extract high-level features from the input data set. The hidden layer D (<b>284</b>) and the hidden layer E (<b>285</b>) may be up-sampling blocks to output the classified or predicted output data set. The hidden layer C (<b>283</b>) may perform residual stacking as bottleneck between down-sampling blocks (e.g., hidden layer A (<b>281</b>), hidden layer B (<b>282</b>)) and up-sampling blocks (e.g., hidden layer D (<b>284</b>), hidden layer E (<b>285</b>)). The hidden layer F (<b>286</b>) may include a softmax layer or a regressor layer to classify or predict a predetermined class or a value based on input attributes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, in a convolutional layer, the input data set is convolved with a set of learned filters, designed to highlight specific characteristics of the input data set. A pooling layer produces a scaled down version of the output. This is achieved by considering small neighborhood regions and applying the desired operation filter (e.g. min, max, mean, etc.) across the neighborhood. A ReLU layer enhances the nonlinear property of the network by introducing a non-saturating activation function. One example of such a function is to threshold out negative responses (set negative values to zero). A fully connected layer provides a high-level reasoning by connecting each node in the layer to all activation nodes in the previous layer. A softmax layer maps the inputs from the previous layer into a value between 0 and 1 which allows for interpreting the outputs as probabilities and selection of classified facie with highest probability. A dropout layer offers a regularization technique for reducing network over-fitting on the training data by dropping out individual nodes with a certain probability. A loss layer (utilized in training) defines the weight dependent cost function that needs to be optimized (bring cost down to zero) for improved accuracy.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, the PCML algorithms (<b>200</b>) includes an activation function in a ReLU layer (e.g., hidden layer F (<b>286</b>)) to calculate the sonic log prediction error (e.g., mean square error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE)) between the predicted sonic logs and a ground truth (e.g., field sonic logs). For example, the activation function is a scaled version of the leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) or a Swish activation function. The activation function is applied to the predicted Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in such a way that the loss is negligible when the values of the predicted Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio within the assumed physically meaningful range, and penalizes otherwise. In particular, the ground truth may include field sonic logs which are used to calibrate the predicted sonic logs during training to find the optimal model and model parameters. Thus, the model may be applied to predict sonic logs for a well of interest.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, a PCML algorithm (<b>200</b>) may use a simple data split technique to separate the input well logs (depth (<b>205</b>), GR (<b>210</b>), ZDEN (<b>215</b>), NPHI (<b>220</b>), and other data (<b>225</b>)) used for the training, validation, and testing of the PCML models. An example of the data split technique considers 70% of the obtained well logs for model training (e.g., tuning of the model parameters), 10% of the obtained well logs for validation (e.g., performance validation for each different set of model parameters), and 20% of the obtained well logs for testing the final trained model. However, the data split technique may result in the over-fitting problem of the PCML models with limited generalization capabilities. For example, the deployed model will underperform when predicting unseen samples.

The k-fold inner cross-validation and the k-fold outer cross-validation may have different values of the &#x201c;k&#x201d; parameter. In some example embodiments, the nested inner/outer cross-validation defines a plurality of PCML algorithms and their corresponding models in a grid and evaluates a performance metrics of interest (e.g., area under curve (AUC), accuracy, geometric mean, f1 score, mean absolute error, mean squared error, sensitivity, specificity, etc.) to find the optimal parameters of the PCML model.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show various configurations of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

The obtained well logs may include diverse properties of the formation. The PCML model may improve prediction accuracy by including a large number of well logs of various types as input parameters. For example, repeat well logs may help to quantify uncertainty in predictions for the PCML model. The obtained well logs are pre-processed to be handle missing data, input anomalies detection and standardization of well logs. For example, the obtained well logs are filtered and resampled to remove systematic errors and invalid values due to environment conditions or incorrectly calibrated or malfunctioning logging tools.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In Block <b>305</b>, a PCML model is determined by training the obtained multiple well logs in accordance with one or more embodiments. The PCML model is applied to predict one or more sonic logs and mechanical properties of interest (e.g., DTC, DTS, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio). Different PCML algorithms (e.g., an artificial neural network, a linear regression algorithm, a logistic regression algorithm, a support vector regression algorithm, a random forest algorithm, a boosted decision tree algorithm, a multi-layer perceptron algorithm, a convolutional neural network, etc.) may be applied to perform the classification problem.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, the learning objective function in the PCML algorithm incorporates a sonic log prediction error and a physics constraint directed loss (equation 1).

The physics constraint directed loss g(f(x;&#x3b8;) is defined in terms of the validity of the mechanical properties of interest. The sonic log prediction error may have a vector norm of p (e.g., L1 or L2). The physics constraint direct loss error may have a vector norm of q (e.g., L1 or L2). For example, the L1 norm is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the vector. The L2 norm is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared vector values.

For example, the learning objective function is negligible when the values of the predicted Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are within an appropriate physically meaningful range, and penalizes otherwise. As another example, a scaled version of the leaky rectified linear unit or the recent Swish activation function are both suitable for this purpose. This hidden layer may be a direct implementation of Poisson's ratio calculation (equation 3), or its surrogate via a network model (e.g., an ANN). For example, the physics constraint direct loss function penalizes the predicted Poisson's ratio as f((v&#x2212;0.04)/(0.3&#x2212;0.04)) outside an appropriate range (e.g., a range from 0.04 to 0.3) defined by a user.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0050">Furthermore, a PCML model may be validated with loss function defined as such can be readily applied to independent new input log data to predict sonic logs that are consistent to the physics constraints. In addition, the PCML model may produce the physics constraint loss as an additional quality measure. As another example, a nested k-fold cross-validation technique is used to train and tune the PCML model parameters. For example, the inner k-fold cross-validation is used to tune the PCML model parameters performed on the obtained multiple well logs. The outer k-fold cross-validation is used to validate the final performance of the PCML model on the obtained multiple well logs.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0051">In Block <b>315</b>, other mechanical properties and field breakout data are obtained for the well of interest in accordance with one or more embodiments.

For example, the breakout angle &#x3b8; of breakout initiation (e.g., half of breakout width) is calculated using formation UCS, pore pressure, SHmax, and Shmin based on a breakout model (equation 4). As another example, SHmax is defined by a user from previous experience or derived from other mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.). Particularly, a breakout model shows a correlation between breakout and fracture orientations in the wellbore. A decrease of Young's modulus and an increase of Poisson's ratio suggest a weak zone at a depth of interest which may be the result of increasing microcrack density in the fracture core where the breakout (e.g., breakout angle, width, azimuth, and depth) develops.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>S</mi>      <mi>Hmax</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>C</mi>         <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>+</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>&#x394;</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msub>          <mi>P</mi>          <mi>W</mi>         </msub>        </mrow>        <mo>+</mo>        <mrow>         <mn>2</mn>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msub>          <mi>P</mi>          <mi>p</mi>         </msub>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mn>2</mn>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>cos</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mn>2</mn>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>        </mrow>       </mrow>      </mfrac>      <mo>-</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>S</mi>        <mi>hmin</mi>       </msub>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mfrac>        <mrow>         <mn>1</mn>         <mo>+</mo>         <mrow>          <mn>2</mn>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mi>cos</mi>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mn>2</mn>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>         </mrow>        </mrow>        <mrow>         <mn>1</mn>         <mo>-</mo>         <mrow>          <mn>2</mn>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mi>cos</mi>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mn>2</mn>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>         </mrow>        </mrow>       </mfrac>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>4</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0060" num="0000">Where SHmax is the maximum horizontal compressive stress, Shmin is the least horizontal compressive stress.
