As mentioned, in this embodiment the user may authenticate using a username and a password. Once the user has been authenticated, the server <b>120</b> may obtain transfer records associated with the account of the user from the database. The transfer records identify value transfers such as transactions made by the user. Each transfer record includes a transfer amount, a transfer date and a transfer descriptor. The transfer descriptor may include a name of a merchant and may include a location such as for example a city or country identifying where the transaction was initiated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The server <b>120</b> may obtain all available transfer records associated with the account of the user or may only obtain transfer records for transactions made within the past six (6) months, one (1) year, two (2) years, five (5) years, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The transfer records are grouped based on predefined criteria (step <b>520</b>). In this embodiment, the predefined criteria may include a default setting. The default setting may be adjusted by the user.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this embodiment, the transfer records are grouped based on the date of the transaction. For example, transfer records may be grouped by day, week, month or year. In this embodiment, the predefined criteria groups the transfer records based on month. Put another way, transfer records reflecting value transfers made within the same month are grouped together. Other examples of predefined criteria may be based on a location identified by the transfer descriptor.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Within at least one group of transfer records, one or more representative transfer records are identified based at least on stored selection criteria (step <b>530</b>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, the stored selection criteria may be based on the transfer amount, the transfer descriptor, and/or the date of the transaction. For example, all transfer records within a group may be compared to one another, and the transfer record having the highest transfer amount may be selected as a representative transfer record for that group.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The stored selection criteria may identify one or more representative transfer records as being interesting and may identify the interesting transfer record as being the representative transfer record. An interesting transfer record may be a transfer record that the user is likely to find interesting. An interesting transfer record may be identified based on one or more of the transfer amount, the transfer descriptor and the date of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, all transfer records within a group may be compared to one another, and the transfer record that includes a transfer descriptor identifying an interesting merchant or location may be selected as a representative transfer record for that group. The interesting location or merchant may be a popular restaurant. To identify the interesting location or merchant, the server <b>120</b> may determine that transfer descriptor identifies a restaurant. To determine if the restaurant is a popular restaurant, the server <b>120</b> may send a request to the API requesting, for example, a number of images available for that restaurant. When the API responds with the number of images, the server <b>120</b> may determine that the restaurant is a popular restaurant when the number of images exceeds a threshold. When more than one transfer record within the group includes a transfer descriptor that identifies a restaurant, the server <b>120</b> may send a request to the API for each transfer record that includes a transfer descriptor that identifies a restaurant and may select the transfer record corresponding to the restaurant with the greatest number of images as being the representative transfer record for the group. Other examples of interesting locations or merchants include sporting venues, luxury shops, bars, nightclubs, tourist attractions, theme parks, etc.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The API may additionally or alternatively determine that a particular location or merchant is popular or interesting based on a number of social media interactions for an account of the particular location or merchant. For example, the API may view a social media account of the particular location or merchant and may obtain information indicating a number of followers or interactions made within the social media network for that particular location or merchant.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The server <b>120</b> may tag at least one of the transfer records with a tag based on a location or merchant identified by the transfer descriptor included in the at least one transfer record. For example, the server <b>120</b> may tag transfer records that include transfer descriptors identifying locations or merchants located outside of a home city, province, state or country of the user. In this example, the server <b>120</b> may determine the location of the user's home based on stored identity data associated with the account of the user. When one or more transfer records indicate locations or merchants located outside of, for example, the home country of the user, these transfer records may be tagged based on the location. For example, when a user is travelling abroad and one or more transfer records include transfer descriptions identifying transfers initiated at locations or merchants located in Paris, France, these transfer records may be tagged with &#x201c;Paris&#x201d; or &#x201c;Paris, France.&#x201d; The one or more transfer records tagged with &#x201c;Paris&#x201d; or &#x201c;Paris, France&#x201d; may be identified as the one or more representative transfer records for the group.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The server <b>120</b> may tag at least one of the transfer records with a tag based on a category of the merchant or location identified by the transfer descriptor. For example, where a transfer record identifies a merchant that is a grocery store, a tag such as &#x201c;Groceries&#x201d; or &#x201c;Grocery Store&#x201d; may be assigned to the transfer record. Other examples of tags include &#x201c;Coffee Shop&#x201d;, &#x201c;Restaurant&#x201d;, etc.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The server <b>120</b> may ignore some transfer records when identifying one or more representative transfer records for the group. For example, transfer records that include transfer descriptors identifying locations or merchants that may be associated with negative events may be ignored.

For example, on July 15 the user spent $250.00 at a grocery store and $225.00 on a website that relates to golf. On July 18, the user spent $450.00 at a car repair center. When selecting one or more representative transfer records for the group, the server <b>120</b> ignores the transfer record representing the transaction made at the grocery store and the transfer record made at the car repair center. As such, the representative transfer record is selected as the transfer record representing the transaction made at the website that relates to golf and the image <b>1820</b> associated with the representative transfer record is an image of a golf club.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Although in embodiments described above, selectable options are used to scroll through various groups and selectable options are used to select criteria of which to group transfer records by, alternative inputs may be used. For example, when transfer records are grouped by month (see for example transfer record summary interface <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the user may wish to group transfer records by week. To adjust the criteria, the user may perform a zoom-in gesture via touch input on the display screen of the computing device <b>110</b>. In response to the zoom-in gesture, the computing device <b>110</b> may send a signal to the server <b>120</b> indicating that the transfer records are to be grouped by week. Similarly, when transfer records are grouped by month (see for example transfer record summary interface <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the user may wish to group transfer records by year. To adjust the criteria, the user may perform a zoom-out gesture via touch input on the display screen of the computing device <b>110</b>. In response to the zoom-out gesture, the computing device <b>110</b> may send a signal to the server <b>120</b> indicating that the transfer records are to be grouped by year. Zoom-in and zoom-out gestures may switch or toggle between the various criteria. As mentioned, the various criteria may be daily (most specific), weekly, monthly, yearly (least specific). Each time a zoom-in gesture is identified, the transfer records may be sorted by the next-most specific criteria. Similarly, each time a zoom-out gesture is identified, the transfer records may be sorted by the next-least specific criteria.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Although transfer records are described as including a transfer descriptor that identifies a merchant or a location, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the transfer descriptor may additionally or alternatively include information regarding items purchased. For example, when transfer is initiated at a clothing store, the transfer descriptor may include a list of all items purchased at the clothing store. When the transfer record including the transfer descriptor that includes a list of all items purchased at the clothing store is identified as being the representative transfer record for the group, an image of one of the purchased items may be obtained via the API. For example, an image of a particular article of clothing that was purchase may be obtained via the API and set as the image associated with the representative transfer record.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one or more embodiments, the user may create their own group of transfer records.
