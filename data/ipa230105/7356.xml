For example, when a user browses a web page, or views online programming, the related art describes targeting recommendations to the user that relate to activities that the user has recently planned or purchased reservations for. However, these recommendations often have no nexus to the media through which the user is navigating, and thus may go ignored, or may be perceived as an annoyance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Systems and methods are provided herein for generating for display recommendations that are temporally relevant to activities of a user and are contextually relevant to a portion of a media asset that the user is consuming. For example, if the user has an itinerary indicating he will travel to Italy in a week, and the user is presently watching a movie scene taking place in Rome, Italy, the user may be provided a recommendation relating to Italy at that time because the movie scene has a nexus to the user's upcoming travel plans.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some aspects of the disclosure, a media guidance application may identify a first plurality of activities a user has planned, as well as a plurality of respective times for which each of the first plurality of activities was planned to be performed by the user. The media guidance application may identify this information by querying a non-media guidance application, such as an application dedicated to booking travel activities (e.g., Kayak, which is a service for booking car, hotel, and airline reservations).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, in order to identify the activities, the media guidance application may identify a plurality of non-media guidance applications that are associated with the user. For example, the user may use multiple applications that are dedicated to booking travel activities (for example, in addition to Kayak, the user may use an airline-specific application for booking a flight). The media guidance application may query each non-media guidance application of the plurality of non-media guidance applications for information relating to activities the user has planned, and may receive, in response to the querying, information about an activity of the activities the user has planned. The media guidance application may add the information to the first plurality of activities. Thus, the media guidance application may add the information from each non-media guidance application used by the user to schedule activities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may filter, from the first plurality of activities, a second plurality of activities (e.g., activities that are upcoming in the near future). The media guidance application may perform this filtering by determining which of the first plurality of activities has a corresponding respective time of the plurality of respective times that is within a threshold period of time of a present moment, and by adding each such activity to the second plurality of activities. For example, the media guidance application may determine which activities (e.g., travel plans) are coming up in the next day, week, and/or month.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the media guidance application, when performing the filtering operation, may determine the threshold period of time by querying a database. The media guidance application may then access respective information relating to each respective activity of the first plurality of activities, and, for each respective information corresponding to each respective activity of the first plurality of activities, may access information relating to a respective time at which the respective activity is planned to be performed by the user. Thus, the media guidance application may learn each time at which each activity is planned to be performed. The media guidance application may compare each respective time at which the respective activity is planned to be performed by the user to the threshold period of time, and, in response to determining that the respective time at which the respective activity is planned is within the threshold period of time, the media guidance application may add the respective activity to the second plurality of activities.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may, when querying the database for a threshold, query the database to determine a plurality of threshold periods of time, where each threshold period of time corresponds to a different type of activity. For example, if a user booked a trip to Rome, Italy for three months from now, that trip may be something the user is very excited about because it is a long-distance vacation. However, if the user planned to play tennis three months from now, that activity may not be so exciting because tennis is an activity that the user performs on an ongoing basis. Thus, different thresholds may apply to different types of activities (e.g., travel versus sports) when deciding whether to provide a recommendation relating to those activities). Thus, the media guidance application may, for each respective information corresponding to each respective activity of the first plurality of activities, access information relating to a respective type of activity of the respective activity, and, when comparing each respective time at which the respective activity is planned to be performed by the user to the threshold period of time comprises, the media guidance application may determine a respective type of activity of the respective activity, identify a respective threshold period of time of the plurality of threshold periods of time that corresponds to the respective type of activity of the respective activity, and compare the respective time at which the respective activity is planned to be performed by the user to the respective threshold period of time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify characteristics of each activity of the second plurality of activities. For example, if the user booked travel to Rome, Italy (which is in Europe), and plans to visit the Roman Colosseum (which is an ancient Roman ruin), and to go sky diving (which is an adventure sport), some characteristics of this activity may be: (1) Italy, (2) Rome, (3) Europe, (4) Colosseum, (5) Ruins, (6) Sky Diving, and (7) Adventure Sports.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similar to identifying the characteristics of the activities, the media guidance application may identify characteristics of a portion of a media asset that the user is consuming at the present moment, such as a present frame of a movie, or a present scene. For example, if a present frame of a movie depicts actor Robert De Niro sky diving, and occurs in Europe, some characteristics may be (1) Robert De Niro, (2) Sky Diving, and (3) Europe.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may compute, for each activity of the second plurality of activities, whether the respective characteristics of each respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset based on a comparison between the respective characteristics and the characteristics of the portion of the media asset. To perform this computation, the media guidance application may determine, for each respective activity, a respective amount of respective characteristics that match the characteristics of the portion of the media asset. The media guidance application may then compare each respective amount to a threshold, and may determine, based on comparing each respective amount to the threshold, that a respective characteristic has a respective amount that exceeds the threshold. In response to determining that the respective characteristic has a respective amount that exceeds the threshold, the media guidance application may determine that the respective characteristics for the respective activity to which the respective characteristics correspond are relevant to the portion of the media asset. Thus, activities with a sufficient number of characteristics that match characteristics of a portion of a media asset will be deemed relevant to the portion of the media asset.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, when comparing each respective amount to a threshold, the media guidance application may determine a plurality of thresholds, where each threshold of the plurality of thresholds corresponds to a respective activity of the second plurality of activities. The media guidance application may then compare each respective amount that corresponds to a respective activity to a threshold of the plurality of thresholds that corresponds to the respective activity. For example, a user profile may reflect that a user rarely travels to Italy, but often plays tennis. Thus, the threshold for providing recommendations for Italy when the user has a trip planned for Italy may be lower than a threshold for playing tennis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, in response to determining that the respective characteristics for a respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset, the media guidance application may generate for display a recommendation relating to the respective activity. For example, when generating for display the recommendation, the media guidance application may determine which characteristics of the respective characteristics for the respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset, and may access a plurality of candidate recommendations. The media guidance application may then compare the characteristics of the respective activity that are relevant to the portion of the media asset to characteristics corresponding to each candidate recommendation of the plurality of candidate recommendations. The media guidance application may determine, based on comparing the characteristics of the respective activity that are relevant to the portion of the media asset to characteristics corresponding to each candidate recommendation of the plurality of candidate recommendations, a candidate recommendation that best matches the respective activity, and may generate for display the candidate recommendation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the media guidance application, when determining which characteristics of the respective characteristics for the respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset, may determine which characteristics of the respective characteristics for the respective activity match the characteristics of the portion of the media asset.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine that a plurality of respective activities have respective characteristics that are relevant to the portion of the media asset. The media guidance application may rank each activity of the plurality of respective activities based on how relevant each activity is with respect to the portion of the media asset. When the media guidance application generates for display the recommendation relating to the respective activity, the media guidance application may generate for display a recommendation for a highest ranked activity.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the media guidance application, when ranking each activity of the plurality of respective activities based on how relevant the each activity is respect to the portion of the media asset, may rank each activity based on an amount of characteristics corresponding to each activity that match the characteristics of the portion of the media asset.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify activities a user has planned that are within a threshold period of time of a present moment. The media guidance application may identify characteristics of each of the activities and may also identify characteristics of a portion of a media asset that the user is consuming at the present moment. The media guidance application may determine, based on a comparison of the characteristics of each of the activities to the characteristics of the portion of the media asset, that an activity is relevant to the portion of the media asset, and may generate for display a recommendation relating to the activity that is relevant to the portion of the media asset.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of characteristics relating to various portion of a media asset, as well as characteristics of planned activities of a user, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings and other media guidance information, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows another illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment (UE) device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for generating for display a recommendation relating to a planned activity of a user that is relevant to a displayed portion of a media asset, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for determining which activities a user has planned are sufficiently close in time to form a basis for a recommendation, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for determining which candidate recommendation of a plurality of candidate recommendations that relate to a planned activity of a user to generate for display to the user, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of characteristics relating to various portion of a media asset, as well as characteristics of planned activities of a user, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts user equipment <b>100</b> and user equipment <b>110</b>, which are each generating for display portions of a media asset, where user equipment <b>100</b> is generating for display portion <b>102</b>, and user equipment <b>110</b> is generating for display portion <b>112</b>. User equipment <b>100</b> and user equipment <b>110</b> may be the same user equipment, but shown at different points in time. As used herein, a &#x201c;portion of a media asset&#x201d; (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;portion&#x201d;) is defined to mean any segment of a media asset. When the media asset includes video, the portion may refer to a single video frame, a scene, a user-defined or editor-defined portion, or any other discrete segment of the video. Where the media asset includes audio, the portion may refer to a space between two conceptual boundaries (i.e., where a topic shifts from one topic to another), a sentence, a discrete period of time, or any other segment of the audio.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each portion of a media asset may have associated characteristics. For example, portion <b>102</b> is associated with characteristics <b>104</b>, and portion <b>112</b> is associated with characteristics <b>114</b>. The term &#x201c;characteristics,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any attribute relating to a portion. For example, a characteristic may be anything relating to who is in a portion (e.g., actors, cartoons, or other characters in the portion), what is in a portion (e.g., objects, landscapes, brightness, etc.), where the portion occurs (e.g., a filming location for a video, or a location that the video intends to portray), when the portion occurs (e.g., past, present, or future), and what activities are occurring in the portion (e.g., if a character in the media asset is presently engaged in any activity, such as walking, running, a sport, sleeping, or any other activity). As depicted, characteristics <b>104</b> and characteristics <b>114</b> are organized into known data structures that are associated with a given portion; however, characteristics <b>104</b> and characteristics <b>114</b> may also be determined, or supplemented, on-the-fly, by obtaining information about the media asset through any known means (e.g., character recognition, object recognition, natural language processing, and crowd sourced data (e.g., user annotations), and the like).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">User profile <b>150</b> is a data structure that includes, among other things, activities that are planned by a user who is viewing the media asset. As used herein, the term &#x201c;activity&#x201d; refers to any planned or scheduled course of action that a user intends to take. For example, an activity may be a planned trip (or a sub-component thereof, such as a day-long tour within a week-long trip, or attendance at a sporting event during the planned trip). An activity may also be a scheduled event, such as a plan to attend tennis lessons, or a plan to go jogging. An activity may be routine (e.g., a daily jog), or non-routine (e.g., a trip to somewhere exotic, like Antarctica).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">User profile <b>150</b> includes activity <b>152</b> and activity <b>154</b>. While activity <b>152</b> is depicted as an activity learned through a travel booking application, and activity <b>154</b> is depicted as an activity entered manually by a user through a calendar application, activity <b>152</b> and activity <b>154</b> may be any activities. The media guidance application may learn of activity <b>152</b> and activity <b>154</b>, and thus add activity <b>152</b> and activity <b>154</b> to user profile <b>150</b>, by querying one or more non-media guidance applications. As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-media guidance application&#x201d; refers to any application that does not fit within the scope of the term &#x201c;media guidance application,&#x201d; as defined below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Specifically, a non-media guidance application is an application that is used primarily for a purpose other than providing guidance through media. Examples of non-media guidance applications include calendar applications, proprietary applications whose primary purpose is to sell goods and/or services, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An activity, as described above, may be inferred based on user interactivity with a non-media guidance application. When a user purchases a product, the media guidance application may infer that the user will engage in an activity that requires the product in the near-term. Inferences may be based on data of a knowledge graph that logs associations between products and activities that are associated with those products, as well as places in which those activities may be performed. Knowledge graphs and their features are described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/501,504, filed Sep. 30, 2014, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/500,309, filed Sep. 29, 2014, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/448,308, filed Jul. 31, 2014, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an example, if a user purchases snorkeling equipment from a retailer, such as Amazon.com, a web retailer, or from Target, a brick-and-mortar retailer, a non-media guidance application may inform the media guidance application of the purchase (e.g., an application associated with the retailer may transmit a message to the media guidance application with information about the purchased product). The media guidance application may then consult a knowledge graph to learn various activities associated with the equipment, such as snorkeling and scuba diving, as well as places in which these activities may occur. The media guidance application may thus provide recommendations to the user when a portion of a media asset includes an activity associated with the product, or a place associated with the product.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The media guidance application may consult a profile of the user to determine whether the user intends to travel to a place associated with a purchased product, or perform an activity associated with the purchased product, in order to strengthen its inference about the activity in which the purchased product is likely to be used. Following from the snorkeling example, if a travel application reflects that the user will be traveling to Hawaii in the near future, the media guidance application may learn from the knowledge graph that Hawaii has a strong association with snorkeling, and may infer that the user intends to snorkel while in Hawaii. Thus, when a portion of a media asset reflects a scene in Hawaii, or a scene relating to snorkeling, the media guidance application may generate for display a recommendation about snorkeling in Hawaii.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a media guidance application (e.g., executed by control circuitry of user equipment or of a server remote from user equipment) may identify a first plurality of activities a user has planned. Functionality of control circuitry, user equipment, servers, and communications networks are described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. The media guidance application may identify the activities by accessing user profile <b>150</b>, which may be located in memory of the user equipment or of a remote database (as described further below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the media guidance application may determine that user profile <b>150</b> indicates that the user has planned activity <b>152</b> and activity <b>154</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the media guidance application may determine that activity <b>152</b> indicates that the user has planned a trip to Los Angeles, Calif., from Jan. 1, 2017 through Jan. 16, 2017, and that the user plans to go sky diving while in Los Angeles. The media guidance application may determine that activity <b>154</b> indicates that the user has a surfing lesson planned for May 5, 2017, at 2:00 &#x3bc;m, in Jones Beach, N.Y.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described in the foregoing, the media guidance application may have populated user profile <b>150</b> by querying a non-media guidance application, such as an application dedicated to booking travel activities (e.g., Kayak, which is a service for booking car, hotel, and airline reservations), a calendar application, or any other non-media guidance application. Alternatively, or additionally, the media guidance application may proactively query one or more non-media guidance applications for information about activities that the user has planned without referencing user profile <b>150</b>. For example, the media guidance application may periodically query the non-media guidance applications for new activities that are not reflected on user profile <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, or alternatively, the media guidance application may instruct the non-media guidance applications to push updates to the media guidance application. As an example, if a user plans a new activity using a non-media guidance application, the non-media guidance application may transmit a notification to the media guidance application to inform the media guidance application of the new activity. The media guidance application may responsively update user profile <b>150</b> to reflect the new activity. Moreover, in some embodiments, the media guidance application may delete activities from user profile <b>150</b> at any point in time, such as the instant the activity occurs, at a predetermined time after the activity occurs, and/or at a user's command. The predetermined time may be set by a user or may be a default setting. The user's command may occur any time, whether or not the activity has occurred yet.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a non-media guidance application may determine that a plan for an activity is canceled or postponed. The non-media guidance application may be under instructions from the media guidance application to update the media guidance application about the cancelation. The media guidance application may receive such an update, and may reactively adjust or delete an activity entry from user profile <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, the media guidance application may periodically query the non-media guidance applications to confirm proactively that a planned activity has not been altered, postponed, or canceled.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may learn which non-media guidance applications should be queried by consulting user profile <b>150</b>, which may reflect which non-media guidance applications the user interacts with. For example, as a user installs an application on a smartphone or tablet device, the media guidance application may update user profile <b>150</b> to indicate that a new non-media guidance application has been installed and should be monitored for activity updates. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may monitor secondary sources for activity updates. For example, the media guidance application may monitor an e-mail application, which is a non-media guidance application, for e-mails that reflect that an activity has been planned, such as a travel itinerary or confirmation. Other secondary sources may be monitored, such as text messages, social messaging communications, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may filter, from the first plurality of activities, a second plurality of activities (e.g., activities that are upcoming in the near future). The media guidance application may perform this filtering by first determining which of the first plurality of activities has a corresponding respective time of the plurality of respective times that is within a threshold period of time of a present moment. The media guidance application may obtain the threshold by querying local memory or a remote database for the threshold. The threshold may be set by default settings, by a user, or by an editor of the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, one threshold period of time will globally apply to all activities. For example, the media guidance application may be programmed in a manner that only activities that are within fifteen days from a present moment are considered to be coming up in the near future. Thus, if the present moment is 10:00 pm on Dec. 18, 2016, activity <b>152</b> may be deemed to be near to the present moment because it occurs on Jan. 1, 2017, which is less than 15 days away from the present moment. However, activity <b>154</b>, which does not occur for more than five months from the present moment, will not be deemed to be near to the present moment. In such a case, activity <b>152</b> may be added to the second plurality of activities, while activity <b>154</b> will not be added to the second plurality of activities, thus resulting in filtering activity <b>154</b> out from the first plurality of activities.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, different threshold periods of time will apply to different types of activities. For example, if a user rarely travels, the media guidance application may determine that a user would be excited about a trip that the user has planned for many months from a present moment. As another example, if an activity is routine (e.g., a daily jog is indicated on the user's calendar every morning at 7 am), the media guidance application may determine that the user is unlikely to be excited about the activity until just minutes before the activity begins. Thresholds for different types of activities may be predefined by an editor of the media guidance application, by default, or by a user. The media guidance application may alter the thresholds dynamically over time as it receives feedback. For example, as will be described below, the media guidance application may provide recommendations to the user that relate to the activity if the activity is near enough in time. If the user, however, rarely acts on the recommendation, the media guidance application may reduce the threshold for that type of activity. Similarly, if the user often acts on the recommendation, the media guidance application may increase the threshold for that type of activity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As an example of how variable thresholds may work, if the user associated with user profile <b>150</b> lives in Los Angeles, and the user is a sky diving instructor who sky dives many days out of the year, and the present moment is Dec. 18, 2016, the threshold for an activity of the type &#x201c;sky diving&#x201d; may be below 12 days, and thus, activity <b>152</b> may not be added to the list. Similarly, if the same user loves surfing, and loves New York, but rarely visits, the threshold for the type of activity of visiting New York, and/or surfing, may be six months, and thus activity <b>154</b>, which occurs within six months, may be added to the second plurality of activities.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, an activity may be of multiple types. For example, activity <b>152</b> may be of the types &#x201c;sports&#x201d; (because sky diving is a sport) and &#x201c;travel&#x201d; (because it indicates it is a travel booking), and &#x201c;sky diving&#x201d;. If an activity has multiple types, and thresholds are variable based on type of activity, then each type may contribute to the threshold. For example, the media guidance application may determine the threshold to be a weighted average of a value assigned to each type. As another example, each type may have an amount of time associated with it, and the media guidance application may add each amount of time associated with each type together to form the threshold.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify characteristics of each activity of the second plurality of activities. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify the characteristics of each activity by consulting a data structure associated with the activity. For example, activity <b>152</b> represents a data structure that details multiple characteristics of a travel booking, such as the fact that activity <b>152</b> is a travel booking, the place in which activity <b>152</b> will take place (Los Angeles, Calif.), the dates at which activity <b>152</b> will take place (Jan. 1, 2017 through Jan. 16, 2017), and other plans that activity <b>152</b> includes, such as sky diving. The data structure that activity <b>152</b> represents may be populated by the media guidance application extracting each characteristic from information received from a non-media guidance application, such as a travel itinerary. The media guidance application may alternatively, or additionally, learn characteristics about activity <b>152</b> by consulting a secondary source, such as a database, that has associations with a given destination. For example, if activity <b>152</b> represents a trip to Los Angeles, Calif., the media guidance application may determine that a characteristic of Los Angeles, Calif. is that it has a beach, because Santa Monica beach is a top tourist attraction in Los Angeles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The media guidance application may identify characteristics of a portion of a media asset that the user is consuming at the present moment, such as a present frame of a movie, or a present scene. For example, portion <b>102</b> may be a scene, or an image frame, from the movie Point Break, which stars actor Keanu Reeves. Characteristics <b>104</b> may be predetermined characteristics, as stored in local memory or in a remote database. The characteristics may be predetermined based on an editor entering the characteristics (e.g., IMDb, a popular movie database application, may have written up the characteristics, and the media guidance application may retrieve them from IMDb). The characteristics may also be predetermined from a user entering the characteristics (e.g., on a social media site that tags portion <b>102</b> with characteristics <b>104</b>). Characteristics <b>104</b> may also be received with portion <b>102</b> as metadata in a VBI or auxiliary signal. Alternatively, characteristics <b>104</b> may be received from any known alternative source. For example, if the movie Point Break were being played to a user from a DVD, then characteristics <b>104</b> may be written onto the DVD and known to the media guidance application from that storage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may dynamically determine characteristics <b>104</b>. For example, the media guidance application may use facial recognition to recognize actors other than Keanu Reeves that may not have been included in a pre-defined characteristics <b>104</b>, and may add those actors to characteristics <b>104</b>. Other means of determining characteristics and adding them to characteristics <b>104</b> include performing textual recognition, such as performing textual recognition on a sign to learn that a characteristic of portion <b>102</b> is that it is filmed on a specific street. The media guidance application may perform natural language processing on speech, subtitles, and/or closed captioning to learn further characteristics <b>104</b> about portion <b>102</b>, as well as object or image recognition. While characteristics <b>114</b> of portion <b>112</b> were not discussed in this embodiment, the media guidance application may determine characteristics <b>114</b> of portion <b>112</b> in any manner described with respect to characteristics <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may compute, for each activity of the second plurality of activities, whether the respective characteristics of each respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset based on a comparison between the respective characteristics and the characteristics of the portion of the media asset. In other words, the media guidance application may determine, based on a comparison of characteristics <b>104</b> or characteristics <b>114</b> to the characteristics of activity <b>152</b> or activity <b>154</b>, whether activity <b>152</b> and/or activity <b>154</b> is relevant to portion <b>102</b> or portion <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To perform this computation, the media guidance application may determine, for each respective activity, a respective amount of respective characteristics that match the characteristics of the portion of the media asset. For example, the media guidance application may determine that one of characteristics <b>104</b> of portion <b>102</b> match the characteristics of activity <b>152</b> (namely, &#x201c;California&#x201d;). Similarly, the media guidance application may determine that two of characteristics <b>104</b> of portion <b>102</b> match the characteristics of activity <b>154</b> (namely, &#x201c;beach&#x201d; and &#x201c;surfing&#x201d;). As another example, the media guidance application may determine that four characteristics <b>114</b> of portion <b>112</b> match the characteristics of activity <b>152</b> (namely, &#x201c;sky diving,&#x201d; &#x201c;California,&#x201d; &#x201c;Beach,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Pacific&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The media guidance application may then compare each respective amount to a threshold, and may determine, based on comparing each respective amount to the threshold, that a respective characteristic has a respective amount that exceeds the threshold. Similar to the time threshold discussed above, the threshold amount of characteristics that need to match may be static, or may vary based on the activity. Moreover, all characteristics of an activity or of a portion need not be treated equally&#x2014;if the media guidance application detects that a given characteristic is important, or irrelevant, to a user's interest, then that given activity may be given more or less weight, and may count as multiple activities, or may have no weight at all. For example, if the media guidance application determines that a user profile (e.g., user profile <b>150</b>) indicates that sky diving is very important to the user, when the characteristic &#x201c;sky diving&#x201d; is encountered in both an activity and a characteristic of a portion, the media guidance application may treat that encounter as if two matching characteristics are found, or three matching characteristics are found. The amount that a given characteristic is weighted may be programmed by an editor of the media guidance application to be any desired function.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, similar to the notion of weighting characteristics of an activity described above, when comparing each respective amount to a threshold, the media guidance application may determine a plurality of thresholds, where each threshold of the plurality of thresholds corresponds to a respective activity of the second plurality of activities. For example, the media guidance application may consult user profile <b>150</b> to determine preferences of the user. The media guidance application may then determine, based on how much a user prefers a given activity, how many characteristics of a portion of a media asset should match that activity to trigger a recommendation. This determination may be a pre-programmed function input by an editor, where the more a user prefers an activity, the lower the threshold becomes. The media guidance application may then compare each respective amount that corresponds to a respective activity to a threshold of the plurality of thresholds that corresponds to the respective activity in order to determine whether to trigger a recommendation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In response to determining that the respective characteristic has a respective amount that exceeds the threshold, the media guidance application may determine that the respective characteristics for the respective activity to which the respective characteristics correspond are relevant to the portion of the media asset. Thus, activities with a sufficient number of characteristics that match characteristics of a portion of a media asset will be deemed relevant to the portion of the media asset.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, in response to determining that the respective characteristics for a respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset, the media guidance application may generate for display a recommendation relating to the respective activity. For example, when generating for display the recommendation, the media guidance application may determine which characteristics of the respective characteristics for the respective activity are relevant to the portion of the media asset (e.g., which characteristics of an activity match the characteristics of the portion), and may access a plurality of candidate recommendations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As a non-limiting example, characteristics <b>104</b>, which include six characteristics may be associated with six candidate recommendations, each corresponding to a different one of the six characteristics. As another example, candidate recommendations may be associated with multiple characteristics, and the media guidance application may select a candidate recommendation to generate for display based on the candidate recommendation matching the most relevant characteristics of the activity, or based on having a highest weighted sum of characteristics (as described above, based on user profile <b>150</b>). The media guidance application may determine, based on comparing the characteristics of the respective activity that are relevant to the portion of the media asset to characteristics corresponding to each candidate recommendation of the plurality of candidate recommendations, a candidate recommendation that best matches the respective activity, and may generate for display the candidate recommendation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine that a plurality of respective activities have respective characteristics that are relevant to the portion of the media asset. The media guidance application may rank each activity of the plurality of respective activities based on how relevant each activity is with respect to the portion of the media asset (e.g., how many characteristics match, or based on a weighted amount of characteristics that match, the characteristics of the portion). When the media guidance application generates for display the recommendation relating to the respective activity, the media guidance application may generate for display a recommendation for a highest ranked activity.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The amount of content available to users in any given content delivery system can be substantial.

Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>404</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>410</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>410</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>400</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>400</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>404</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>404</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>400</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>400</b>. Equipment device <b>400</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>410</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>400</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>410</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>400</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>404</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>404</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>404</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>404</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">User equipment device <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>502</b>, user computer equipment <b>504</b>, wireless user communications device <b>506</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>502</b>, user computer equipment <b>504</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>506</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>502</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>504</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>504</b> may, like some user television equipment <b>502</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>504</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In system <b>500</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>502</b>, user computer equipment <b>504</b>, wireless user communications device <b>506</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.allrovi.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>514</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>502</b>, user computer equipment <b>504</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>506</b> are coupled to communications network <b>514</b> via communications paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>, respectively. Communications network <b>514</b> may be one or more networks including the Internet, a mobile phone network, mobile voice or data network (e.g., a 4G or LTE network), cable network, public switched telephone network, or other types of communications network or combinations of communications networks. Paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b> may separately or together include one or more communications paths, such as, a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Path <b>512</b> is drawn with dotted lines to indicate that in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> it is a wireless path and paths <b>508</b> and <b>510</b> are drawn as solid lines to indicate they are wired paths (although these paths may be wireless paths, if desired). Communications with the user equipment devices may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although communications paths are not drawn between user equipment devices, these devices may communicate directly with each other via communication paths, such as those described above in connection with paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>, as well as other short-range point-to-point communication paths, such as USB cables, IEEE 1394 cables, wireless paths (e.g., Bluetooth, infrared, IEEE 802-11x, etc.), or other short-range communication via wired or wireless paths. BLUETOOTH is a certification mark owned by Bluetooth SIG, INC. The user equipment devices may also communicate with each other directly through an indirect path via communications network <b>514</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">System <b>500</b> includes content source <b>516</b> and media guidance data source <b>518</b> coupled to communications network <b>514</b> via communication paths <b>520</b> and <b>522</b>, respectively. Paths <b>520</b> and <b>522</b> may include any of the communication paths described above in connection with paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>. Communications with the content source <b>516</b> and media guidance data source <b>518</b> may be exchanged over one or more communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, there may be more than one of each of content source <b>516</b> and media guidance data source <b>518</b>, but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. (The different types of each of these sources are discussed below.) If desired, content source <b>516</b> and media guidance data source <b>518</b> may be integrated as one source device. Although communications between sources <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> with user equipment devices <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b> are shown as through communications network <b>514</b>, in some embodiments, sources <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> may communicate directly with user equipment devices <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b> via communication paths (not shown) such as those described above in connection with paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">System <b>500</b> may also include an advertisement source <b>524</b> coupled to communications network <b>514</b> via a communications path <b>526</b>. Path <b>526</b> may include any of the communication paths described above in connection with paths <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>. Advertisement source <b>524</b> may include advertisement logic to determine which advertisements to transmit to specific users and under which circumstances. For example, a cable operator may have the right to insert advertisements during specific time slots on specific channels. Thus, advertisement source <b>524</b> may transmit advertisements to users during those time slots. As another example, advertisement source <b>524</b> may target advertisements based on the demographics of users known to view a particular show (e.g., teenagers viewing a reality show). As yet another example, advertisement source <b>524</b> may provide different advertisements depending on the location of the user equipment viewing a media asset (e.g., east coast or west coast).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, advertisement source <b>524</b> may be configured to maintain user information including advertisement-suitability scores associated with user in order to provide targeted advertising. Additionally or alternatively, a server associated with advertisement source <b>524</b> may be configured to store raw information that may be used to derive advertisement-suitability scores. In some embodiments, advertisement source <b>524</b> may transmit a request to another device for the raw information and calculate the advertisement-suitability scores. Advertisement source <b>524</b> may update advertisement-suitability scores for specific users (e.g., first subset, second subset, or third subset of users) and transmit an advertisement of the target product to appropriate users.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Content source <b>516</b> may include one or more types of content distribution equipment including a television distribution facility, cable system headend, satellite distribution facility, programming sources (e.g., television broadcasters, such as NBC, ABC, HBO, etc.), intermediate distribution facilities and/or servers, Internet providers, on-demand media servers, and other content providers. NBC is a trademark owned by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., ABC is a trademark owned by the American Broadcasting Company, Inc., and HBO is a trademark owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. Content source <b>516</b> may be the originator of content (e.g., a television broadcaster, a Webcast provider, etc.) or may not be the originator of content (e.g., an on-demand content provider, an Internet provider of content of broadcast programs for downloading, etc.). Content source <b>516</b> may include cable sources, satellite providers, on-demand providers, Internet providers, over-the-top content providers, or other providers of content. Content source <b>516</b> may also include a remote media server used to store different types of content (including video content selected by a user), in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of content, and providing remotely stored content to user equipment are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,761,892, issued Jul. 20, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Media guidance data source <b>518</b> may provide media guidance data, such as the media guidance data described above. Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other media guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, guidance data from media guidance data source <b>518</b> may be provided to users' equipment using a client-server approach. For example, a user equipment device may pull media guidance data from a server, or a server may push media guidance data to a user equipment device. In some embodiments, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with source <b>518</b> to obtain guidance data when needed, e.g., when the guidance data is out of date or when the user equipment device receives a request from the user to receive data. Media guidance may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, a user-specified period of time, a system-specified period of time, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). Media guidance data source <b>518</b> may provide user equipment devices <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b> the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the media guidance data may include viewer data. For example, the viewer data may include current and/or historical user activity information (e.g., what content the user typically watches, what times of day the user watches content, whether the user interacts with a social network, at what times the user interacts with a social network to post information, what types of content the user typically watches (e.g., pay TV or free TV), mood, brain activity information, etc.). The media guidance data may also include subscription data. For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions and advertisements that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>408</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>404</b> of a user equipment device <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>404</b> of user equipment device <b>400</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>518</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>518</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>518</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. Youtube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Media guidance system <b>500</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches, or in a system employing other approaches for delivering content and providing media guidance. The following four approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one approach, user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short-range point-to-point communication schemes described above, via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network, or via communications network <b>514</b>. Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>516</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>502</b> and user computer equipment <b>504</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>506</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>514</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>516</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>518</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>502</b>, user computer equipment <b>504</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>506</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud either directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>504</b> or wireless user communications device <b>506</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>504</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>514</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.
