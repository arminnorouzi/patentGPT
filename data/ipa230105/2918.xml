level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, a carbon dioxide gas phase reduction device has been researched and developed. A carbon dioxide gas phase reduction device disclosed in NPL 1 is configured by disposing a gas reduction sheet, in which an ion exchange membrane (Nafion (registered trademark)) and a reduction electrode (Cu) are combined, between a left oxidation tank and a right reduction tank. The ion exchange membrane is disposed toward the oxidation tank side, and the reduction electrode is disposed toward the reduction tank side. The oxidation tank is filled with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution as an electrolytic solution, and an aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) oxidation electrode in which a nickel oxide (NiO) catalyst is laminated is immersed in the aqueous solution. The oxidation electrode is connected to the reduction electrode of the gas reduction sheet via a conducting wire.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such a carbon dioxide gas phase reduction device, when helium (He) is put into the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution in the oxidation tank and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is put into the reduction tank, and the oxidation electrode is irradiated with light (hv), a carbon dioxide reduction reaction proceeds at a three-phase interface consisting of the ion exchange membrane (Nafion) of the gas reduction sheet, the reduction electrode (Cu), and the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the reduction tank. Specifically, in the oxidation tank, oxygen is generated due to an oxidation reaction of water. In the reduction tank, hydrogen is generated by a reduction reaction of protons in the ion exchange membrane, and carbon monoxide and formic acid are generated by a carbon dioxide reduction reaction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">[NPL 1] Sato, et al.

In this regard, a method in which the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution is poured into the oxidation tank when an operation of the gas phase reduction device is started, and the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution is discharged from the oxidation tank when the operation is stopped, and thus contact between the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution and the reduction electrode is limited to only during an operation of the gas phase reduction device is also conceivable.

The nitride semiconductors shown as the oxidation electrodes <b>1</b> of Examples 1 to 4 may have different laminated structures, or may have different compositions such as a composition containing indium and aluminum. Further, for the oxidation electrodes <b>1</b> of Examples 1 to 4, instead of the nitride semiconductors, compounds exhibiting photoactivity such as titanium oxide and amorphous silicon may be used. The oxidation electrode <b>1</b> of Examples 5 to 8 may be a metal such as gold, silver, copper, indium, or nickel instead of platinum. Instead of copper, the reduction electrode <b>7</b> may be gold, platinum, silver, palladium, gallium, indium, nickel, tin, cadmium, an alloy thereof, or a mixture of these metals or metal oxides and carbon. As the aqueous solutions <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, instead of the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution, a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, a potassium chloride aqueous solution, or a sodium chloride aqueous solution may be used. The ion exchange membrane <b>6</b> is, for example, a cation exchange membrane called Nafion, which is a perfluorocarbon material composed of a hydrophobic Teflon skeleton composed of carbon-fluorine and a perfluoro side chain having a sulfonic acid group.
