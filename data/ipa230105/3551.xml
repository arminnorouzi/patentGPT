In a range in which the voltage switches, a voltage corresponding to a rotation angle before the voltage switches and a voltage corresponding to a rotation angle when the voltage switches exist in duplications, and the rotation angle and the voltage do not have a one-by-one relationship therebetween. Accordingly, by excluding computation of the rotation angle in a predetermined range from the time when the voltage switches and providing a one-by-one relationship between the rotation angle and the voltage, an appropriate rotation angle is computed from the voltage. As a result, such a device has a range in which a rotation angle cannot be detected, and therefore it is impossible to continuously detect the rotation angle.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a rotation angle detecting device comprises a detecting unit configured to output a first output value that varies with a rotation angle of a rotary body in a first cycle having, as one cycle period, a predetermined range of the rotation angle and output a second output value that varies with the rotation angle in a second cycle having, as one cycle period, another range of the rotation angle, which is different from that of the first cycle. A variation in the second output value is different from a variation in the first output value in a positive/negative sign. A magnitude relationship between the first output value and the second output value changes with a variation in the rotation angle at a plurality of rotation angles during the one cycle period of the first cycle. The rotation angle detecting device further comprises a selector unit configured to select, from between the first output value and the second output value, a value, which is at least a first threshold corresponding to a minimum value of values of the first output value corresponding to the plurality of rotation angles, and which is at most a second threshold corresponding to a maximum value of the values of the first output value corresponding to the plurality of rotation angles. The rotation angle detecting device further comprises a computing unit configured to compute, based on the value selected by the selector unit, a value related to the rotation angle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a result, in a range of at least the first threshold to at most the second threshold, the value output from the detecting unit is continuous at any rotation angle and has a one-by-one relationship with the rotation angle. Accordingly, the value selected by the selector unit is continuous at any rotation angle &#x3b8; and has a one-by-one relationship with the rotation angle &#x3b8;. Consequently, the rotation angle is computed on the basis of the value which is continuous at ay rotation angle &#x3b8; and has the one-by-one relationship with the rotation angle &#x3b8;, and therefore the rotation angle detecting device can continuously detect the rotation angle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to the drawings, a description will be given below of embodiments.
