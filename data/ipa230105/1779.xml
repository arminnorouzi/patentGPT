Power of the rotating electric machine is determined as a product of a rotational speed and a torque of the rotating electric machine. Accordingly, the increase of power density of the rotating electric machine can be realized by increasing either one of a rotational speed or a torque.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, it is often the case where attempts have been made to increase power density by increasing a rotational speed of a rotating electric machine. In this case, it is necessary to interpose gears between the rotating electric machine and a load. Accordingly, due to the gears which become additional constituent elements, there is a possibility that several disadvantages occur including lowering of system efficiency and lowering of reliability and, further, lowering of power density as viewed as a system due to the increase of a weight of the rotating electric machine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, the increase of torque density of a rotating electric machine is one of techniques for realizing the increase of power density of a rotating electric machine while making it unnecessary to use gears. In this case, the increase of reliability and the increase of power density of the system are facilitated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As one of means that have been proposed conventionally for increasing torque density, there has been known a rotor structure that makes use of permanent magnets. A magnetized permanent magnet has a magnetomotive force. Accordingly, by making this magnetomotive force and a magnetomotive force that an electric current that flows through a coil of a stator interact with each other, torque density can be increased. More specifically, by connecting a magnetomotive force of a permanent magnet with a magnetomotive force of a coil current in series on a magnetic circuit, magnetic flux density in a gap is increased so that torque density can be increased.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a conventionally proposed structure suitable for increasing torque density, there has been proposed a structure described in Patent Literature 1, for example. Patent Literature 1 discloses a rotor structure that has the following configuration. The rotor structure includes a plurality of magnets that are arranged in a circumferential direction. The respective magnets are formed in a symmetrical shape with respect to a q axis that is a magnetic pole boundary between d axes that are magnetic pole centers disposed adjacently to each other in the circumferential direction. Further, there has been proposed a rotor structure where an easy axis of magnetization is oriented so as to form an arcuate magnet magnetic circuit such that the easy axis of magnetization becomes parallel to the d axis or a direction that is substantially parallel to the d axis in a portion close to the d axis, and the easy axis of magnetization becomes orthogonal to the q axis or a direction substantially orthogonal to the q axis in a portion close to the q axis. In the proposed structure, the magnetization direction of the magnet takes a pseudo Halbach magnetism where a magnetic flux is concentrated toward the center of the pole and hence, a torque is increased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As exemplified using Patent Literature 1, the conventional rotor structure uses a large amount of magnet, and adopts a rotor shape that can generate Halbach magnetization or a magnetic flux distribution close to Halbach magnetization in a pseudo manner for concentrating a magnetic flux on a pole center thus increasing torque density. This is because , to consider a magnetic circuit in a simplified manner, the rotor is filled with a permanent magnet, and the permanent magnet is magnetized along a direction of a magnetic flux that flows in the rotor. Accordingly, in view of maximizing a magnetomotive force that is acquired during a period from a point of time that a magnetic flux enters from gap surface of a certain pole to a point of time that the magnetic flux exits from a gap surface of a pole disposed adjacently to the certain pole, the conventional concept is reasonable from a viewpoint of a conventional structure. Accordingly, as exemplified in Patent Literature 1, in the conventional structure, the structure is adopted where the permanent magnet is matted between a surface of the rotor and a surface of the stator that face each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, from a viewpoint of using an Nd magnet for maximizing torque density, a unit material cost of a permanent magnet is expensive compared to a unit material cost of a core. Accordingly, the conventional structure pushes up a cost of the rotor and hence, the conventional concept is not desirable in a case where the mass production of rotating electric machines is taken into consideration. Further, in the conventional concept, a rotor is not sufficiently designed such that the consumption of a magnetomotive force of the entire rotating electric machine is not taken into account. That is, the rotor is not designed in such a manner that not only a magnetomotive force of the permanent magnet of the rotor but also a relationship between the magnetomotive force of the permanent magnet of the rotor and a magnetomotive force that an electric current that flows through a wiring of the stator generates are taken into account. Accordingly, there has not been proposed a rotor structure that can further enhance torque density of a rotating electric machine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading

id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to drawings. Although a plurality of embodiments are proposed in the present invention, the following embodiments are merely embodiments, and are not intended to limit the embodiments of the present invention to specific modes described below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Before describing the embodiments, the manner operation of the present invention is described. According to the present invention, a magnetic flux in a magnetized permanent magnet concentrates on core pieces, and the magnetic flux passes the inside of the permanent magnet such that the magnetic flux connects the core pieces disposed adjacently to each other. Accordingly, a leaked magnetic flux in a rotor is minimally generated so that a magnetic flux can be effectively used. Further, when the post-magnetization is performed, a path of a magnetic flux that connects pole centers can be shortened with the use of the core pieces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, Halbach magnetization can be easily acquired in a post-magnetization step and hence, gap magnetic flux density at the pole center can be enhanced. Further, with the use of the core pieces each having high magnetic permeability at the pole center, the consumption of a magnetomotive force of the entire rotating electric machine when a load is applied can be reduced. Particularly, the consumption of a magnetomotive force that an electric current that flows through a wiring of the stator generates is reduced.

In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, embedded surfaces of core pieces <b>110</b> embedded in a permanent magnet part <b>200</b> have a curved surface <b>111</b> having a finite radius of curvature as viewed in a radial direction. The definition of the direction of the radial direction is, as set forth above, the direction directed from the outer peripheral side to the inner peripheral side in the case of the outer rotor, and the direction directed from the inner peripheral side to the outer peripheral side in the case of the inner rotor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the embedded surface of the core piece <b>110</b> embedded in the ring magnet <b>210</b> has a protruding shape having a finite radius of curvature, and a protrusion has a shape that is directed toward an outer peripheral side.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">By adopting the structure according to the embodiment, a magnetic flux that passes the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> and is connected between magnetic poles has a streamline shape and hence, it is possible to prevent the local concentration of the magnetic flux. Accordingly, the local magnetic saturation of the core piece <b>110</b> can be alleviated and hence, torque density of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be enhanced. Particularly, in a case where the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> is magnetized by post magnetization, by allowing the magnetic flux to pass between the core pieces <b>110</b>, the magnetic flux that starts from the curved surface <b>111</b> of one pole and reaches the curved surface <b>111</b> of the other pole is distributed on a smooth approximately circular arc.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">That is, the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> can be magnetized with the magnetic flux distribution where irregularities of a magnetic path length of a magnetic flux that passes respective positions of the curved surface <b>111</b> become small. Accordingly, an amount of electric current necessary for magnetization can be reduced and hence, a manufacturing cost can be reduced. Alternatively, without forming regions where the magnetization is insufficient locally, the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> can be magnetized with a small amount of electric current.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">Further, it is possible to maximize an advantageous effect of the present invention by making a vertex of the curved surface <b>111</b> in the radial direction overlap with the d axis that is a pole center of each magnetic pole.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0085">Next, a fifth embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> that has been used heretofore. In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, a permanent magnet part <b>200</b> is formed of the split magnets (<b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . ). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the split magnets are formed by combining the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , and the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . , in a circular annular shape. However, provided that the number of pieces is two or more, the advantageous effect of the embodiment can be acquired. Further, the advantageous effect of the embodiment can be acquired by setting a splitting direction to any directions such as a radial direction R, a circumferential <b>0</b> direction and a rotary-axis Z direction.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">By adopting the structure according to the present embodiment, a microscopic gap is formed between the respective split magnets of the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> and hence, contact resistance is generated at a contact portion between the split magnets. Accordingly, an effect that the split magnets are electrically separated from each other can be acquired and hence, an eddy current minimally flows between the split magnets in a straddling manner.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">With such a configuration, an eddy current generated in the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> and an eddy current loss can be reduced and hence, efficiency of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be enhanced. Particularly, in a case where the split magnets are coated with an insulation film or the like, an eddy current that flows between the split magnets in a straddling manner can be ignored and hence, the efficiency of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be further enhanced. Particularly, by splitting the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> along the axis of rotation or in the Z direction, an eddy current in the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> and an eddy current loss can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">Particularly, it is unnecessary that all of the split magnets (<b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . ) are formed of the same kind of permanent magnet, and the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> may be formed by combining different kinds of magnets.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">Particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, in the structure where the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . of the split magnets face the gap <b>109</b>, and the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . of the split magnets do not face the gap <b>109</b>, a permanent magnet having a higher coercive force than the second piece can be selected as a permanent magnet for forming the first piece. A magnetic flux of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> concentrates on a periphery of the gap <b>109</b> and hence, by increasing a coercive force of the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , a demagnetization strength of the rotor <b>102</b> can be enhanced. In general, a coercive force and a residual magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet have the trade-off relationship. Accordingly, as the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . , a magnet having a high residual magnetic flux density while having a lower coercive force than the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . can be used. With such a configuration, it is possible to enhance torque density of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> while enhancing the demagnetization strength.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0090">In the same manner, an Nd sintered magnet can be used as the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , and an Nd bond magnet can be used as the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . . To compare the Nd sintered magnet with the Nd bond magnet, in general, the Nd sintered magnet has a higher coercive force than the Nd bond magnet, while the Nd bond magnet can easily set the magnetization direction more freely than the Nd sintered magnet. The reason that the Nd bond magnet has the degree of freedom in the magnetization direction is that the Nd bond magnet is an isotropic magnet so that the Nd bond magnet can easily perform Halbach magnetization or the like, for example.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example of magnetization that can be performed in a case where the Nd sintered magnet is used as the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . , and the Nd bond magnet is used as the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . . The Nd sintered magnets that form the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . are anisotropic magnets and hence, the Nd sintered magnets are magnetized in one direction. On the other hand, the Nd bond magnets that form the second pieces <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, . . . are anisotropic and hence, the Nd bond magnets are magnetized in the direction that is directed from a contact surface with the first pieces <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . toward a contact surface with the core pieces <b>110</b> (or in the opposite direction).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0092">In this manner, by combining the Nd sintered magnets with the Nd bond magnets, the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> that has obtained pseudo Halbach magnetization can be formed by the combined structure of the split magnets. Accordingly, a magnetic flux can be concentrated on the core pieces <b>110</b> so that magnetic flux density of the gap <b>109</b> can be enhanced whereby torque density of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be enhanced. Further, in general, the Nd bond magnet has a higher magnetic permeability than the Nd sintered magnet and hence, magnetic resistance of the second piece against a magnetomotive force <b>620</b> generated by a winding current <b>108</b> that flows through a stator winding <b>107</b> of a stator <b>101</b> is reduced.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0093">Accordingly, magnetic flux density that the winding current <b>108</b> generates in the gap <b>109</b> can be enhanced and hence, torque density of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0094">As another magnet split pattern, the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> may be split on d axes that are pole centers, There exists no circumferential direction component of a magnetic flux on the d axis and hence, even when the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> is split on the d axes, a magnetic characteristic is not affected, Accordingly, it is possible to prevent worsening of torque density that may occur due to splitting of the permanent magnet part <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0095">Further, as another magnet split pattern, the permanent magnet part <b>200</b> may be split on the q axes each of which exists between the pole centers. With such a configuration, at the time of the manufacture, it is possible to integrally mold the core piece <b>110</b> amounting one pole and the permanent magnet part <b>200</b>. For example, assembling and magnetization can be performed for each pole. Particularly, in performing the post magnetization, a magnetization yoke can be arranged at three surfaces in total consisting of a surface on a gap <b>109</b> side and two surfaces on sides in the circumferential direction and hence, an electric current necessary for magnetization can be reduced. Accordingly, the rotating electric machine <b>100</b> can be manufactured easily thus enhancing the productivity of the rotating electric machine <b>100</b>.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0096">A sixth embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a conceptual view of a cross section of an electrically operated wheel <b>900</b> according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention.
