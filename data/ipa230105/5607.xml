id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1) Field of the System</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">A computerized system for management of patient encounters including pairing physical activities, events, objects, and individuals and, associated virtual representation to verify a link between the activity and object with a virtual representation to create an undichotomized pair that can be used for authentication, verification, anti-fraud, appraisals, auditing, recording&#x2014;and the like&#x2014;of the status, activity, and transactions associated with the medical device, task, medication, treatment, or other medical activity. A system for pairing medical events and objects utilizing location data, timing of when they occur, biometric identity of the patient or participant, biometric identification of the provider or medical personnel including service and activity identification. The system pairs an occurring event with a digital representation that can be adapted for use with health care, medical records, insurance, billing, government oversight, verification, or other administrative process. The verified digital data collected can be used to effectuate payments, reimbursements, and smart contracts to facilitate automatic transactions between entities as well as to automatically detect, determine, and record compliance with requirements, private and governmental. The verified digital data can also be used to create digital assets, non-fungible tokens and provide information to third parties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2) Background</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The medical industry is a large and complicated industry for tracking data, activities, individuals, and objects. For example, there is a significant market for medical devices and medications including controlled, restricted, and prescribed medications. Further, some medical activities have increased risk, value, need for control, are prone to mistakes, fraud, and can be subject to abuse.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When performing medical activities, the medical provider goes through a process of reimbursements, which is a process used for medical provider to receive payments for providing healthcare or medical services. To reduce the time between the medical activity and the payments, the process can start before the medical activity is administered or provided and can continue until after its completion. A system that allowed for data tracking prior to a medical activity that can associate the tracked data with medical activity would be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been reported that fraudulent prescription drugs are subject to more abuse in older adults and, this has been a growing problem. It would be advantageous to have a system that better controlled the provisioning of such drugs and, from the medical provider to the patient, to reduce or eliminate prescription drug abuse and reduce or eliminate reimbursement for medications that are not actually provided to the patient. While there have been efforts to address this problem, these efforts are subject to many exposing issues that result in mistakes in the making, distribution, prescription, dispensing, and usage of drugs. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, each year in the United States alone, 7,000 to 9,000 people die because of medication errors. Further, it is estimated that the abuse of opioid analgesics alone results in over $72 billion in medical costs each year. There is also a rise in healthcare fraud, with one entity having to pay $270 million to resolve a fraudulent claim. One estimate of Medicaid fraud states that the waste and loss accrued exceeding $25 billion annually.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The issues with verification that medical services were provided, proper medications were prescribed and delivered, the proper medical personnel administered or provided the medical services, are some issues that if not properly managed, can lead to mistakes, fraud, and abuse. The problem is compounded with the lack of effective regulation and weak enforcement capacity. Further, as the industry becomes more digital, the opportunity for undesirable events occurs such as data breaches and identity theft that can be used to improperly receive medications. A system that is based up on verifiable truths rather than trust would be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In application, Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurance companies are susceptible to fraud which results in unnecessary costs to those companies as well as taxpayers, which can be in the billions of dollars per year. A system that creates an immutable record that verifies the medical provider or professional, patient, medications, location, activity, treatment, event, object, and other items, and functions to pair these with a digital representation that does not rely exclusively upon trusting the digital representation or inputted data alone would be advantageous. The digital representation can represent medical devices, medications, treatments, locations, providers, healthcare workers, patients, participants, and the like, so that an immutable record is provided that can reduce, if not eliminate, fraud. Verifying who, what, when, and where, as it relates to a medical object, and storing it in an immutable database can provide for truth in data, autonomous processing of not only billing and payments but other administrative processes and provide a more secure data storage system. Autonomous verification and storage of digital representations would not only save money and time related to unnecessary costs and fraud, but also would expedite payments resulting in better cash flows and ease of auditing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also an issue with a chain of title or custody for articles such as medical devices, medicines, and medical containers, and the association of these to individuals. Current systems have a lack of accountability, verification, and reliability of information related to the article and transactions. The inability to verify or authenticate articles and other factors can result in loss, mistakes, increased insurance claims, fraud, increased insurance premiums, injury, and death. While there have been some attempts to add item information to a physical material, such as U.S. Pat. No. 8,321,302, these attempts have focused on tracking inventory levels and do not include verifiably pairing a physical material with a virtual representation that can be tracked throughout a process. Further, these prior attempts focus on a single location and do not consider the fact that the physical location of the article can be at separate locations, from creation to distribution and use. This disadvantage can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 8,521,620 which specifically states that if a RFID tag is lost or damaged, the system allows a user to enter an item number or style and tags of similar items are displayed, a new tag is generated and associated with the item having the lost or damaged tag. Once the RFID tag is lost or damaged, the medications or container is no longer paired. While this system specifically allows for the replacement of RFID tags on the same item, it lacks the ability to verifiably pair the new tag with the medications or container. A system immutably pairing individuals, services, activities, objects, and any combination would be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disadvantages of current systems are caused in part due to the lack of an immutable storage system associating the medical device, medication, or container with the virtual representation to determine that the article promised and delivered are properly paired, both physically and digitally. Attempts to provide for inspections (e.g., authentications) that an article is original has not resolved the existing set of problems. There is also a need to verify that the individuals, during the creation, authentication and transactions, are who they say that they are, and identify what tasks they have completed. Evidence that the existing systems fail to address the current and obvious problem is that in 2021, the United States federal government won or negotiated more than $5 billion in healthcare fraud judgments and settlements, the largest amount ever in the history of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice's fraud and abuse enforcement program.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One such system that has failed to provide a meaningful solution is found in United States Patent Application 2014/0288958 which discloses systems and methods that are described to facilitate providing an online automated payment architecture that aggregates funds from multiple health-related accounts (e.g., a member's HSA, an employer's advance account, etc.) and automatically transfers the aggregated funds to a healthcare provider's account to pay a bill or invoice. This system fails to provide a verifiable link to the actual individuals, activities, and actions with the digital representations. Further, this system does not track the activity, individual, date, time, and location to reduce or prevent fraud, nor does it provide efficiencies in autonomous processes such as smart contracts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is also a need to verify that the actions being performed by the individual are in compliance with applicable standards, regulations and other requirements. In some reimbursement systems, reimbursement is only provided if the medical provider meets the requisite authorization, licensees, and other criteria. For example, when a skilled nursing facility provides services covered by Medicare (e.g., speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy), Medicare skilled nursing facility reimbursement rates are calculated under the prospective payment system through Medicare part A so that verification of the medical providers' status and licenses are important to payments. A system that can provide a warning when the criteria are not met, at the time of provision of medical services, would be advantageous. Specifications in some processes can include the specification of an authentication process, commercialization process, or other performance criteria of the article. Specifications can also include initial registration and transaction requirements, as well as notifications.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would be advantageous to have a system that could have medications and/or medical device specifications or requirements related to such things as patient vitals, time of administration of dosage, or licensure and/or training of the individuals involved in the event in an immutable data record where a system could compare the conditions at the time of the event to the specifications and requirements of the medication or medical device. An immutable record of the event would be useful for future diagnoses and medical evaluations of the patient or persons involved in the event as well as tracking for insurance or other purposes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would be advantageous to have a system that verified articles, authorized individuals, verified proper environmental parameters as well as verified that items and tasks are properly paired with a virtual representation. It would be advantageous to have a system that reduced or eliminates the risk of a counterfeit, fraudulent, substitute, lower quality, or other non-designated or approved article being used. It would be advantageous for a system that prevented or reduced the risk of counterfeit, unlicensed or unauthorized articles.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would be advantageous to have a system that allows for third party or automated independent verification to reduce counterfeit, fraudulent, false, or misleading information and activity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It would be an advantage to have a system that can pair medical activities with virtual representation so that authentication can be easily and quickly accomplished in real time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It would be advantageous to have a system that provides for multi-party verification for tracking of the medical activities, individuals, and physical articles. This tracking could happen autonomously and with location confirmation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It would be advantageous to have a system that provides for a verified trust association between medical activities, articles, and virtual representations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It would be advantageous to have an immutable storage of a digital record of medical events that are paired with the patient or recipient, the provider or healthcare worker, as well as the facility, medicines, medical objects, and location whereby the event took place. This immutable record could then be accessed by additional stakeholders in a secure manner such as using a biometric key or unique security token. The token or key could be given to future medical providers, insurance or other administrative processes, or be accessed by the patient or other stakeholder themselves for future reference upon authorization.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The medical, pharmaceutical, and drug manufacturing industries are one of the most regulated business segments. Misrepresentation, fraud, and errors can lead to injury and even unnecessary death. A system that has improved verification and does not rely upon &#x201c;trust&#x201d; of the human operator or human input generated data would be desirable. The insurance industries are also rocked with fraud bloated management and oversight costs in multiple entries related to claims and services provided that have been billed. A platform that requires only a matching biometrically and that can automate autonomously the entire payment and confirmation process by verifications of when where and what and by whom would again be of great value.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It would be advantageous to have an immutable storage system whereby an auditing engine could confirm the data records being created. The data records, being immutable, would be verified as to the accuracy and confirmation of hashes, or other means immutably recorded, in the data as well as the data contained in the hashes being accurate. The data obtained could then be used for predictive analytics as well as for analytical processes to help improve medical treatments, patient experiences, productivity, efficiencies, optimizations, medicine, and product life cycles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE SYSTEM</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, this system can be a computerized system for management of patient encounters comprising: a medical encounter computer system in communication with an immutable storage system; a sensor in communication with the medical encounter computer system; a medical device in communication with the medical encounter computer system adapted to record vital signs of a patient; a healthcare provider record stored on the immutable storage system; a patient record stored on the immutable storage system; a set of computer readable instructions included in the medical encounter computer system adapted to: receive healthcare provider identifying information from the sensor, retrieve the healthcare provider record from the immutable storage system and generate a healthcare provider notification according to a comparison of the healthcare provider identifying information with the healthcare provider record, receive patient identifying information from the sensor, retrieve the patient record from the immutable storage system and generate a patient notification according to a comparison of the patient identifying information with the patient record, receive healthcare activity information from the sensor, and generate a healthcare activity notification according to a comparison of the healthcare activity information with the healthcare provider record, and, generate a medical device notification according to a comparison of a medical device usage with the healthcare provider record.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system can include a sensor that is adapted to receive biometric information.

The computer system can be a kiosk, mobile device or otherwise, and can include a set of computer readable instructions configured to receive information about an article or task that can include the ability to capture information such as research, description of the article, task or process, manufacturer, characteristics of the medical activity, article, task, process, procedures, materials, object and the like, an event associated with the article or task, its significance, the individuals associated with the article or task such as researchers, shippers, manufacturers, distributors, medical service suppliers, dispensaries, medical facilities, date and time, location, individuals that can verify or certify the generation of the digital representation and the meta data associated with the medical activity. The computer system can be a mobile device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The information that can be inputted, received by the sensor, retrieved from a computer device or immutable storage system can include a number of data elements. Data can be retrieved from a medical device such as one that reads vital signs, information about medical treatments, the patient, medical apparatus such as blood pressure monitors, thermometers, and other devices such as dialysis machines, x-rays, CAT scan machines, MRI machines, and the like. A medical device computer system can be used to receive information from these sources as well as a database, local and remote, and a sensor. The sensor can include video, audio, electrical signals such as RF, Bluetooth, and other wireless devices as well as wired devices such as a thermometer attached to the medical encounter computer system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Data can include a healthcare provider record that can include information about a healthcare provider such as name, licenses, authorizations, skill, assignments, work schedule, privileges, and the like. Authorizations can include what medical activities and medications that the medical provider can administer. For example, a surgeon may require an orthopedic license or authorization to perform orthopedic surgeries. A patient record can include patient information such as names, address, location, treatment locations, diagnosis, treatment plans, insurance, approved providers, and the like. A set of computer readable computer instructions can be adapted to retrieve such information, and generate notifications based upon a comparison of the various data it receives. A notification can have several forms such as generating an approval, a warning, a block to prevent the healthcare activity, and the like. For example, the computer readable instructions can compare the usage of healthcare provider licenses required for use of a medical device with the licenses of the healthcare provider and, if the health care provider has the requisite licenses, provide a notification that the healthcare activity is approved. If the healthcare provider does not have the requisite licenses, then the computer readable instructions can generate a warning that the activity is not approved and in one embodiment, prevent the medical device from operating.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sensor can also receive biometric information of the patient and the healthcare provider so that the identity of the patient and healthcare provider can be known to the medical encounter computer system. The system can also identify the location of the medical device and the healthcare provider and compare the two. In the event that these locations do not match, it can indicate that incorrect information is being entered associated with a medical activity. For example, if there is an attempt to enter a medical activity for reimbursement purposes and the health care provider location and the patient location do not match, it can indicate a mistake or fraud. In this case, the health care activity may not have occurred as the patient and the healthcare provider were not in the same location. The same comparison can be performed with the medical device location and the patient location. The medical device can include location information that can be received by the computer readable instructions. The same comparison can be performed with the healthcare provider location and the medical encounter computer system. The same comparison can be performed with the patient location medical encounter computer system. An approved patient location can be included in the patient record which can represent a location where the patient is to receive healthcare treatment. The patient location can include one or more locations such as the patient in home treatment location, in patient location, outpatient location, and the like. In the event that the comparison of these data points do not match, the computer readable instructions can create a notification that warns that a mistake or even fraud occurred, flag a record, event or set of records or events for review or audit, determine that the healthcare activity is not approved, determine that the healthcare activity should not be or have been performed, and the like. The system can also receive and use the biometric information of patient, biometric information of a health care provider and determine a time of activity or event to confirm a patient encounter.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system can also receive health care activity from the sensor or other input that can include use of a medical device, use of an external sensor, administration of medication, application of a medical device, medical treatment, and the like. For example, the sensor can detect physical therapy treatment and activity and can determine if the patient was to receive such treatment. Through the detection of input from a healthcare provider and recording of the motion associated with physical therapy, the system can determine if the treatment was to be administered according to the patient record, healthcare provider, record, insurance information, treatment plan, and the like. The insurance information and treatment plan can be in the patient record or in a third-party database that is associated with the patient and healthcare provider.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the system can determine travel time of a healthcare provider, medical device, and patient from one location to another. The system can determine an arrival time and a departure time of the healthcare provider. The system can have information concerning the healthcare activity and compare a time period associated with a healthcare activity with the time that the healthcare provider was at the patient location and create a temporal notification according to the comparison. For example, if the health care provider was to take a sample of blood, a fifteen-minute time period on location may be reasonable. If the health care provider was to administer physical therapy, a thirty-minute time period on location may be reasonable. If the on-location time was for fifty minutes, it may not be reasonable. The system can also determine a travel time from one location to another. The system can determine a departure time from a first location (e.g., first patient) and an arrival time to a second location (e.g., second patient) to determine a travel time wherein the locations can be within a facility of between two facilities (e.g., one room to another or home to home). If a second health care activity occurred prior to the ability of the health care provider to reasonably travel from the first location to the second location, a notification can be generated. In one embodiment, the system can calculate the travel time according to a mode of transportation that can include walking, biking, motorized vehicle, public transportation, and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When administering medical, the system can retrieve information from a medication computer system. A medication record can include information about medications that are approved for the patient, acceptable substitutes, drug interactions, insurance approved medications, and the like. The system can generate a notification according to the comparison of the medication and patient record and patient identification information. For example, if the patient is not to receive a certain medication and the system determines that this medication is being administered, a warning can be generated. If the medication is not approved for insurance reimbursement, a warning can be generated. If the medication needs to be administered according to certain regulations or healthcare provider authorization, and is not, a warning can be generated. If the patient physiology is outside acceptable ranges, a warning can be generated. The information that is received and generated by the medical encounter system can be recorded on an immutable storage system. In this configuration, a token can be generated that points to one or more components of the medical record and its metadata or one or more portion of the medical record. In one embodiment, smart contracts of other auto initiating software or processes can be included in the system for adding data, hashes, blocks of other items or data to a storage system or cause a computer system to implement a routine, transaction or process. For example, if the patient needs verification that a healthcare provider visit occurred, the token can be associated with the date, time, and location of the medical visit without revealing the underlying activity, such as the treatment, diagnosis, and the like. In one embodiment, the token can be a non-fungible token. Therefore, verification that the patient can provide proof that medical treatment was received with disclosing personal medical information. Such application can be useful for excused absences from work and school. The system can also be used to effectuate a smart contract that can be associated with payments. When the system determines that an appropriate medical activity occurred, the system can instigate payment from an insurance company to a health care provider. The system can also place the payment in a queue for subsequent review so that the payment can be automatically generated, but human intervention for approval can still be accomplished.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system can also facilitate warranty claims for such items as medical devices. For example, a medical device manufacturer may require that the patient have or not have certain attributes (e.g., under a certain age, weight, blood pressure, insulin levels, etc.) or that the medical device only be installed by an authored (e.g., licensed) medical professional. The system can make this determination and store the information in the immutable storage system for later retrieval, in the event that the information is need for a warranty claim, and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the system can capture an image of the individual, item, activity, and its unique identifier and associate that information with a date, time, and location. Individuals can be captured that can include images, video, date, time, and location information. The system can retrieve scheduling and occupancy information and verify that the individuals involved were at the same location at the stated date and time. Images of the article or task can be compared with environmental information (e.g., weather) information at the location, date, and time so that the background of an image showing the environmental conditions can be compared with third-party weather information. If the image of the article shows a cloudy day and the third-party weather information shows a cloudy day, the confidence of the virtual representations of the article increases. Biometric data can be captured from one or more individuals as well as attendance information from access control system to verify that the individual was at the treatment location at the date and time the virtual representation is retrieved, created, and stored. Further, the information can show that a first medical provider encountered a patient at a first date, time, and location and a second medical provided encountered the patient as a second date and time, and same location increasing the confidence that the medical activity properly occurred. The confidence score can represent the probability that the physical individual, action, and objects match the digital representations can be derived from a number of data points. For example, if a patient first location at a first time is 100 miles away from a patient second location at a second time and the difference between the two times is 15 minutes, the confidence is low. This determination can depend upon the travel mode as well.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The information captured can be stored in a record that include fields associated with the above as well as individuals involved, observers, materials used, equipment used, processes used, location, date, time, results, class, type, lot, batch, or other identification of the article or task, one or more sources, cost, care instructions, material specifications, shipping information, storage information, and other information. The medical object record may be created or updated as actual articles arrive to a location and have serial numbers, bar codes, QR codes, RFID values, beacons, lots, sizes, or other components or material identification added or associated with the article record. A medical activity record can include a task information associated with article such as research, reactions, processes, procedures, manufacturing, packaging, shipping, storage, testing, trials, and any combination.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>D</figref>, they illustrate one embodiment of a system <b>100</b> that can be a computer system in a kiosk, or other housing, that can be uniquely associated with a treatment location.

Pairing the physical material with the virtual representation can include several elements or components. Included in the pairing process can be the physical observation of the materials to create a medical device or medication and its components and then associate the medical device or medication with a virtual representation so that the medical device or medication is properly associated with the virtual representation. This verification provides trust that the virtual representation is accurately associated with the medical device or medication as a fact rather than simply trusting that the virtual representation is accurate. This system can use manual or automated processes to physically observe the medical device or medication and its creation tasks and associate the medical device or medication with the virtual representation during various events from raw material to final deliverables. Verification can also use the metadata that is associated with the interaction of medical device or medication by individuals and electronics when the item is created, transported, installed, activated, and destroyed. The metadata that can be captured and placed into immutable storage can provide stakeholders an audit trail of history for their medical device or medication using a verified paired virtual representation. A similar process as described herein can be used for pairing a biometric identifier with an individual.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Verification, including verification of an event, can include verifying that the physical material and the virtual representation match and can be accomplished in a variation of methods including interaction with identification elements such as a tag, label, and the like, capturing an image of the material, capturing a video of the material, capturing a tag physically affixed or otherwise associated with the material, human visual inspection, and any combination. Identification of an individual performing or otherwise associated with an event can be captured by identification devices (e.g., cards, tags, RF ID) and biometrics including visual capture (e.g., facial recognition), voice recognition, iris scan, fingerprint, palm print, and any combination.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment is shown. The immutable storage system <b>1900</b> is accessible by a medical device provider <b>1902</b>. The medical provider can have a unique ID associated with the provider. The medical provider can create a medical object record that represents a medical activity. For example, the medical device can be a prosthetic, crutch, implant, and can be for general use or specific use. The medical provider can include a material list and other properties for the medical device or medication. For example, if the medical device is an implant, the medical provider can specify medical grade stainless steel, titanium, and other biomedical materials, tools, and equipment. There are a host of requirements that include multiple American Society for Testing and Materials standards. For example, if the medical device is for a knee replacement, ASTM F1223 provides for the material and test methods for the medical device. The system can create a medical device record <b>1908</b> that can include information associated with the material, its manufacturer, is supplier, treatment location, supplier for one or more materials, the date and time the design was created or modified and the location where the design was created or modified and other metadata. The medical device record, manufacturing record, shipping record, and storage record can be stored on the immutable storage system that can be local or remote from the designer.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">From this record, a material record can be created and stored on the immutable storage system. The material record can include a single component or multiple components. Each component or material in a set of materials can include a warranty that is from the researcher, tester, manufacturer, distributor, health care professional, installer, and any combination. The requirements for a warranty to remain in place can include requirements such as compliance with installation processes, environmental conditions, use of licensed individuals, use of qualified and experienced individuals, and any combination.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">A medical provider, using a computer system <b>1910</b>, can select or otherwise acquire the medical device <b>1916</b> identified on the material list from a materials record <b>1908</b> or can be retrieved or otherwise received by the medical manufacturer from the immutable storage system. The medical device supplier can verify that the material matches the material requirement record, and the system can capture this event. For example, one method of associating the physical material with a virtual representation is using a tag <b>1920</b><i>a </i>(T<sub>1</sub>) placed on the material. The tag is then physically verified to be associated with the material from the material list or the material record. Therefore, the physical material and the virtual representation (V<sub>1</sub>) are paired by recording this event and associating the physical material, T<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>1</sub>. The material can be received by the manufacturer, scanned, or otherwise identified with a sensor assembly, inspected by an individual and the manufacturing process recorded.

When the medical device or activity is used or applied, the computer system can capture this event by creating a medical object <b>1924</b> record using a medical provider computer system <b>1930</b>. The medical provider or other entity can verify the medical activity by methods including adding a tag <b>1920</b><i>b </i>(T<sub>2</sub>) representing that the proper medical device, medicine, or other object or activity was provided to the proper location. The treatment location computer system can be used to verify that the medical device, medicine, treatment, or other medical activity was properly delivered by retrieving the record <b>1914</b> from the immutable storage system and using the record to match the medical activity.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">A healthcare provider may have ownership of the medical device or medication and therefore the right to transfer the medical device or medication to a second entity. The transaction can be recorded that can include the device ID of the kiosk, tag information of a tag associate with the medical device or medication, exchangeable image file data or other data associated with a photo of the medical device or medication, biometrics of the health care professional, certifier, auditor, patient, pharmacist, or other individual associated with the medical device or medication, location and time certifications of certifier, wallet confirmation, medical device or medication number, hash confirmation, audit information, location over time for the medical device or medication and other information described herein. The system can also store medical device or medication and transactions associated with those in possession of the medical device or medication and those receiving possession and generate transaction history for the entities, jointly or separately that can include the data described herein.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">Using this system, the recipient or other entity can be assured that the medical device or medication was independently verified and authenticated from the creation to the delivery to the patient and that the virtual representation of the medical device or medication and its components (e.g., materials) are paired. Therefore, when purchasing a medical device or medication, the authenticity can be quickly and easily verified at the location of acquisition (e.g., medical facility or pharmacy) by accessing the immutable storage system without the need for a third party or professional authentication process.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">The system described herein can pair the medical device, medication, or container with a virtual representation. Failure to pair the medical device, medication, or container with the virtual representation can negatively impact areas such as authentication, certification, fraud prevention, health, legality, possession, abuse, and the like. Tracking, management, and verification of medical device, medication, or container to ensure authenticity and use and manufacturing is an important aspect to many medical device, medication, or containers. Tracking and record keeping during the life of a medical device, medication, or container from its creation to use can be difficult to perform without the ability to pair the medical device, medication, or container with a virtual representation.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">Systems at multiple locations may be interconnected using image capture devices, RFID, QR codes, barcodes, biometric scanners, still cameras, video cameras, and the like, to identify individuals or machines that are performing verifications during the process. Further, multiple individuals or machines are performing verifications so that there is not a reliance upon any one entity for verifications. The processing of capturing data, including images, from the multiple systems at multiple locations can be used to improve the verification of proper materials and articles as well as to pair the physical items with the virtual representation.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">This process can include internal and external individuals and machines for performing inspections (e.g., verifications). For example, the system can receive a set of internal inspection information entered into the system from an internal inspector representing an internal physical inspection of the medical activity. As an item travels, an internal inspector can provide inspection information representing the stages of the process. The system can also receive a set of external inspection information from an external inspector and an external inspection computer device representing a third-party physical inspection of the process at predetermined stages of the process. Based upon the internal inspection, external inspection or both, an inspection record can be created and stored on the immutable storage system.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, a location marker <b>2000</b> can be used to uniquely identify a treatment and can include a research facility, testing facility, manufacturing facility, health care facility, pharmacy, retail location, distributor, wholesale location, warehouse, medical device, medication, or container location, other physical location or portion thereof. The location marker can be a barcode, RFID, placard, sign, plaque, QR code, or other symbolic, alphanumeric, digital, geofence, or electronic identifier. When creating the location marker, a location marker record <b>2002</b> can be created that includes the location marker identification information, creation date, maker, manufacturing location and other information that can be stored on the immutable storage system. The installed information can retrieve the location marker record and match the retrieved information with the physical location marker to verify that the correct location marker is being installed at <b>2004</b>. The installed can physically install the location marker and using a location enabled device (e.g., GPS enabled, triangulation, wireless positioning system, and the like), read the location marker, and create a location marker installation record <b>2008</b>. The installation can be paired with the physical location marker and the physical location of the project. The metadata from the location enabled device can be included in a location marker installation record that can also include installer information, date, time, location marker information and physical location information, and can be stored on the immutable storage system. Therefore, the physical location marker is verified to be paired with the treatment location and a virtual representation of the location market and treatment location.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">The system can be contained in one or more computer systems and one or more kiosks that are located at treatment locations such as labs, businesses, manufacturing locations, shipping locations, storage locations, dispensary locations, and the like. The kiosk can be in communication with each other or with the immutable ledger. One or more of the records described herein can be included in an audit trail associated with the medical device or medicine. The audit trail can be localized or disparate. The records that can define an audit trail can be localized or disparate.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">Verification of a medical device, medication, treatment, or medical activity with direct information such as capturing the image of the medical activity at a date, time, and location, capturing the individual at a date, time, and location, and any combination. The data captured can be compared with external data such as occupancy information, access control information, shipping records, receipt records, and the like. When the captured data is compared with external data, discrepancies can be detected which can assist in the identification of issues such as fraud, mistakes, and the like. For example, when data about an individual is captured performing a test, the system can correlate the date, time, and location of the test with an access system. If the individual accessed the location where the test occurs, the virtual representation that the individual is at that location can be verified. An image of individuals and article or task can be capture by the system and compared with third-party information such as occupancy, attendance, environment, and other information and if the third-party information is consistent with the transaction information, confidence in the authenticity of the truncation and article increases.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">Third parties can use the system, such as an insurance company, certifier, authentication company, and the like. The medical object record can be stored on the immutable storage system so that the data, event, activity, or item information cannot be subsequently tampered with without detection. The record can include a virtual representation of information associated with the medical device, medication, treatment, or other medical item or activity. In one embodiment, the medical activity can be specified by class, type, product code, product number of other identifying information and virtual representation so that the material requirement record includes the article paired with the virtual representation which is verified by the certifier. This verification is independent of the other verifications described herein.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">The medical object record can include a medical device manufacturing place, warehouse site, shipping information, transaction information or other information showing the life of an article, device, or task. For example, the medical object record can include the manufacturing location, serial number, part number, product number, series number, lot number, date shipped, and date recited at a location. The article or task record can include when the article was used (e.g., during a medical treatment), the location where the article will be used, the location of the task and what the article or task will ultimately be used for.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">When the medical device, medication, or container or component (e.g., article) is selected for transport by the manufacturer or supplier, a shipping company can be sent a shipping order representing the article to be transported. The shipping order can include the verifiably paired virtual representation and its information. The shipping company can be provided shipping information from the manufacturer, designer, supplier, or other company that can facilitate the transaction (e.g., broker, distributor, reseller). The shipping order can be provided directly to the shipping company or can be retrieved from the immutable storage system. Once the shipping company receives the shipping order, it can travel to the desired article location and determine if the article in the shipping order match the medications or container at the desired location. A shipping pickup record can be created representing that the shipping company received the article and that the article picked matches the shipping order. This verification can be independent of the other verifications described herein.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">Once that article is delivered to the desired location, the shipping company can unload the article and verify that the article that was unloaded was the same article included in the shipping order. The shipping company can create a shipping delivery record representing that the article was delivered and that the article matches the shipping order. The shipping record can include the environmental conditions when the article was delivered, delivery notes, and the like. The shipping delivery record can be stored on the immutable storage system. Receiving entity can review the article delivered and verify that the delivered article matches the design, article requirements, supply record, shipping order, shipping pickup record, shipping delivery record, or any combination.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Once the article is received by the desired location, the system can notify individuals that the article is ready for distribution. The individuals can be verified by the system and an individual verification record can be created and stored on the immutable storage system. The system can utilize biometrics or other systems as described herein for verification of actual individuals at the physical location to correspond with requirement for those that can verify that the article is authorized.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">The system can identify individuals including when individuals are entering or leaving a location and store this information on the immutable storage system. The information capture can identify individuals through biometric identification devices such as a camera or other image capture device, facial recognition, voice recognition, retinal scans, fingerprint scanners, hand scanners, and other biometric devices. In one embodiment, the computing logic may allow authorized individuals to manually enter the presence of another authorized individual, including on the controller at the treatment location or through a remote device that can be determined to be at the treatment location, within a boundary associated with the treatment location, in proximity to the system. In one embodiment, individuals may be verified and paired with a virtual representation using two-factor authentication.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">The individual can be provided with user information and specifications or other design requirements that can be represented by a task record. The task record can be stored on the immutable storage system. Once installed, the system can verify that the article was used (which can be individually inspected) according to the task record, create a task verification record and store the task verification record on the immutable storage system. The activity verification record represents that a task associated with the article was performed and can signify that the activity was completed. The activity record can represent that the activity was performed by a proper individual and in compliance with any requirements as well as if the article passes one or more inspections.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Prior to, during and after a task is completed, an inspection can be performed that can include a pre-task inspection, task inspection, post task inspection and any combination. A pre-task inspection, task inspection, and post task inspection record can be created so that the three records can be stored on the immutable storage system. The task record can include information that the inspection resulted in passing, passing with deficiencies, and failing. If the inspection fails, a medical supervisor, or other entity can be given the opportunity to remedy the failure and the inspection process can be performed again. The process can also determine if, while the task passed the inspection, the deficiencies should be remedied.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">The system can be uniquely associated with the treatment location. A location marker can be affixed to the user location and uniquely identify the treatment location. The treatment location can be a research facility, lab, warehouse, shipper, distributor, storage area, health care facility, retail location, mobile or temporary medical facility, and the like. The location marker can be read by the system so that the system can determine its location. Third parties can read the location marker to determine the location. For example, the shipping company can arrive at the manufacturing location, read the location marker, and associate the location marker with the receipt and shipping of an article. In one embodiment, the manufacturer can receive a shipping identifier associated with the delivery, such as a truck, trailer, pallet, or other container so that the article is known to be received at the user location. Other parties can also access the location marker to verify that the third party is at the treatment location.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">The system can be contained in a housing such as a kiosk and can be physically associated with the treatment location. The treatment location can be defined by a boundary representing the perimeter of the treatment location. The system can include a sensor and reader which can be selected from the group consisting of radio frequency identification (RFID) detector, ultra-high frequency (UHF) detector, a bar code scanner, a QR code scanner, near frequency communication (NFC) device; Bluetooth beacons, an optical character recognition (OCR) device, and any combination thereof. An environmental sensor, such as a weather sensor or weather station, can be in communications with the or included in the housing and configured to record the weather and other environmental conditions at the treatment location and at different times during the project. This information can be used to verify the authenticity of the article.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a medical provider can use a computer system that can be present at or transported to a treatment location at <b>2100</b>. The computer system can receive and store medical provider information which can include the date, time, location, and biometric information of the medical provider <b>2102</b>. The computer system can include a location sensor such as a GPS sensor so that the location of the computer device is known, and the location can be associated with data that is received inputted or otherwise gathered from the computer device. Therefore, the location of the computer device can be known as well as the location of the computer device at a certain date and time.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">The computer device can receive medical provider information. This information can be used to determine the identity of the medical provider and location of the medical provider at a certain date and time. This information can be used to create medical provider information that can be recorded on the immutable ledger. This record can be used to verify that the medical provider, who can be identified through biometric information so that verification of the identified is known, was at a certain location at a certain date and time. The medical provider identification can be compared to the computer system information so that a determination can be made the that the medical provider and the computer system were in the same location at a certain date and time. In one embodiment, verification that the computer system and the medical provider were at the same location during a date and time can be determined using a date and time range.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">The computer device can receive patient information at <b>2104</b>. This information can be used to determine the identity of the patient and location of the patient at a certain date and time. This information can be used to create a patient identification information that can be recorded on the immutable ledger. This record can be used to verify that the patient, who can be identified through biometric information so that verification of the identified is known, was at a certain location at a certain date and time. The medical provider identification can be compared to the patient information and computer system information so that a determination can be made the that the medical provider, the patient and the computer system were in the same location at a certain date and time. In one embodiment, verification that the patient and the medical provider were at the same location during a date and time can be determined using a date and time range.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">A medical monitor can be in communication with the computer device and can be adapted to receive medical information about the patient at <b>2106</b>. Information that can be received, measured, inputted, gathered, and the like, can include a vital sign, medical alert, implantable medical information, pumps information, stimulator information, inertial sensor information, physiological information, and any combination thereof. The medical monitor can also record medical treatment, advice, suggestions, application of medical device (e.g., applying a cuff, splint, stent, and any like processes and procedures). The medical monitor and computer system can receive medical information manually such as blood pressure as well as through automated methods such as EEG or others. The computer system and medical monitor can receive input wired, or wirelessly, and can be in communications with such devices as a blood glucose, heart rate, or blood pressure monitor.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">The medical activity that can be recorded can include a medical treatment that can be the application of a service such as physical therapy, assessments, testing, diagnostics, surgery, occupational treatment, or other therapy, and the like. Medical activity can be the gathering and recording of medical information such as physiological information. Medical activity can be the provision of medicine or other medical good. Medical activity can be instructions, strategies, or plans that can be delivered to the patient.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">From the information gathered, the computer system can create a medical encounter record that can be stored on the immutable storage system. Validations can be made from the medical encounter record that can include verification that the medical provider and the patient were at the same location at the same time and that the medical activity was recorded, reducing the risk that incorrect or even fraudulent information is being submitted such as to the medical computer system, insurance system, and reimbursement systems. The computer system can retrieve information about the medical provider and determine if the medical provider is authorized to provide or participate in the medical activity. In certain circumstances, insurance payments and reimbursement for medical services are contingent that the medical providers have certain licenses and authorization. The computer system can generate a warning when a medical activity is performed by a non-licensed and non-authorized medical provider, at a non-authorized location, within or outside a predetermined treatment time, with non-authorized medical device, medicines or items, and the like. Such warning can be provided to the medical provider so that the medical activity can be assigned to another medical provider. Such warning and controls can assist in the reduction or elimination of unapproved medical facilities, medical activities that are not covered by insurance, non-approved medical devices or treatments, medical activity that is not in compliance with applicable policies, regulations, approvals, and the like, as well as otherwise non-approved medical activities.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">When the media encounter record is stored at <b>2110</b>, the computer system and a remote computer system can retrieve the medical encounter record and analyze the medical encounter record for a determination of validity, reimbursement, regulatory compliance, policy and procedure compliance, and other characteristics. The medical provider can be apprised of any discrepancies in the process by the treatment location thereby reducing the amount of time dedicated to correction of any actual or potential issues.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">The medical location can include any location, stationary or mobile, where medical services are provided and can include a testing facility, medical facility, healthcare provider facility, manufacturing facility, distribution facility, pharmacy, residence, assisted living facility, room or location within a facility, inpatient facility or portion thereof, and any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">The medical activity can be assigned a unique medical identification. When the medical activity includes providing medicines and a medical device, the medicine and medical device can include a tag that identifies the medicine or medical device. The tag can be uniquely associated with the medicine or the medical device.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">This computer system and a remote system can determine if the medical provider, medical activity, and patient were at the same location at the same or near same time. Further, capturing biometric information of the individual reduces the misidentification of the medical provider and patient. Mistakes and even fraud are reduced as the verification represents which individual preformed what tasks at what date and time. For example, the computer system can determine its location when patient information is entered. The computer system can then retrieve patient information from a local or remote database and retrieve the home or other location of the patient. If the computer system location and the patient home location do not match, a warning can be generated. This feature can reduce or prevent medical activities from being performed at unauthorized locations, can indicate that the patient information may not be accurate or that a mistake or fraud is occurring. The combinations of identification (including biometric identification) coupled with location, date and time of the individuals and activities can reduce or eliminate mistakes and fraud as well as provide validation and verification that the digital representations accurately reflect the physical, activities, individuals, and objects. In one embodiment, the computer system can track an individual or object from one location to the next. For example, a medical provider can be at a first location with a first patient and subsequently at a second location with a second patient. The distance and travel time between the first location and the second location can be calculated or approximated and compared with the timespan between when the medical provider was at the first location and second location. A determination can then be made concerning the feasibility of the activities of the medical provider. The ability to prove that a medical activity was performed at the first location and the second location with a sufficient timespan can assist with identifying a mistake or fraud. Further, using biometric information, the system allows for the identity of the provider and the patient to be known.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">In one embodiment, the identification device and the medical monitor can determine their own location and can have date and time information which can be compared with the location, date, and time of the computer system to provide a more accurate data set.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">In operation, the medical activity can include a medical procedure, administering a medicine, applying a medical device, providing medical instructions, a medical assessment, a medical validation, and any combination thereof. The medical activity can be the application of a splint (e.g., medical device), administering medications (e.g., providing medicine), provide advice or recommendations (e.g., medical advice), and any combination.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">When data, including the medical encounter record is stored on the immutable storage system, a remote computer system can retrieve the record and preform an analysis on the data. The computer system and the remote computer system can use the medical encounter record and create a medical reimbursement request that can be used to send to a reimbursement agent as the medical encounter record can be used to verify that the medical activity was performed, who performed the activity, who received the activity, where the medical activity was performed and when it was performed using various points of identification, date, time, and location. This information can increase the time between the medical activity and the reimbursement process.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The computer system and the remote system can use the immutable storage system and retrieve multiple records for the provider, patient, activity, location, and the like. When compared, a medical provider can be shown to perform the medical activity within a short time frame or arrival at the treatment location which be used to create and modify a confident score. The confidence score can be a representation for the medical provider that the information associated with the medical provider is accurate. If a medical provider has larger gaps between arrival and the treatment location and the medical activity, the confidence score can be lower.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">The medical provider does not need to be a human. In one embodiment, the medical monitor can be an autonomous medical sensor and artificial intelligence device, such as a telemedicine device, such as within a kiosk. The telemedicine device can include a patient interface, sensors, communications, and storage. When the telemedicine is actuated by the patient, the telemedicine device can capture its locations and the date and time. A human medical provider can be remotely located from the patient and can use the telemedicine device to view medical information and communication with the patient. The human medical provider can access the remote telemedicine device that can capture the identity of the remote medical provider and the date, time, and location of the remote medical provider. The remote medical provider information can be captured and used for storage and verification. For example, the time between the telemedicine sessions can be used to assist in a determination whether a mistake is made or even fraud given that medical activity information can be compared with the remote medical provider information.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Data, including the medical encounter record, can be sent to a medical provider, and can be included in an electronic medical record. The electronic medical record can be provided with a pointer (e.g., a memory location) within an immutable storage system so that the medical information can be stored more securely without multiple copies of the information in multiple databases. The pointer can be removed when access to the immutable storage system is revoked.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">The individuals on the treatment location may be prompted to wear certain wearables, including medically sterilized wearables, that provide useful information to the computer system. For instance, individuals may be prompted to wear location tracking devices, such as GPS devices, Bluetooth, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, ultra-high frequency (UHF) and beacon-based devices. The use of the wearables helps to perform geofencing within the treatment location. The location tracking provided by the wearable helps the system to monitor the location of individuals on the treatment location on an ongoing basis. The permissions may define what portions of the treatment location an individual may access. Ongoing monitoring may indicate that an individual is attempting to enter a location where the individual is not permitted. This may trigger a response as described herein. A signal may be sent to the vest or wearable to trigger a visual or audible cue that the individual is not in a permitted area. In addition, individuals may be requested to wear wearables that track biometric information, such as heart rate, body temperature, respiration rate, and blood pressure. This information may be tracked and stored on an ongoing basis.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">The system may track the movement of articles at the treatment location or to and from the treatment location. Scanning technology such as RFID readers, UHF readers, and the like may be utilized to assist the location tracking of articles and even individuals. The tracking of articles helps reduce the risk of loss, theft, mis-delivery, and the like. For example, the tracking solution may indicate instances of possible theft, such as when the article is leaving the treatment location when the removal of the article is not proper. Tracking can improve the confidence in the authentication of the article.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">The system may allow for the establishment of one or more geofenced zones that can be associated with treatment location and location of the article. These locations can include entrance areas, exit areas, event areas, storage areas, and any combination thereof. These areas could be monitored and established with access allowances or restrictions to control movement of articles, individuals, and equipment to assist with the prevention of loss, mistakes, fraud, theft, inefficiencies, and damage. The system can assist with verification that articles stored at these locations are consistent with the information concerning the article status, locations, state, etc.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">The system, including a controller, may also interface with individuals to allow for the entry of notes and related details of a material, task, inspection, environmental conditions, individual, other task, process of individual, or any combination thereof. For example, the system may allow an inspector to capture images of notes, forms, documents, labels, and the like using various readers, sensors, and input devices. The system can capture the use of the object such as during a medical treatment or application of a medical device.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The system can be adapted to register a medication and drug, medical device, or medical article or object at its point of origin which can include specifications and conformity issues not only for the transportation and handling of the article, but also can confirm with the integrity of manufacturing and transportation, that at the time of dosage or treatment, administration, or use, a set of requirements related to that medical article are met. The system provides for confirmation of delivery to a set physical location (e.g., identifiable location such as with GPS technology). The medical article is then registered to that location. At the time of an event, the system registers the location, date, time, individual, and articles using an immutable block chain or other immutable storage system mechanism, registers the biometrics of the administrator or caregiver, as well as the biometrics of the person receiving the medical article or treatment. The system can immutably store this data associated with an asset record or other unique identifying record. These data points then can be used by the system to autonomously validate processes, payments, or progress points in an overall process. The system can include an auditing capability whereby when these data points are immutably recorded in the asset record, currently by a hash on an immutable block chain, the auditing functionality verifies the hash recorded in the asset record is recorded upon the referenced or corresponding block chain. The auditing component verifies the data recorded at the hash is the same data in the asset record results in a system that can identify anomalies and provide for predictive analysis.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
