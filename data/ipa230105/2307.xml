invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of certain embodiments of the invention and the working examples. In accordance with the purpose(s) of this invention, certain embodiments of the invention are described in the Summary of the Invention and are further described herein below. Also, other embodiments of the invention are described herein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0090">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Further, the ranges stated in this disclosure and the claims are intended to include the entire range specifically and not just the endpoint(s). For example, a range stated to be 0 to 10 is intended to disclose all whole numbers between 0 and 10 such as, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., all fractional numbers between 0 and 10, for example 1.5, 2.3, 4.57, 6.1113, etc., and the endpoints 0 and 10. Also, a range associated with chemical substituent groups such as, for example, &#x201c;C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons,&#x201d; is intended to specifically include and disclose C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons as well as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>4 </sub>hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0091">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0092">As used in the specification and the claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include their plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. References to a composition or process containing or including &#x201c;an&#x201d; ingredient or &#x201c;a&#x201d; step is intended to include other ingredients or other steps, respectively, in addition to the one named.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0093">The terms &#x201c;containing&#x201d; or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; are synonymous with the term &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; and is intended to mean that at least the named compound, element, particle, or method step, etc., is present in the composition or article or method, but does not exclude the presence of other compounds, catalysts, materials, particles, method steps, etc., even if the other such compounds, material, particles, method steps, etc., have the same function as what is named, unless expressly excluded in the claims.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0094">It is also to be understood that the mention of one or more method steps does not preclude the presence of additional method steps before or after the combined recited steps or intervening method steps between those steps expressly identified. Moreover, the lettering of process steps or ingredients is a convenient means for identifying discrete activities or ingredients and the recited lettering can be arranged in any sequence, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0095">The term &#x201c;copolyester,&#x201d; as used herein is understood to mean a synthetic polymer prepared by the reaction of one or more difunctional carboxylic acids and/or multifunctional carboxylic acids with one or more difunctional hydroxyl compounds and/or multifunctional hydroxyl compounds except that residues of at least two or more diacids or at least two or more diols, or a combination thereof, are present in the copolyester. Typically, the difunctional carboxylic acid can be a dicarboxylic acid and the difunctional hydroxyl compound can be a dihydric alcohol such as, for example, glycols. Furthermore, as used in this application, the interchangeable terms &#x201c;diacid&#x201d; or &#x201c;dicarboxylic acid&#x201d; include multifunctional acids, such as branching agents. The term &#x201c;glycol&#x201d; as used in this application includes, but is not limited to, diols, glycols, and/or multifunctional hydroxyl compounds. Alternatively, the difunctional carboxylic acid may be a hydroxy carboxylic acid such as, for example, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and the difunctional hydroxyl compound may be an aromatic nucleus bearing 2 hydroxyl substituents such as, for example, hydroquinone. The term &#x201c;residue,&#x201d; as used herein, means any organic structure incorporated into a polymer through a polycondensation and/or an esterification reaction from the corresponding monomer. The term &#x201c;repeating unit,&#x201d; as used herein, means an organic structure having a dicarboxylic acid residue and a diol residue bonded through an ester group. Thus, for example, the dicarboxylic acid residues may be derived from a dicarboxylic acid monomer or its associated acid halides, esters, half-esters, salts, half-salts, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, or mixtures thereof, useful in a reaction process with a diol to make polyester. As used herein, the term &#x201c;terephthalic acid&#x201d; is intended to include terephthalic acid itself and residues thereof as well as any derivative of terephthalic acid, including its associated acid halides, esters, half-esters, salts, half-salts, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, or mixtures thereof or residues thereof useful in a reaction process with a diol to make polyester. The term &#x201c;modifying aromatic diacid&#x201d; means an aromatic dicarboxylic acid other the terephthalic acid. The term &#x201c;modifying glycol&#x201d; means a glycol other than 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. In one embodiment, terephthalic acid may be used as the starting material. In another embodiment, dimethyl terephthalate may be used as the starting material. In another embodiment, mixtures of terephthalic acid and dimethyl terephthalate may be used as the starting material and/or as an intermediate material. For the purposes of this invention, polyesterethers are included within the definition of polyesters within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0096">The copolyesters of the present invention can be readily prepared by methods well known in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,012,267, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. More particularly, the reactions for preparing the copolyesters can be carried out at temperatures of about 150&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. in the presence of polycondensation catalysts such as titanium tetrachloride, manganese diacetate, antimony oxide, dibutyl tin diacetate, zinc chloride, or combinations thereof. The catalysts are typically employed in amounts of 10 to 1000 ppm, based on total weight of the reactants.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0097">A long list of pre-polymerization precursors have been prepared which are expected to assist in facilitating the preparation of copolyesters with a high alternating character. Given the ease of preparation of the examples described herein, it is believed that this synthetic approach could be further extended to an even larger variety of pre-polymerization monomer compounds (including monomers of greater chain length and complexity) which are included within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0098">In one embodiment, the pentamers of the invention can comprise at least one of the following structures:</p><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-C00013" he="16.51mm" wi="73.15mm" file="US20230002308A1-20230105-C00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0113" num="0099">wherein R and R&#x2033; represent residues of at least one diol;</p><p id="p-0114" num="0100">wherein R and R&#x2033; are not the same; and</p><p id="p-0115" num="0101">wherein R&#x2032; comprises residues of at least one diacid or diester.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0102">In one embodiment, the pentamers of the invention can comprise one or more diols selected from residues of 2,2,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutane-1,3-diol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, hydroxypivalyl hydroxypivalate, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, isosorbide, 1,6-hexanediol, 3-methyl-pentanediol, 2-methylpentanediol, 2,2,4-tri-methylpentane-diol, 2-ethylhexanediol, 2,2-diethylpropanediol, 1,4-di-(hydroxyethoxy)-benzene, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclobutane, 2,2-bis-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane, or 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)-propane.
