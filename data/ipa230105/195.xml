Some players use only a chin strap, others use only a face protector, and others use both a chin strap and a face protector. Some players use neither a chin strap nor a face protector.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical batting helmets include male snap elements mounted to the helmet shell to receive female snap elements on a chin strap, so that the chin strap may be snapped onto the batting helmet. This conventional snap-connection requires several components (such as the snaps and hardware to hold the snaps to the helmet) that add to the weight, cost, and manufacturing complexity of the helmet. The male snap elements are also somewhat unsightly, especially when a chin strap is not attached to the helmet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical face protector is fastened to the exterior of a batting helmet using four to six bolts. Such a conventional connection adds to the weight, cost, and manufacturing complexity of the helmet. It also complicates installation and removal of the face protector.

The helmet shell <b>100</b> (which may be referenced as a &#x201c;shell&#x201d; herein) includes a crown region <b>105</b> positioned to cover the top of a user's head, a front (forehead) region <b>110</b> (which may optionally include a visor <b>115</b>) positioned to cover an anterior portion of a user's head, a rear region <b>120</b> positioned to cover a posterior portion of a user's head, a first side region <b>125</b> positioned to cover a lateral portion of a user's head, and a second side region <b>130</b> positioned opposite the first side region <b>125</b> to cover another lateral portion of a user's head. The first side region <b>125</b> may include a first lateral flap <b>135</b> and the second side region <b>130</b> may include a second lateral flap <b>140</b>. Each of the side regions <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> includes an opening <b>145</b>, which may optionally form a vent hole for sound or air to reach a user's ear from outside the shell <b>100</b>. Each opening <b>145</b> may be positioned in one of the lateral flaps <b>135</b>, <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first side region <b>125</b> and the first lateral flap <b>135</b> include an inner surface <b>150</b> facing an interior region <b>155</b> of the shell <b>100</b>. The second side region <b>130</b> and the second lateral flap <b>140</b> also include an inner surface <b>160</b> facing the interior region <b>155</b> of the shell <b>100</b>. The interior region <b>155</b> receives the user's head. The first side region <b>125</b> and the first lateral flap <b>135</b> further include an outer surface <b>165</b> facing away from the shell <b>100</b>. Likewise, the second side region <b>130</b> and the second lateral flap <b>140</b> include an outer surface <b>170</b> facing away from the shell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inner surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> of the lateral flaps <b>135</b>, <b>140</b> may include sockets for receiving clip elements or portions of a face protector, as described in additional detail below. Specifically, the inner surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> of the lateral flaps <b>135</b>, <b>140</b> may include first sockets <b>175</b> positioned to receive clip elements for holding a chin strap. Only one such first socket <b>175</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, on the first lateral flap <b>135</b>. The other first socket <b>175</b> may be similar and may be symmetrically positioned and oriented on the second lateral flap <b>140</b>. The inner surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> of the lateral flaps <b>135</b>, <b>140</b> may additionally or alternatively include second sockets <b>180</b> positioned to receive plate elements of a face protector. Only one such second socket <b>180</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, on the first lateral flap <b>135</b>. The other second socket <b>180</b> may be similar and may be symmetrically positioned and oriented on the second lateral flap <b>140</b>. Helmet shells configured in accordance with some embodiments of the present technology may not include a first lateral flap <b>135</b> or a second lateral flap <b>140</b>, or they may not include any lateral flaps <b>135</b>, <b>140</b>. In such embodiments, other areas of the inner surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> of the side regions <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> may include the sockets <b>175</b>, <b>180</b> (for example, the sockets <b>175</b>, <b>180</b> may be positioned closer to the crown region <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the sockets <b>175</b>, <b>180</b> may be formed as a recess in the shell <b>100</b> extending away from the interior region <b>155</b> of the shell <b>100</b>. For example, the helmet shell <b>100</b> may be molded to include these recesses. In some embodiments, the recesses may be formed by projecting or extruding bordering material inwardly from the helmet shell <b>100</b> toward the interior region <b>155</b>. For example, a wall or boundary of material may define the recesses forming the sockets <b>175</b>, <b>180</b>. In further embodiments, one or more of the recesses may be included in a discrete element affixed to the helmet shell <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the first sockets <b>175</b> can include a rounded or circular shape configured to correspond to a portion of a clip element, as described in additional detail below. In some embodiments, the second sockets <b>180</b> may have a non-circular shape to limit (for example, prevent or at least substantially prevent) rotation of the plate elements of a face protector relative to the shell <b>100</b>, as described in additional detail below. For example, in some embodiments, the second sockets <b>180</b> may have a polygonal shape, such as a rectangular shape, a triangular shape, or another shape suitable for limiting rotation of the plate elements of a face protector relative to the shell <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, each of the second sockets <b>180</b> may include a cavity <b>185</b> for receiving a boss on the plate elements, as described in additional detail below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, the shell <b>100</b> may be configured to cover most or all of a player's head, with the exception of the player's face, which may generally be exposed or partially covered with a face protector or a chin strap. The helmet shell <b>100</b> facilitates attaching a face protector or a chin strap to the helmet shell <b>100</b> using features (such as the sockets <b>175</b>, <b>180</b>) that are generally concealed within the interior region <b>155</b> of the shell <b>100</b>. Accordingly, when a face protector or a chin strap is not used, the helmet shell <b>100</b> has a cleaner exterior appearance with less weight than conventional helmets.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Chin-Strap Clips</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate a first perspective view, a second perspective view, and a side perspective view, respectively, of a clip element <b>200</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. The clip element <b>200</b> is configured to engage either one of the side regions <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> (see above regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, a clip element <b>200</b> may engage the first socket <b>175</b> in the first lateral flap <b>135</b> or the first socket <b>175</b> in the second lateral flap <b>140</b>. The clip element <b>200</b> is also configured to retain a portion of a chin strap, as explained in additional detail below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the clip element <b>200</b> includes a base portion <b>205</b>, a hook portion <b>210</b> extending from the base portion <b>205</b>, and an engagement element <b>215</b> on the hook portion <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the engagement element <b>215</b> may be a projection positioned on an end <b>220</b> of the hook portion <b>210</b>. The engagement element <b>215</b> may extend from the end <b>220</b> of the hook portion <b>210</b> toward the base portion <b>205</b>. The engagement element <b>215</b> may have a generally cylindrical shape corresponding to a generally cylindrical shape of a portion of one of the first sockets <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, the engagement element <b>215</b> and the corresponding first socket <b>175</b> may have other corresponding shapes. In some embodiments, the engagement element <b>215</b> may include a surface feature <b>217</b> (such as a hemispherical surface feature) configured to engage a corresponding indentation in the first socket <b>175</b> (for example, an indentation <b>176</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The base portion <b>205</b> includes a strap retainer <b>225</b>. The strap retainer <b>225</b> is configured to hold a portion of a chin strap. In some embodiments, the strap retainer <b>225</b> is a strap adjuster such as a ladder-lock buckle (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, sometimes called a ladder adjuster), a D-ring, an adjustable clamp device, or another device suitable for adjustably retaining a portion of a chin strap. In some embodiments, the strap retainer <b>225</b> is a strap adjuster with one or more teeth <b>230</b> or similar elements for gripping the portion of the chin strap.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a portion of a batting helmet system <b>300</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. Two clip elements <b>200</b> are attached to the shell <b>100</b> (one on each side region <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>). Each engagement element <b>215</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C</figref>) is engaged with a side region <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> (for example, positioned in a first socket <b>175</b>). Each hook portion <b>210</b> extends through an ear vent or other opening <b>145</b> in a respective side region <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> of the shell <b>100</b>. The base portion <b>205</b> of the clip element <b>200</b> is positioned outside of the shell <b>100</b>, where it can receive and adjustably retain a portion of a chin strap.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, each clip element <b>200</b> is installed in the batting helmet system <b>300</b> by snapping the engagement element <b>215</b> into a socket <b>175</b> in a side region <b>125</b>, <b>130</b> (for example, in a lateral flap <b>135</b>, <b>140</b>). Such snapping is facilitated by the relative shape and sizes of the engagement element <b>215</b> and the socket <b>175</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the rounded shape of the engagement element <b>215</b> must be forced (snapped) into the socket <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, each clip element <b>200</b> may be rotated about the engagement element <b>215</b> along a rotational path <b>305</b> that sweeps across the outer surface <b>170</b> to facilitate positioning of the base portion <b>205</b> (and therefore, a chin strap, such as the chin strap <b>605</b> described below) according to a user's preferences (for example, according to a user's preferred position of a chin strap). In some embodiments, the rotational path <b>305</b> includes rotation of approximately fifteen degrees relative to the shell <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, rotating the clip element <b>200</b> upwards (toward the crown region) beyond the extent of the rotational path <b>305</b> facilitates disengagement and removal (unclipping) of the clip element <b>200</b> from the helmet shell <b>100</b>.

The boss <b>425</b> may be positioned to extend into a corresponding cavity <b>185</b> in a socket <b>180</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a portion of a batting helmet system <b>500</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. The batting helmet system <b>500</b> may include the face protector <b>400</b>. The plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> may be positioned in the second sockets <b>180</b> in a manner that limits (for example, prevents or at least substantially prevents) rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b>. For example, one or both of the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b>, or one or both of the second sockets <b>180</b> (see also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), may be shaped to limit (for example, prevent) rotation of the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b> when the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> are positioned in the second sockets <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> may have shapes that are keyed to the corresponding shapes of the second sockets <b>180</b> in a manner that limits rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Positioning a plate element <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> in the second socket <b>180</b> holds the face protector <b>400</b> in the shell <b>100</b> while limiting (for example, preventing) rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b>, which improves safety during impacts against the face protector <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> and the second sockets <b>180</b> may include non-circular shapes, such as corresponding polygonal shapes. With reference to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in particular embodiments, one or both plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> may each include a first rectangular portion <b>430</b> (which itself may include the boss <b>425</b>) adjacent to the anterior portion <b>423</b>, and a second rectangular portion <b>435</b> projecting from (cantilevered from) the first rectangular portion <b>430</b> (for example, projecting in a generally posterior direction). Accordingly, one or both of the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> may have an L-shape as generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. The second sockets <b>180</b> may have corresponding shapes (such as a first rectangular portion and a second rectangular portion extending therefrom) to receive the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b>. The single second rectangular portion <b>435</b> cantilevered from each plate element <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> provides resistance against forces leveraged upon the anterior portion <b>423</b>. Generally, embodiments of the present technology include plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> and second sockets <b>180</b> that have corresponding geometries to limit (for example, prevent) rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b>. Preferably, the plate elements and second sockets are sized to have a relatively tight fit with tight tolerances to further limit relative rotation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The batting helmet system <b>500</b> may include a fastener <b>505</b> to attach the plate element <b>405</b> to the first lateral flap <b>135</b> (or generally to the shell <b>100</b>, if the shell <b>100</b> does not include a lateral flap). With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fastener <b>505</b> may pass through the boss <b>425</b> to engage the shell <b>100</b> (which may optionally include an embedded threaded element for receiving the fastener <b>505</b>). The batting helmet system <b>500</b> may include an additional fastener <b>505</b> to attach the other plate element <b>415</b> to the shell <b>100</b> in a similar manner. In some embodiments, one or both of the fasteners <b>505</b> may be a releasable fastener (such as a threaded bolt or screw, or a clip configured to clip to an element in the shell <b>100</b>) or, in other embodiments, fasteners <b>505</b> may be omitted and an adhesive or other attachment device may be used to attach the plate elements <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> to the shell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the face protector <b>400</b> may be affixed to the shell <b>100</b> using only two fasteners or other attachment devices, while still limiting rotation relative to the shell <b>100</b> as a result of the corresponding shapes of the plates <b>405</b>, <b>415</b> and the second sockets <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the fasteners or other attachment devices may contribute to resisting rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> (for example, by increasing friction between connected elements).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0000">Batting Helmet Systems with Chin-Strap Clips and Face Protectors</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a batting helmet system <b>600</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. In some embodiments, the batting helmet system <b>600</b> may include both a face protector <b>400</b> and one or more clip elements <b>200</b>. The batting helmet system <b>600</b> may further include a chin strap <b>605</b> retained on the batting helmet system <b>600</b> with the strap retainer <b>225</b>, which may be adjustable to customize tension in the chin strap <b>605</b>. For example, the chin strap <b>605</b> may include a first strap portion <b>610</b> held in one of the clip elements <b>200</b> (in the strap retainer <b>225</b>), and a second strap portion <b>615</b> held in another one of the clip elements <b>200</b>. Each end of the chin strap <b>605</b> may be held in a strap retainer <b>225</b> so that the chin strap <b>605</b> spans across a user's face for positioning an optional cup portion <b>620</b> of the chin strap <b>605</b> on a user's chin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The shell <b>100</b> of batting helmet systems configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology (such as the batting helmet systems <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> described above) may include a rigid or semi-rigid shell. In some embodiments, batting helmet systems may be partially or fully lined with a shock-absorbing material <b>625</b>. Those skilled in the art understand suitable shock-absorbing materials <b>625</b>, which may include foam, gel, fabric, or other various forms of padding, liner(s), or other shock-absorbing material suitable for absorbing impact forces received by the shell <b>100</b>. Comfort padding, or other comfort-providing material, may also be included inside the shell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Clip elements <b>200</b> and helmet systems configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology facilitate attachment of a chin strap <b>605</b> to a helmet shell <b>100</b> without the need for additional hardware permanently mounted on the helmet shell <b>100</b>. Accordingly, embodiments of the present technology facilitate reduction of (a) weight of a batting helmet system, (b) parts of a batting helmet system, or (c) cost of a batting helmet system, while also providing a more aesthetically pleasing appearance when a user does not use a chin strap (a user may remove the clip elements, in contrast with typical helmets that include permanent button snap elements). Clip elements <b>200</b> are also easier to operate while a helmet system is on a user's head than traditional connections between chin straps and helmet shells.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Helmet systems and face protectors configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology provide several other advantages. For example, because the present technology provides a batting helmet system (such as the batting helmet systems <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> described above) that includes a face protector <b>400</b> attached to the interior of the shell <b>100</b>, the exterior of the shell <b>100</b> need not include unattractive exterior mounting features for the face protector <b>400</b>. Embodiments of the present technology use less hardware than typical batting helmets, which reduces weight, cost, and complexity of manufacturing. Embodiments of the present technology limit rotation of the face protector <b>400</b> relative to the shell <b>100</b>, which increases safety.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the disclosed technology have been described for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the technology, and elements of certain embodiments may be interchanged with those of other embodiments, and that some embodiments may omit some elements. For example, although clip elements <b>200</b> are described and illustrated as being implemented on both sides of a helmet, in some embodiments, a clip element <b>200</b> may be used on one side of a helmet but not the other (the other side of the helmet may use an alternative suitable connection between the chin strap and the helmet). Similarly, a face protector configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology may exclude one of the plate elements on a side of the face protector, instead connecting to the shell in another manner on that side of the face protector.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In some embodiments, a helmet system may include only a face protector <b>400</b> and it may omit clip elements. In some embodiments, a helmet system may omit a face protector and it may include one or more clip elements <b>200</b>. Accordingly, various combinations of clip elements, plate elements, face protectors, and chin straps are contemplated by the various embodiments of the present technology. For example, some helmets may include only one lateral flap for accommodating aspects of the present technology. Correspondingly, shells configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology may omit one or more of the sockets for receiving clip elements or plate elements.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Although shells are described as including a crown region, a front region, a rear region, side regions, and lateral flaps, embodiments of the present technology may be implemented in shells that omit one or more of these elements. Embodiments of the present technology need not include a helmet shell. For example, embodiments of the present technology may include clip elements, face protectors and other components as independent devices.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Further, while advantages associated with certain embodiments of the disclosed technology have been described in the context of those embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the technology. Accordingly, the disclosure and associated technology may encompass other embodiments not expressly shown or described herein, and the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Numerical adjectives including &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second,&#x201d; as used in the foregoing description, do not convey hierarchy or specific features or functions. Rather, such numerical adjectives are intended to aid the reader in distinguishing between elements which may have similar nomenclature (for example, &#x201c;sockets&#x201d; or &#x201c;side regions&#x201d;), but which may differ in position, orientation, or structure. Accordingly, such numerical adjectives may be used differently in the claims than in the foregoing description.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
