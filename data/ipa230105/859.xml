BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Migraine is a very common, often debilitating, form of headache. Typically the headache is unilateral (affecting one half of the head) and pulsating in nature. In addition to head pain, associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, (increased sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (increased sensitivity to sound). Migraines can also be associated with &#x201c;auras,&#x201d; which are transient visual, sensory, language, or motor disturbances often manifest as flashes of colored or blinking lights that occur shortly before the onset of head pain.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Symptomatic treatment of migraine generally involves administration of triptans, such as sumatriptan or zolmitriptan, or ergot alkaloids, such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. While various routes of administration of these drugs for the treatment of migraine have been utilized, there still exists a need for easily administrable, fast-acting drug formulations and treatments for the amelioration of migraine symptoms.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">3.

When compared with the FDA approved Migranal intranasal DHE formulation, the IN DHE powder formulations presented herein produce higher C<sub>max </sub>values and shorter T<sub>max </sub>values. Additionally, the exposure within the first 30 minutes post-administration is improved with the IN DHE powder formulations. The improvement in these PK parameters is particularly important in the treatment of migraine. Since DHE is generally administered to relieve an already occurring migraine, a faster onset and greater exposure to the drug in a short period of time is an optimal pharmacokinetic profile. Lastly, the plasma exposure to the drug is even further improved by adding caffeine to the IN DHE powder formulation and/or splitting the dose between two nostrils. These improvements in PK allow for administration of a lower dose of DHE to achieve therapeutically effective plasma levels.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">6.3 Example 3</heading><heading id="h-0016" level="1">A Randomized, Open-Label, 5-Way Crossover Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Dose proportionality, Safety, and Tolerability of Single Doses of Dihydroergotamine 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 m<sub>2 </sub>Intranasal Powder and Assess the Relative Bioavailability to Dihydroergotamine 1 mg Administered Subcutaneously as a Solution in Healthy Volunteers</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0161">The study described herein is designed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, dose-proportionality, safety and tolerability of DHE intranasal powder 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 3 mg in young healthy subjects and compare its bioavailability with DHE 1 mg administered subcutaneously as a solution.

Patients are instructed to use the product when they have an active migraine headache. Specifically, prior to use, patients are instructed to blow their nose gently to help open the nasal passages. If the entire dose is to be delivered in a single nostril, the patient is instructed to select the nostril with the better airflow. Some physicians may consider using the DHE nasal powder in their office or in a medical setting. The total amount of DHE in a single dose ranges from about 0.1 to 10 mg. Typically, a patient receives a dose of about 1.0 to 2.0 mg. DHE nasal powder with or without caffeine may be administered to the patient.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0305">DHE Nasal Powder Presentation. The DHE nasal powder formulation is delivered using a dispenser. The dispenser primarily consists of a squeeze bottle with a nozzle approximately half an inch long. The squeeze bottle functions as a pump and the nozzle, which normally holds the powder at its base, also targets and guides the delivery of the powder into the nostril. The squeeze bottle can be configured as a disposable single-unit dose delivery system or a multiple dose delivery. It can also be configured to be refilled with the powder once the pre-filled dispenser is fully used. The dispenser containing the formulation can also be configured to deliver each dose in a single or a double puff without priming. The powder from the dispenser can be administered in either nostril or both nostrils.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0306">Exclusions. Patients are instructed not to use the product to prevent a headache if they have no prodromal symptoms of migraine such as changes in mental state including irritability or confusion, and physical signs including thirst or diarrhea. Any migraine patient who is pregnant or nursing, has any cardiovascular diseases, or taking anti-HIV medications, or taking macrolide antibiotic such as troleandomycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin is instructed not to use the DHE nasal powder formulation. Similarly, migraine patients taking triptans are instructed not to use the DHE nasal powder and conversely, patients using the DHE nasal powder are instructed not to simultaneously use triptans for the treatment of migraine.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0307">Incorporation by Reference</p><p id="p-0214" num="0308">Various references such as patents, patent applications, and publications are cited herein, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
