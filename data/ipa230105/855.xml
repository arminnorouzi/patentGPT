Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular is associated with recurrent mutations in an array of genes such as FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, and others (Tyner et al., 2018). Due to the nature of leukemogenesis, AML is polyclonal and heterogeneous, with distinct subpopulations of cells expressing different combinations of genetic mutations. After treatment with chemotherapeutic or targeted agents, or a combination of these, a patient may achieve morphological complete remission but still retain a small percentage of cells with persistent leukemia-related mutations. This is known as measurable residual disease or MRD (Ding et al., 2012). Patients with MRD, though in morphological remission, may benefit from long-term treatment administration to prevent disease relapse. This type of treatment administration is often referred to as maintenance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are associated with high risk of relapse and poor prognosis. It is also one of the more common genetic alterations in AML, occurring in approximately 20-30% of cases (Daver, Schlenk, Russell, &#x26; Levis, 2019). Mutations in FLT3 are also associated with other proliferative disorders. The frequency and prognostic value of mutations in this gene have made FLT3 a highly attractive drug target in proliferative disorders, especially hematologic malignances such as AML. Agents targeting this protein have recently been approved or are currently in development. One such agent currently in development is crenolanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity against FLT3 mutations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the impact of FLT3 mutations on patient prognosis, persistence these mutations in MRD are of special concern. Traditional methods of monitoring measurable residual disease are limited by their inability to detect mutations in very small numbers of cells, or dependent on changes in the expression pattern of cell markers which may not be reliable over time or between institutions (Ommen, 2016). Therefore, what is needed is a method with improved sensitivity to detect recurrent genetic mutations that are associated with increased risk of relapse, allowing physicians to choose more appropriate methods or treatments and to remove or reduce measurable residual disease thereby maintaining disease remission.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention includes a method of treating a subject with a proliferative disorder comprising a wild type FLT3 with or without one or more co-occurring FLT3 mutations, the method comprising of administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of crenolanib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with at least one of an alkylating agent, an antimetabolite, a natural product or a combination thereof.

In one example, the invention provides methods for preventing a cell proliferative disorder related to FLT3, comprising administration of a prophylactically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention in a subject. Administration of said prophylactic agent can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the FLT3 driven cell proliferative disorder, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;mutant FLT3&#x201d;, &#x201c;disorder related to FLT3,&#x201d; or &#x201c;disorders related to FLT3 receptor,&#x201d; or &#x201c;disorders related to FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase,&#x201d; or &#x201c;FLT3 driven cell proliferative disorder&#x201d; refers to diseases associated with or implicating FLT3 activity, for example, mutations leading to constitutive activation of FLT3. Examples of &#x201c;disorders related to FLT3&#x201d; include disorders resulting from over stimulation of FLT3 due to mutations in FLT3, or disorders resulting from abnormally high amount of FLT3 activity due to abnormally high amount of mutations in FLT3.

In addition to a pre-existing FLT3 mutation, the additional genetic mutations disclosed herein significantly decrease the prognosis of the patient. A poor prognosis can refer to any negative clinical outcome, such as, but not limited to, a decrease in likelihood of survival (such as overall survival, relapse-free survival, or metastasis-free survival), a decrease in the time of survival (e.g., less than 5 years, or less than one year), presence of a malignant tumor, an increase in the severity of disease, a decrease in response to therapy, an increase in tumor recurrence, an increase in metastasis, or the like. In particular examples, a poor prognosis is a decreased chance of survival (for example, a survival time of equal to or less than 60 months, such as 50 months, 40 months, 30 months, 20 months, 12 months, 6 months or 3 months from time of diagnosis or first treatment).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">In one aspect of the invention pertains to single cell sequencing analysis of recurrent AML genetic mutations that is performed using the TAPESTRI&#x2122; platform.

Cells are then lysed and loaded back onto the TAPESTRI&#x2122; platform, where each single nucleus is encapsulated with a unique DNA based barcode linked to acrylamide-based beads and PCR master mix and primer sets against recurrent AML mutant genes in an oil droplet. These droplets are directly deposited in PCR tubes and exposed to UV light to release the barcodes. Subsequently the barcoded genomic DNA within the droplets can be amplified according to standard PCR amplification techniques. In this same aspect the PCR products are then isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and then libraries prepared for next-generation sequencing compatible with Illumina platforms (including MiSeq, HiSeq, and NovaSeq), followed by sequencing said libraries on one of the validated Illumina platforms (including MiSeq, HiSeq, and NovaSeq).

This is a case of a particularly high-risk patient, having multiple FLT3 mutations associated with poor prognosis, having co-occurrence of NPM1-FLT3<sup>ITD</sup>-DNMT3A mutations is also associated with a poor prognosis (Papaemmanuil et al., 2016). Furthermore, monocytic differentiation has been associated with CD163 overexpression, which has been retrospectively seen in the diagnostic bone marrow sample from this patient, and is also associated with poor prognosis (van Galen et al., 2019). To treat this patient's disease and overcome the FLT3 mutations, this patient was provided oral crenolanib besylate in combination with standard chemotherapy on a clinical trial for newly diagnosed AML patients with activating FLT3 mutations. The patient was treated with induction chemotherapy, comprised of seven days of cytarabine and three days of daunorubicin, followed by 100 mg of crenolanib besylate three times daily starting on day 10 of treatment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">A bone marrow biopsy taken on day 35 of treatment revealed the patient's bone marrow blasts had been reduced to less than 5% and the patient was determined to have achieved morphologic complete remission in response to crenolanib with combination therapy. In an effort to maintain remission, the patient was then administered four cycles of high dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy. In each cycle, the patient received cytarabine chemotherapy at standard doses, followed by oral crenolanib besylate at 100 mg three times daily starting 48 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and continuing until 72 hours before the start of the next cycle of chemotherapy. A bone marrow sample taken on day 237 of treatment, after completing consolidation chemotherapy, confirmed that the patient remained in morphologic remission. Due to the aggressive nature of FLT3 mutated AML, the patient continued to receive single agent crenolanib besylate therapy at 100 mg three times daily for 12 months, known as maintenance. Bone marrow samples were obtained sequentially throughout maintenance to monitor the patient's disease and confirm the patient remained in remission.

After induction chemotherapy, many of the clonal populations have been cleared. Finally, after maintenance therapy, only wildtype cells, and clones bearing only the DNMT3A-R882C mutation remain.
