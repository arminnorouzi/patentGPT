The semiconductor device package <b>1</b> includes a main substrate <b>10</b>, at least one thin film transistor (TFT) module <b>12</b>, a component mounting region <b>14</b> (including, for example, at least one first electronic component (such as a plurality of first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>)), a display device (including, for example, an upper substrate <b>130</b>, a plurality of light emitting devices <b>140</b> and a protection layer <b>150</b>), at least one encapsulant <b>230</b> and at least one conductive via (including, for example, a plurality of conductive vias <b>16</b>). In some embodiments, the TFT module <b>12</b> is disposed on one side of the component mounting region <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the semiconductor device package <b>1</b> can be used or implemented in a bendable or flexible electronic component (e.g., an electronic watch, an electronic band or the like).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The main substrate <b>10</b> may include, for example, a printed circuit board, such as a paper-based copper foil laminate, a composite copper foil laminate, or a polymer-impregnated glass-fiber-based copper foil laminate. The main substrate <b>10</b> may include an interconnection structure, such as a redistribution layer (RDL) or a grounding element. For example, the main substrate <b>10</b> may include a plurality of interconnection vias <b>103</b> that tapers downward. The main substrate <b>10</b> has a first surface <b>101</b> and a second surface <b>102</b> opposite to the first surface <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The TFT module <b>12</b> is disposed adjacent to and electrically connected to the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the TFT module <b>12</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b>, and may be formed by optical lithography process. In some embodiments, the TFT module <b>12</b> may be or include a driving circuit electrically connected to the light emitting devices <b>140</b>. For example, the driving circuit is configured to send a driving current (or voltage) to the light emitting devices <b>140</b>, and the light emitting devices <b>140</b> are driven by the driving current to emit light with a luminance that corresponds to a magnitude of the driving current. Various kinds of circuits can serve as the driving circuit for driving the light emitting devices <b>140</b>. For example, the driving circuit may include a plurality of transistors <b>120</b> and at least one storage capacitor. For example, the driving circuit can include a drive configuration indicated as a 5T/1C type, a 4T/1C type, a 3T/1C type, a 2T/1C type or the like, where T represents a transistor and C represents a storage capacitor.

The insulation layer <b>115</b> contacts the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the structure of the transistor <b>120</b> of the driving circuit can be changed or adjusted depending on different design specifications. For example, the semiconductor channel <b>123</b> may be a two layered structure, and the transistor <b>120</b> may include further a passivation layer covering the drain <b>124</b>, the source <b>125</b>, the exposed portion of the semiconductor channel <b>123</b> and the insulation layer <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transistor <b>120</b> of the TFT module <b>12</b> may be electrically connected to the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b> through a first inner via <b>116</b><i>a</i>, a second inner via <b>116</b><i>b </i>and a third inner via <b>116</b><i>c</i>. The first inner via <b>116</b><i>a</i>, the second inner via <b>116</b><i>b </i>and the third inner via <b>116</b><i>c </i>extend through the insulation layer <b>115</b> and are electrically connected to the gate <b>121</b>, the drain <b>124</b> and the source <b>125</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> are disposed adjacent to and electrically connected to the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b>.

Thus, the first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and the TFT module <b>12</b> are disposed side by side. That is, a lateral side surface of the first electronic component <b>220</b> faces a lateral side surface of the TFT module <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> may be or include an active component, a passive component and/or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments, the electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> may be electrically connected to the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b> through, for example, a connecting material <b>11</b> such as a solder ball.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The encapsulant <b>230</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>101</b> of the main substrate <b>10</b> and covers the TFT module <b>12</b> and the first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> concurrently. In some embodiments, the encapsulant <b>230</b> may be a molding compound including an epoxy resin with or without fillers dispersed therein. The encapsulant <b>230</b> may define a plurality of through holes <b>233</b> extending through the encapsulant <b>230</b> to expose a portion of the source <b>125</b> of the transistor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each of the conductive vias <b>16</b> is disposed in a respective one of the through holes <b>233</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the conductive vias <b>16</b> is a solid metal structure. Since the through holes <b>233</b> may be formed by exposure and development or laser drilling, they may taper downward. Thus, the conductive vias <b>16</b> that are formed by filling the through holes <b>233</b> with a metal material may also taper downward. In addition, the conductive vias <b>16</b> may extend through the encapsulant <b>230</b> and contact and electrically connect the source <b>125</b> of the transistor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The upper substrate <b>130</b> is disposed on the encapsulant <b>230</b>. The upper substrate <b>130</b> may include, for example, a printed circuit board, such as a paper-based copper foil laminate, a composite copper foil laminate, or a polymer-impregnated glass-fiber-based copper foil laminate. The upper substrate <b>130</b> may include an interconnection structure (such as a circuit layer <b>13</b>, an upper via <b>131</b> and a RDL <b>132</b>) or a grounding element. The upper substrate <b>130</b> defines a plurality of cavities <b>130</b><i>c </i>to accommodate the light emitting devices <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, a depth of the cavity <b>130</b><i>c </i>can be larger, equal to or less than the thickness of the light emitting device <b>140</b> depending on different design specifications. In some embodiments, the cavities <b>130</b><i>c </i>may be omitted, and the light emitting devices <b>140</b> may be disposed on the top surface of the upper substrate <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the upper substrate <b>130</b> may extend to the entire top surface of the encapsulant <b>230</b>. That is, some light emitting devices <b>140</b> may be disposed in the component mounting region <b>14</b>, so as to be disposed right above the first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each of the light emitting devices <b>140</b> is disposed within a respective one of the cavities <b>130</b><i>c </i>of the upper substrate <b>130</b>.

Further, the upper substrate <b>130</b> can protect the first electronic components <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> from being impacted by external force; thus, the thickness of the encapsulant <b>230</b> can be reduced, and the total thickness of the semiconductor device package <b>1</b> can be reduced accordingly. In addition, the upper substrate <b>130</b> may extend to the entire top surface of the encapsulant <b>230</b>; thus, the area of the display device is increased.
