Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a multifunctional air pollution reduction device that can be used for tools such as dental handpieces, ultrasonic dental scalars, ultrasonic dental scaling tips, electrosurgical pencils and/or polishing tools.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When using a tool to process a material, air pollution often occurs, and the user may inhale air pollutants which can cause cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. In addition, noise is often generated during an operating of the tool; the noise may lead to hearing loss. Finally, vibration may also occur when using the tool, causing diseases such as Hand-Ann Vibration Syndrome (HAVS).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of dental service, a dentist, a dental hygienist, and a technician use dental handpieces. However, when using a dental handpiece to treat patients or process materials, a large amount of air pollution may be generated. The air pollutant contains hazardous materials such as ultrafine particles, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, aerosols, sprays, mists, droplets, bio-aerosols, gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These kinds of air pollutant can affect both the patient and dental personnel in an operation room. Some studies show that dental technicians are at risk of respiratory diseases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another problem of the dental handpiece and the ultrasonic scaling tip is noise pollution. Some studies report that dentists face a risk of hearing problems during work. Furthermore, the noise from a dental handpiece or dental drill can also cause anxiety and discomfort to a patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Using dental handpieces may also lead to vibration related diseases, including musculosketal disorder, small fiber nerve or mechanorecptory injury. Another study shows that people using dental handpieces are at higher risk of finger-related symptoms and upper limb symptoms.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there still lacks effective methods to reduce such vibration in dental handpieces and ultrasonic scaling tips. Thus, air pollution, noise, and vibration is needed to be reduced in order to protect dental personnel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some of the dental service provider use local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to remove the air pollutants. However, most of the current local exhaust ventilations are standalone devices that occupy much space. Some local exhaust ventilation even require another person to hold it.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Recently, some patents (e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/212,758) attach an ionizer and/or a local exhaust ventilation to a tool such as a dental handpiece or an electrosurgical pencil to reduce air pollution. However, the device can still not reduce the noise and the vibration produced from dental handpiece. Moreover, the electric wire of the ionizer that is attached to the outside the dental handpiece can make it uncomfortable to hold. Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved device that can reduce the noise, the vibration and grip discomfort in addition to air pollution from the tools such as the dental handpieces or the ultrasonic scaling tips.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a case in an operation room, surgical smoke is produced when using an electrosurgical pencil during surgery. Surgical smoke contains hazardous gases and particles (aerosols). Exposure to surgical smoke can be hazardous to health. Although using the electrosurgical pencil will not generate noise and vibration, the electrosurgical pencil may be slippery when contacting with body fluid during the surgical process, and may affect the surgery. In addition, this kind of slippery problem can also happen during operation of dental tools. It is noted that the aforementioned U.S. application Ser. No. 16/212,758 does not have an anti-slip function. Thus, it is also desirable for the improved device to have anti-slip function.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The objective of the present invention is to provide a multifunctional air pollution reduction device for reducing air pollution generated during an operation of tools.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the objective, a multifunctional air pollution reduction device is designed to include a tool, and a multifunctional pollutant remover.
