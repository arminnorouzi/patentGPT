Raw materials in the stock bin <b>1</b> are massive phosphate rock, silica and coke, or regular massive materials formed by grinding, bonding, press-molding and sintering one or more of phosphate rock, silica and coke. A discharge port of the stock bin <b>1</b> is connected to a mineral aggregate lock hopper <b>2</b> by an inlet airlock valve <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, and a lower opening of the mineral aggregate lock hopper <b>2</b> is connected to an upper feeding port of a phosphorous coal gasification reactor <b>3</b> by an outlet airlock valve <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>.

In the phosphorus coal gasification reactor <b>3</b>, a drying zone <b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, a dry distillation zone <b>3</b>-<b>2</b>, a combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, a phosphate rock reduction zone <b>3</b>-<b>4</b>, and a slag bath zone <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> are formed from top to bottom. A main body of the phosphorus coal gasification reactor <b>3</b> is a housing having pressure resistance of 1.0 to 4.0 MPa, and a fireplace slag layer, a lining, refractory bricks and a shell are provided from inside to outside when viewed in a cross-section view. A gas product outlet <b>4</b> communicating with the phosphorus coal gasification reactor <b>3</b> is installed at the top of the phosphorus coal gasification reactor <b>3</b>, two to eight combustion burners <b>5</b> are symmetrically arranged on the combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, and an auxiliary burner <b>6</b> communicating with the slag bath zone <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> is arranged at the bottom of the slag bath zone <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>. The fuel entering the fuel burner <b>5</b> is any one of oxygen, pulverized coal, oxygen and water vapor, oxygen and water vapor and pulverized coal, and oxygen and pulverized coal. In some embodiments, the fuel burner <b>5</b> injects oxygen and pulverized coal into the reactor in a jet flow manner to reduce the consumption of coke in the mineral aggregates by rising crude syngas.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The phosphate rock is proportioned to make the P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>content thereof reach 18%-25% by weight, and the material, (SiO<sub>2</sub>+Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)/CaO, has an acidity value of 0.7-0.95. Regarding the acidity value, the SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO carried by the phosphate rock and coal must be considered. In a case that the SiO<sub>2</sub>+Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in the phosphate rock and coal are not enough, the required acidity value will be achieved by adding silica. The ingredients of phosphate rock may be phosphate rock lumps, granular coke and silica lumps. It is also possible to mix the ore fines of the phosphate rock, coke and silica into pellets according to a calculated ratio for charging.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The proportioned phosphate rock briquettes are intermittently fed via the stock bin <b>1</b>, and through the regulation of the <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> inlet airlock valve and the <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> outlet airlock valve, the phosphate rock briquettes are pressurized by the mineral aggregate lock hopper <b>2</b> to enter the reactor <b>3</b>. The phosphate rock briquettes are subjected to heat exchange with the bottom-up process gas at an upper portion of the reactor, forming the drying zone <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and the dry distillation zone <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> in sequence. The process gas is cooled to 300 to 700&#xb0; C. and then enters the next process from the gas outlet <b>4</b> at an upper seal of the reactor <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Along with the falling of the phosphate rock briquettes, the solid material is close to the combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, the temperature is further increased to 1500 to 1700&#xb0; C., and the phosphate rock briquettes are molten gradually to enter the phosphate rock smelting reduction zone <b>3</b>-<b>4</b>. The phosphate rock is reduced by the carbon (coke or coal) at a high temperature of 1400 to 1600&#xb0; C. to generate phosphorus vapor, and non-volatile substances form slags to enter the slag bath zone <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>. The slag bath zone <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> is subjected to liquid seal by a high-temperature fuel gas fed by the auxiliary burner <b>6</b>, the pressure at the auxiliary burner is reduced when slags need to be discharged. The liquid slags flow into the slag quench chamber <b>7</b> for water quenching in the slag quench chamber filled with water to form glass slags with a coagulation performance, which are discharged via the slag lock hopper <b>8</b> for sail. The pressure of the auxiliary burner <b>6</b> depends on the residence time required for phosphate rock reduction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fuel is injected, by two to eight fuel burners <b>5</b>, into the furnace to form the combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> for the oxidation of the coal, and the temperature at the combustion center is above 2,000&#xb0; C. to provide energy required for the reduction reaction of the phosphate rock. A gas chamber is formed in the combustion zone to support the solid mineral aggregates above the combustion zone and to heat the phosphate rock briquettes. The fuel for the combustion burner may be any one of oxygen, oxygen and (water) vapor, oxygen and (water) vapor and pulverized coal, and oxygen and pulverized coal. When oxygen is employed, the combined fuel feeding burner <b>5</b> only provides combustion improver, while the fuel is coal briquette, anthracite or coal char, and is fed, by the stock bin <b>1</b>, from the top of the reaction zone, along with the solid phosphate rock briquettes. In order to control the temperature at the combustion center zone, it is possible to employ the (water) vapor accompanied by the oxygen; When oxygen and pulverized coal is employed, the fuel and the combustion improver provided by the combined fuel feeding burner <b>5</b> simultaneously enter the combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> from the fuel feeding burner <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In conclusion, the combustion zone <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of the reactor provides the high temperature of 1,800-2,000&#xb0; C. and the required energy for the reduction process, instead of a heat supply mode of the original yellow phosphorus electric furnace; a phosphorus-coal coupling continuous reactor is provided, and the thermal energy dissipation of the system is controlled to not exceed 2%. The combined production of the yellow phosphorus and the syngas is achieved by employing an automatic liquid phase slag discharging system.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
