detection assembly for a motor vehicle, and more particularly the invention relates to a cleaning system associated with a sensor/transmitter of such a detection assembly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles, particularly motor vehicles, increasingly include automated systems, such as driving assistance systems. Such automated systems include in particular at least one detection assembly which comprises one or more sensor(s)/transmitter(s) making it possible to acquire signals representing the surroundings of the vehicle and parameters external to this vehicle as well as at least one control unit configured to interpret the information thus gathered and to make the decisions that need to be made as a result of this information.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it will be understood that it is particularly important to check that these sensors/transmitters are operating properly throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. In particular, these sensors/transmitters are most often arranged outside the vehicle, for example carried on the bodywork, and may for example get dirty, possibly making it difficult, or even impossible, to acquire information. It is therefore necessary to provide a cleaning system capable of effectively removing detritus, dirt, organic matter and other disruptive elements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such cleaning systems must in particular be adapted to the dimensions of the glazed surface to be cleaned. It is particularly problematic to provide cleaning systems able to properly clean a glazed surface of elongate shape, that is to say with a longitudinal dimension greater than the corresponding transverse dimension. It is thus known practice to provide a cleaning system in which a wiper is driven by a rotary drive motor in a rotary movement around a transverse axis. However, the glazed surface of the sensors/transmitters should be curved, not flat, so that the wiper is pressed firmly against the surface to be cleaned.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Said rotary movement may be a continuous or discontinuous rotary movement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative, particularly applicable to flat glazed surfaces, is to provide a cleaning system in which the wiper is driven in a longitudinal translational movement, along the largest dimension of the sensor/transmitter, in order to wipe the flat glazed surface thereof. Such cleaning systems may however prove to be bulky, in particular because they require the use of a rod that can be deployed in the direction of translation of the wiper.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention falls within this context and proposes an alternative to systems for cleaning sensors/transmitters of detection assemblies aimed at solving at least the drawbacks which have just been mentioned, wherein said cleaning system may be used to clean a flat or curved glazed surface of a sensor/transmitter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aim of the present invention is to provide a cleaning system affording better performance, in particular by reducing the travel time of the cleaning system on the glazed surface to be cleaned and therefore the time required to clean said glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a cleaning system for cleaning a glazed surface of a motor vehicle, said cleaning system comprising at least one wiper and a drive device for driving at least the wiper along an axis of translation substantially perpendicular to said wiper, characterized in that the glazed surface is a detection surface of a sensor/transmitter of a detection assembly and in that the drive device comprises at least one drive motor for driving in rotation about an axis of rotation substantially perpendicular to the axis of translation, and at least one conversion device for converting the rotary movement of the drive motor into a rectilinear movement along the axis of translation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is designed in particular for cleaning glazed surfaces of sensors/transmitters, i.e. glazed surfaces having smaller dimensions than those presented by glazed surfaces associated with the passenger compartment of the vehicle such as a windshield or a rear window. The size of the glazed surface is in particular tailored to the nature of the sensor/transmitter with which it is associated. By way of example, where the detection assembly is an optical assembly and the sensor/transmitter an optical sensor, the longitudinal dimension of the optical surface to be cleaned may be around 300 to 400 mm and the transverse dimension, perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension, may be around 50 to 100 mm.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cleaning system as it is implemented according to the invention is particularly suitable for cleaning glazed surfaces having an elongate shape, i.e. having a main elongation dimension, in this case corresponding to a longitudinal direction, at least twice as large as the perpendicular, in this case transverse, dimension of the glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This glazed surface may be characterized by a flat structure, essentially included in a plane of extension, or may have a curved structure curving around a longitudinal axis corresponding to the axis of the largest dimension of the glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drive device is configured to move the wiper longitudinally in translation between a first end position and a second end position of the glazed surface. By way of example, said end positions may be positioned near two opposite edges of the glazed surface, for example two opposite side edges or two opposite longitudinal edges arbitrarily forming an upper edge and a lower edge. In other words, the drive device is configured to allow a reciprocating movement in longitudinal translation between the two end positions, on the basis of a rotary movement initiated by the rotary drive motor. Such a drive device makes it possible in particular to clean a glazed surface by means of a translational movement particularly suitable for effectively cleaning the entire glazed surface of the sensor/transmitter, using a standard rotary motor arranged on one edge of the glazed surface to be cleaned.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, the end positions may delimit a limited area of the glazed surface, for example a field of vision of an optical sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one feature of the invention, the conversion device comprises, on the one hand, an articulated connecting member to which the wiper is attached, by means of at least one connector, and on the other hand, a fixed motor articulation point rotationally rigidly secured to an output shaft of the drive motor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The wiper comprises at least one blade, for cleaning, by wiping, the glazed surface of the sensor/transmitter, and at least one blade holder, which is attached to the conversion device by the connector. In particular, said connector may be centered on the wiper or be arranged at an axial end of said wiper. The arrangement of the conversion device between an articulated connecting member and a fixed motor articulation point makes it possible to convert a rotary movement around an axis passing through the fixed articulation point into a precise translational movement not affected by the mounting tolerances of the cleaning system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one feature of the invention, at least one axial end of the wiper comprises at least one guide member configured to guide the wiper along the axis of translation of this wiper.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The guide member ensures the wiper is held in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of translation defining its rectilinear movement so as to prevent the blade from shifting while wiping the glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The guide member may, by way of example, be a tab configured to extend parallel to at least one wall of a housing of the sensor/transmitter, said wall carrying the glazed surface to be cleaned. Alternatively, the guide member may be configured to interact with the sensor/transmitter, for example with a channel included in the wall of the housing or in the glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one feature of the invention, the conversion device comprises at least a connecting rod system and/or a cam.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The connecting rod system comprises a plurality of connecting rods articulated relative to one another. A first connecting rod forms, at a first tip, the fixed motor articulation point and is rotatably mounted on the drive motor. When the first connecting rod is rotated by the drive motor, a second tip, opposite the first tip, defines a circular path.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one connecting rod of the connecting rod system, different from the first connecting rod, participates in forming, at the opposite end to the first connecting rod, the articulated connecting member connecting the wiper to the conversion device. In particular, said connecting rod may be directly or indirectly articulated to the first connecting rod.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one implementation of the conversion device with a cam, the connector ensuring the connection between the wiper and the conversion device may, for example, comprise a pin configured to move along a peripheral edge of the cam or along a groove made in the cam.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The conversion device may comprise a combination of the cam and the connecting rod system, at least one connecting rod of the connecting rod system being connected to the connector and/or comprising the pin configured to interact with the cam.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an optional feature of the invention, the connecting rod system comprises at least the first connecting rod, attached to the drive motor to form the fixed motor articulation point, and at least two articulated quadrilaterals of connecting rods, respectively a first quadrilateral of connecting rods and a second quadrilateral of connecting rods, at least the articulated connecting member being common to the first quadrilateral and to the second quadrilateral, the second quadrilateral comprising a fixed point of the conversion device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, the connecting rod system may consist of a Peaucellier-Lipkin device converting the circular path defined by the second tip of the first connecting rod into a translational movement of the articulated connecting member of the conversion device, so as to drive the wiper along the axis of translation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an optional feature of the invention, the connector may be arranged at a first axial end of the wiper, the at least one guide member being arranged at a second axial end, opposite the first axial end, of said wiper.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this case, &#x201c;first axial end&#x201d; means the end of the wiper closest to the axis of rotation of the drive motor. It follows that the &#x201c;second axial end&#x201d; is a distal end of the wiper with respect to the axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an optional feature of the invention, the connector may be centered on the wiper, i.e., the connector is equidistant from the first axial end and the second axial end of the wiper.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The alternative in which the connector is centered is particularly suitable for cleaning assemblies in which the wiper has a large axial dimension, substantially of the order of the largest dimension of the glazed surface to be cleaned. For example, such an embodiment may be implemented to ensure that the glazed surface is wiped perpendicularly to a longest dimension of said glazed surface. In other words, the wiper extends over the longest dimension of the glazed surface, thus advantageously reducing the travel time of the cleaning system on the glazed surface and therefore the time required to clean said glazed surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Advantageously, when the cleaning system according to the present invention has such an alternative, it preferably has the guide means at each of its longitudinal ends.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one feature of the invention, irrespective of the embodiment implemented, the wiper may comprise at least one supply device for supplying cleaning fluid and at least one spray device for spraying said cleaning fluid onto at least the glazed surface of the sensor/transmitter.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By way of example, the supply device may consist of at least one tube while the device for spraying the cleaning fluid may consist of at least one duct formed in the blade holder and a plurality of nozzles opening into said duct.

This results in a movement of the second connecting rod <b>67</b> and, with the wiper guided in translation by the guide members <b>47</b>, this movement generates a push or a pull on the connector and therefore a movement of the wiper along a rectilinear path along the axis of translation <b>200</b>, between the first end position and the second end position, parallel to the generatrix <b>120</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The dimensions of the connecting rods impact on the transverse stroke of the wiper and these dimensions are provided such that the end positions of the wiper may correspond to the regions close to the upper edge <b>37</b> and the lower edge <b>39</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>, so that the wiper <b>19</b> moves over the entire transverse dimension <b>150</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Alternatively, the cleaning system <b>7</b> may be configured, in particular by a specific dimensioning of the connecting rods or by abutment means blocking the rotation of the first connecting rod <b>65</b>, to wipe a limited portion of the transverse dimension <b>150</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>, the spacing between the first end position and the second end position as well as the extent of movement of the wiper <b>19</b> thus being smaller.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Such a connecting rod system <b>60</b> has the advantage of simple, compact and inexpensive implementation.

As stated above, these second and third pivots are caused to move along the second circle <b>895</b> owing to the connection between these pivots and the common fixed point <b>93</b> shared by the sixth connecting rod <b>89</b> and the seventh connecting rod <b>91</b>, which are themselves also driven by the movement of the second and third pivots.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Such a connecting rod system <b>60</b>, combined with the guiding in translation of the wiper on either side, or at least along one side, of the glazed surface, makes it possible to ensure the conversion of the circular path defined by the first circle <b>710</b> into a linear path of the articulated connecting member <b>31</b> along a primary axis <b>210</b>, parallel to the axis of translation of the wiper <b>19</b>, this wiper being carried by the articulated connecting member <b>31</b> via the connector <b>33</b> which may take the form of a rigid arm.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The movement of the wiper <b>19</b> between the first end position and the second end position is characterized by the gradual deformation of the first quadrilateral <b>75</b> and the second quadrilateral <b>77</b> of connecting rods <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">For example, when the wiper <b>19</b> is moved from the first end position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to any intermediate position, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, between the first end position and the second end position, the first quadrilateral <b>75</b> and the second quadrilateral <b>77</b> change shape insofar as the second pivot <b>85</b> and the third pivot <b>87</b> move apart gradually.

By way of example, the contactor <b>97</b> may be carried by the fourth connecting rod <b>81</b> so that, when the second pivot <b>85</b> and the third pivot <b>87</b> are brought together at the first end position, the fifth connecting rod <b>83</b> comes into contact with the contactor <b>97</b> carried by the fourth connecting rod <b>81</b>, allowing electrical contact and sending an instruction for the abovementioned valve to open, so as to allow the cleaning fluid to flow. The cleaning fluid is then distributed in the cleaning system <b>7</b> and sprayed toward the optical surface <b>9</b> throughout the movement of the wiper <b>19</b>, from the first end position to the second end position.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">When the second pivot <b>85</b> and the third pivot <b>87</b> are brought together again, with the wiper in the second end position, the fifth connecting rod <b>83</b> again comes into contact with the contactor <b>97</b>, allowing electrical contact and sending an instruction for the abovementioned valve to close, so as to cut off the flow of cleaning fluid. Consequently, no fluid is sprayed onto the optical surface <b>9</b> as the wiper <b>19</b> moves from the second end position to the first end position.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In such a situation, the cleaning fluid spray nozzles <b>57</b> are turned toward the second end position, so that the optical surface <b>9</b> is first moistened by the cleaning fluid and then wiped by the blade <b>23</b> of the wiper <b>19</b>. Provision could be made, without departing from the context of the invention, for the orientation of the nozzles, and the end position in which the opening or closing of the valve is triggered, to be modified.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Another alternative could consist in modifying the location of the contactor <b>97</b>, for example between the second connecting rod <b>67</b> and the third connecting rod <b>79</b>, or between the sixth connecting rod <b>89</b> and the seventh connecting rod <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an alternative example of the first embodiment advantageously making it possible to reduce the extent of movement of the wiper <b>19</b> and therefore the duration of the sensor surface cleaning operation, as well as making it possible to make the connecting rod system <b>60</b> compact. In such a cleaning system <b>7</b>, the wiper <b>19</b> extends parallel to the longitudinal dimension <b>160</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>, i.e. between the side edges <b>41</b>, and the wiper <b>19</b> is moved translationally in the transverse direction between the first end position and the second end position, respectively positioned near the upper edge <b>37</b> and the lower edge <b>39</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Note that, as explained above, such an embodiment of the present invention can only be implemented if the wiper <b>19</b> moves along the axis of translation <b>200</b>, parallel to the generatrix <b>120</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>. The optical surface <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> thus has a curvature having a different orientation from that previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, the curvature being positioned around a transverse axis. In other words, while the position of the drive device <b>21</b>, and in particular the position of the conversion device <b>29</b>, can be modified, it is essential, for optimal operation of the present invention, that the wiper <b>19</b> extend perpendicular to the generatrix <b>120</b> and that it be moved along the axis of translation <b>200</b>, with a movement substantially parallel to said generatrix <b>120</b>. On the other hand, such constraints do not arise when the optical surface <b>9</b> is flat.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> thus differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref> in that the wiper <b>19</b> has a larger dimension, the blade thus having a length <b>180</b> greater than the longitudinal dimension <b>160</b>, of around 300 to 400 mm, of the optical surface <b>9</b>, and in that the conversion device <b>29</b> is arranged facing one of the side edges <b>41</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The principle of movement of the wiper <b>19</b> and the change in the positions of the various connecting rods <b>64</b> of the conversion device <b>29</b> between the first end position and the second end position is thus identical to that described above, with the difference that the conversion device <b>29</b> is arranged opposite one of the side edges <b>41</b> and that the articulated connecting member <b>31</b> is moved along the primary axis <b>210</b> which here extends along said side edge <b>41</b>, substantially parallel to the transverse direction.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Since the transverse dimension <b>150</b> of the optical surface <b>9</b> is smaller than its longitudinal dimension <b>160</b>, the distance traveled by the wiper <b>19</b> between the first end position, for example near the upper edge <b>37</b>, and the second end position, for example near the lower edge <b>39</b>, is smaller. This results in a reduction in the time taken for the cleaning operation but also a reduction in the size due to the drive device <b>21</b>. To be specific, since the movement of the wiper <b>19</b> is of smaller extent, the scale of the &#x201c;Peaucellier-Lipkin&#x201d; conversion device <b>29</b> is itself reduced, the features concerning the relative arrangement of the various quadrilaterals nevertheless remaining similar to what has been described above.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the connector <b>33</b> extends between the articulated connecting member <b>31</b> and the first axial end <b>43</b>.
