When any one of the power supplies is abnormal and needs to be repaired, the other one of the power supplies maintains supplying power. Another way is that the conventional power supply device has an uninterruptible power system (UPS). When the power supply device damages or the power failure of the power supply device occurs, the UPS can provide power to machines.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the conventional power supply device needs to have two power supplies, and the cost is therefore higher. No matter the conventional power supply device adopts having two power supplies manner or having UPS manner to maintain supplying power, this is a remedy after the conventional power supply device is already damaged or the power failure of the conventional power supply device occurs. The loss of the factory cost by the power supply device being damaged or the power failure of the conventional power supply device occurring is extremely high. The loss of the factory is sometimes beyond compute. Therefore, how to reduce the cost of the power supply device, and how to prevent the power supply device from being damaged or to prevent the power failure of the power supply device from occurring is a problem to be improved in the field.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader.

As shown in the figure, the power supply device includes a power converter <b>100</b> and a power monitor <b>200</b>. The power monitor <b>200</b> includes a detecting circuit <b>210</b>, a processing circuit <b>220</b>, a warning circuit <b>230</b> and a communication circuit <b>240</b>. With respect to connection, the power converter <b>100</b> is connected to a power <b>800</b> and a load <b>900</b>. The detecting circuit <b>210</b> is connected to a primary side circuit <b>110</b> of the power converter <b>100</b>, and connected to a secondary side circuit <b>120</b> of the power converter <b>100</b>. The processing circuit <b>220</b> is connected to the detecting circuit <b>210</b>. The warning circuit <b>230</b> is connected to the processing circuit <b>220</b>. The communication circuit <b>240</b> is connected to the warning circuit <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With respect to operation, the power converter <b>100</b> transforms the energy provided by the power <b>800</b>, and provides it to the load <b>900</b>. In one embodiment, the power <b>800</b> can be but not limited to the power grid or other outer power. The power monitor <b>200</b> is configured to monitor the condition of the power converter <b>100</b>, and inform users immediately when the power converter <b>100</b> is abnormal, so as to prevent the power supply device from being damage/power failure, which will be described in detail as below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The detecting circuit <b>210</b> of the power monitor <b>200</b> detects a first abnormal condition of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> of the power converter <b>100</b> and a second abnormal condition of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> of the power converter <b>100</b> in real time. The processing circuit <b>220</b> then calculates a first class and a first occurring number of the first abnormal condition, and calculates a second class and a second occurring number of the second abnormal condition. For example, when the energy provided by the power <b>800</b> is high, the primary side circuit <b>110</b> will receive a high voltage. Meanwhile, the detecting circuit <b>210</b> will detect the above-mentioned abnormal condition, and the processing circuit <b>220</b> then calculates a class of the abnormal condition (e.g., 1000 volts/750 volts are two kinds of different classes) and a happened number of the abnormal condition. In addition, when the electricity usage demand of the load <b>900</b> increases, an overload condition will happen in the secondary side circuit <b>120</b>. Meanwhile, the detecting circuit <b>210</b> will detect the above-mentioned abnormal condition, the processing circuit <b>220</b> then calculates the class of the abnormal condition (e.g., overload time: 10 seconds/overload time: 3 seconds are two kinds of different classes) and the happened number of the abnormal condition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Subsequently, the processing circuit <b>220</b> of the power monitor <b>200</b> further determines whether a first occurring number is larger than a first predetermined number corresponding to the first class.

Besides, the processing circuit <b>220</b> determines whether a second occurring number is larger than a second predetermined number corresponding to the second class. If it is, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs a second abnormal signal. In one embodiment, the processing circuit <b>220</b> receives the first predetermined number corresponding to the first class and the second predetermined number corresponding to the second class from a look-up table. For example, the processing circuit <b>220</b> receives a related predetermined number according to the class of the abnormal condition of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> (e.g., 1000 volts/750 volts). When the class of the abnormal condition is 1000 volts, the damage to the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is high due to the abnormal voltage is high. Therefore, the acceptable number of the 1000 volts is predetermined to be 5. If the shock number to the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is more than 5, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal. In contrast, when the class of the abnormal condition is 750 volts, the damage to the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is low due to the abnormal voltage is low. Therefore, the acceptable number of the 750 volts is predetermined to be 20. If the shock number to the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is more than 20, the processing circuit <b>220</b> then outputs the abnormal signal.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The condition of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is that the processing circuit <b>220</b> receives a corresponding predetermined number according to the class of the abnormal condition of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> (e.g., overload time: 10 seconds/overload time: 3 seconds). When the class of the abnormal condition is that the overload time is 10 seconds, the damage to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is high due to the overload time is long. Therefore, the acceptable number of the 10 seconds overload time is predetermined to be 50. If the happened time of the overload condition to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is more than 50, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal. In contrast, when the class of the abnormal condition is that the overload time is 3 seconds, the damage to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is low due to the overload time is low. Therefore, the acceptable number of the 3 seconds overload time is predetermined to be 100. If the happened time of the overload condition to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is more than 100, the processing circuit <b>220</b> then outputs the abnormal signal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, the warning circuit <b>230</b> will output a warning signal according to the first abnormal signal corresponding to the primary side circuit <b>110</b>, or the warning circuit <b>230</b> will output the warning signal according to the second abnormal signal corresponding to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b>. For example, when the shock number to the primary side circuit <b>110</b> by 1000 volts is more than 5, the damage of elements inside the primary side circuit <b>110</b> may achieve the damage tolerance. The elements inside the primary side circuit <b>110</b> will break down at any time if keep using the elements. Meanwhile, the warning circuit <b>230</b> will output the warning signal, so as to remind users to change the elements inside the primary side circuit <b>110</b>, in order to avoid damage/power failure of the power supply device. Similarly, when the happened time of the 10 seconds overload condition to the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is more than 50, the damage of the elements inside the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> may achieve the damage tolerance. The elements inside the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> will break down at any time if keep using the elements. Meanwhile, the warning circuit <b>230</b> will output the warning signal, so as to remind users to change the elements inside the secondary side circuit <b>120</b>, in order to avoid damage/power failure of the power supply device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The abnormal conditions of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> and the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> of the power converter <b>100</b> in the present disclosure are not intended to be limited to the above-mentioned embodiments. For example, the abnormal condition of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> can also be voltage abnormal, current abnormal, surge or other condition which may damage circuits, and the abnormal condition of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> can also be voltage abnormal, current abnormal, overload or other condition which may damage circuits.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the power monitor <b>200</b> of the present disclosure can be used in remote monitor field. The power monitor <b>200</b> may include a communication circuit <b>240</b>. If the primary side circuit <b>110</b> or the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> of the power converter <b>100</b> is abnormal, the communication circuit <b>240</b> can be used to transmit the warning signal to a remote monitor system (not shown) through a wired manner or a wireless manner, such that users can monitor the power converters easily in a remote manner. If the abnormal condition happens, staff whose location near the abnormal power converter <b>100</b> will be noticed to fix the abnormal power converter <b>100</b>. In addition, the power monitor <b>200</b> further uses the detecting circuit <b>210</b> to detect the primary side circuit <b>110</b> or the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> of the power converter <b>100</b> for generating detection data. The communication circuit <b>240</b> is further used to transmit detailed detection data (e.g., abnormal condition data) to the remote monitor system. The remote monitor system collects all conditions for big data analyzing, and adaptively adjusts the power monitor <b>200</b> or the parameter of the look-up table according to analyzing result, such that the power monitor <b>200</b> can further monitor and give a waring intelligently.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a detailed circuit diagram of a power converter <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The power converter <b>100</b> used herein is a flyback converter. However, the embodiment is used for illustration purpose, and the present disclosure is not limited to the circuit as shown in the embodiment regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The power converter <b>100</b> can be a forward converter, a half-bridge converter, a full-bridge converter or other type converter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference is now made to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The detecting circuit <b>210</b> of the power monitor <b>200</b> is configured to detect voltage of the input capacitor C of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> (i.e., the voltage of the input capacitor C is called input voltage herein). Subsequently, the processing circuit <b>220</b> is configured to compare a condition of the input voltage and a predetermined parameter. If the condition of the input voltage and the predetermined parameter are different, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs an abnormal signal. The warning circuit <b>230</b> then outputs a warning signal according to the abnormal signal. The warning signal is transmitted to a remote monitor device (not shown) through the communication circuit <b>240</b> so as to notice users. In addition, for facilitating the understanding of the technology of the power monitor in the present disclosure, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is a diagram of a voltage waveform according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The voltage waveform W<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the voltage waveform of the input capacitor C of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and the voltage waveform W<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the output voltage waveform of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The present disclosure has multiple power monitor technologies, which will be described in detail as below.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. With respect to wave trough detection, the processing circuit <b>220</b> is configured to determine whether a wave trough of the input voltage W<b>1</b> is lower than a predetermined wave trough voltage. For example, a predetermined wave trough voltage L<b>2</b> is set. If the wave trough of the input voltage W<b>1</b> is lower than the predetermined wave trough voltage L<b>2</b> (i.e., the A point as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), it represents that an abnormal condition occurs. Meanwhile, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal. Aging process of the input capacitor C occurs when the input capacitor C is used after a period of time. If the input capacitor is an electrolytic capacitor, the electrolyte solution therein will decrease as time goes on, such that the performance of the input capacitor declines. Conventional detection manner is to detect the output voltage W<b>2</b> of the secondary side circuit, and a waring is given when the output voltage W<b>2</b> is abnormal. However, as discussed above, the element that introduces problems is in the primary side circuit, which results in the decreasing of the input voltage W<b>1</b>. The conventional manner, to give a waring when detecting that the output voltage W<b>2</b> of the secondary side circuit being abnormal, is putting the cart before the horse. If the wave trough detection manner of the present disclosure is used as the power monitor manner, the aging process of the input capacitor C of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> will be found directly/efficiently (i.e., detecting that the input voltage W<b>1</b> is lower than the predetermined wave trough voltage L<b>2</b>, which represents the input capacitor C ages), such that the input capacitor C can be changed immediately. As such, the condition of performance decreasing/damage of the power supply device can be prevented in advance so as to prevent the output ripple wave from becoming larger.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With respect to peak value detection, the processing circuit <b>220</b> is configured to determine whether a peak of the input voltage W<b>1</b> is larger than a predetermined peak voltage value.

Meanwhile, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal. For detecting whether power provided by an outer power (e.g., a power grid) is abnormal, conventional detection manner is to detect the output voltage W<b>2</b> of the secondary side circuit as well, and a waring is given when the output voltage W<b>2</b> is abnormal. However, as discussed above, the element that introduces problems is in the primary side circuit receiving power from the outer power, which results in the increasing of the input voltage W<b>1</b>. The conventional manner, to give a waring when detecting that the output voltage W<b>2</b> of the secondary side circuit being abnormal, is also putting the cart before the horse. If the peak value detection manner of the present disclosure is used as the power monitor manner, the input voltage W<b>1</b> of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> can be detected in a real time. If the peak of the input voltage W<b>1</b> is larger than a predetermined peak voltage value for too many times, the input capacitor C will be damaged seriously.

If the wave motion difference value of the input voltage is larger than the predetermined voltage difference value, it represents that a wave motion of a power provided by the power <b>800</b> is too large. As such, the input capacitor C will also be damaged. Conventional detection manner is to detect the output voltage W<b>2</b> of the secondary side circuit as well, and a waring is given when the output voltage W<b>2</b> is abnormal.

At this time, the input capacitor C can be changed immediately. As such, the condition of performance decreasing/damage of the power supply device can be prevented in advance so as to prevent the output ripple wave from becoming larger.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With respect to unit time variation rate detection, the processing circuit <b>220</b> is configured to determine whether a waveform unit time variation rate of the input voltage is larger than predetermined unit time variation rate. If the waveform unit time variation rate of the input voltage is larger than a predetermined unit time variation rate (i.e., the point B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), it represents that an over load condition occurs. As such, the capacitor C will also be damaged. If the over load condition happens for too many times, the input capacitor C will be damaged seriously. Meanwhile, the input capacitor C can be changed immediately. As such, the condition of performance decreasing/damage of the power supply device can be prevented in advance so as to prevent the output ripple wave from becoming larger. In addition, when the over load condition happens, that is the output current of the secondary side circuit <b>120</b> is too large (i.e., the output current is larger than a predetermined output current), the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the protection signal to a remote monitor system (not shown) in advance. The remote monitor system can monitor the whole system, and the remote monitor system controls the power converter <b>100</b> in advance so as to prevent the power supply device from damage. Subsequently, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal to the warning circuit <b>230</b>, and the warning circuit <b>230</b> outputs the warning signal to notice users to do related processing. For example, the processing circuit <b>220</b> can output the protection signal to the remote monitor system in advance, and the remote monitor system changes the power converter <b>100</b>, lowers the load of the power converter <b>100</b> or to do other suitable processing. As such, before the warning circuit <b>230</b> notices users to do related processing, the power converter <b>100</b> can be protected by performing protection processes in advance so as to further prevent the power supply device from damage.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) waveform according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The control manner of the switches in the primary side circuit <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is, for example, a pulse width modulation (PWM). The widths of the pulse width modulation signals P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> are normal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the widths of the pulse width modulation signals are increasing from the pulse width modulation signal P<b>4</b>. The width of the pulse width modulation signal P<b>6</b> is too large, and it represents that the abnormal condition occurs, which is probably caused by the over loading condition. The width of the pulse width modulation of the present disclosure is used as the power monitor manner. A width of the pulse width modulation signal is set to be a predetermined width of the pulse width modulation signal. For example, the predetermined width of the pulse width modulation signal is the width of the pulse width modulation signal P<b>5</b>. If the processing circuit <b>220</b> determines that the width of the pulse width modulation signal of the switch in the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is different from the predetermined width (e.g., large than the width of the pulse width modulation signal P<b>5</b>), the processing circuit <b>220</b> does not output the abnormal signal to give a warning until the abnormal condition occurs (i.e., the pulse width modulation P<b>6</b>), but outputs the abnormal signal in advance. As such, the performance decreasing/damage of the power supply device can be prevented in advance. In addition, with respect to frequency detection, when the control manner of the switch in the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is changed into pulse frequency modulation (PFM), the processing circuit <b>220</b> determines whether the frequency of the control signal of the switch in the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is different from the predetermined frequency. If the frequency of the pulse frequency modulation signal of the switch of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is different from the predetermined frequency, the processing circuit <b>220</b> outputs the abnormal signal. For example, the normal frequency of the pulse frequency modulation signal is ranged from 60 kHz-80 kHz. When the frequency of the pulse frequency modulation signal is 200 kHz, it represents that the abnormal condition occurs, which is probably introduced by over loading. The pulse frequency modulation signal of the present disclosure is used as the power monitor manner. A predetermined frequency is set such as 100 kHz. If the processing circuit <b>220</b> determines that the frequency of the pulse frequency modulation signal of the switch of the primary side circuit <b>110</b> is larger than the predetermined frequency, the processing circuit <b>220</b> does not output the abnormal signal to give a warning until the abnormal condition occurs (i.e., the frequency of the pulse frequency modulation signal is 200 kHz), but outputs the abnormal signal in advance. As such, the condition of performance decreasing/damage of the power supply device can be prevented in advance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In view of the above embodiments of the present disclosure, it is apparent that the application of the present invention has the advantages as follows. In view of the foregoing, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a power monitor. The power monitor of the present disclosure can forecast the condition of the power converter intelligently so as to change the element or do other related processing in advance. Therefore, the power converter can be maintained in normal condition, and almost has no chance to be damage/power failure. For preventing the conventional power supply device from damage/power failure, the conventional power supply device needs two power supplies. Compared with the conventional power supply device with two power supplies, the present disclosure needs single power supply. Therefore, the cost of the power supply device is reduced. In addition, the aging elements can be changed in advance so as to maintain the power supply in high efficiency condition, such that the output ripple wave can be prevented from becoming larger or other related standards of the power supply device can be prevented from being abnormal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible.
