For example, substrate processing tools may have respective specifications for film thickness non-uniformity (NU). Film thickness NU may be measured as a full-range, a half-range, and/or a standard deviation of a measurement set taken at predetermined locations on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. In some examples, the NU may be reduced by, for example, addressing a direct cause of the NU. NU may also be addressed by introducing a counteracting NU to compensate and cancel the existing NU. In other examples, material may be intentionally deposited non-uniformly to compensate for known non-uniformities at other (e.g. previous or subsequent) steps in a process. Material may be also be intentionally removed non-uniformly.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Double patterning (DPT) ALD processes (e.g., a self-aligned double patterning, or SADP, process) may include steps including, but not limited to, various deposition steps, a lithography step, a trim step, and a sacrificial spacer layer deposition step. Each step may have associated NUs affecting overall critical dimension (CD) NU and imbalance. For example, the trim step may be performed between the lithography step and the spacer layer deposition step to reduce the CD. However, trim NU may result in non-uniform double patterning. Non-uniform double patterning increases CD imbalance and results in poor yield. Trim NU may be characterized as radial NU and azimuthal NU.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">CD NU and imbalance for a particular substrate may be characterized as within wafer (WiW) variability. Conversely, CD NU and imbalance between different substrates may be characterized as wafer-to-wafer (WtW) variability. In DPT processes, minimizing WtW variability in CD NU and imbalance may be difficult. For example, the trim step and the subsequent spacer deposition step may be performed in a same processing chamber to increase processing throughout. Deposition steps may cause material to accumulate on surfaces (e.g., inner walls) within the processing chamber. Further, etch byproducts (e.g., byproducts of the trim step) may accumulate on surfaces of the processing chamber. This accumulation of material within the processing chamber changes an overall impedance of the processing chamber. Changes in the overall impedance in turn affect etch rates. Accordingly, the accumulation of material and the resultant change in the impedance of the chamber increases WtW variability of the trim step.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Systems and methods according to the principles of the present disclosure are configured to reduce WtW deposition and etching variability (e.g., in a trim step) caused by accumulation of material on inner surfaces of the processing chamber. For example, deposition and etch rates may be further affected by pressure within the processing chamber. Accordingly, in one example, as deposition or etch rates change (e.g., increase or decrease) as a result of the accumulation, a control parameter of the pressure may be adjusted to compensate for the changed deposition and/or etch rate. In other words, pressure may be adjusted to maintain desired deposition and etch rates. As an example, an accumulation value may be determined. The accumulation value indicates an amount of accumulation of material on the surfaces within the processing chamber. A setpoint pressure corresponding to a desired pressure within the processing chamber is adjusted based on the accumulation value. Accordingly, variability caused by changes in the impedance of the processing chamber is reduced. In another example, the control parameter is a duration of the deposition (e.g., a duration of a corresponding deposition step). In another example, the control parameter is a duration of the etching (e.g., a duration of a corresponding trim step). Accordingly, the duration of deposition or etching may be increased or decreased based on the accumulation value to compensate for the changed rate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of a substrate processing system <b>100</b> including a substrate support (e.g., an ALD pedestal) <b>104</b> according to the present disclosure is shown.

For example, deposition of the spacer layer <b>308</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> and etching of the mandrels <b>304</b> during the trim step as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> cause material to be deposited on surfaces (e.g., on inner walls) of the processing chamber. Accumulation of this deposited material changes the impedance of the processing chamber and etch rates during subsequent etch steps, causing WtW variability of the trim step. For example, an etch amount (e.g., for a trim step of a predetermined duration, in Angstroms) decreases as accumulation of material in a processing chamber increases. More specifically, as accumulation increases and causes the impedance of the process chamber to change, the effective pressure decreases. In other words, the effective pressure is less than a desired (e.g., setpoint) pressure. The accumulation may be measured as a number of trim/deposition cycles relative to a last time the processing chamber was cleaned. Conversely, the etch amount increases as the pressure increases. The increase may be generally linear.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The controller <b>182</b> according to the present disclosure is configured to increase the setpoint pressure (e.g., increase the pressure from a predetermined default setpoint to an adjusted pressure) based on the accumulation. For example, the setpoint pressure is adjusted in accordance with a pressure adjustment factor. When accumulation is low (e.g., less than 900 Angstroms), the pressure adjustment factor may be 1.0000. In other words, adjusting the setpoint pressure may not be necessary when accumulation is low. In contrast, as accumulation increases, the pressure adjustment factor increases from 1.0000 to a value greater than 1.0000 (e.g., to 1.01, 1.02, . . . , 1.06, etc.).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, if a desired pressure is 7.00 Torr at an accumulation of 3900 Angstroms, the effective pressure for a setpoint pressure of 7.00 Torr corresponds to 7.00*0.94, or 6.58 Torr. Accordingly, the setpoint pressure is increased in accordance with the pressure adjustment factor of 1.06 corresponding to an accumulation of 3900 Angstroms such that the effective pressure is maintained at the desired pressure indicated by the setpoint pressure. In other words, the setpoint pressure is adjusted according to 7.00*1.06=7.42 Torr. Pressure may be adjusted in a similar manner at accumulation levels greater than 3900 Angstroms (e.g., up to accumulation of 1.5 &#x3bc;m or greater.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Pressure adjustment factors may be calculated or determined at various accumulation values. The accumulation values may correspond to measured, estimated, or determined amounts of accumulation. In some examples, the pressure adjustment factors may be fit to a curve and/or represented as a formula. In one example, the curve is represented as a 3<sup>rd </sup>degree polynomial. The controller <b>182</b> is configured to calculate an adjusted setpoint pressure based on the accumulation, the desired setpoint pressure (e.g., as received as an input from a user, a process recipe, etc.), and the formula.

At <b>808</b>, the method <b>800</b> determines a correlation between an increase in accumulation of material within a processing chamber (and a corresponding change in an impedance of the processing chamber) and changes in etch amounts for a given trim step. For example, the method <b>800</b> collects and stores first data indicating a correlation between a decrease in the etch amount (e.g., in Angstroms) and an increase in the accumulation. For example, the accumulation may be measured in trim/deposition cycles, where one cycle corresponds to one trim step followed by one spacer layer deposition step, since a last time the processing chamber was cleaned). In other examples, accumulation may be measured in another manner. For example, the accumulation may be measured as a total duration of etching and deposition performed within the processing chamber since a last time the processing chamber was cleaned, a total number of substrates processed since a last time the processing chamber was cleaned, an amount of time that has elapsed since a last time the processing chamber was cleaned, etc. For example only, the collected first data corresponds to accumulation values and corresponding etch amounts.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At <b>812</b>, the method <b>800</b> determines a correlation between etch amount and a pressure within the processing chamber. For example, the method <b>800</b> collects and stores second data indicating correlations between changes in pressure provided during a trim step and corresponding changes in etch amount. For example only, the collected second data may correspond to pressure relative to etch amounts. Generally, increasing pressure increases the etch amount while decreasing pressure decreases the etch amount.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At <b>816</b>, the method <b>800</b> uses the collected first data and second data to calculate a required pressure to achieve a target etch amount at different accumulation values. For example, the method <b>800</b> calculates the effective pressure, a ratio of the effective pressure to a setpoint pressure, and a pressure adjustment factor (e.g., a ratio of pressure required to compensate for the accumulation to the setpoint pressure) for a given accumulation value. At <b>820</b>, the method <b>800</b> uses the pressure adjustment factor to calculate and store a correlation between various accumulation values and corresponding pressure adjustment factors.

The controller <b>900</b> includes a pressure controller or control module <b>904</b> that controls pressure within the processing chamber during a trim step according to the present disclosure. For example, the pressure controller <b>904</b> selectively provides signals to the valve <b>178</b> and the pump <b>180</b> to adjust the pressure within the processing chamber <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pressure controller <b>904</b> receives a desired setpoint pressure (e.g., based on a process recipe being executed by the controller <b>900</b>, from a user interface <b>908</b>, etc.) and an accumulation value (e.g., from an accumulation determiner or calculation module <b>912</b> configured to determine accumulation within the processing chamber as described above). The pressure control module <b>904</b> retrieves stored data from memory <b>916</b>. For example, the stored data corresponds to a formula indicating a correlation between various accumulation values and corresponding pressure adjustment factors. The pressure controller <b>904</b> calculates an adjusted pressure based on the determined accumulation, the setpoint pressure, and the retrieved data. The pressure control module <b>904</b> controls the pressure within the processing chamber <b>108</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another example, the controller <b>900</b> may be configured to adjust a duration of the trim step instead of adjusting the amount of pressure to compensate for the reduced etch rate caused by accumulation within the processing chamber. Alternatively, the controller <b>900</b> may be configured to adjust a duration of the trim step in addition to adjusting the amount of pressure to compensate for the reduced etch rate. In particular, the duration of the trim step may be increased to compensate for the reduced etch rate. For example, the pressure controller <b>904</b> receives the desired setpoint pressure, a duration of the trim step, and the accumulation value. The pressure controller <b>904</b> retrieves stored data from memory <b>916</b> indicating a correlation between various accumulation values and corresponding trim step duration adjustment factors. In an example where a process recipe indicates a trim step duration D, the pressure controller <b>904</b> is configured to adjust the duration D in accordance with an adjusted duration D<sub>adj</sub>=(duration adjustment factor)*D. For example, the duration adjustment factor may be calculated based on the accumulation value in accordance with a formula correlating various accumulation values and corresponding duration adjustment factors in a manner similar to the calculation of the pressure adjustment factor as described above.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the systems and methods described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> correspond to reducing WtW etching variability caused by accumulation of material on inner surfaces of the processing chamber, the principles of the present disclosure may also be implemented to reduce WtW deposition variability in a similar manner. For example, deposition may be affected by pressure within the processing chamber. Accordingly, as deposition rates change (e.g., increase or decrease) as a result of the accumulation, a control parameter of the pressure may be adjusted to compensate for the changed deposition rate. Accordingly, pressure may be adjusted to maintain desired deposition rates and reduce variability caused by changes in the impedance of the processing chamber. In other examples, the duration of the deposition step may be increased or decreased to compensate for the changed deposition rate.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, deposition steps may be performed in accordance with a selected deposition profile. For example, a deposition profile may be based on a range of deposition amounts (i.e., a deposition thickness) across a substrate. Each deposition profile may be optimized for a particular processing chamber, process, etc. and various process parameters to achieve a desired deposition thickness across a substrate. For example, a deposition profile may be calculated to achieve a uniform deposition thickness across the substrate to minimize radial and/or azimuthal variation in deposition thickness (i.e., to minimize a deposition thickness range and maximize range stability). Further, deposition profiles may be optimized to minimize a difference in respective variability ranges for a batch of substrates processed within a same processing chamber.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, as accumulation of material within the processing chamber increases, deposition rates also change. Accordingly, ranges of variation in deposition thickness across respective substrates processed within a same processing chamber may differ as accumulation increases. In other words, a deposition profile that is optimized at a first level of accumulation may not be optimized for a second level of accumulation. A difference in range stability across a batch of substrates may change accordingly. For example, a first substrate that is processed in the processing chamber using a deposition profile may have a first range of variability of deposition thickness while a second substrate processed using the same deposition profile and at the same level of accumulation may have a second range of variability. A difference between the first range and the second range changes between different levels of accumulation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Deposition thicknesses may have different ranges of variation across multiple substrates for different levels of accumulation. A deposition profile may be optimized for high levels of accumulation (e.g., greater than 10,000 Angstroms of accumulation). Ranges of variation and differences between the ranges of variation are generally greater at lower levels of accumulation (e.g., at less than 10,000 Angstroms of accumulation). The ranges of variation and the differences between the ranges decrease as accumulation increases. For example, at lower levels of accumulation (e.g., less than 3,000 Angstroms), a maximum difference between the ranges may be approximately 1 Angstrom. Conversely, at greater levels of accumulation (e.g., more than 24,000 Angstroms), a maximum difference between the ranges may be less than 0.5 Angstroms.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Ranges of variation and the difference between respective ranges of variation across a batch of processed substrates are inversely proportional to levels of accumulation. Conversely, in examples where the deposition profile is optimized for low levels of accumulation (e.g., less than 10,000 Angstroms), the ranges of variation and the difference between ranges of variation across a batch of processed substrates may be directly proportional to levels of accumulation. In other words, in examples where the deposition profile is optimized for low levels of accumulation, the ranges of variation and the difference between ranges of variation across a batch of processed substrates may increase as accumulation levels within the processing chamber increase.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, variable pressure may be used to compensate for changes in levels of accumulation. For example, at low accumulation (e.g., less than 3000 Angstroms), the pressure may be maintained at a relatively low level (e.g., less than 1.5 Torr). As accumulation increases, the pressure <b>1</b> is increased accordingly. For example, the pressure is increased as accumulation increases to approximately 15,000 Angstroms. The pressure may level off and be maintained at a relatively constant level at accumulation levels greater than 15,000 Angstroms. The increase in the pressure may be is generally linear or non-linear (e.g., step-wise).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, the lower pressure within the processing chamber for lower accumulation levels results in lower ranges in variation and lower differences between the ranges in variation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example method <b>1000</b> for compensating for accumulation in a processing chamber to minimize WtW variability in a deposition step according to the present disclosure begins at <b>1004</b>.

In other words, the described embodiments are not mutually exclusive, and permutations of one or more embodiments with one another remain within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Spatial and functional relationships between elements (for example, between modules, circuit elements, semiconductor layers, etc.) are described using various terms, including &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; &#x201c;engaged,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;next to,&#x201d; &#x201c;on top of,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; and &#x201c;disposed.&#x201d; Unless explicitly described as being &#x201c;direct,&#x201d; when a relationship between first and second elements is described in the above disclosure, that relationship can be a direct relationship where no other intervening elements are present between the first and second elements but can also be an indirect relationship where one or more intervening elements are present (either spatially or functionally) between the first and second elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A OR B OR C), using a non-exclusive logical OR, and should not be construed to mean &#x201c;at least one of A, at least one of B, and at least one of C.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some implementations, a controller is part of a system, which may be part of the above-described examples. Such systems can comprise semiconductor processing equipment, including a processing tool or tools, chamber or chambers, a platform or platforms for processing, and/or specific processing components (a wafer pedestal, a gas flow system, etc.). These systems may be integrated with electronics for controlling their operation before, during, and after processing of a semiconductor wafer or substrate. The electronics may be referred to as the &#x201c;controller,&#x201d; which may control various components or subparts of the system or systems. The controller, depending on the processing requirements and/or the type of system, may be programmed to control any of the processes disclosed herein, including the delivery of processing gases, temperature settings (e.g., heating and/or cooling), pressure settings, vacuum settings, power settings, radio frequency (RF) generator settings, RF matching circuit settings, frequency settings, flow rate settings, fluid delivery settings, positional and operation settings, wafer transfers into and out of a tool and other transfer tools and/or load locks connected to or interfaced with a specific system.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Broadly speaking, the controller may be defined as electronics having various integrated circuits, logic, memory, and/or software that receive instructions, issue instructions, control operation, enable cleaning operations, enable endpoint measurements, and the like. The integrated circuits may include chips in the form of firmware that store program instructions, digital signal processors (DSPs), chips defined as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or one or more microprocessors, or microcontrollers that execute program instructions (e.g., software). Program instructions may be instructions communicated to the controller in the form of various individual settings (or program files), defining operational parameters for carrying out a particular process on or for a semiconductor wafer or to a system. The operational parameters may, in some embodiments, be part of a recipe defined by process engineers to accomplish one or more processing steps during the fabrication of one or more layers, materials, metals, oxides, silicon, silicon dioxide, surfaces, circuits, and/or dies of a wafer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The controller, in some implementations, may be a part of or coupled to a computer that is integrated with the system, coupled to the system, otherwise networked to the system, or a combination thereof. For example, the controller may be in the &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; or all or a part of a fab host computer system, which can allow for remote access of the wafer processing. The computer may enable remote access to the system to monitor current progress of fabrication operations, examine a history of past fabrication operations, examine trends or performance metrics from a plurality of fabrication operations, to change parameters of current processing, to set processing steps to follow a current processing, or to start a new process. In some examples, a remote computer (e.g. a server) can provide process recipes to a system over a network, which may include a local network or the Internet. The remote computer may include a user interface that enables entry or programming of parameters and/or settings, which are then communicated to the system from the remote computer. In some examples, the controller receives instructions in the form of data, which specify parameters for each of the processing steps to be performed during one or more operations. It should be understood that the parameters may be specific to the type of process to be performed and the type of tool that the controller is configured to interface with or control. Thus as described above, the controller may be distributed, such as by comprising one or more discrete controllers that are networked together and working towards a common purpose, such as the processes and controls described herein. An example of a distributed controller for such purposes would be one or more integrated circuits on a chamber in communication with one or more integrated circuits located remotely (such as at the platform level or as part of a remote computer) that combine to control a process on the chamber.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Without limitation, example systems may include a plasma etch chamber or module, a deposition chamber or module, a spin-rinse chamber or module, a metal plating chamber or module, a clean chamber or module, a bevel edge etch chamber or module, a physical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber or module, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber or module, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) chamber or module, an atomic layer etch (ALE) chamber or module, an ion implantation chamber or module, a track chamber or module, and any other semiconductor processing systems that may be associated or used in the fabrication and/or manufacturing of semiconductor wafers.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As noted above, depending on the process step or steps to be performed by the tool, the controller might communicate with one or more of other tool circuits or modules, other tool components, cluster tools, other tool interfaces, adjacent tools, neighboring tools, tools located throughout a factory, a main computer, another controller, or tools used in material transport that bring containers of wafers to and from tool locations and/or load ports in a semiconductor manufacturing factory.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
