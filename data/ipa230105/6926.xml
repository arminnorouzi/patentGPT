The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some networks rely on redundancy protection to ensure service availability and business continuity. For example, a set of nodes (e.g., network devices, such as firewalls, routers, gateways, or the like) may be configured as a high-availability (HA) cluster (i.e., a chassis cluster). When configured as a high-availability cluster, the set of nodes provides failover capability in the event of system, software, or hardware failure. In the high-availability cluster, a first node acts as a primary node and a second node acts as a secondary node. In situations where the primary node fails, the secondary node takes over the processing of network traffic and the performing of tasks that were assigned to the failed primary node. Often, the primary node of the HA cluster may become overloaded or otherwise subject to network traffic conditions that impact the primary's node ability to route the network traffic. Consequently, the network traffic may suffer from issues associated with high latency, low bandwidth, high jitter, and/or the like, even though the primary node has not failed. This may result in communication failure, packet data loss, traffic blackholing, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some implementations described herein provide a node that provides high-availability switchover based on traffic metrics. In some implementations, the node may be an active node associated with a high-availability service (e.g., the node may be included in a high-availability cluster) and may route session traffic communicated via a first route path between a first endpoint device and a second endpoint device. The node may determine a first measurement of a traffic metric (e.g., a latency metric, a bandwidth metric, a jitter metric, and/or the like) of the first route path and may receive, from another node associated with the high-availability service (e.g., the other node may be included in the same high-availability cluster or another high-availability cluster), a second measurement of the traffic metric of a second route path. The node may compare the first measurement and the second measurement and determine that the traffic metric is enhanced on the second route path relative to the first route path. The node may cause, via a high-availability link between the node and the other node, the second node to become the active node for routing the session traffic between the first endpoint and the second endpoint.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this way, the node described herein automatically allows session traffic to be routed via the second route path based on network traffic conditions associated with the first route path. Accordingly, the node enhances or improves the traffic metric associated with the session traffic and thus prevents, or reduces a likelihood of, communication failure, packet data loss, traffic blackholing, and/or the like. This also increases a robustness of the high-availability service associated with the node and therefore provides a high quality communication experience for users of devices that are associated with the high-availability service.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref> are diagrams of an example implementation <b>100</b> associated with HA switchover based on traffic metrics. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref>, example implementation <b>100</b> includes multiple endpoint devices (e.g., shown as endpoint device R<b>1</b> and endpoint device R<b>2</b>) and multiple nodes (e.g., shown as part of HA cluster A or HA cluster B). These devices are described in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. The multiple nodes may be connected to the endpoint device R<b>2</b> via one or more networks (e.g., shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref> as network <b>1</b> and network <b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> may be associated with a session service provider (e.g., for an application, a streaming media service, and/or the like). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the endpoint device may be connected to a session platform of the session service provider. The session platform may provide session traffic (e.g., application traffic, streaming media traffic, and/or the like) to the endpoint device R<b>1</b>, which may send the session traffic to the endpoint device R<b>2</b> (e.g., via the multiple nodes and/or the one or more networks). As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may be connected to a user device (e.g., of a customer of the session service provider) and may provide the session traffic to the user device (e.g., for display on a display of the user device).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> may be connected to one or more HA clusters, where an HA cluster includes two or more nodes. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> may be connected to an HA cluster A and an HA cluster B, where HA cluster A includes n nodes (where n&#x2265;2) and HA cluster B includes m nodes (where m&#x2265;2). A node A (e.g., an HA node) may be the primary node of the HA cluster A, and a node B (e.g., an HA node) may be the primary node of the HA cluster B.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The HA cluster A and the HA cluster B may provide a high-availability service, such that one HA cluster, of the HA cluster A and the HA cluster B, may be an active HA cluster that routes the session traffic between endpoint device R<b>1</b> and endpoint device R<b>2</b>, and another HA cluster, of the HA cluster A and the HA cluster B, may be a backup HA cluster (e.g., that routes the session traffic when HA cluster A fails). Accordingly, in some implementations, when the HA cluster A is the active HA cluster, the node A (e.g., because the node A is the primary node of the HA cluster A) is an active node that routes the session traffic, and the node B (e.g., because the node B is the primary node of the HA cluster B) is a backup node. When the HA cluster B is the active HA cluster, the node B (e.g., because the node B is the primary node of the HA cluster B) is the active node that routes the session traffic and the node A (e.g., because the node A is the primary node of the HA cluster A) is the backup node.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">While some implementations described herein are directed to the endpoint device R<b>1</b> connected to the HA cluster A and the HA cluster B, other configurations are possible. In a first example, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> may be connected to a first set of nodes (e.g., that is not an HA cluster) and a second set of nodes (e.g., that is not an HA cluster), where a first node (e.g., a node A) of the first set of nodes acts as a primary node of the first set of nodes and a second node (e.g., a node B) of the second set of nodes acts as a primary node of the second set of nodes. In a second example, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> may be connected to a first node (e.g., a node A) and a second node (e.g., a node B) (e.g., where the first node and second node are not included in an HA cluster). Accordingly, in either the first example or the second example, one node, of the first node and the second node, may be an active node that routes the session traffic between the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and endpoint device R<b>2</b> and another node, of the first node and the second node, may be a backup node.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, the HA cluster A may be physically separate from the HA cluster B. For example, a physical distance between a node of the HA cluster A and a node of the HA cluster B may satisfy (e.g., be greater than or equal to) a physical distance threshold. The HA cluster A may be connected to the HA cluster B via an HA link (e.g., an internet protocol (IP) link, a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) link, and/or the like). The HA link may connect some or all nodes of the HA cluster A to the HA cluster B. For example, the HA link may connect the node A and the node B.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the HA cluster A may be connected to network <b>1</b> and the HA cluster B may be connected to network <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the node A may be connected to network <b>1</b> and the node B may be connected to network <b>2</b>. Network <b>1</b> and network <b>2</b> may be separate networks (e.g., provided by separate network service providers). In some implementations, the HA cluster A and the HA cluster B (and the endpoint device R<b>2</b>) may be connected to the same network.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a path A and a path B may exist between the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b>, such that the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may communicate the session traffic via the path A or the path B. The path A may originate at the endpoint device R<b>1</b>, traverse the HA cluster A (e.g., that includes the node A) and the network <b>1</b>, and terminate at the endpoint device R<b>2</b>. The path B may originate at the endpoint device R<b>1</b>, traverse the HA cluster B (e.g., that includes the node B) and the network <b>2</b>, and terminate at the endpoint device R<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may communicate the session traffic via path A when the HA cluster A is active (e.g., when the node A is active) and may communicate the session traffic via path B when the HA cluster B is active (e.g., when the node B is active).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the HA cluster A (e.g., one or more nodes of the HA cluster A) and the HA cluster B (e.g., one or more nodes of the HA cluster B) may communicate via the HA link to establish an active HA cluster and a backup HA cluster for the endpoint device R<b>1</b> (e.g., by communicating border gateway protocol (BGP) messages). Additionally, or alternatively, the node A may communicate with the node B via the HA link to establish an active node and a backup node for the endpoint device R<b>1</b>. For example, as shown by reference number <b>102</b>, the node A may communicate with the node B to establish the node A as the active node and the node B as the backup node for the endpoint device R<b>1</b> (and/or to establish HA cluster A as the active HA cluster and HA cluster B as the backup HA cluster).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and by reference number <b>104</b>, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may communicate to establish a session between the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b>. For example, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may communicate messages (e.g., BGP messages) via path A (e.g., that traverses the HA cluster A and/or the node A and the network <b>1</b>) to establish the session. In some implementations (e.g., after the session is established), the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may communicate session traffic via path A. Accordingly, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and by reference number <b>106</b>, node A (and/or other nodes of the HA cluster A) may receive and route the session traffic between the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and the endpoint device R<b>2</b> (e.g., via the path A).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, and reference number <b>108</b><i>a, </i>the node A may measure one or more traffic metrics associated with the path A. A traffic metric associated with the path A may include, for example, a latency metric associated with the path A, a bandwidth metric associated with the path A, a jitter metric associated with the path A, and/or the like. In some implementations, to measure the one or more traffic metrics associated with the path A, the node A may transmit probe messages (e.g., dynamic probing messages, such as real-time performance monitoring (RPM) messages, two-way active measurement protocol (TWAMP) messages, and/or application quality of experience (AppQoE) messages, among other examples) to the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and/or the endpoint device R<b>2</b> (e.g., via the path A). In response, the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and/or the endpoint device R<b>2</b> may send response messages to the node A (e.g., via the path A). The node A may receive the response messages from the endpoint device R<b>1</b> and/or the endpoint device R<b>2</b> and may determine measurements of the one or more traffic metrics based on the response messages. For example, the node A may determine a measurement of a latency metric and/or a measurement of a jitter metric associated with the path A by comparing a time of transmission of one or more probe messages and a time of receipt of one or more corresponding response messages.
