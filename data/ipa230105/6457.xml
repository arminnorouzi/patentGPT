More specifically, the present disclosure relates to shunt implementation (e.g., packaging) in a battery system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure, which are described below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrical systems often include a battery system to capture (e.g., store) generated electrical energy and/or to supply electrical power. In fact, battery systems may be included in electrical systems utilized for various applications and/or with varying configurations. For example, a stationary power system may include a battery system that receives electrical power output by an electrical generator and stores the electrical power as electrical energy. In this manner, the battery system may supply electrical power to electrical loads using the stored electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, an electrical system in an automotive vehicle may include a battery system that supplies electrical power, for example, to provide and/or supplement the motive force (e.g., power) of the automotive vehicle. The battery system may include a battery control system that controls (e.g., monitors and/or manages) operation of the battery system. For example, the battery control system may determine operational parameters (e.g., voltage and/or current) of the battery system and instruct the battery system to adjust operation based at least in part on the operational parameters. Thus, implementation of the battery control system may vary based at least in part on implementation (e.g., configuration and/or organization) of the battery system. The battery system may also include sensing circuitry that detects the operational parameters. However, in some instances, coupling of the sensing circuitry to the remainder of the battery system may be affected when the battery system is in operation, which, at least in some instances, may affect a measurement accuracy of the operational parameters.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below.

In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, battery systems may be implemented to capture (e.g., store) electrical energy generated by one or more electrical generators and/or to supply electrical power to one or more electrical loads using stored electrical energy. Leveraging these benefits, one or more battery systems are often included in an electrical system. In fact, battery systems may be utilized in electrical systems with varying configurations to implement a wide-variety of target applications, for example, ranging from a stationary power system to a vehicular electrical system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To facilitate implementing different target applications, the configuration of an electrical system and, thus, the battery system used in the electrical system may be adjusted. For example, in one target application, the electrical system may include a first electrical load (e.g., component) designed to operate using electrical power in a high (e.g., 48V, 600V, or 720V) voltage domain and a second electrical load that operates using electrical power in a low (e.g., 3V, 5V, or 12V) voltage domain. As such, the battery system may be implemented to supply electrical power to the first electrical load in the high voltage domain.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, to facilitate providing the high voltage domain, the battery system may be implemented with multiple battery modules (e.g., packs) connected in series as one or more battery strings. Additionally, to facilitate providing sufficient electrical power to operate the first electrical load, in some embodiments, the battery system may be implemented with multiple battery modules and/or multiple battery strings connected in parallel. Furthermore, the battery system and/or an external power source may be implemented to supply electrical power to the second electrical load in the low voltage domain.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A vehicle that uses one or more battery systems for providing all or a portion of the motive power for the vehicle can be referred to as an xEV, where the term &#x201c;xEV&#x201d; is defined herein to include all of the following vehicles, or any variations or combinations thereof, that use electric power for all or a portion of their vehicular motive force. For example, xEVs include electric vehicles (EVs) that utilize electric power for all motive force. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), also considered xEVs, combine an internal combustion engine propulsion system and a battery-powered electric propulsion system, such as 48 Volt (V) or 130V systems.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term HEV may include any variation of a hybrid electric vehicle. For example, full hybrid systems (fHEVs) may provide motive and other electrical power to the vehicle using one or more electric motors, using only an internal combustion engine, or using both. In contrast, mild hybrid systems (mHEVs) disable the internal combustion engine when the vehicle is idling and utilize a battery system to continue powering the air conditioning unit, radio, or other electronics, as well as to restart the engine when propulsion is desired. The mild hybrid system may also apply some level of power assist, during acceleration for example, to supplement the internal combustion engine. Mild hybrids are typically 96V to 130V and recover braking energy through a belt or crank integrated starter generator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, a micro-hybrid electric vehicle (mHEV) also uses a &#x201c;Stop-Start&#x201d; system similar to the mild hybrids, but the micro-hybrid systems of a mHEV may or may not supply power assist to the internal combustion engine and operates at a voltage below 60V. For the purposes of the present discussion, it should be noted that mHEVs typically do not technically use electric power provided directly to the crankshaft or transmission for any portion of the motive force of the vehicle, but an mHEV may still be considered as an xEV since it does use electric power to supplement a vehicle's power needs when the vehicle is idling with internal combustion engine disabled and recovers braking energy through an integrated starter generator.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any vehicle that can be charged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the energy stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEVs are a subcategory of EVs that include all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A battery system in any of the aforementioned vehicles may include a battery control system to control operation (e.g., storage of electrical energy and/or supply of electrical power). In particular, the battery control system may control operation of the battery system by performing various functions, such as determining operational parameters (e.g., voltage, current, and/or temperature) related to operation of the battery system, communicating the operational parameters within the battery control system, communicating the operational parameters to an external communication network, and/or determining control commands instructing the battery system to perform control actions. For example, the battery control system may determine operational parameters of one or more battery cells in a battery module, one or more battery modules, one or more battery strings, and/or the battery system as a whole. Additionally, the battery control system may communicate the operational parameters to a supervisory control system that coordinates operation of sub-systems in the electrical system. Furthermore, the battery control system may communicate a control command instructing a relay (e.g., circuit breaker) to open when a fault is detected.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the battery control system may determine current flow through a battery module and control operation of the electrical system accordingly. To facilitate measuring current flow, a shunt may be electrically coupled to terminals of a battery cell of the battery system and electrically coupled with the rest of the electrical system, for example, to facilitate supplying and/or receiving electrical power. Additionally, the shunt may be electrically coupled to a sensing portion of the battery control system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various techniques may be utilized to electrically couple the sensing portion of the battery control system and the shunt. However, in some instances, the various techniques may affect implementation associated cost, such as component count, hardware footprint, and/or manufacturing steps. Moreover, in some instances, the various techniques may affect integrity of signals communicated from the sensing portion of the battery control system and, thus, measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in certain existing battery control systems, the shunt is coupled, via bus bars and/or soldering, to control circuitry that includes the sensing circuitry. However, certain forces may be imparted on the electrical system that may affect an integrity of the coupling. For example, torsional force may be exerted on the shunt and/or the bus bars, which may impart undesired stress on the solders and/or bus bars. As a result, the solders and/or bus bars may shift in position or otherwise be affected to reduce the electrical connection between the shunt and the control circuitry.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other existing systems, the sensing circuitry may be separate from the control circuitry and the shunt may be formed on the sensing circuitry, which may be coupled to the control circuitry via a flexible cable, for instance. However, movement of the flexible cable and/or distance between the control circuitry and the sensing circuitry may introduce noise in the communication signals and, thus, affect accuracy of the communication signals. Additionally, separating the sensing circuitry and the control circuitry may increase implementation associated costs, such as number of manufacturing steps.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To facilitate reducing implementation associated cost and/or improving measurement accuracy, the present disclosure provides techniques to implement a shunt in a cavity formed in a battery control system housing and coupled to the battery control system via an electrically conductive connector assembly. Additionally, the battery control system, including a control portion and a sensing portion, may be implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB) disposed within the battery control system housing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, spacing connectors and securing connectors may couple the shunt to the PCB. For example, the spacing connectors may be electrically conductive receptacles cups coupled to the PCB. In some embodiments, each receptacle cup may include a retaining spring contact. Additionally, in some embodiments, the securing connectors may be electrically conductive press fit pins coupled to each receptacle cup through an opening formed in the battery control system housing. In this manner, a shunt may be press fitted onto the press fit pins, thereby electrically coupling the shunt to the battery control system and mechanically securing the shunt in the cavity. Additionally or alternatively, the shunt may be mechanically secured within the cavity via ridges formed along one or more sidewalls of the cavity, for example, by press fitting.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Moreover, in some embodiments, the securing connectors may include electrically conductive fasteners. For example, a first set of fasteners may couple the housing and the PCB while a second set of fasteners couples the shunt and the housing. Additionally, the spacing connectors may include a set of electrically conductive bridges that may couple the first set of fasteners and the second set of fasteners, thereby electrically coupling the shunt to the battery control system and mechanically securing the shunt in the cavity. In some embodiments, the shunt may additionally or alternatively be mechanically secured in the cavity via overmolding.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Implementing (e.g., packaging) a shunt using any combination of the techniques described herein may increase measurement accuracy. In particular, mechanical (e.g., torsional, vibration, and/or shock) forces may be absorbed by the battery control system housing (e.g., cavity sidewall), thereby reducing likelihood that the torsional force disrupts electrical connections between the shunt and the battery control system, for example, compared to directly soldering the shunt to the PCB. Moreover, a likelihood of electromagnetic interference affecting measurement accuracy may be reduced, for example, compared to the flex cable due to reducing distance measurement signals travel between the sensing portion and the rest of the battery control system. In fact, in some embodiments, a length of the electrical connections (e.g., bridge and/or press fit pin) may be adjusted (e.g., optimized), for example, in a manner that produces acceptable voltage drop readings to improve measurement accuracy. Additionally, implementation associated cost may be reduced by enabling the battery control system to be implemented using fewer (e.g., one) printed circuit boards, for example, compared to implementing a dedicated sensing circuitry PCB that includes the sensing portion on the shunt and communicatively coupling the dedicated sensing circuitry PCB with the control circuitry PCB via a flex cable.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To help illustrate, an electrical system <b>10</b> including a battery system <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, in the depicted automotive vehicle <b>32</b>, the battery system <b>12</b> includes two battery modules <b>24</b>&#x2014;namely a first battery module <b>24</b>A and a second battery module <b>24</b>B.
