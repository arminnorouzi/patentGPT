Typically, ruby, ZrO<sub>2 </sub>or sapphire type jewels are used to form endstones or guide elements referred to as bearings. These endstones and guide elements are intended to come into contact with the pivots to make same capable of moving in rotation with minimal friction. They thus form, for example, all or part of a bearing of the arbor of the wheel set mounted such that it rotates. Jewels used as a rotational guide element for a pivot typically have a through-hole into which the pivot is inserted so as to bear on an endstone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example from the prior art of an assembly <b>1</b> comprising a jewel <b>2</b> provided with a hole <b>3</b> and a hemispherical recess <b>4</b> forming the entrance to the hole <b>3</b>. The assembly <b>1</b> further comprises a pivot <b>7</b> configured to be inserted into the hole <b>3</b> in order to allow a movable element, not shown in the figure, to rotate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In principle, synthetic jewels are used in horological movements. In particular, the Verneuil method is known for manufacturing monocrystalline-type jewels. Polycrystalline-type jewels also exist, which are manufactured by pressing a precursor in order to obtain a green body of the future jewel from a pressing tool.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Once formed, the jewels are typically subjected to a method for depositing an epilame on the jewel. The epilame is a thin layer that allows the physical properties of the surface of the jewel to be modified.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The surface finish is important for contact with liquids, in particular for lubricating the jewel, for example with a pivot. More specifically, a drop of liquid deposited on the surface of the jewel forms a contact angle that varies depending on the surface finish. The smaller the angle, the more the drop spreads over the surface, and the larger the angle, the more the drop remains bulging on the surface of the jewel. For example, for an epilame-coated jewel, the angle of a drop of lubricating oil is about 44&#xb0;, whereas without epilame, the drop forms a smaller angle, and is thus spread further. Typically, spreading of the drop, for improved lubrication, is only desired for example between the jewel and the pivot.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the drawback of the epilame layer is that the effect thereof remains limited to an angle of less than 50&#xb0;, even though it effectively increases the contact angle. On the other hand, the epilame layer wears out over time, as the adhesion of the epilame layer to the jewel is not optimal. As a result, the wear of the epilame layer reduces the adhesion of the lubricating oil.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The purpose of the invention is to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, and aims to provide a jewel with a larger contact angle with the lubricating oil, and with a longer life.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To this end, the invention relates to a method for treating a jewel, in particular a horological jewel, the jewel comprising a body defining the shape thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method is noteworthy in that it comprises a step of ion implantation on the surface of the body to modify the roughness of said surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Ion implantation increases or decreases the relief of the surface of the jewel, which changes the roughness thereof. Depending on the size of the implanted ions, a different roughness is obtained, as the ions structure the surface differently. Some ions increase the roughness, whereas other ions decrease the roughness of the surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, ion implantation can produce two opposite effects of particular interest depending on the ion chosen for implantation. With some ions, ion implantation allows the contact angle with a liquid to be decreased, whereas with other ions, the contact angle with a liquid increases.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, by decreasing the contact angle of the surface, the adhesion of an epilame layer deposited on this ion implanted surface is increased. The life of the epilame layer is thus increased, which wears out less quickly than a layer deposited on a jewel without ion implantation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, by increasing the contact angle of the surface of the jewel, the need for an epilame layer can be dispensed with, and the lubricating oil can be disposed directly on the jewel. This simplifies the jewel manufacturing method, as it avoids the need to deposit an epilame layer, and can even achieve far higher contact angles than those obtained with an epilame layer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the method comprises a step of depositing an epilame layer on the surface of the jewel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the epilame layer comprises chromium nitride, and is preferably made entirely thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the step of depositing the epilame layer is carried out by PVD, PECVD.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the ions implanted on the surface reduce the contact angle of a drop of liquid, the contact angle being less than 40&#xb0; for a drop of water.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the implanted ions are helium or argon.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the ions implanted on the surface of the body increase the contact angle of a drop of liquid, the contact angle being greater than 50&#xb0;, or even greater than 70&#xb0;, for a drop of water.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the implanted ions are nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the ion implantation step is carried out by ECR-type magnetic electron cyclotron resonance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the ion implantation step is carried out using plasma.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the body of the jewel is previously formed in a first step by a Verneuil-type method for a monocrystalline jewel or by a sintering method for a polycrystalline jewel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the jewel comprises Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and is preferably made entirely thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other specific features and advantages will be clearly observed in the following description, which is given as a rough guide and in no way as a limiting guide, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagrammatic view of a bearing for a pivot according to one known embodiment from the prior art;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a method for producing a jewel according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagrammatic view of a jewel obtained using a first embodiment of the method according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagrammatic view of a jewel obtained using a second embodiment of the method according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As explained hereinabove, the invention relates to a method <b>10</b> for the surface treatment of a jewel capable of forming a guide element of a timepiece, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The jewel is, for example, intended to come into contact with a pivot, also referred to as a trunnion, for example of a balance staff, in order to make same able to rotate with minimal friction. It is thus understood that the present invention in particular allows a jewel to be treated, which jewel is capable of forming all or part of a bearing of a staff mounted such that it can rotate, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the method <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the body of the jewel is formed in a first step <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For a polycrystalline-type jewel, a precursor is produced from a mixture of at least one powder material with a binder. This material can be, in a non-limiting and non-exhaustive manner, ceramic. In this context, the ceramic-based powder can contain at least a metal oxide, a metal nitride or a metal carbide. For the purposes of illustration, the ceramic-based powder can contain aluminium oxide in order to form synthetic sapphire or a mixture of aluminium oxide and chromium oxide to form poly-ruby of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>type, or zirconium ceramic of the ZrO<sub>2 </sub>type. Moreover, the binder can have various natures such as, for example, of the polymer or organic type.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A step of pressing the precursor is then carried out with an upper die and a lower die of a pressing device in order to form a green body of the future jewel.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sintering is then carried out for said green body in order to form the mineral body of the future jewel in said at least one material. The material can be, as stated hereinabove, ceramic. In other words, this step is intended to sinter the green body to form a ceramic body of the future perforated jewel. Preferably, according to the invention, the sintering step can include pyrolysis, for example by thermal debinding.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mineral body can be machined, for example to shape the top face and bottom face in order to obtain a predefined jewel thickness. Machining can also consist of drilling a hole through the jewel if necessary, and of functionalising the surfaces of the body.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Lapping and/or brushing and/or polishing the mineral body procures a special finish. This finishing step gives the jewel a surface finish that is compatible with the use thereof. Such a finishing step further allows the final dimensions to be adjusted and/or edges to be removed and/or the surface roughness to be modified locally.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For a monocrystalline jewel, the body is formed using a Verneuil-type method. A Verneuil-type method comprises a step of melting a material that will crystallise upon contact with a single-crystal seed. Corundum (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is typically used as a starting material. Machining and lapping are similar to the embodiment of the polycrystalline-type jewel.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the invention, a second step <b>12</b> of the method <b>10</b> consists of treating at least a part of the surface of the body by ion implantation. Ion implantation is a technology that allows ions to be incorporated into a material.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, it allows for nanostructuring by modifying the relief of the surface of the body. More specifically, the implantation of ions into the surface creates a relief, which modifies the roughness of the surface. Depending on the type of ions implanted, a different roughness is obtained, as the ions have different sizes, which structure the surface differently. Some ions increase the roughness, whereas other ions decrease the roughness of the surface. Increasing the roughness increases the contact angle, whereas decreasing the roughness decreases the contact angle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Facilities exist for such a treatment, which comprise an ion source, a particle accelerator using electrostatic properties to create a beam of ions and an enclosure containing the body of the jewel to receive the ions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferred alternative embodiment, the implantation is carried out by immersing the body of the jewel in an ionic plasma. The jewel is submerged into an ion plasma, for example by an ECR-type electron cyclotron resonance method.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first embodiment of the second step <b>12</b> of the method <b>10</b> consists of implanting ions on the surface of the jewel, which ions allow the contact angle of a liquid on said surface to be decreased. The contact angle obtained is preferably less than 40&#xb0; for a drop of water. Thus, such a surface allows the adhesion of a layer deposited on the surface of the body, for example an epilame layer, to be improved. Preferably, the ions implanted on the surface of the jewel are helium or argon ions, as they decrease the contact angle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a second embodiment of the second step <b>12</b>, ions are implanted into the jewel, which ions allow the contact angle of a drop of liquid on the surface of the jewel to be increased. Preferably, the ions implanted on the surface of the jewel are nitrogen ions. The contact angle is greater than 60&#xb0;, or even greater than 70&#xb0; for a drop of water. This avoids the need for an epilame layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, the ions are implanted into the body at a depth of up to 150 nm.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A third step <b>13</b> of the method <b>10</b> is optional depending on the chosen embodiment, and preferably applies to the first embodiment. The third step <b>13</b> consists of depositing an epilame layer on the part of the surface treated by ion implantation in the second step. The epilame layer is preferably a chromium nitride layer. An epilame layer is typically deposited in the vapour phase by a PVD- or PECVD-type method. The epilame layer preferably has a thickness of 0.003 to 0.006 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Optionally, laser nanostructuring of the epilame layer can be carried out in a fourth step <b>14</b>. Thus, it is possible to select which part of the surface of the jewel has an epilame layer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The part of the jewel <b>20</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, corresponds to a jewel treated according to the first embodiment. The jewel <b>20</b> comprises a body <b>23</b>, the surface <b>24</b> whereof has been implanted with ions that reduce the contact angle of a liquid. The jewel <b>20</b> further includes an epilame layer <b>21</b> deposited on this surface <b>24</b>. As can be seen, a drop of liquid deposited on the epilame layer forms a contact angle greater than 40&#xb0; for a drop of oil.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The part of the jewel <b>30</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, corresponds to a jewel treated according to the second embodiment. The jewel <b>30</b> comprises a body <b>25</b>, the surface <b>27</b> whereof has been implanted with ions that allow the contact angle of a drop of liquid to be increased. This jewel does not require an epilame layer, which is absent in the figure. A drop of water, for example, forms a contact angle of at least 70&#xb0; thanks to the ion implantation.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
