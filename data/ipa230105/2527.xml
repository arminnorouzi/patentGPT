description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a copolymer, a resin composition, a molded product, a filmy molded product, and a method for producing a copolymer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An acrylic resin is excellent in transparency, weather resistance, an elastic modulus, surface hardness, and the like, and thus has been widely used for liquid crystal or organic EL display front plates, signboard products, lighting products, home appliances, vehicle interior/exterior materials, industrial materials, construction materials, lenses, light guide plates, light condensing members, optical films used for liquid crystal or organic EL displays, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in some of these applications, acrylic resin products are required to have improved impact resistance while a high elastic modulus is maintained. Further, it is required that the acrylic resin can be molded into a shape with a small thickness or a complicated shape by using a melt molding method such as injection molding or extrusion molding. That is, there is a demand for an acrylic resin with excellent melt moldability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses, as a technique for improving the impact resistance of an acrylic resin, a resin composition obtained by blending rubber (core-shell rubber) that has a core-shell structure having a core portion consisting of crosslinked rubber and a shell portion ensuring dispersibility and compatibility between the core portion and a (meth)acrylic polymer serving as a matrix, with a (meth)acrylic resin.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the resin composition described in Patent Document 1 contains core-shell rubber, the melt viscosity is likely to increase and the melt moldability is likely to decrease, and thus there is a problem in that the applications of the resin composition are limited to resin products with a large thickness or resin products with a simple shape. Further, although the molded product formed of the resin composition is transparent around room temperature, there is a problem in that the transparency is degraded in a high temperature environment. Further, when an acrylic resin blended with core-shell rubber is molded into a film, there is a problem in that the film is whitened when the film is bent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a method for solving the above-described problems, a resin composition obtained by blending a block copolymer or a graft copolymer (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;block/graft copolymer&#x201d;) in place of the core-shell rubber with a (meth)acrylic resin has been known. Since the block/graft copolymer is formed such that two or more polymer segments are linked to each other via a chemical bond, a phase separation structure of the resin composition obtained by blending the block/graft copolymer having a poly(meth)acrylate chain with an acrylic resin has a nanometer size (also referred to as &#x201c;microphase separation structure&#x201d;). Therefore, in the resin composition and the molded product obtained by molding the resin composition, the characteristics of both the acrylic resin serving as a matrix and the block/graft copolymer can be exhibited, and the characteristics of each polymer segment of the block/graft copolymer can be exhibited.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The acrylic resin has excellent transparency, but has a problem of being hard and brittle. However, since the microphase separation structure is formed in the resin composition obtained by blending the block/graft copolymer with the acrylic resin, the transparency of the acrylic resin is favorably maintained in the molded product obtained by molding the resin composition, and the characteristics (for example, the impact resistance) of each polymer segment of the block/graft copolymer can be exhibited.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a technique for improving the impact resistance of the acrylic resin using a block copolymer, for example, Patent Document 2 describes that a block copolymer is obtained by a method for performing controlled radical polymerization in the presence of a nitroxide. Specifically, Patent Document 2 discloses a technique for obtaining a sheet-like molded product containing a block copolymer using a method for adding syrup to a mold and performing polymerization to produce a cast sheet. It is described that the obtained sheet-like molded product contains an acrylic resin and a block copolymer having a polymethyl methacrylate chain and an n-butyl acrylate/styrene copolymer chain and has excellent impact resistance and transparency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, as a method for producing the block/graft copolymer described above, a method for producing an acrylic macromonomer (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;macromonomer&#x201d;) in advance using an extremely small amount of a cobalt complex having an extremely high chain transfer constant and copolymerizing the macromonomer and other monomers to produce a block/graft copolymer is known. The method for producing an acrylic macromonomer using a cobalt complex is known as a catalytic chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) method. The macromonomer is a polymer containing a polymerizable functional group in the molecular structure and is also referred to as a macromer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent Document 3 discloses a technique for improving impact resistance by applying CCTP to an emulsion polymerization method to produce a macromonomer, copolymerizing the obtained macromonomer with another acrylic monomer using the emulsion polymerization method to produce a graft copolymer (comb copolymer) (corresponding to &#x201c;block/graft copolymer&#x201d; of the present application), and adding the obtained graft copolymer to a thermoplastic resin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, Patent Document 4 discloses a technique for achieving the balance between impact resistance and transparency by applying CCTP to a suspension polymerization method to produce a macromonomer, copolymerizing the obtained macromonomer with other acrylic monomers using a solution polymerization method to produce a macromonomer copolymer, and adding the obtained macromonomer copolymer to an acrylic resin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[Patent Document 1]</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0013">Japanese Examined Patent Application, Second Publication No. S62-21804</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">[Patent Document 2]</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2008-274290</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">[Patent Document 3]</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0015">Published Japanese Translation No. 2004-509195 of the PCT International Publication</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">[Patent Document 4]</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2018-159023</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, since the synthesis of the block copolymer, the synthesis of the polymethyl methacrylate serving as a matrix, and the production of the molded product are performed at the same time in the method described in Patent Document 2, there is a problem in that the melt molding method cannot be applied and the molded product cannot be molded into a shape with a small thickness or a complicated shape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Meanwhile, in the method described in Patent Document 3, the molded product formed of a thermoplastic resin composition to be obtained is not transparent because the refractive index of the graft polymer and the refractive index of the acrylic resin serving as the matrix are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, in the method described in Patent Document 4, the transparency of the molded product to be obtained is not sufficient because the refractive index of the macromonomer copolymer and the refractive index of the acrylic resin serving as a matrix are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An object of the present invention is to solve the above-described problems.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">That is, an object of the present invention is to provide a molded product having excellent impact resistance and excellent transparency in a wide use temperature range and a resin composition with excellent melt moldability for molding the molded product.

When the polymerization temperature is extremely low, there is a concern that the reaction proceeds slowly and thus the polymerization time increases.
