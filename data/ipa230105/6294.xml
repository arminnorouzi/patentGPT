level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2020-0061858 filed on May 22, 2020 in the Republic of Korea, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a battery technology, and more specifically, to a technology that allows smooth communication connection and power supply with a vehicle when a battery is mounted to the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently commercialized secondary batteries include nickel cadmium battery, nickel hydrogen battery, nickel zinc battery, lithium secondary battery, and so on. Among these, the lithium secondary battery has almost no memory effect to ensure free charge and discharge, compared to the nickel-based secondary battery, and the lithium secondary battery is spotlighted due to a very low discharge rate and a high energy density.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The lithium secondary battery mainly uses a lithium-based oxides and a carbon material as a positive electrode active material and a negative electrode active material, respectively. The lithium secondary battery includes an electrode assembly in which a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate respectively coated with the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material are disposed with a separator being interposed therebetween, and an exterior, or a battery case, for hermetically accommodating the electrode assembly together with an electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, the lithium secondary batteries may be classified into a can-type secondary battery having an electrode assembly included in a metal can and a pouch-type secondary battery having an electrode assembly included in a pouch of an aluminum laminate sheet, depending on the shape of the exterior.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The secondary batteries have been widely used to supply an operation power to portable terminals such as smart phones and laptop computers for several decades, and recently, as the development and distribution of electric vehicles expand, the secondary batteries are recognized as a very important part serving as a driving energy source that enables electric vehicles to move. In particular, since high output and capacity are required to drive an electric vehicle, the secondary battery is not used alone, but a large number of secondary batteries are connected in series and/or parallel to each other to constitute one high-voltage battery pack, and the battery pack is mounted to the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The battery pack for supplying a driving power for moving the vehicle as described above may be configured to be attachable to and detachable from a vehicle. Further, as the shared e-mobility business is activated, the secondary battery may be configured to be easily mounted to and detached from a vehicle by not only professional technicians but also general drivers. For example, in order to use a shared vehicle, a user may carry a battery pack and directly mount it after reaching the shared vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a situation, if the battery pack is mounted to the vehicle, it is necessary to properly supply a power between the vehicle and the battery pack. In particular, the vehicle is equipped with a control unit such as a VCU (Vehicle Control Unit), and when the battery pack is mounted, it is necessary to perform smooth communication between the control unit of the vehicle and the battery pack. In general, when a driver starts the vehicle, a power supply request signal may be transmitted from the vehicle control unit (VCU) to the battery pack, so that a driving power is supplied from the battery pack to a motor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, if communication between the control unit of the vehicle and the battery pack is not smoothly performed, a situation may occur in which the power supply request signal is not transmitted from the control unit of the vehicle to the battery pack even if the driver sends a request for starting. In addition, due to this, the vehicle may not start properly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the electric vehicle may be separately equipped with an auxiliary battery for supplying a power to electrical components of the vehicle, such as an instrument panel, a radio, a navigation system and an air conditioner, in addition to the battery pack for supplying a driving power. At this time, the control unit of the vehicle such as the VCU may also be operated by receiving a power from the auxiliary battery. However, if the auxiliary battery is fully discharged, an operation power is not supplied to the control unit of the vehicle, so the control unit of the vehicle cannot transmit a start request signal or the like to the battery pack. Therefore, even if the battery pack is fully charged, the vehicle may not be started since auxiliary battery of the vehicle is fully discharged.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, in the case of a shared vehicle, since the vehicle is not directly managed by a user, it is impossible to properly figure out in advance whether the auxiliary battery of the vehicle is in a fully discharged state. In addition, since the vehicle is not always located at a service provider due to the characteristics of the shared vehicle, it is difficult to manage whether the auxiliary battery provided in each vehicle is fully discharged one by one.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is designed to solve the problems of the related art, and therefore the present disclosure is directed to providing a battery pack for a vehicle, which is configured to efficiently supply a power to the vehicle when the battery pack is mounted to an electric vehicle, and a vehicle including the battery pack.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objects and advantages of the present disclosure may be understood from the following detailed description and will become more fully apparent from the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Also, it will be easily understood that the objects and advantages of the present disclosure may be realized by the means shown in the appended claims and combinations thereof</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a battery pack, which is configured to be mountable to and detachable from a vehicle driven by a motor and having a vehicle control unit to supply a driving power to the motor, the battery pack comprising: a battery cell having at least one secondary battery; a power supply terminal configured to be connectable to a connection terminal of the vehicle that is connected to the vehicle control unit and the motor; a power supply path located between the power supply terminal and the battery cell and configured to supply a power from the battery cell to the power supply terminal; a switching unit provided on the power supply path and configured to electrically turn on/off the power supply path; a mounting recognition unit configured to recognize whether the battery pack is mounted to the vehicle; and a processor configured to control the switching unit so that a power is supplied from the battery cell to the vehicle control unit, when receiving a signal from the mounting recognition unit that the battery pack is recognized as being mounted to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Here, the processor may be configured to be communicable with the vehicle control unit and transmit a response signal to the vehicle control unit when receiving a start request signal of a user from the vehicle control unit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the power supply terminal may include a control power terminal configured to be connectable to a connection terminal of the vehicle control unit and a driving power terminal configured to be connectable to a connection terminal of the motor, and the power supply path may include a control power path connected between the battery cell and the control power terminal and configured to supply an operation power to the vehicle control unit and a driving power path connected between the battery cell and the driving power terminal and configured to supply a driving power to the motor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the switching unit may include a control switching unit provided on the control power path to switch whether or not to supply the operation power and a driving switching unit provided on the driving power path to switch whether or not to supply the driving power.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, the processor may be configured to turn on the control switching unit so that an operation power is supplied from the battery cell to the vehicle control unit, when the mounting recognition unit recognizes that the battery pack is mounted.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the processor may be configured to turn on the driving switching unit so that a driving power is supplied from the battery cell to the motor, when receiving a start request signal of a user from the vehicle control unit.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, when the vehicle includes an auxiliary battery for supplying a power to the vehicle control unit, the processor may be configured to control the switching unit so that a power is supplied from the battery cell to the auxiliary battery, thereby supplying a power to the vehicle control unit indirectly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the mounting recognition unit may be configured to be physically deformed when the battery pack is placed at a designated position of the vehicle to recognize whether the battery pack is mounted.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the mounting recognition unit may include a GPS module to recognize whether the battery pack is mounted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another aspect of the present disclosure, there is also provided a vehicle, comprising the battery pack according to the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, with respect to the battery pack configured to be attachable to and detachable from a vehicle, it is possible to determine whether the battery pack is mounted to the vehicle by itself</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, even if a separate signal is not received from the control unit of the vehicle, a power may be smoothly supplied from the battery pack to the vehicle, particularly to the control unit of the vehicle. Therefore, according to this embodiment of the present disclosure, the battery pack may be configured to perform smooth communication between the battery pack and the vehicle control unit, when the battery pack is mounted to a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, if an auxiliary battery for supplying a power to the vehicle control unit is provided to the vehicle, even if the auxiliary battery is in a fully discharged state, an operating power may be automatically supplied to the vehicle control unit or the auxiliary battery by mounting the battery pack. In addition, due to this, communication between the vehicle control unit and the battery pack may be made normally. Therefore, even if the auxiliary battery of the vehicle is fully discharged, the user may start and drive the vehicle normally.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, according to this embodiment of the present disclosure, it is possible to prevent a problem that the vehicle cannot be started due to full discharge of the auxiliary battery to cause unexpected damage to a driver.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, this embodiment of the present disclosure may be more effectively applied to a shared e-mobility business and the like. That is, even though a driver using a shared vehicle service or a service provider providing such a service does not check whether the auxiliary battery is fully discharged, just by mounting the battery pack to the vehicle, it is possible to charge the auxiliary battery or supply an operation power to the vehicle control unit, so the vehicle can be started normally. Accordingly, a driver using the shared vehicle service may use the corresponding service smoothly, and it is possible to reduce the management and maintenance cost of a service provider providing the service.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, effects of various embodiments according to the present disclosure may be achieved, and some other effects will be described later in each embodiment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The accompanying drawings illustrate a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure and together with the foregoing disclosure, serve to provide further understanding of the technical features of the present disclosure, and thus, the present disclosure is not construed as being limited to the drawing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram schematically showing a functional configuration of a battery pack according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a connection configuration between a battery pack and a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a circuitry connection configuration between the battery pack and the vehicle according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a circuitry connection configuration between the battery pack and the vehicle according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a circuitry connection configuration between the battery pack and the vehicle according to still another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a circuitry connection configuration between the battery pack and the vehicle according to still another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of a mounting recognition unit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of the mounting recognition unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in a state where the battery pack is mounted to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of a mounting recognition unit according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In addition, the mounting recognition unit <b>150</b> may include a voltage applying unit <b>155</b> so that a + terminal and a &#x2212; terminal thereof are respectively connected to the two coupling pieces <b>151</b> to apply a predetermined voltage. However, since the two coupling pieces <b>151</b> are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance, a current may not flow therebetween. In addition, an connection piece <b>152</b> may be provided to be spaced apart from the two coupling pieces <b>151</b> by a predetermined distance, for example to be spaced apart by a predetermined distance in a lower direction as shown in the drawing. The connection piece <b>152</b> may be made of an electrically conductive material. In addition, the connection piece <b>152</b> is placed on a moving cover <b>153</b>, the moving cover <b>153</b> may be connected to the pack case <b>101</b> through an elastic body <b>154</b>.

Also, the moving cover <b>153</b> may be made of an electrically non-conductive material, for example, a plastic material. In addition, if the battery pack <b>100</b> is placed on the vehicle <b>10</b> as indicated by an arrow d, the moving cover <b>153</b> may be configured to be movable, so that the mounted connection piece <b>152</b> may connect the two coupling pieces <b>151</b> to each other.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">More specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, if the battery pack <b>100</b> is mounted at a correct position on the mounting portion of the vehicle <b>10</b>, such as a vehicle body, the vehicle fastening portion p may be inserted into the pack fastening portion g. At this time, the vehicle fastening portion p configured in a protrusion shape protruding in an upper direction pushes the moving cover <b>153</b> in an upper direction, as indicated by an arrow el in the figure, and the elastic body <b>154</b> may be stretched. In addition, as the moving cover <b>153</b> moves as above, the connection piece <b>152</b> placed on the upper portion of the moving cover <b>153</b> also moves in the upper direction, so that both ends of the connection piece <b>152</b> may contact the two coupling pieces <b>151</b>. At this time, since a power is applied between the two coupling pieces <b>151</b> by the power applying unit <b>155</b>, as indicated by an arrow e<b>2</b>, a current may flow between the two coupling pieces <b>151</b>.

Moreover, in the case of a shared vehicle used for e-mobility service, since a GPS module may be almost necessarily mounted, it may be possible to figure out the position of the vehicle through the GPS module of the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle position information figured out in this way may be stored in a separate server through a wireless communication network and then transmitted to the mounting recognition unit <b>150</b>, or may be transmitted directly to the mounting recognition unit <b>150</b> of the battery pack <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In this case, the mounting recognition unit <b>150</b> may determine whether the battery pack <b>100</b> is mounted to the vehicle <b>10</b> by comparing the separately provided position information of the vehicle with the location information of the battery pack <b>100</b> figured out by itself.
