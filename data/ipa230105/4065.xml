For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2021-86066 (Patent Literature 1) discloses an optical unit which includes a movable body having a camera module and a fixed body swingably holding the movable body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A case which swingably holds a movable body having an optical module is commonly structured and used in a state that the optical module is attached to the movable body. The optical module commonly includes an imaging element in addition to a lens, and a flexible wiring board which is electrically connected with the imaging element is commonly extended from the optical module. The flexible wiring board is used for swingably holding the movable body with respect to a fixed body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional optical unit, in order to swing a movable body by a sufficient amount of swing with respect to a fixed body, a flexible wiring board which is structured in a specially customized shape is used. However, manufacturing of an optical module having a flexible wiring board in a specially customized structure and a dedicated case to which the optical module is attached requires time and labor and a high cost.

According to this structure, various optical modules which are capable of swinging with the axial line direction as a swing axis can be utilized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the case in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the movable body is capable of swinging with respect to the fixed body only with the axial line direction of the optical module as a swing axis. According to this structure, a thickness in the optical axis direction of the case can be reduced. Further, a structure of the case can be simplified and thus, a cost of the case can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the case in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the movable body is capable of swinging with respect to the fixed body, in addition to the swing axis in the axial line direction, with a direction intersecting the axial line direction as a swing axis. According to this structure, the optical module can be swung with respect to the case with a plurality of swing axes as references and thus, further various types of optical modules can be used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the case in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the second flexible wiring board is provided with a first extended part which is extended in a first direction and a second extended part which is extended in a second direction intersecting the first direction. According to this structure, the second flexible wiring board can be resiliently bent in various directions and the movable body can be swingably held with a sufficient amount of swing with respect to the fixed body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An optical unit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes the above-mentioned case and an optical module.
