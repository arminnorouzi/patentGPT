Here, the display panel may be a flat panel display panel or a curved display panel, and because a plurality of inorganic light emitting diodes (inorganic LEDs; e.g., micro LEDs or mini LEDs) of less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m is mounted, it may provide better contrast, response time, and energy efficiency compared to a liquid crystal display (LCD) which requires a backlight.

The inorganic light emitting device may be a semiconductor chip configured to emit light on its own when power is supplied. A micro LED, which is an inorganic light emitting device, may have a relatively fast response rate, low power, and a high brightness. For example, the micro LED may have higher efficiency in converting electricity to photons compared to the LCD or the OLED of the related art. For example, a brightness per watt of the micro LED may be higher compared to the LCD or the OLED display of related art. Accordingly, the micro LED may be configured to show a same brightness with about half of an energy compared to the LED (width, length and height respectively exceeding 100 &#x3bc;m) or the OLED of related art.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition to the above, the micro LED may realize a relatively high resolution, a superior color, shading and brightness, express color of a wide range accurately, and realize a screen that is clear even in the outdoors where sunlight is bright. Further, the micro LED may be guaranteed a long life span because it is resistant against a burn in phenomenon and there is no deformation due to little heat being generated. The micro LED may have a flip chip structure in which an anode electrode and a cathode electrode are formed at a same first surface and a light-emitting surface is formed at a second surface positioned at an opposite side of the first surface at which the electrodes are formed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, a substrate may be disposed with a TFT layer on which a thin film transistor (TFT) circuit is formed at a front surface, and disposed with a timing controller configured to control a power supply circuit and a data driving driver configured to supply power to a TFT circuit, a gate driving driver and respective driving drivers at the rear surface.
