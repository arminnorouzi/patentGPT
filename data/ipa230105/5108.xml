This approach requires preparation of the reference images with different resolutions, which greatly increases the workload of reference data preparation. Maybe due to inconsistency of different reference images in geographic space, geometric positions of images with different resolutions are also inconsistent, and geometric normalization of multi-scale images cannot be truly achieved. In addition, the reference images are stored in the form of a single file, and the geometric normalization processing can only be performed on a desktop computer or a server storing the reference images, and a plurality of devices cannot be used for parallel processing at the same time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a flowchart of a remote sensing image geometric normalization method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the remote sensing image geometric normalization method includes:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">S<b>11</b>: constructing a pyramid tile structure for a reference image, and releasing reference tile data, wherein the reference tile data is data in the pyramid tile structure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In an implementation, the constructing the pyramid tile structure for the reference image, and releasing the reference tile data, includes:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">determining the number of levels of tiles in a pyramid tile structure to be constructed and an image resolution of each of the levels;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Specifically, it is necessary to perform image resampling and slicing on all reference images to construct reference tile data in a pyramid structure. In a case of constructing a pyramid tile, first, the number of levels of the tiles and an image resolution of each of the levels are determined. Usually, the image resolutions to be processed range from the centimeter-level to the kilometer-level. Therefore, in a case of constructing a tile data structure, the resolutions should cover resolutions ranging from the centimeter-level to the kilometer-level.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">slicing the reference image in accordance with a preset level and a preset resolution to construct the pyramid tile structure; and</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Specifically, a size and the naming rule of the tile also need to be determined. The size of the tile is usually 256*256 or 512*512, and a file may be named by a row number, a column number, and a level of the tile.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">releasing the reference tile data through a web map tile service protocol.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Specifically, after the reference image is sliced in accordance with a set level and resolution, the data is released by using the WMTS (Web Map Tile Service) protocol. During the geometric normalization after the releasing, the tile data may be downloaded through the WMTS protocol.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">S<b>12</b>: calculating a level of a tile to be downloaded and a name of the tile to be downloaded according to a resolution and geographic coordinates of an image to be subjected to geometrical normalization, and downloading corresponding data from the reference tile data according to the level of the tile to be downloaded and the name of the tile to be downloaded, to obtain a standard tile set.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Specifically, before the geometric normalization, it is first necessary to determine the level of the obtained tile according to the resolution of the image to be processed. A determination standard is that the resolution of the level of the tile is similar to the resolution of the image to be processed, and the resolution of the image to be processed is better than the resolution of the level of the tile. After the level of the tile is determined, the number of tiles to be obtained and the tile file names are calculated and determined according to a geographic space range of the image to be processed and the naming rule of the tile file. Then all tile data is downloaded through a multi-threading manner.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">S<b>13</b>: performing a first geometric correction on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization and tiles in the standard tile set, to obtain a first image processing result.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">In an implementation, the performing the first geometric correction on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization and the tiles in the standard tile set, includes:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">in a case that a resolution of the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization is higher than a preset resolution threshold, performing a rational polynomial coefficients RPC correction on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization; and</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Specifically, at present, for high-resolution images, all images obtained by users are images with the RPC parameter, and the RPC correction needs to be performed before use.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">in a case that the resolution of the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization is lower than or equal to the resolution threshold, performing a correction according to locating information of the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Specifically, low-resolution images have generally their own latitude and longitude data. Therefore, for the low-resolution images, a rough geometric correction (the first geometric correction) is performed by using their own longitude and latitude data. In the rough geometric correction (the first geometric correction), since their own longitude and latitude data may not be consistent with the size of the image, first, it is necessary to interpolate the longitude and latitude data to generate longitude and latitude data that is consistent with the size of the original image, and then the interpolated latitude and longitude data is used to perform geometric positioning of the original image to generate a remote sensing image with projection information.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In an implementation, the performing the RPC correction on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization, includes:</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">selecting the tiles from the standard tile set based on a sampling interval, according to an arrangement order of the tiles in the standard tile set, to perform image matching on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization, to obtain the control points;</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">updating an RPC parameter by using the control points; and</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">performing the RPC correction on the image to be subjected to geometrical normalization by using an updated RPC parameter through a digital elevation model.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Specifically, for most sensors, the RPC parameter is not accurate enough due to the influence such as a satellite attitude. Therefore, before the RPC correction, a small number of control points are required to optimize the RPC parameter, and then DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data and the optimized RPC parameter are used to perform the RPC correction. In order to ensure absolute geometric precision, it is usually carried out by manually collecting control points. In the present disclosure, in order to ensure relative consistency of the multi-scale images in a spatial position, the relative geometric precision is required. Therefore, an image matching method is used to obtain a small number of uniform control points. During the image matching, according to the arrangement order of the tile images, every M rows and N columns, a tile file is selected for the image matching, and sizes of M and N are determined according to the number and a range of the tile data. In a case that the tile data is matched with the image, an image area corresponding to the tile data is automatically estimated according to the RPC parameter, and then the commonly used SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features), and other feature matching algorithms with scale and rotation invariant to perform automatic matching. After the automatic matching is completed, methods such as the RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) and the least square fit are used to eliminate wrong control points.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">S<b>14</b>: matching the first image processing result with the tiles in the standard tile set, to obtain a plurality of control points, and calculating a result evaluation precision by using the plurality of control points.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In an implementation, a mean square error of the first image processing result relative to the reference image is calculated according to the control points, and the mean square error is determined as the result evaluation precision;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">wherein a formula of calculating the result evaluation precision is:</p><p id="p-0081" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RMSE=&#x221a;{square root over ((<i>x</i><sub>i</sub><i>&#x2212;x</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2032;)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>y</i><sub>i</sub><i>&#x2212;y</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2032;)<sup>2</sup>)}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">wherein RMSE is the evaluation precision, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) are coordinates of a control point i on the first image processing result, and (x<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;, y<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;) are coordinates on the first image processing result to which coordinates of the control point i on the reference image are converted according to geographic coordinates.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">Specifically, after the geometric correction is performed, the automatic image matching method is used to complete automatic matching of the tile data and the corrected image, and the control points are homogenized, and then these control points are used to calculate the mean square error (RMSE) of the corrected image relative to the reference image.

In actual geometric fine correction (the second geometric correction), an appropriate automatic image matching method is selected according to imaging characteristics and a resolution of the image. For the medium and high resolution images, a feature matching method with scale and rotation invariance may usually be selected, and for the low resolution images, contours of surface features, large rivers, large estuaries, and large lakes with obvious characteristics may be selected for matching. During automatic matching, automatic matching of each tile and corresponding area data of image is completed successively. After the automatic matching is completed, methods such as the RANSAC and the least square fit are used to eliminate wrong control points.
