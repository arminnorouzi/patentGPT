In order to respond to such market demand, development of a display device using a self-light emitting element is in progress. The appearance of a display device using a micro LED, which is a fine light emitting element, is expected as a self-light emitting element. As a method for manufacturing a display device using micro LEDs, a method of sequentially transferring individually formed micro LEDs to a drive circuit has been introduced. However, as the number of micro LED elements increases as the image quality increases to full HD, 4K, 8K, etc., a large number of micro LEDs are individually formed and sequentially transferred to the substrate on which the drive circuit and the like are formed. An enormous amount of time is required for the transfer process. In addition, poor connection between the micro LED and the drive circuit or the like may occur, resulting in a decrease in yield.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A technique is known in which a semiconductor layer including a light emitting layer is grown on a Si substrate, and electrodes are formed on the semiconductor layer and then bonded to a circuit substrate on which a drive circuit is formed (for example, JP 2002-141492 A (Kokai)).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for manufacturing an image display device and the image display device are provided, in which transferring process of a light emitting element is reduced and a yield is improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for manufacturing an image display device is disclosed.

In the region where the relative value of the current density is larger than 1.0, the light emission efficiency decreases monotonously. That is, the pixel LED has an appropriate current density that maximizes the light emission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">It is expected that a highly efficient image display device can be realized by suppressing the current density to such an extent that sufficient luminance can be obtained from the light emitting element. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows that the light emission efficiency tends to decrease as the current density decreases at a low current density.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">As described in the first embodiment and the second embodiment, the light emitting element is formed by individually separating all layers of the semiconductor layer <b>1150</b> including the light emitting layer by etching or the like. At this time, the bonding surface between the light emitting layer and the n-type semiconductor layer is exposed at the end portion. Similarly, the bonding surface between the light emitting layer and the p-type semiconductor layer is exposed at the end portion.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">When such an end exists, electrons and holes recombine at the end portion. On the other hand, such recombination does not contribute to light emission. The recombination at the end portion occurs almost independently of the current flowing through the light emitting element. The recombination is considered to occur according to the length of the bonding surface that contributes to the light emission at the end portion.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">When two light emitting elements having a cubic shape having the same size are caused to emit light, the end portions are formed in four directions for each light emitting element, and therefore, recombination may occur at a total of eight end portions.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">In contrast, in the present embodiment, the semiconductor layers <b>350</b>, <b>350</b><i>a</i>, and <b>3350</b><i>a </i>having two light emitting surfaces have four end portions. The region between the openings <b>358</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>358</b>-<b>2</b> has few injections of electrons and holes and hardly contributes to light emission. Therefore, it can be considered that there are six end portions contributing to light emission. Thus, in the present embodiment, the number of end portions is substantially reduced, so that recombination that does not contribute to light emission can be reduced, and it becomes possible to reduce the drive current accordingly. When the distance between subpixels is shortened or the current density is relatively high for high definition or the like, in the subpixel group <b>320</b> of the third embodiment, the distance between the light emitting surfaces <b>351</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>351</b>S<b>2</b> becomes shorter. In this case, if the n-type semiconductor layer <b>351</b> is shared, a portion of the electrons injected to the adjacent light emitting surface may be diverted, and the light emitting surface on the side that is not driven may slightly emit light. In the modification, because the n-type semiconductor layer is separated for each light emitting surface, generation of slight light emission on the light emitting surface that is not driven can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In the present embodiment, the semiconductor layer including the light emitting layer is formed by stacking the p-type semiconductor layer, the light emitting layer, and the n-type semiconductor layer in this order from the interlayer insulating film side, and the exposed surface of the n-type semiconductor layer is roughened. This is preferable from the viewpoint of improving the light emission efficiency. As in the case of the first embodiment, the stacking order of the p-type semiconductor layer and the n-type semiconductor layer may be changed, and the n-type semiconductor layer, the light emitting layer, and the p-type semiconductor layer may be stacked in this order.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0255" num="0254">The image display device described above can be, for example, a computer display, a portable terminal such as a TV or a smartphone, or a car navigation as an image display module having an appropriate number of pixels.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an image display device according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a main part of the configuration of the computer display.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, an image display device <b>401</b> includes an image display module <b>402</b>.
