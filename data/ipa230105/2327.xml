More particularly, the invention provides inhibitors or inactivators of protein arginine deiminase 1 (PAD1), pharmaceutical compositions and methods of preparation and use thereof. The invention also relates to molecular probes based on such compounds and methods of preparation and use thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Citrullination, a post-translational modification (PTM) of arginine, plays pivotal roles in several physiological processes, including the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-formation and DNA-damage induced apoptosis. (Brinkmann, et al. <i>Science </i>2004, 303, 1532-1535; Fuhrmann, et al. <i>Chem. Rev. </i>2015, 115, 5413-5461; Kenny, et al. <i>Elife </i>2017, 6; d) Mondal, et al. <i>Acc. Chem. Res. </i>2019, 52, 818-832.)</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Protein citrullination is catalyzed by a family of cysteine hydrolases, termed protein arginine deiminases or PADs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Although five PAD isozymes (PAD1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) are known, only four of them (PADs1-4) are catalytically active. PAD activity is tightly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PADs contain 4 (PAD1), 5 (PAD3, 4) or 6 (PAD2) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. (Arita, et al. <i>Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. </i>2004, 11, 777-783; Saijo, et al. <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>2016, 428, 3058-3073; Slade, et al. <i>ACS Chem. Biol. </i>2015, 10, 1043-1053.)</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PADs catalyze the hydrolysis of the guanidium side chain of arginine to generate citrulline. Aberrant PAD activity leads to numerous autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and certain cancers. These pathologies established the PADs as therapeutic targets and multiple small molecule PAD inhibitors are known.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding leads to the formation of a catalytically competent active site through a series of dramatic conformational changes that reorient key catalytic residues. Catalysis is mediated by a nucleophilic cysteine (C645 in PAD1, 4; C647 in PAD2; C646 in PAD3), a histidine (H471), and two aspartates (D350 and D473) that properly orient the substrate guanidium group for nucleophilic attack by the cysteine. In addition to their important physiological roles, aberrant protein citrullination leads to several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and ulcerative colitis as well as certain cancers. These disease links have established multiple PADs as promising therapeutic targets. (Fuhrmann, et al. <i>Chem. Rev. </i>2015, 115, 5413-5461; Mondal, et al. <i>Acc. Chem. Res. </i>2019, 52, 818-832.)</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cl-amidine and BB-Cl-amidine are two widely used pan-PAD inhibitors that possess a chloroacetamidine warhead that covalently modifies the active site cysteine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). Although these inhibitors exhibit similar potencies for the inhibition of PADs1-4, BB-Cl-amidine exhibits superior efficacy in cells and animal models of disease owing to its higher cell permeability and metabolic stability. (Knight, et al. <i>Ann. Rheum. Dis. </i>2015, 74, 2199-2206; Luo, et al. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2006, 128, 1092-1093.)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Interestingly, o-Cl-amidine, with a carboxylate substitution on the Cl-amidine scaffold, exhibits superior potencies for PAD inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). (Causey, et al. <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>2011, 54, 6919-6935.) A crystal structure of PAD4 in complex with o-F-amidine, a fluoroacetamidine-containing analogue of o-Cl-amidine, indicates that the carboxylate group forms a direct hydrogen bond with W347 (universally conserved amongst the PADs) and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Q346 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). However, o-Cl-amidine exhibits poor cellular efficacy, likely due to the negatively charged carboxylate that limits cell permeability.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is an urgent and growing need for novel therapeutics and treatment methods that provide improved clinical effectiveness with reduced side effects, in particular through safe and effective inhibition or inactivation of PAD1.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention provides novel inhibitors or inactivators of PAD1, and pharmaceutical compositions and methods of preparation and use thereof. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be used to treat a number of diseases and conditions (e.g., cancers and autoimmune diseases).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also provides novel molecular probes (e.g., imaging probes) for PAD1. These molecular probes are based on the PAD1 inhibitors or inactivators disclosed herein in conjugation with detectable labels, such as fluorescent dyes. These probes may be adapted for use in screening to identify PAD1 inhibitors or inactivators.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Significantly, the disclosed compounds are the highly selective and potent PAD1 inhibitors. A core feature is the iodine substitution(s) in these inhibitors which are crucial for both potency and selectivity. Without being bound to the theory, detailed structure-activity relationships revealed that their potency and selectivity is due in large part to the formation of a halogen bond with PAD1. These inhibitors inhibit histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells and mouse zygotes with excellent potency. Also developed, based on this inhibitor scaffold, was a series of PAD1-selective activity-based probes that show remarkable cellular efficacy and proteome selectivity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect, the invention generally relates to a compound having the structural formula (I),</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="51.82mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230002328A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0017" num="0000">wherein<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">each of R<sub>a </sub>and R<sub>b </sub>is H or D;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">X is a halogen atom;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">R<sup>2 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of: H, OH or OCH<sub>3</sub>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">R<sup>4 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of: H, halogen, ethynyl (HC&#x2261;C&#x2014;)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0019">each of R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>5 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of: H, Cl, Br, I, <sup>i</sup>Pr (isopropyl);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0020">R<sup>6 </sup>is H or R;

The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on, for example, the particular compounds chosen, the species of subject and their age/existing health conditions or risk for health conditions, the dosing regimen to be followed, the severity of the disease, whether it is administered in combination with other agents, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0136">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;treating&#x201d; a disease or disorder refers to a method of reducing, delaying or ameliorating such a condition before or after it has occurred. Treatment may be directed at one or more effects or symptoms of a disease and/or the underlying pathology. Treatment is aimed to obtain beneficial or desired results including, but not limited to, therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient can still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the pharmaceutical compounds and/or compositions can be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. The treatment can be any reduction and can be, but is not limited to, the complete ablation of the disease or the symptoms of the disease. As compared with an equivalent untreated control, such reduction or degree of prevention is at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100% as measured by any standard technique.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0137">As used herein, the term &#x201c;therapeutic effect&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described herein.

Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines, including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt can be chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0141">n certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a pharmaceutically acceptable ester. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable ester&#x201d; refers to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Such esters can act as a prodrug as defined herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl esters of acidic groups, including, but not limited to, carboxylic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphinic acids, sulfinic acids, sulfonic acids and boronic acids. Examples of esters include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates. The esters can be formed with a hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of the parent compound.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0142">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a &#x201c;solvate&#x201d; (e.g., a hydrate). As used herein, the term &#x201c;solvate&#x201d; refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water, the solvate is a &#x201c;hydrate&#x201d;. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes that, for example, can include 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or 1 to about 2, about 3 or about 4, solvent or water molecules.

A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis (e.g., hydrolysis in blood). In certain cases, a prodrug has improved physical and/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs can increase the bioavailability of the compound when administered to a subject (e.g., by permitting enhanced absorption into the blood following oral administration) or which enhance delivery to a biological compartment of interest (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent compound. Exemplary prodrugs include derivatives of a disclosed compound with enhanced aqueous solubility or active transport through the gut membrane, relative to the parent compound.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0144">The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., <i>Design of Prodrugs </i>(1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., &#x201c;Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,&#x201d; <i>A.C.S. Symposium Series</i>, Vol. 14, and in <i>Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design</i>, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. Exemplary advantages of a prodrug can include, but are not limited to, its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound, or it can enhance absorption from the digestive tract, or it can enhance drug stability for long-term storage.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0145">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; excipient, carrier, or diluent refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject pharmaceutical agent from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body.

The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be used to treat various diseases and conditions that are mediated by PAD1. Diseases and conditions that may benefit from treatment using the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include cancer (e.g., breast cancer) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0160">The invention also provides novel potent and selective molecular probes (e.g., imaging probes) for PADs based on the inhibitors or inactivators of PAD1 disclosed herein in conjugation with detectable labels such as fluorescent dyes, and methods of use thereof. The molecular imaging probes of the invention may be used to screen compounds for PAD1 inhibition or inactivation.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0161">A core feature of the highly potent PAD1 selective inhibitors (e.g., 1 and 19) disclosed herein is iodine substitutions crucial for potency and selectivity. Detailed structure-activity relationships indicate that their potency and selectivity is due to the formation of a halogen bond with PAD1. These inhibitors inhibit histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells and mouse zygotes with excellent potency. Also disclosed herein is a PAD1-selective activity-based probe that shows remarkable cellular efficacy and proteome selectivity useful as chemical tools to understand PAD1 biology.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0162">The first-generation inhibitors suffered from a number of limitations including their susceptibility to proteolysis and poor membrane permeability.

The later moieties were included to enhance the permeability and stability of the inhibitor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Notably, this compound contains the less-reactive fluoroacetamidine warhead, which has less off-target toxicity.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0165">Remarkably, 1 exhibits 74-fold selectivity for PAD1 over the other PADs with a k<sub>inact</sub>/K<sub>1 </sub>value of 10,400&#xb1;2,380 M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).

Since fluoroacetamidine-containing compounds afford better isozyme-selectivity, only these compounds in the SAR analysis are discussed below. However, the activity of the chloroacetamidine-containing compounds are given in Tables 1-2 and they follow similar trends to the fluoroacetamidine-containing compounds. Briefly, 3 and 5, which replace the 2-hydroxyl with a methoxy and hydrogen substitution, respectively, exhibit similar potency for PAD1 but a significant loss in selectivity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1). By contrast, 7, which lacks the iodo groups at 3- and 5-positions, shows an 87-fold drop in potency for PAD1 and a remarkable loss in selectivity. In fact, 7 is 21-fold selective for PAD4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0242">These results indicate that the 2-hydroxyl group is important for PAD1 selectivity, while the iodo groups are responsible for both potency and PAD1 selectivity. Given this data, it was initially hypothesized that the iodo groups contribute to potency and selectivity via the formation of favourable hydrophobic interactions with PAD1. However, 9, which replaces the iodo groups with hydrophobic and isosteric isopropyl groups, exhibited almost identical activity as 7, indicating that the iodo groups are involved in halogen bond formation with PAD1.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0243">To validate the possible formation of halogen bonds between compound 1 and PAD1, 11-14 were synthesized with bromo- and chloro substitutions at the 3- and 5-positions. Since the positive potential on halogens decreases in the order: I&#x3e;Br&#x3e;Cl, a hallmark feature is that the strength of a halogen bond follows the same order. Therefore, if the potency and selectivity of 1 is due to formation of an halogen bond with PAD1, they are expected to decrease in the order: I&#x3e;Br&#x3e;Cl. In fact, a gradual decrease was observed in both potency and selectivity upon replacement of the iodo groups. For example, 11 is 3-fold less potent than 1 and exhibits only 25-fold PAD1 selectivity, whereas 13 is 8-fold less potent than 1 and exhibits only 10-fold selectivity for PAD1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0244">Additionally, the k<sub>inact </sub>and K<sub>1 </sub>values for 1, 11 and 13 reveal that while these compounds share similar inactivation rates (k<sub>inact</sub>), there was a gradual decrease in binding affinity, as measured by an increase in K<sub>I</sub>, as one goes from 1 (12.5 &#x3bc;M) to 11 (54.8 &#x3bc;M) to 13 (124.5 &#x3bc;M) (Table S2). These observations clearly indicate that the potency and selectivity of 1 originates from the iodo groups that form halogen bonds with PAD1. Although different halogens are also expected to alter the pK<sub>a </sub>of the 2-hydroxyl, and thereby enhance hydrogen bond formation of this group to W347, the potency of the inhibitor is expected to increase as the electronegativity of the halogen atoms increase.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0245">The halogen-dependent change in potency of the PAD1 inhibitors was further confirmed using an activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) assay that uses the PAD-targeted probe, rhodamine-conjugated F-amidine (RFA, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). (Luo, et al. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2006, 128, 14468-14469.)</p><p id="p-0197" num="0246">RFA enables the covalent modification and fluorescent labelling of PADs with the help of its fluoroacetamidine and rhodamine moieties, respectively. However, in the presence of a PAD inhibitor that can compete for binding to the active site, RFA labelling is inhibited. (Mondal, et al. <i>ACS Chem. Biol. </i>2018, 13, 1057-1065.) Using this assay, 1 inhibited RFA labelling of PAD1 with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 18 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Interestingly, compounds 11, 13 and 7 with bromo-, chloro- and hydrogen substitutions at the 3- and 5-positions, respectively, exhibit a gradual decrease in the potency of inhibiting RFA labelling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Similar results were obtained with the chloroacetamidine-containing compounds 2, 12, 14 and 8 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0247">Having established their importance, next studied was whether both iodo groups contribute to potency and selectivity. Although a structure of PAD1 in complex with 1 would address this issue, several attempts to crystallize this complex were unsuccessful. Therefore, 15-18 were synthesized which contain an iodo group at either the 3- or 5-position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Notably, 15 and 17 are 7- and 35-fold less potent than the parent compound 1. Furthermore, 15 and 17 were only 13- and 3-fold selective for PAD1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1). These results indicated that both iodines were important for potency and PAD1 selectivity. Moreover the data indicate that the 3-iodine places the iodine at the 5-position in a suitable position to form a halogen bond. Since electron withdrawing substituents increase the halogen bond strength by increasing the positive potential on halogen, we synthesized 19 and 20 which contain a fluoro substitution in the parent scaffold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). 19 exhibited improved potency (k<sub>inact</sub>/K<sub>I</sub>=13250&#xb1;2870 M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and was 44-fold selective for PAD1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0248">Next evaluated was the cellular potency of these inhibitors in PAD1-overexpressing HEK293TPAD1 cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> for PAD1 expression). It was found that PAD1 citrullinates histone H3 at the 2, 8 and 17 positions in vitro and in HEK293TPAD1 cells in the presence of calcium (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0249">Compounds 1 and 19 inhibited histone H3 citrullination in a dose-dependent manner with EC<sub>50 </sub>values of 14.5 and 31.8 &#x3bc;M, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>). In contrast to the 6-7-fold higher in vitro potency, chloroacetamidine-containing compounds 2 and 20 exhibit only 1.3-2-fold higher activity in cells compared to 1 and 19 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). These results indicate that despite having a lower in vitro potency, fluoroacetamidine-containing compounds can exhibit similar cellular activity to chloroacetamidine-containing compounds, likely due to their lower off-target toxicity. Interestingly, the cellular activities of 1, 7, 11 and 13 for the inhibition of histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells also follow the order 1&#x3e;11&#x3e;13&#x3e;7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>), paralleling their in vitro potencies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). It is recognized, however, that this trend may also be due to a combination of potency and cell permeability as the lipophilicity of these compounds follows the same order. Notably, the Efficacy Index (the ratio of cytotoxicity to EC<sub>50</sub>) of 1 and 19 are 17 and 10, respectively, indicating that these compounds inhibit cellular PAD1 without causing significant toxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0250">PAD1 is the predominant nuclear PAD in early embryos and PAD1-catalyzed histone H3 citrullination is essential for early embryo development. (Zhang, et al. <i>Sci. Rep. </i>2016, 6, 38727.) Depletion of PAD1 in mouse zygotes does not affect oocyte maturation or pronuclear formation but dramatically arrested early embryo development at the 4-8-cell stage. Encouraged by the inhibition of histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells, 1 and 19 were evaluated in pronuclear (PN) zygotes. Treatment with 1 and 19 led to dramatic arrest of embryo development at the morula stage, while 87% of the control zygotes progressed to the blastocyst stage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, E). Furthermore, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of the embryos at the 4-cell stage indicate that 1 and 19 dramatically inhibit histone H3 citrullination that correlates with the arrest of embryo development (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>F</figref> and S10). These observations indicate that 1 and 19 can inhibit endogenously expressed cellular PAD1 in mouse zygotes.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0251">Using this inhibitor scaffold, 21 and 22 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) were developed, which include an alkyne handle that can be conjugated with fluorescent (TAMRA)- or biotin-containing reporter tags using the copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ABPP-based applications. Similar to the parent compounds, 21 and 22 exhibited almost 34- and 9-fold selectivity for PAD1 over the other PADs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and Table 1). When conjugated with fluorescent TAMRA-N<sub>3 </sub>using CuAAC, 21 dose-dependently labels recombinant PAD1 and the limit of detection (LOD) of recombinant PAD1 by 21 is 4.3 pmol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, see top and bottom for dose-dependence and LOD, respectively). Similar results were obtained with 22 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Fluorescence intensities, normalized against the Coomassie stain intensities, for the labelling of PADs1-4 by 21 and 22 indicate that 21 exhibits significant selectivity for PAD1, whereas 22 was less selective (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Therefore, 21 was used for fluorescent labelling of PAD1 in HEK293TPAD1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0252">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> and S12, compound 21 labeled PAD1 in HEK293TPAD1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Remarkably, 21 exhibited an impressive LOD of 72 pmol of PAD1 in HEK293TPAD1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>). Encouraged by the selective labelling of PAD1 by 21 in HEK293TPAD1 cells, it was used to establish a target engagement assay to evaluate the cellular potency of PAD1 inhibitors. For this application, compound 1 was used as an inhibitor of labelling of PAD1 by 21. Interestingly, compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited the labelling of PAD1 by 21 in HEK293TPAD1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>) with an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 12.7 &#x3bc;M, which was similar to that obtained for the inhibition of histone H3 citrullination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0253">Furthermore, CuAAC was performed on a 21-labeled proteome from HEK293TPAD1 cells with Biotin-N3 and selectively captured the biotinylated proteins on streptavidin-agarose beads followed by an on-bead digestion of the captured proteins with trypsin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C and <b>17</b></figref>). Reductive methylation (ReDiMe) was then performed on the trypsin digest with heavy (for the 21-treated samples) or light (for control samples) formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. Subsequent proteomic analysis afforded the enrichment ratio of the proteins that were covalently modified by 21. PAD1 was main protein isolated by 21 in HEK293TPAD1 cells, indicating the remarkable proteome-wide selectivity of this molecular scaffold. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0254">In summary, iodinated chemical probes were developed with excellent potency and PAD1 selectivity. The high potency and selectivity arise mainly from the iodo groups, which form halogen bonding interactions with PAD1. These PAD1 inhibitors inhibit histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells and mouse embryos with excellent efficacy. Significantly, this is the first demonstration of a potent PAD1 inhibitor with a fluoroacetamidine warhead and the potential use of halogens to increase the potency and isozyme-selectivity of PAD inhibitors.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Experimental</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Materials and Methods:</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0255">Fmoc-Orn(Boc)-OH, HBTU, HOBt and N-iodosuccinimide were bought from Chem-Impex International, Inc.
