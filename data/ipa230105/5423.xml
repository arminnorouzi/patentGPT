In the data writing period, the switch SW<b>1</b> and the switch SW<b>2</b> are turned on, and the switch SW<b>3</b> is turned off. Thus, the data potential is supplied to the gate of the transistor Tr<b>1</b> through the switch SW<b>1</b>.

In the holding and light-emitting period, the switch SW<b>1</b> and the switch SW<b>3</b> are turned off, and the switch SW<b>2</b> is turned on. Thus, the current flowing through the transistor Tr<b>1</b> flows into the light-emitting/receiving element ME through the switch SW<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the path of current is indicated by a dashed arrow.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">By turning off the switch SW<b>3</b> in the data writing period and the holding and light-emitting period, the light-emitting/receiving element ME and the transistor Tr<b>2</b> can be electrically insulated from each other.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates an operation in a period during which the light-emitting/receiving element ME receives light and electric charge is accumulated in the light-emitting/receiving element (a light exposure period). Electric charge is accumulated at both ends of the light-emitting/receiving element ME in the light exposure period, whereby a potential difference Vc between the anode and the cathode of the light-emitting/receiving element ME is changed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the light exposure period, the switch SW<b>1</b>, the switch SW<b>2</b>, and the switch SW<b>3</b> are all turned off. Thus, the light-emitting/receiving element ME is electrically insulated from both the transistor Tr<b>1</b> and the transistor Tr<b>2</b>. Consequently, the electric charge accumulated on the anode side of the light-emitting/receiving element ME can be prevented from flowing toward the transistor Tr<b>1</b> and the transistor Tr<b>2</b>. As a result, image capturing with high accuracy can be performed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Note that in the light exposure period, the switch SW<b>1</b> may be turned on. In that case, data potential writing may be performed in the light exposure period. In other words, a period during which light exposure and data writing are concurrently performed may be provided.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates an operation in a period during which the electric charge accumulated in the light-emitting/receiving element ME is transferred to the node to which the gate of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is connected (a transfer period). In the transfer period, the switch SW<b>1</b> and the switch SW<b>2</b> are turned off, and the switch SW<b>3</b> is turned on. Thus, the electric charge accumulated in the light-emitting/receiving element ME is transferred through the switch SW<b>3</b> to the node to which the gate of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is connected. By turning off the switch SW<b>3</b> after transfer of the electric charge is completed, the potential of the gate of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is held.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">By turning off the switch SW<b>2</b> in the transfer period, the light-emitting/receiving element ME and the transistor Tr<b>1</b> can be electrically insulated from each other. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, a current can be prevented from flowing from the wiring AL through the transistor Tr<b>1</b>, the switch SW<b>2</b>, and the switch SW<b>3</b> to the node to which the gate of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is connected. In particular, in the case where the data potential is held at the gate of the transistor Tr<b>1</b> and the transistor Tr<b>1</b> is on, turning off the switch SW<b>2</b> can favorably prevent electric charge from flowing from the wiring AL to the gate of the transistor Tr<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the light exposure period and the transfer period, the data potential is preferably held at the gate of the transistor Tr<b>1</b>. Thus, by switching the switch SW<b>2</b> from the off state to the on state after the transfer period ends, the light-emitting/receiving element ME can be made to emit light immediately without additional data writing. Accordingly, a period during which an image is not displayed (a non-display period) is not caused in the period after the transfer period is completed until an image is displayed; hence, degradation of display quality can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this manner, the switch SW<b>2</b> is controlled to be turned on in a period during which an image is displayed, and to be turned off in a period during which image capturing is performed (the light exposure period and the transfer period). That is, the switch SW<b>2</b> can be referred to as a switch for switching between image display and image capturing. By providing the switch SW<b>2</b> between the transistor Tr<b>1</b> and the light-emitting/receiving element ME, the functions of the light-emitting/receiving element ME can be reliably switched.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Structure Example 2</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A more specific structure example of the display apparatus of one embodiment of the present invention will be described below.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a block diagram for illustrating a structure of a display apparatus <b>10</b>.

Alternatively, the formation of an exciplex can be confirmed by a difference in transient response, such as a phenomenon in which the transient photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of the mixed film has longer lifetime components or has a larger proportion of delayed components than that of each of the materials, observed by comparison of the transient PL of the hole-transport material, the transient PL of the electron-transport material, and the transient PL of the mixed film of these materials.

Note that a GIXD method is also referred to as a thin film method or a Seemann-Bohlin method.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0406">For example, the XRD spectrum of a quartz glass substrate shows a peak with a substantially bilaterally symmetrical shape. On the other hand, the peak of the XRD spectrum of an IGZO film having a crystal structure has a bilaterally asymmetrical shape. The asymmetrical peak of the XRD spectrum clearly shows the existence of crystal in the film or the substrate.

For example, a halo pattern is observed in the diffraction pattern of the quartz glass substrate, which indicates that the quartz glass substrate is in an amorphous state. Furthermore, not a halo pattern but a spot-like pattern is observed in the diffraction pattern of the IGZO film deposited at room temperature.

Examples of the non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include the above-described CAAC-OS and nc-OS. Other examples of the non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0409">Here, the above-described CAAC-OS, nc-OS, and a-like OS are described in detail.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">[CAAC-OS]</heading><p id="p-0411" num="0410">The CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor that has a plurality of crystal regions each of which has c-axis alignment in a particular direction. Note that the particular direction refers to the film thickness direction of a CAAC-OS film, the normal direction of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed, or the normal direction of the surface of the CAAC-OS film. The crystal region refers to a region having a periodic atomic arrangement. When an atomic arrangement is regarded as a lattice arrangement, the crystal region also refers to a region with a uniform lattice arrangement. The CAAC-OS has a region where a plurality of crystal regions are connected in the a-b plane direction, and the region has distortion in some cases. Note that the distortion refers to a portion where the direction of a lattice arrangement changes between a region with a uniform lattice arrangement and another region with a uniform lattice arrangement in a region where a plurality of crystal regions are connected. That is, the CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor having c-axis alignment and having no clear alignment in the a-b plane direction.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0411">Note that each of the plurality of crystal regions is formed of one or more fine crystals (crystals each of which has a maximum diameter of less than 10 nm). In the case where the crystal region is formed of one fine crystal, the maximum diameter of the crystal region is less than 10 nm. In the case where the crystal region is formed of a large number of fine crystals, the size of the crystal region may be approximately several tens of nanometers.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0412">In the case of an In-M-Zn oxide (the element M is one or more kinds selected from aluminum, gallium, yttrium, tin, titanium, and the like), the CAAC-OS tends to have a layered crystal structure (also referred to as a layered structure) in which a layer containing indium (In) and oxygen (hereinafter, an In layer) and a layer containing the element M, zinc (Zn), and oxygen (hereinafter, an (M,Zn) layer) are stacked. Indium and the element M can be replaced with each other. Therefore, indium may be contained in the (M,Zn) layer. In addition, the element M may be contained in the In layer. Note that Zn may be contained in the In layer. Such a layered structure is observed as a lattice image in a high-resolution TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) image, for example.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0413">When the CAAC-OS film is subjected to structural analysis by out-of-plane XRD measurement with an XRD apparatus using &#x3b8;/2&#x3b8; scanning, for example, a peak indicating c-axis alignment is detected at 2&#x3b8; of 31&#xb0; or around 31&#xb0;. Note that the position of the peak indicating c-axis alignment (the value of 2&#x3b8;) may change depending on the kind, composition, or the like of the metal element contained in the CAAC-OS.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0414">For example, a plurality of bright spots are observed in the electron diffraction pattern of the CAAC-OS film. Note that one spot and another spot are observed point-symmetrically with a spot of the incident electron beam passing through a sample (also referred to as a direct spot) as the symmetric center.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0415">When the crystal region is observed from the particular direction, a lattice arrangement in the crystal region is basically a hexagonal lattice arrangement; however, a unit lattice is not always a regular hexagon and is a non-regular hexagon in some cases. A pentagonal lattice arrangement, a heptagonal lattice arrangement, and the like are included in the distortion in some cases. Note that a clear grain boundary cannot be observed even in the vicinity of the distortion in the CAAC-OS. That is, formation of a grain boundary is inhibited by the distortion of lattice arrangement. This is probably because the CAAC-OS can tolerate distortion owing to a low density of arrangement of oxygen atoms in the a-b plane direction, an interatomic bond distance changed by substitution of a metal atom, or the like.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0416">A crystal structure in which a clear grain boundary is observed is what is called polycrystal. It is highly probable that the grain boundary becomes a recombination center and captures carriers and thus decreases the on-state current and field-effect mobility of a transistor, for example. Thus, the CAAC-OS in which no clear grain boundary is observed is one of crystalline oxides having a crystal structure suitable for a semiconductor layer of a transistor. Note that Zn is preferably contained to form the CAAC-OS. For example, an In&#x2014;Zn oxide and an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide are suitable because they can inhibit generation of a grain boundary as compared with an In oxide.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0417">The CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor with high crystallinity in which no clear grain boundary is observed. Thus, in the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is unlikely to occur. Moreover, since the crystallinity of an oxide semiconductor might be decreased by entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like, the CAAC-OS can be regarded as an oxide semiconductor that has a small amount of impurities or defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies). Hence, an oxide semiconductor including the CAAC-OS is physically stable. Therefore, the oxide semiconductor including the CAAC-OS is resistant to heat and has high reliability. In addition, the CAAC-OS is stable with respect to high temperature in the manufacturing process (what is called thermal budget). Accordingly, the use of the CAAC-OS for the OS transistor can extend the degree of freedom of the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0000">[nc-OS]</p><p id="p-0420" num="0418">In the nc-OS, a microscopic region (e.g., a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, in particular, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm) has a periodic atomic arrangement. In other words, the nc-OS includes a fine crystal. Note that the size of the fine crystal is, for example, greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, particularly greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm; thus, the fine crystal is also referred to as a nanocrystal. Furthermore, there is no regularity of crystal orientation between different nanocrystals in the nc-OS. Hence, the orientation in the whole film is not observed. Accordingly, the nc-OS cannot be distinguished from an a-like OS or an amorphous oxide semiconductor by some analysis methods. For example, when an nc-OS film is subjected to structural analysis using out-of-plane XRD measurement with an XRD apparatus using &#x3b8;/2&#x3b8; scanning, a peak indicating crystallinity is not detected. Furthermore, a diffraction pattern like a halo pattern is observed when the nc-OS film is subjected to electron diffraction (also referred to as selected-area electron diffraction) using an electron beam with a probe diameter larger than the diameter of a nanocrystal (e.g., larger than or equal to 50 nm). Meanwhile, in some cases, a plurality of spots in a ring-like region with a direct spot as the center are observed in the obtained electron diffraction pattern when the nc-OS film is subjected to electron diffraction (also referred to as nanobeam electron diffraction) using an electron beam with a probe diameter nearly equal to or smaller than the diameter of a nanocrystal (e.g., greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 30 nm).</p><p id="p-0421" num="0000">[a-Like OS]</p><p id="p-0422" num="0419">The a-like OS is an oxide semiconductor having a structure between those of the nc-OS and the amorphous oxide semiconductor. The a-like OS includes a void or a low-density region. That is, the a-like OS has lower crystallinity than the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS. Moreover, the a-like OS has higher hydrogen concentration in the film than the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Composition of Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0423" num="0420">Next, the above-described CAC-OS is described in detail. Note that the CAC-OS relates to the material composition.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">[CAC-OS]</heading><p id="p-0424" num="0421">The CAC-OS refers to one composition of a material in which elements constituting a metal oxide are unevenly distributed with a size greater than or equal to 0.5 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm, or a similar size, for example. Note that a state in which one or more metal elements are unevenly distributed and regions including the metal element(s) are mixed with a size greater than or equal to 0.5 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm, or a similar size in a metal oxide is hereinafter referred to as a mosaic pattern or a patch-like pattern.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0422">In addition, the CAC-OS has a composition in which materials are separated into a first region and a second region to form a mosaic pattern, and the first regions are distributed in the film (this composition is hereinafter also referred to as a cloud-like composition). That is, the CAC-OS is a composite metal oxide having a composition in which the first regions and the second regions are mixed.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0423">Note that the atomic ratios of In, Ga, and Zn to the metal elements contained in the CAC-OS in an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide are denoted with [In], [Ga], and [Zn], respectively. For example, the first region in the CAC-OS in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide has [In] higher than [In] in the composition of the CAC-OS film. Moreover, the second region has [Ga] higher than [Ga] in the composition of the CAC-OS film. For example, the first region has higher [In] and lower [Ga] than the second region. Moreover, the second region has higher [Ga] and lower [In] than the first region.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0424">Specifically, the first region includes indium oxide, indium zinc oxide, or the like as its main component. The second region includes gallium oxide, gallium zinc oxide, or the like as its main component. That is, the first region can be referred to as a region containing In as its main component. The second region can be referred to as a region containing Ga as its main component.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0425">Note that a clear boundary between the first region and the second region cannot be observed in some cases.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0426">In a material composition of a CAC-OS in an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide that contains In, Ga, Zn, and O, regions containing Ga as a main component are observed in part of the CAC-OS and regions containing In as a main component are observed in part thereof. These regions are randomly dispersed to form a mosaic pattern. Thus, it is suggested that the CAC-OS has a structure in which metal elements are unevenly distributed.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0427">The CAC-OS can be formed by a sputtering method under a condition where a substrate is not heated intentionally, for example. Moreover, in the case of forming the CAC-OS by a sputtering method, any one or more selected from an inert gas (typically, argon), an oxygen gas, and a nitrogen gas are used as a deposition gas. The flow rate of the oxygen gas to the total flow rate of the deposition gas in deposition is preferably as low as possible; for example, the flow rate of the oxygen gas to the total flow rate of the deposition gas in deposition is higher than or equal to 0% and lower than 30%, preferably higher than or equal to 0% and lower than or equal to 10%.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0428">For example, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is used to obtain EDX mapping, and according to the EDX mapping, the CAC-OS in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide has a structure in which the region containing In as its main component (the first region) and the region containing Ga as its main component (the second region) are unevenly distributed and mixed.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0429">Here, the first region has a higher conductivity than the second region. In other words, when carriers flow through the first region, the conductivity of a metal oxide is exhibited. Accordingly, when the first regions are distributed in a metal oxide as a cloud, high field-effect mobility (&#x3bc;) can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0430">The second region has a higher insulating property than the first region. In other words, when the second regions are distributed in a metal oxide, leakage current can be inhibited.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0431">Thus, in the case where a CAC-OS is used for a transistor, by the complementary function of the conducting function due to the first region and the insulating function due to the second region, the CAC-OS can have a switching function (On/Off function). A CAC-OS has a conducting function in part of the material and has an insulating function in another part of the material; as a whole, the CAC-OS has a function of a semiconductor. Separation of the conducting function and the insulating function can maximize each function. Accordingly, when the CAC-OS is used for a transistor, high on-state current (I<sub>on</sub>), high field-effect mobility (&#x3bc;), and excellent switching operation can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0432">A transistor using a CAC-OS has high reliability. Thus, the CAC-OS is most suitable for a variety of semiconductor devices such as display apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0433">An oxide semiconductor has various structures with different properties. Two or more kinds among the amorphous oxide semiconductor, the polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, the a-like OS, the CAC-OS, the nc-OS, and the CAAC-OS may be included in an oxide semiconductor of one embodiment of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">&#x3c;Transistor Including Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0437" num="0434">Next, the case where the above oxide semiconductor is used for a transistor is described.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0435">When the above oxide semiconductor is used for a transistor, a transistor with high field-effect mobility can be achieved. In addition, a transistor having high reliability can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0436">An oxide semiconductor with a low carrier concentration is preferably used for the transistor. For example, the carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor is lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, still further preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, yet further preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, and higher than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. In order to reduce the carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor film, the impurity concentration in the oxide semiconductor film is reduced so that the density of defect states can be reduced. In this specification and the like, a state with a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic state. Note that an oxide semiconductor having a low carrier concentration may be referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0437">A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly has a low density of trap states in some cases.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0438">Electric charge trapped by the trap states in the oxide semiconductor takes a long time to disappear and might behave like fixed electric charge. Thus, a transistor whose channel formation region is formed in an oxide semiconductor with a high density of trap states has unstable electrical characteristics in some cases.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0439">Accordingly, in order to obtain stable electrical characteristics of a transistor, reducing the impurity concentration in an oxide semiconductor is effective. In order to reduce the impurity concentration in the oxide semiconductor, it is preferable that the impurity concentration in an adjacent film be also reduced. Examples of impurities include hydrogen, nitrogen, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, iron, nickel, and silicon.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="2">&#x3c;Impurities&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0443" num="0440">Here, the influence of each impurity in the oxide semiconductor is described.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0441">When silicon or carbon, which is one of Group 14 elements, is contained in the oxide semiconductor, defect states are formed in the oxide semiconductor. Thus, the concentration of silicon or carbon in the oxide semiconductor and the concentration of silicon or carbon in the vicinity of an interface with the oxide semiconductor (the concentration measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)) are lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0442">When the oxide semiconductor contains an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal, defect states are formed and carriers are generated in some cases. Accordingly, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor that contains an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal tends to have normally-on characteristics. Thus, the concentration of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal in the oxide semiconductor, which is obtained by SIMS, is lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0443">When the oxide semiconductor contains nitrogen, the oxide semiconductor easily becomes n-type by generation of electrons serving as carriers and an increase in carrier concentration. As a result, a transistor using an oxide semiconductor containing nitrogen as a semiconductor is likely to have normally-on characteristics. When nitrogen is contained in the oxide semiconductor, a trap state is sometimes formed. This might make the electrical characteristics of the transistor unstable. Therefore, the concentration of nitrogen in the oxide semiconductor, which is obtained using SIMS, is lower than 5&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, still further preferably lower than or equal to 5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0444">Hydrogen contained in the oxide semiconductor reacts with oxygen bonded to a metal atom to be water, and thus forms an oxygen vacancy in some cases. Entry of hydrogen into the oxygen vacancy generates an electron serving as a carrier in some cases. Furthermore, bonding of part of hydrogen to oxygen bonded to a metal atom causes generation of an electron serving as a carrier in some cases. Thus, a transistor using an oxide semiconductor containing hydrogen is likely to have normally-on characteristics. Accordingly, hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor is preferably reduced as much as possible. Specifically, the hydrogen concentration in the oxide semiconductor, which is obtained using SIMS, is lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than 5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, still further preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0445">When an oxide semiconductor with sufficiently reduced impurities is used for the channel formation region of the transistor, stable electrical characteristics can be given.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0446">At least part of this embodiment can be implemented in combination with the other embodiments described in this specification as appropriate.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading><p id="p-0450" num="0447">In this embodiment, electronic devices of embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0448">An electronic device in this embodiment includes the display apparatus of one embodiment of the present invention.
