An input device, such as a push button, is generally provided on an outer surface of the housing which the operative can press. The input device has a speed control switch connected to it for operation of the speed of the working head.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional power tool switches of this type utilize reed switches having a contact piece and a resistance plate. Resistance is controlled by adjustment of the location of the contact piece on the resistance plate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A problem exists in that the contact piece and resistance plate wear due to repeated abrasion in use leading to failure of the switch. Thus, the present invention aims to improve upon this problem.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for providing a switch mechanism.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of operating an electric power tool.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention will be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In the embodiment, apparatus <b>801</b> comprises a housing <b>802</b> and a pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> which is mounted to housing <b>802</b>. In the embodiment, pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> comprises a resistive pressure sensor and, in this embodiment is a dual-point sensor. This means that pressure sensitive device records an applied pressure at two points of the sensing device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Apparatus <b>801</b> comprises a first actuator <b>804</b> which is moveably connected to housing <b>802</b> such that actuator <b>804</b> can move along an axis towards and away from pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> in a substantially similar manner to the embodiment of apparatus <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Apparatus <b>801</b> further comprises a first resilient member <b>805</b> which is substantially similar to resilient member <b>406</b> described previously. Thus, resilient member <b>805</b> is connected at a first end to actuator <b>804</b> and to pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> at a second end.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a substantially similar manner, housing <b>802</b> comprises a groove <b>806</b> which is configured to receive pressure sensitive device <b>803</b>. Groove <b>806</b> is provided on an inner wall of housing <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the embodiment, apparatus <b>801</b> comprises a guide rod <b>807</b> which is attached to housing <b>802</b> and is positioned perpendicular to the pressure surface of pressure sensitive device <b>803</b>. Guide rod <b>807</b> is fixed to actuator <b>804</b> at one end and housing <b>802</b> at the opposite end. Resilient member <b>808</b> is sleeved on guide rod <b>807</b>. Actuator <b>804</b> is resiliently biased away from pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> by means of resilient member <b>805</b> and resilient member <b>808</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, apparatus <b>801</b> further comprises a further resilient member <b>809</b> which is positioned between actuator <b>804</b> and pressure sensitive device <b>803</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A second actuator <b>810</b> is also provided and is connected to an input device <b>811</b> at one end with the opposite end of actuator <b>810</b> abutting against pressure sensitive device <b>803</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, in this way, apparatus <b>801</b> comprises first and second input devices <b>811</b> and <b>812</b> which can be operated by operative <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this embodiment, when a force is applied to input device <b>812</b> resilient members <b>805</b>, <b>808</b> and <b>809</b> are compressed to activate separate points on the pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> simultaneously. This provides increased control from the input device <b>812</b> for operative <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When operative <b>102</b> applies force to input device <b>811</b>, pressure is exerted on pressure sensitive device <b>803</b> in region <b>813</b> thereby providing an alternative response. This therefore gives apparatus <b>801</b> two separate modes which provide an increased range. When applying force to input device <b>811</b>, the lack of resilient members included reduces the effort required by operative <b>102</b>. However, for increased sensitivity input device <b>812</b> may be utilized to provide increased control.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
