To date, no one has successfully created a compact, reliable, solid-state DCC transmitter capable of delivering megawatts of heating power at RF frequencies into either present experimental or future commercial nuclear fusion power plants.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional RF power technology to provide such high-power at RF frequencies for nuclear fusion includes vacuum tubes and modular solid-state amplifiers. Both of these technologies may fail to deliver the needed power at RF frequencies for different reasons.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One conventional approach to delivering RF power needed for plasma heating relies on high-power vacuum tubes (tetrodes). Vacuum electronic devices may fail because of inherent tube characteristics and vanishing marketplace issues, such as tuning, stability, lifetime, unreliable supply chain and the like. The large tetrodes or vacuum tubes are in serious risk of being abandoned by industry as the techniques required to build them are lost through retirement of the key engineers and technicians.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another conventional approach to delivering RF power needed for plasma heating is modular solid-state amplifiers which use multi-stage power combination (which may or may not include binary combining) to combine the output of many individual transistor amplifiers. Modular solid-state amplifiers may fail due to electrical and RF control difficulties (generation and combination of a distributed system), mechanical complexity, and a very large footprint. While conventional solid-state transmitters have been demonstrated at hundreds of kilowatts, state-of-the-art conventional high-power transmitters remain excessively large and complex. The leading manufacturer of such devices has indicated they would not repeat the current approach of combining many 100 kW units.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a solid-state direct cavity combiner (DCC) transmitter system for providing megawatts of power is featured.

The tuning of resonant cavity <b>12</b> and output control may be performed en masse to all of the plurality of high-power transistors <b>14</b> by use of an axially located adjustable tuning element and an axially located output coupler which interact with the magnetic and electric fields within cavity <b>12</b> to adjust its quality factor and resonant frequency. This preferably eliminates the need to tune each individual transistor for the system operating conditions, making these functions straightforward and simple. This avoids one of the problems of conventional commercial distributed RF systems.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> preferably provides an order of magnitude improvement in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), preferably provides an order of magnitude reduction in physical footprint, and preferably provides about a 50% reduction in the cost per watt compared to conventional tetrode-based systems.

The modular structure of the solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> discussed above may be a full-power transmitter with a partially populated, full-size prototype. The modular design of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> enables scale-up in transmitter power, easy adaptation to a range of commercial fusion plant configurations and sizes, and low manufacturing costs due to cost scaling of the mass-produced RF modules.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Together, the advantages discussed above preferably enable affordable scaling of this technology to the multiple megawatts of RF power required for plasma heating in a realistic fusion system. Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> of one or more embodiments of this invention may combine multiple resonant cavities <b>12</b>, e.g., as disclosed in the applicant's '665 patent cited supra to increase the total available RF power to the needs of the specific fusion system.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Every major magnetic fusion system requires auxiliary means of heating the plasma to start the fusion reaction. ICRF heating is commonly used due to its efficiency, steady-state nature, and compatibility with the fusion environment. ICRF applied to plasmas has shown increased plasma energy content, electron temperature and bulk ion heating. Heating plasmas with ICRF waves has been shown to be an effective method of heating present-day tokamak plasma and recent work has shown its potential to heat reactor plasmas. See, e.g., M J Mantsinen, et al, <i>Analysis of Bulk Ion Heating with ICRH in JET High</i>-<i>performance Plasmas&#x201d;, preprint of paper Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion</i>, incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">To heat the fusion plasma, RF power in the range of 10 MW is required. A solid-state DCC transmitter comprised of one or more embodiments of this invention may produce RF power in the ICRF for approximately $1/W to $2/W which is much less than alternative solid-state approaches or conventional tetrode-based systems.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> preferably provides a modular, low-cost, high-efficiency, high-power, highly reliable RF transmitter suitable for ICRF fusion plasma heating. The electrical, RF, and mechanical simplicity of the architecture discussed above with reference to one or more of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref> preferably enables low costs of less than $2/W, efficiencies well above 70%, total power per resonant cavity <b>12</b> of over 1.3 MW, with a MTBF of over 100,000 hours.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">One of the primary challenges in fusion is achieving a hot dense plasma. RF heating of fusion plasmas requires producing and controlling MWs of cost-effective RF power. Tetrodes are not viable for commercial fusion power, and competing Solid-State Amplifiers (SSAs), have a multitude of independent mechanical joints, binary combiners, impedance matching stages, and water coolant connections. Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> of one or more embodiments of this invention uses a direct-connection approach, which reduces costs by significantly simplifying the electrical, thermal, and mechanical design and also dramatically improves reliability and ease of maintenance.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">ICRF power is considered a good candidate to efficiently heat plasmas to thermonuclear conditions for future devices like the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the Small Prototype Advanced Robust Compact Reactor (SPARC) has favorable scaling to reactor plasmas without core wave penetration issues. The core wave physics has been experimentally established including deuterium-tritium discharges in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) and the Joint European Tokamak (JET). These studies demonstrated that the majority of the power is absorbed on fuel ions via second harmonic tritium with co-resonant minority 3He absorption providing a path to a burning plasma regime. The ability to preferentially heat bulk ion, minority ions or electrons by an appropriate choice of the launched frequency and spectrum is potentially advantageous. This flexibility can be exploited to provide an effective means of central density and impurity control. Recent experiments in the Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment Upgrade (ASDEX-U) and Alcator C-Mod shown high-power ICRF power coupled into plasmas with minimal impurity contamination. Successful long pulse ICRF heating experiments show that ICRF heating technology can be used to reach burning plasma conditions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Transmitter reliability is preferably increased by an order of magnitude or more with a solid-state RF amplifier, such as solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> of one or more embodiments of this invention when compared to tetrodes. Not only are individual RF transistors longer-lived, but the failure of an individual module has a small impact on the overall operation of the amplifier; the impact being a slight reduction in output power. This graceful degradation means that full power operation can be maintained even in the event of failure of a number of modules.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An RF plant utilizing solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> would have a dramatically longer MTBF and reduced support costs, lowering the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) by more than about 50%. It is estimated that solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> heating transmitter will reduce the expected plant lifetime RF cost, including tube repair/replacements from about $4/W down to about $2.00/W, significantly increasing the competitiveness and feasibility of fusion power in general, and of high-field tokamaks in particular. One or more embodiments of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> preferably enables smaller fusion plants by reducing the recirculating power, which essentially reduces a parasitic loss. 30 MW of recirculating power in a GW-class machine is negligible, but in a 100 MWe plant, the RF is consuming 30% of the plant output just to keep the plasma going. The LCC comparison is even more favorable due to the improved efficiency of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b>. Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> will preferably allow commercial fusion energy to meet the operational expectations of future utility customers.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The ability of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> to provide reliable, affordable, plasma heating technology makes the overall fusion system less expensive and simpler to operate reliably.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Direct mounting of the modules <b>20</b> on water-cooled end-plates <b>24</b> and <b>36</b> discussed above with reference to one or more of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref> preferably maximizes heat transfer from high-power transistors <b>14</b> to the internal flow channels in end-plates of large resonant cavity <b>12</b> while minimizing the number of required cooling connections <b>40</b>. This preferably allows greater power density due to the ability to the elimination of cooling connections on the modules (enabling them to be smaller) and dramatically simplified maintenance requirements. Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> provides high transmitter reliability preferably provided by graceful degradation which results because each magnetic coupling loop <b>28</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b></figref> has an area that is small compared to resonant cavity <b>12</b>. Thus, even if several individual transistors fail, their effects only weakly couple to the cavity field and do not disrupt the operation of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b>. The addition of more transistors than nominally required allows full specification performance despite any failures. Solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> preferably includes fast-acting DC and RF FET drain over-voltage protection on each quad module <b>20</b> of each of tri-quad module <b>30</b> which also reduces risk during operation with the inevitable plasma mismatches.

Low output impedance high-power RF transistors <b>14</b> are not matched up to an arbitrary 50-ohm impedance level. Instead, solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> includes magnetic coupling loops that operate at the optimum load impedance at the drain of the devices. This configuration is simple and has low losses. The resonant cavity is a well-known means of combining or dividing power.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Typically, a resonant cavity has a high unloaded Q, so that intrinsic losses can be very low. With heavy input and output loading, the loaded Q is much lower, providing good bandwidth, e.g., about 10%, while retaining the intrinsic low conduction losses of the cavity. Resonant cavity <b>12</b> of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> preferably provides a large, well-defined electromagnetic field structure which can be driven simultaneously by many transistors. Various geometry and mode combinations for resonant cavity <b>12</b> may utilized.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The ability of resonant cavity <b>12</b> to accommodate additional high-power RF transistors without significantly changing the interior magnetic or electric fields by increasing the output coupling allows nearly linear increases in power per transistor and simplifies each power output stage. The combination of many inputs into a single resonant cavity <b>12</b> provides a high degree of redundancy and a graceful degradation characteristic.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Resonant cavity <b>12</b> has a very high unloaded Q factor, enabling power to be resonated out of individual amplifiers with nearly zero loss.

Both the resonant frequency and the loading of resonant cavity <b>12</b> of solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> are preferably easily adjustable with capacitive tuning slugs, e.g., as disclosed in the '665 patent cited supra. This allows for easy addition of Tri-Quad modules <b>22</b> without significantly altering the internal field structure. The stability of the internal fields provides exceptional isolation; individual module failures do not destabilize the resonant cavity <b>12</b> enough to bring the solid-state DCC transmitter system <b>10</b> down and the remaining modules merely operate at slightly reduced power.
