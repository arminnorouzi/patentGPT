It applies non-damaging electromagnetic frequencies to enhance overall health and wellness.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Every cell in the body has a negative charge on the cell wall. For nerve cells, this is approximately &#x2212;60 mV; other cells may vary in the net negative charge. To maintain healthy levels of this negative charge, potassium and magnesium should be contained inside the cells, while calcium and sodium ideally remain outside the cells. The human diet is often insufficient to maintain a proper balance of these chemicals in all cells, especially after injury and trauma&#x2014;PEMF is used to correct for this to ensure the electrical health of a patient's cells. PEMF can be used to supplement and enhance currently existing healthcare modalities, improving adenosine triphosphate [ATP] production, increasing oxygenation, enhancing circulation, promoting hydration, facilitating detoxification, and gaining a better overall absorption of nutrients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photobiomodulation (PBM Therapy) is the application of red and near infra-red light over injuries, joints, or lesions to improve wound and soft tissue healing, reduce inflammation and give relief for both acute and chronic pain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The red and near infrared light (600 nm-1000 nm) commonly used in PBM can be produced by laser or high intensity LEDs. When the correct intensity and treatment times are used, red and near infrared light reduces oxidative stress and increases ATP. This improves cell metabolism and reduce inflammation by inducing nitric oxide production, blood flow and also movement of growth factor and increase cellular respiration. These effects can be enhanced by pulsed emissions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite both PEMF and PBM therapies being non-invasive and effective in supporting the body's healing processes and overall health (both have been shown to shown to heal muscle and ligament damage and reduce delayed onset muscle soreness), there are currently no devices available on the market for applying these two synergistic therapies in tandem.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing PEMF and PBM solutions apply each therapy in isolation, and furthermore they are often contained in cumbersome hard plastic or metal enclosures that do not contour to the body and required a user to stay in place while either therapy was applied. It is within this context that the present invention is provided.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a combined Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy and Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapeutic device in the form of a flexible wearable that can be secured to a user's body part to apply targeted radiation to a desired area.
