The drain of the transistor M is connected with the current source IBIAS, the source of the transistor M is grounded, and the drain of the transistor M is short-circuited with the gate. The gate of the M transistor is connected to the gate of the transistor M<b>0</b> of the power amplifier and is configured to provide a bias voltage for the gate of the M<b>0</b> transistor. The transistor M<b>0</b> is included in a signal amplification circuit for amplifying an input signal. The signal amplification circuit further includes a capacitor C<b>1</b>, a capacitor C<b>2</b>, a voltage source VCC and an inductor L. The specific connection mode of the signal amplification circuit is as follows. The gate of M<b>0</b> transistor is connected with one end of capacitor C<b>1</b>, and the other end of capacitor C<b>1</b> is used as the RF signal input end. The drain of the transistor M<b>0</b> is connected to the voltage source VCC through the inductor L and also connected to one end of the capacitor C<b>2</b>, the other end of the capacitor C<b>2</b> is used as the RF signal output end, and the source of the transistor M<b>0</b> is connected to a ground terminal. Based on the above bias circuit, since the transistor M is connected as a diode and the diode is a nonlinear component, the nonlinear effect causes the gate-source voltage of the transistor M to decrease with the increase of the power of the input RF signal, that is, the bias voltage provided to the transistor M<b>0</b> decreases, and then leads to the deterioration of the linearity of the transistor M<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments of this disclosure provide a bias circuit of a power amplifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic structure diagram of a first structure of a bias circuit of a power amplifier of an embodiment of this disclosure.
