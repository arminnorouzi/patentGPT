hardware and memory hardware in communication with the data processing hardware storing instructions that when executed on the data processing hardware cause the data processing hardware to perform operations. The operations include receiving, at a receiver of the data processing hardware, data associated with at least one physical parameter associated with installing a tire-wheel assembly valve along an installation axis of a stemming device including a transducer that communicated with a tire-wheel assembly valve. The operations further include recording, in the memory hardware, the received data throughout an act of the stemming device inserting the tire-wheel assembly valve through a valve hole of a wheel. The operations yet further include utilizing an algorithm at a processor of the data processing hardware for comparing the recorded data against a data signature for determining if the tire-wheel assembly valve is adequately or inadequately installed within the valve hole of the wheel.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features. For example, the operations further include sending, from a transmitter of the data processing hardware, a validation signal to a wheel processing system including the stemming device for validating the wheel including the tire-wheel assembly valve being adequately disposed within the valve hole of the wheel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, the operations further include sending, from a transmitter of the data processing hardware, a rejection signal to a wheel processing system including the stemming device for rejecting the wheel including the tire-wheel assembly valve being inadequately disposed within the valve hole of the wheel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the data associated with the transducer is derived from at least one of a force transducer, pressure transducer, absolute position transducer, relative position transducer, proximity transducer or the like, and is positioned axially along an installation axis the stemming device received by the receiver of the data processing hardware at a rate of 100 Hz or greater.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the data signature is formulated by numerically estimating a time derivative of the axial force along the installation axis of the stemming device over time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, the processor of the data processing hardware retrieves the data signature from a characteristic signature database stored in the memory hardware.

In some instance, the characteristic signature database including one or more force rate signals may be alternatively called &#x201c;virtual force rate signal&#x201d; that are created by numerically estimating a time derivative of the force imparted by the stemming device <b>10</b> over time. In an example, a force rate signature stored in the characteristic database may be substantially similar to the data associated with the force signal measurement seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. Therefore, upon the computing device <b>50</b> receiving the measurement M, and, after comparing the measurement M to the force rate signature and determining that the measurement M is substantially similar to the force rate signature, the computing device <b>50</b> may electronically determine that the valve V and tire pressure monitor TPM has been adequately installed upon the wheel W.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the first derivative of the force signal is plotted against sample count. In a successful marrying of the valve stem V<sub>S </sub>to the valve stem opening W<sub>V </sub>in the wheel W, certain characteristics should be present. For example, once the insertion process begins in earnest, the initial signal should show a steep negative slope culminating at a negative peak <b>5</b>C&#x2032; immediately followed by a steep positive slope culminating at a positive peak <b>5</b>C&#x2033;. This characteristic signature is not evident in a faulty installation (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> that depicts a faulty installation). In the faulty installation depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, although there is an initial negative slope culminating at a negative peak (see, e.g., the negative spike <b>6</b>C&#x2032;), the magnitude of the initial negative spike <b>6</b>C&#x2032; is merely &#x2153; of the magnitude of the initial negative spike <b>5</b>C&#x2032; depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. An additional confirmation that the installation is faulty is that a spike <b>6</b>C&#x2033;, which immediately follows initial negative spike <b>6</b>C&#x2032;, has very little, if any positive amplitude. This is in contrast to the amplitude of the positively-going spike <b>5</b>C&#x2033; in the successful installation which has a magnitude of approximately 1&#xbd; units above the X-axis (i.e., the X-axis functions as the zero amplitude reference in this graph). Of course, the absolute amplitude of the various peaks mentioned above relating to the first derivative force signal of the successful installation as well as the absolute amplitude of the first derivative force signal of a faulty installation are not nearly as important as the relative peak amplitudes between the successful installation and the faulty installation. Also, the signatures generated from a first derivative of a force signal during installation can be compared to a &#x201c;gold standard signature database&#x201d; that is created using one or more signatures generated from installations that are known to be acceptable. Any number of statistical techniques can be used to generate a database of &#x201c;gold standard&#x201d; signatures, which can then be quickly and easily compared to the signatures generated during production use of the valve stemming device <b>10</b>. Although it may be most cost efficient to use a force sensor as the primary means of measuring the parameters generated during the installation and thereafter mathematically manipulating the force signal to generate the first derivative of the force signal (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>6</b>C</figref>), there is nothing prohibiting the use of a sensor that measures (directly) the first derivative of the install force. This technique might be beneficial in installations where time efficiency is critical inasmuch as the use of a force derivative sensor would not have the inherent time delay associated with collecting a force signal, storing it, and mathematically converting it into data that is a representative of its first derivative.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D and <b>6</b>D</figref>, an exemplary computing device <b>50</b> includes one or more of a display screen <b>52</b>, a speaker <b>54</b> or the like that may be utilized for ascertaining the performance of the stemming device <b>10</b>.
