The brake element of the hydraulically or pneumatically operated service brake is normally locked mechanically in this end position.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, these purely mechanical parking brakes have been increasingly replaced with electric brake systems. These use a threaded spindle/nut combination as an axially adjustable element of a linear drive. A threaded spindle is driven by an electric motor and acts on the thread of the encompassing nut. A longitudinal movement of the nut along the spindle axis is brought about by the spindle rotation. If the nut is connected to a piston element which acts on a brake pad, a (parking) braking action can be achieved. A nut-spindle system furthermore has the advantage that it is secure in a currentless state because the self-locking of the thread, combined with a normally present reduction gearbox and the drive motor, holds the brake in the locked position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The nut-spindle system acts from a technical perspective as a worm gear, wherein the reduction or step-up is determined by the dimensioning of the threaded spindle and the pitch of the thread. Very short reaction times are normally not required for parking brake systems; in contrast, it must be possible to generate sufficiently high clamping forces on the brake so that a vehicle can be held securely in the loaded state even when parked on a slope. For this reason, nut-spindle systems are primarily used and less frequently the more complex and costly, but smoother running ball screw drives.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The intention below is to consider the thread design which is typically used when constructing a nut-spindle system. The actuating forces when operating a parking brake act on the nut-spindle system substantially along the central longitudinal axis of the system. The transmission of force between threaded spindle and nut is performed here via the threads which engage in one another; depending on the loading direction via the flanks, which slide in each case on one another, of the threads of nut and threaded spindle. Since the structural length of the mounted operating unit consisting of drive spindle and nut varies depending on the position of the thread, the overall surface area of the force-transmitting flanks also changes. Moreover, depending on the pull-out length of the nut-spindle combination, the angle play, therefore the possible lateral deflection or tilting of the threaded spindle relative to the nut, can be of varying magnitude.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the purpose of understanding, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, where an asymmetrical thread is shown, in the case of which the thread has flanks with varying gradient. A situation is shown, where force F<sub>a </sub>acting on the nut (force parallel to the axis of the nut-spindle unit) presses the steeper threaded flanks of nut and threaded spindle onto one another.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> now considers this situation on an isolated thread flank: F<sub>a </sub>acts axially, which enables a separation of the forces as shown in the force parallelogram. A force component F<sub>s </sub>is produced which is introduced into the thread perpendicular to the flank and a radial component F<sub>r</sub>. A<sub>as </sub>and A<sub>sy </sub>designate the flank surfaces which are effectively in frictional engagement with the mating flank. It becomes clear from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> that force F<sub>a </sub>acting axially on A<sub>as </sub>or A<sub>sy </sub>can be deflected better into the material in the case of a thread with steep flanks than with flatter flanks. This has two clear advantages: On one hand, the compressive load on the surface is lower because perpendicular force component F<sub>s </sub>is smaller in the case of flatter flanks (with identical F<sub>a</sub>). Secondly, radial force component F<sub>r </sub>is also smaller. There is, however, a component&#x2014;F<sub>r </sub>in mirror symmetry to the central axis of the system which (largely) cancels out this component. As a result of manufacturing tolerances, considered via the thread length in engagement, a resultant force can, however, be produced which leads to a tilting moment on the nut-spindle system and thus increases wear.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since, in the case of parking brake systems, the maximum load occurs for the operating unit when the system is moved into the braking position, it is therefore obvious to select an asymmetrical thread because the load peaks can thus be better deflected from the nut onto the spindle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Nut-spindle systems for the described use as part of a linear drive are, on the grounds of cost, often manufactured as cold formed workpieces from steel. The threads are in this case rolled, i.e. cold formed with special machines. The thread is grooved by suitable chamfering rollers into a cylindrical or hollow-cylindrical raw form. This can thus be performed as an internal thread (nut) or as an external thread (spindle). The cold forming ensures higher thread strength and can enable smoother and better surface structures without chip formation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A side effect in the case of thread rolling is the formation of what are known as closing folds. During thread production, the tool presses the thread profile into the blank and displaces the material from the thread base into the thread tips. This thus occurs for each thread simultaneously from both flanks. The boundary between these two displacement fronts can lead at the thread tip to a more or less pronounced closing fold along the thread tip depending on the degree of forming, material and process control; where the material displacement is at its highest, the thread is, however, at its narrowest. Closing folds are disadvantageous for the load capacity of the region of the thread tip.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An asymmetrically arranged closing fold also arises in the case of an asymmetrical thread. Studies have thus shown that this closing fold does not weaken both thread flanks to the same degree; interestingly, the steeper thread flank is affected to a greater extent. This can have a negative impact due to the force distribution shown above. As the comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> shows, force component F<sub>s </sub>(vectorial) introduced into the material in the case of flatter flanks is necessarily inclined to a greater extent with respect to the central axis than in the case of the steeper flank. Pictorially, the force vector tends to aim past the closing fold in the case of the flatter thread flank, into the volume of the threaded tooth which is advantageous for the introduction of force and unaffected by the closing fold.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The material in the case of asymmetrical threads in the thread base, relative to the original surface, is notched to a greater extent at the foot of a steeper flank than in the case of a flatter flank, likewise as a result of the thread shaping. The material in the thread base is thus subject to locally greater loads, which can facilitate the formation of micro-cracks.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">All of these considerations mean that the approach from the prior art, configuring the nut-spindle systems of the operating unit for parking brake systems with an asymmetrical thread, does not appear to be fundamentally advantageous. Operating units according to the present invention are characterized by simplified production and improved efficiency while the locking forces in the end position correspond to the same requirements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An operating unit for a parking brake of motor vehicles comprises an operatively connected unit consisting of drive spindle and nut which forms an axially length-adjustable element of a linear drive and acts as such. The drive spindle has a drive side for connection to an electric drive and a substantially cylindrical spindle portion with an external thread. The nut has in contrast a sleeve-shaped central body with an internal thread and furthermore a head portion which is formed in order to act as a pressure piston on a brake element of the parking brake. Central body and head portion of the nut can, just like drive side and spindle portion of the drive spindle, be embodied in one piece or be composed in a frictional, positive-locking or firmly bonded manner of two components. Internal and external threads of the operating unit intermesh as threads in the operative connection and define a common axial axis of rotation (A).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the invention, the thread is designed as a symmetrical thread, in the case of which the flank angles (&#x3b1;, &#x3b1;&#x2032;), relative to a radial reference plane (R) perpendicular to the axis of rotation (A), have angle values which are substantially equal in magnitude.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one preferred embodiment of the operating unit, the drive spindle is essentially embodied as a cold formed metal molded part. In a further embodiment, the nut is essentially embodied as a cold formed metal molded part.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In both cases, essentially means that, apart from pre-treatment or post-treatment steps (such as production of the raw form before thread rolling, heat treatment, surface tempering, hardening, cleaning, turning over or finishing), the key forming steps are performed by cold forming and not by machining.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further embodiment of an operating unit, the flank angles (a, a&#x2032;) are selected between 12&#xb0;-18&#xb0; (in each case inclusive), preferably between 13&#xb0; and 15&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The use of an operating unit as an axially length-adjustable element of a linear drive for a parking brake of motor vehicles is built on an operatively connected unit comprised of drive spindle and nut.
