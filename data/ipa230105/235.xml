id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a color chart for helping in the choice of a cosmetic product chosen within a range of cosmetic products having different respective hues and also to a method for the manufacture of a color chart.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ranges of cosmetic products, in particular of foundations, comprise numerous different hues. The person who wishes to choose a foundation has great difficulties in finding, at a sales outlet, the hue which corresponds to her makeup strategy, whether this is a hue which is tone by tone with her complexion or another hue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, as the product has a degree of transparency, the resulting color of the makeup with a foundation depends not only on the color of the latter but also on the color of the skin on which it is applied. It is thus particularly difficult for the user to choose the hue by observing the product in its container (pot, tube or bottle). The color blocks printed on the packaging or available on the corresponding sales outlet often have a very approximate color located between that in the container and a made-up color and do not solve this problem.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is sometimes possible to test, at the sales outlet, one or more foundations. However, it is only possible to test one foundation at a time, which renders the operation tedious. It is then necessary to make a selection of the foundations beforehand in order to restrict the number of hues to be tested.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other problems of a logistical type are posed at the sales outlets, in superstores and medium-sized stores. The advertisement of products is very important without explicit organization or personnel for advising on a choice. Color references are variable from one brand or one range to another, which does not make it possible to easily navigate between the suggestions. Packagings often have labels for indication of the color of the product which are often too small or not very realistic, which does not make it possible to thoroughly compare the color of the label with that of the skin. The artificial light of the sales outlet may also interfere with the perception of the result of the color on the skin. To these difficulties is often added the impossibility of testing the product and thus of visualizing the result of it in terms not only of color but also of texture and of coverage. The shortage of time available to the person who is choosing a cosmetic product in this context and the lack of intimacy which she may experience in choosing and testing the product should also be taken into account.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Printed color charts are known. The publication WO2014/152580 discloses a device for making a color of a cosmetic composition correspond with the hue of the skin of a person. This device comprises a strip comprising a plurality of transparent and opaque parts. The opaque parts have different shades. The opaque parts can comprise an opaque base layer, which is printed, common to all the opaque parts, on which is printed a colored layer with a hue of the shade concerned, specific to each opaque part. When the strip is placed on the skin of a person, the opaque part which has a color close to the hue of the skin become substantially invisible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">JP2001/0112538 describes a tool comprising five colored surfaces printed on transparent sheets connected together by a ring. The first of the surfaces comprises a non-opaque print of two foundation colors printed side-by-side. The other surfaces comprise a print of a base product to be put under the foundation in order to modify the effect of the foundation. Thus, by putting the first of the surfaces on the skin, the client can choose the foundation color which pleases her among the two provided, then she can superimpose this first surface with each of the other surfaces in order to be able to choose a base product as a function of the effect produced on her skin. This makes it possible for a professional to show her the advantage of the base product.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">JPH11272179 describes a tool comprising several bands made from a transparent plastic sheet and each comprising several different respective skin color zones positioned side-by-side, each zone being pierced by a hole. The bands are connected together by a ring. Each band can be placed in front of the face and the skin can be seen through each hole, surrounded by the colored zone. This makes it possible for a professional to determine the color of the skin and thus to advise on a suitable foundation. These two documents describe tools which require the presence of a professional in the choice of the foundation or of a base product.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">JPH09262135 describes a chart with printed colors and a hollowed zone, which makes it possible to place it in front of the skin for a comparison of the skin color with the colors of the chart.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The known color charts are generally not very ergonomic and/or not very realistic. They do not correctly reproduce the coverage and/or the color of the corresponding foundations. Furthermore, when they consist of a support with printing of colors on the support, the print can be weak and rapidly deteriorate with use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There thus exists a need to benefit from a color chart which constitutes a tool for helping in the choice of a cosmetic product, in particular a foundation, among a range of cosmetic products provided with different respective hues, without the help necessarily of an adviser at a sales outlet, such a color chart reproducing, as faithfully as possible, the color and the coverage of the cosmetic product and being resistant to use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">ACCOUNT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention thus provides, according to one of its aspects, a color chart for helping in the choice of a cosmetic product chosen within a range of cosmetic products having different respective hues, the color chart comprising at least one transparent or translucent support and, for at least one of said hues, at least one non-opaque white-colored layer and at least one non-opaque colored layer, the color of which is close to that of the hue which it is desired to reproduce, superimposed on the white-colored layer, the white-colored and colored layers being printed on the transparent or translucent support.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By virtue of the invention, the benefit is obtained of a novel color chart which makes it possible to present the true result of the application of a cosmetic product on a person, in particular on her skin or her lips, by being positioned in front of the skin. This is because the presence of the printed non-opaque white-colored layer and of the printed non-opaque colored layer contributes to reproducing the true level of coverage obtained with the corresponding cosmetic product.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">&#x201c;Non-opaque&#x201d; layer denotes a layer making it possible for visible light to pass through it to the point of having an effect perceptible visually by the human eye.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;White-colored layer&#x201d; should be understood as meaning a white achromatic layer; the white-colored layer has a white appearance preferably under daylight (D<sub>65 </sub>illuminant).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x201c;Colored layer&#x201d; is understood to mean a layer of non-white color.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">&#x201c;Transparent&#x201d; denotes the absence of diffusion perceptible visually by the human eye on passing through the support. &#x201c;Crystal clear&#x201d; materials are examples of transparent materials.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x201c;Translucent&#x201d; denotes the presence of a diffusion perceptible visually by the human eye. The diffusion remains sufficiently weak so as not to prevent the desired effect from being obtained after application of the white-colored and colored layers.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The white-colored layer and the colored layer are preferably completely superimposed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the white-colored layer is in contact with the transparent or translucent support and the colored layer is in contact with the white-colored layer, being printed on the latter. In an alternative form, the colored layer is in contact with the transparent or translucent support and the white-colored layer is in contact with the colored layer, being printed on the latter.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The delta E, dE or also &#x394;E is defined as a measurement of difference between two colors. The formula drawn up in 1976 by the Commission internationale de l'&#xe9;clairage [International Commission on Illumination] (CIE) is as follows:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>E</i>=&#x221a;{square root over ((<i>L*</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;L*</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>a*</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;a*</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>b*</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;b*</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)}&#x2003;&#x2003;[Math 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">where:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">L*<sub>1</sub>, a*<sub>1 </sub>and b*<sub>1 </sub>are the coordinates in the CIE Lab colorimetric space of the first color to be compared and L*<sub>2 </sub>, a*<sub>2 </sub>and b*<sub>2 </sub>are those of the second color.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">The delta E corresponds to the distance between two colors placed in this color space.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Other formulae exist for calculating this delta E (CIE 1976, CIE 1994, CIE 2000, CMC), in particular the delta E 2000 (CIE 2000) used in the context of the present invention. These novel formulae introduce coefficients for adjusting the result as a function of the hue or of the field of application (graphic arts, textiles).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The Delta E 2000 or also &#x394;E*<sub>00</sub>, which is more accurate but also more complex, includes factors for weighting in brightness, saturation and hue, but also interactive parameters between saturation and difference in hues, in order to improve the performance qualities in terms of differences in blue colors, and also a weighting of the scale in a*, in order to optimize the performance qualities of the differences in relatively unsaturated colors.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>

Such a film or sheet can protect these layers without modifying the colored effect thereof or modifying the visibility through the color chart.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">The range of different hues of the cosmetic products can comprise at least ten different hues, indeed even more than twenty hues, in particular more than thirty hues, for example thirty-eight hues.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046">It should be noted that the color chart makes it possible to simulate the hue and the coverage of different cosmetic products after application to the skin and is targeted as being the most faithful possible to the result obtained with these cosmetic products. The color chart of the invention makes it possible to obtain this desired faithfulness, which is evaluated and confirmed during its conception.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">A further subject matter of the present invention, according to another of its aspects, in combination with or independently from all or part of that which precedes and follows, is a color chart for helping in the choice of a cosmetic product chosen within a range of cosmetic products having different respective hues, the color chart comprising at least one transparent or translucent support and, for at least one of said hues, at least one non-opaque layer printed on the translucent or transparent support, comprising a white-colored ink and at least one colored ink, which is non-opaque, the color of this layer being close to that of the hue which it is desired to reproduce.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Range of Color Charts</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0048">The invention also relates, according to another aspect, in combination with that which precedes, to a range of color charts, comprising a plurality of color charts as defined above, each color chart comprising a range of hues.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0049">According to this aspect, the hues are grouped together by ranges of hues within a color chart. It is then possible to create several different color charts, each color chart comprising several hues similar to one another. It is thus possible to create one or more color charts with hues of light colors, one or more color charts with hues of intermediate colors and one or more color charts with hues of dark colors. For example, among 40 hues studied, the Delta E 2000 between the lightest hue and the darkest hue of all the hues is 35 and the Delta E 2000 of the hues of a range of hues is between 5 and 15. These Delta E 2000 values can vary in another range.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0050">The existence of a range of color charts makes it possible to choose the color chart(s) corresponding to the complexion of the skin or to the makeup strategy, for example. Light skins can choose one or more color charts with light-colored layers, while dark skins can choose one or more color charts with dark-colored layers. Each color chart can comprise between two and ten different hues, indeed even between two and eight different hues, for example comprise seven different hues. This makes it possible to exclude in advance the obviously inappropriate hues and to restrict the choice to appropriate hues, in advance, before using the color chart.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Method for the Manufacture of a Color Chart</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0051">A further subject matter of the present invention, according to another aspect, in particular taken in combination with that which precedes, is a method for the manufacture of a color chart in particular as defined above, comprising the following stages, carried out for at least one of said hues:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0052">a) printing, on a transparent or translucent support, a non-opaque, white-colored layer,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0053">b) printing, in particular after drying the white-colored layer, a non-opaque, colored layer, the color of which is similar to that of the hue which it is desired to reproduce, superimposed on the white-colored layer on the transparent or translucent support.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">The color of the colored layer superimposed on the white-colored layer can be such that the Delta E 2000 between the printed color and the color of the corresponding hue of the cosmetic product on application is less than 2, in particular less than 1.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The thickness of the white-colored layer and/or the color of the colored layer can be chosen so that the difference in level of coverage between the printed layer and the applied layer of the cosmetic product of the corresponding hue, expressed as difference in contrast ratio CR %, is preferably less than or equal to &#xb1;15%.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">The printing stages a) and b) are carried out in this order, preferably.

In an alternative form, two different printers are used.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">The printer used can comprise a printhead for printing the white layer and another printhead for printing the colored layer. The layers are printed successively. The white layer has then had the time to dry when the colored layer is printed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">In an alternative form, the printer used for the printing can comprise a single printhead which prints first the white layer and then the colored layer. In this case, it may be that the white layer does not have the time to dry when the colored layer is printed. An at least partial mixing of the white and colored layers may then take place on the support. It is thus possible to obtain, in this case, a color chart as defined above for helping in the choice of a cosmetic product chosen within a range of cosmetic products having different respective hues, the color chart comprising at least one transparent or translucent support and, for at least one of said hues, at least one non-opaque layer printed on the translucent or transparent support, comprising a white-colored ink and at least one colored ink, which is non-opaque, the color of this layer being close to that of the hue which it is desired to reproduce. Such an alternative printing form with a single printhead is suitable instead for production of the color charts on a non-industrial scale. It should be noted that one and the same printer can carry out both ways of printing with one printhead and two printheads.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">A computer tool which makes the connection between computer data and actionable data for printing, also known as RIP (Raster Image Processor), consisting of specialized software, the objective of which is to manage the printing and to replace the driver, can be used. Such specialized software in printing is preferably chosen for its ability to precisely print L*, a* and b* colorimetric data. The software known under the Caldera name can be chosen in order to increase in particular the quality of the color printout but also the productivity and the profitability.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The printing stages a) and b) can comprise producing prints with at least one pattern and/or opening.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">As already mentioned, the printing carried out on the color chart during the method for the manufacture of the color chart according to the invention has the objective of simulating the color and the coverage of a cosmetic product, in particular of a foundation, once applied to the skin.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In order to achieve this objective, the method can comprise the preliminary stage consisting in printing the same hue with different levels of coverage.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The method can comprise the stage consisting in printing, on a transparent or translucent support, white-colored layers of different thicknesses and, on each of these, in printing a colored layer of the color of the cosmetic product which was measured on the white region of the evaluation device.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The method can comprise the stage consisting in arranging the transparent or translucent support with a printed white-colored layer and a printed colored layer on the evaluation device, on the regions respectively colored white and black, and in carrying out at least one measurement, in particular of reflectance, on the colored layer in order to calculate the color and optionally the level of coverage of the printed color on the transparent or translucent support. This makes it possible to confirm, by comparison, if the level of coverage, or covering power, approaches, preferably to &#xb1;15%, the level of coverage of the cosmetic product, in particular of the cosmetic product applied to the evaluation device, which level of coverage was determined beforehand, as explained above.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">Furthermore, the printed color on the transparent or translucent support measured, in particular on a white background of the evaluation device, is compared with the target color of the cosmetic product of corresponding hue, in particular measured on the evaluation device.

In order to do this, the number of passes of printing the white-colored layer is modified in order to vary the thickness. This makes it possible to choose, among several, the thickness of the white-colored layer which gives the result closest to reality, in particular in terms of level of coverage. One and the same thickness of white-colored layer can be chosen for several different hues which are preferably close to one another.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">The color on a white background is preferably systematically checked in order to compare the printed color and the color of the target foundation on application on a white background. For the coverage, the checking can take place on a selection of products from the entire range by adding the reflectance on a white and black background of a contrast card, for example.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">The evaluation device, which comprises at least two regions respectively colored white and black, can be chosen from the group consisting of a synthetic material, in particular synthetic skin, a cardboard sheet, in particular for producing a contrast card.
