Examples of sleep-related and/or respiratory disorders include Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD), Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), apneas, Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR), respiratory insufficiency, Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Neuromuscular Disease (NMD), and chest wall disorders.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a form of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), and is characterized by events including occlusion or obstruction of the upper air passage during sleep resulting from a combination of an abnormally small upper airway and the normal loss of muscle tone in the region of the tongue, soft palate and posterior oropharyngeal wall. More generally, an apnea generally refers to the cessation of breathing caused by blockage of the air (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) or the stopping of the breathing function (often referred to as central apnea). Typically, the individual will stop breathing for between about 15 seconds and about 30 seconds during an obstructive sleep apnea event.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other types of apneas include hypopnea, hyperpnea, and hypercapnia. Hypopnea is generally characterized by slow or shallow breathing caused by a narrowed airway, as opposed to a blocked airway. Hyperpnea is generally characterized by an increase depth and/or rate of breathing. Hypercapnia is generally characterized by elevated or excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, typically caused by inadequate respiration.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) is another form of sleep disordered breathing. CSR is a disorder of a patient's respiratory controller in which there are rhythmic alternating periods of waxing and waning ventilation known as CSR cycles. CSR is characterized by repetitive de-oxygenation and re-oxygenation of the arterial blood.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS) is defined as the combination of severe obesity and awake chronic hypercapnia, in the absence of other known causes for hypoventilation. Symptoms include dyspnea, morning headache and excessive daytime sleepiness.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) encompasses any of a group of lower airway diseases that have certain characteristics in common, such as increased resistance to air movement, extended expiratory phase of respiration, and loss of the normal elasticity of the lung.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology, or indirectly via nerve pathology. Chest wall disorders are a group of thoracic deformities that result in inefficient coupling between the respiratory muscles and the thoracic cage.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">These and other disorders are characterized by particular events (e.g., snoring, an apnea, a hypopnea, a restless leg, a sleeping disorder, choking, an increased heart rate, labored breathing, an asthma attack, an epileptic episode, a seizure, or any combination thereof) that occur when the individual is sleeping.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea during a sleep session. The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea and/or hypopnea events experienced by the user during the sleep session by the total number of hours of sleep in the sleep session. The event can be, for example, a pause in breathing that lasts for at least 10 seconds. An AHI that is less than 5 is considered normal. An AHI that is greater than or equal to 5, but less than 15 is considered indicative of mild sleep apnea. An AHI that is greater than or equal to 15, but less than 30 is considered indicative of moderate sleep apnea. An AHI that is greater than or equal to 30 is considered indicative of severe sleep apnea. In children, an AHI that is greater than 1 is considered abnormal. Sleep apnea can be considered &#x201c;controlled&#x201d; when the AHI is normal, or when the AHI is normal or mild. The AHI can also be used in combination with oxygen desaturation levels to indicate the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>100</b> according to some implementations of the present disclosure is illustrated.

The respiratory system <b>120</b> can include a respiratory pressure therapy device <b>122</b> (referred to herein as respiratory device <b>122</b>), a user interface <b>124</b>, a conduit <b>126</b> (also referred to as a tube or an air circuit), a display device <b>128</b>, a humidification tank <b>129</b>, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the control system <b>110</b>, the memory device <b>114</b>, the display device <b>128</b>, one or more of the sensors <b>130</b>, and the humidification tank <b>129</b> are part of the respiratory device <b>122</b>. Respiratory pressure therapy refers to the application of a supply of air to an entrance to a user's airways at a controlled target pressure that is nominally positive with respect to atmosphere throughout the user's breathing cycle (e.g., in contrast to negative pressure therapies such as the tank ventilator or cuirass). The respiratory system <b>120</b> is generally used to treat individuals suffering from one or more sleep-related respiratory disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, or mixed sleep apnea).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The respiratory device <b>122</b> is generally used to generate pressurized air that is delivered to a user (e.g., using one or more motors that drive one or more compressors). In some implementations, the respiratory device <b>122</b> generates continuous constant air pressure that is delivered to the user. In other implementations, the respiratory device <b>122</b> generates two or more predetermined pressures (e.g., a first predetermined air pressure and a second predetermined air pressure). In still other implementations, the respiratory device <b>122</b> is configured to generate a variety of different air pressures within a predetermined range. For example, the respiratory device <b>122</b> can deliver at least about 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, at least about 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, at least about 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, between about 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and about 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, between about 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and about 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, etc. The respiratory device <b>122</b> can also deliver pressurized air at a predetermined flow rate between, for example, about &#x2212;20 L/min and about 150 L/min, while maintaining a positive pressure (relative to the ambient pressure).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user interface <b>124</b> engages a portion of the user's face and delivers pressurized air from the respiratory device <b>122</b> to the user's airway to aid in preventing the airway from narrowing and/or collapsing during sleep. This may also increase the user's oxygen intake during sleep. Depending upon the therapy to be applied, the user interface <b>124</b> may form a seal, for example, with a region or portion of the user's face, to facilitate the delivery of gas at a pressure at sufficient variance with ambient pressure to effect therapy, for example, at a positive pressure of about 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O relative to ambient pressure. For other forms of therapy, such as the delivery of oxygen, the user interface may not include a seal sufficient to facilitate delivery to the airways of a supply of gas at a positive pressure of about 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some implementations, the user interface <b>124</b> is a facial mask that covers the nose and mouth of the user. Alternatively, the user interface <b>124</b> can be a nasal mask that provides air to the nose of the user or a nasal pillow mask that delivers air directly to the nostrils of the user. The user interface <b>124</b> can include a plurality of straps (e.g., including hook and loop fasteners) for positioning and/or stabilizing the interface on a portion of the user (e.g., the face) and a conformal cushion (e.g., silicone, plastic, foam, etc.) that aids in providing an air-tight seal between the user interface <b>124</b> and the user. The user interface <b>124</b> can also include one or more vents for permitting the escape of carbon dioxide and other gases exhaled by the user <b>210</b>. In other implementations, the user interface <b>124</b> comprises a mouthpiece (e.g., a night guard mouthpiece molded to conform to the user's teeth, a mandibular repositioning device, etc.).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The conduit <b>126</b> (also referred to as an air circuit or tube) allows the flow of air between two components of a respiratory system <b>120</b>, such as the respiratory device <b>122</b> and the user interface <b>124</b>. In some implementations, there can be separate limbs of the conduit for inhalation and exhalation. In other implementations, a single limb conduit is used for both inhalation and exhalation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One or more of the respiratory device <b>122</b>, the user interface <b>124</b>, the conduit <b>126</b>, the display device <b>128</b>, and the humidification tank <b>129</b> can contain one or more sensors (e.g., a pressure sensor, a flow rate sensor, or more generally any of the other sensors <b>130</b> described herein). These one or more sensors can be use, for example, to measure the air pressure and/or flow rate of pressurized air supplied by the respiratory device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The display device <b>128</b> is generally used to display image(s) including still images, video images, or both and/or information regarding the respiratory device <b>122</b>. For example, the display device <b>128</b> can provide information regarding the status of the respiratory device <b>122</b> (e.g., whether the respiratory device <b>122</b> is on/off, the pressure of the air being delivered by the respiratory device <b>122</b>, the temperature of the air being delivered by the respiratory device <b>122</b>, etc.) and/or other information (e.g., a sleep score, the current date/time, personal information for the user <b>210</b>, etc.). In some implementations, the display device <b>128</b> acts as a human-machine interface (HMI) that includes a graphic user interface (GUI) configured to display the image(s) as an input interface. The display device <b>128</b> can be an LED display, an OLED display, an LCD display, or the like. The input interface can be, for example, a touchscreen or touch-sensitive substrate, a mouse, a keyboard, or any sensor system configured to sense inputs made by a human user interacting with the respiratory device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The humidification tank <b>129</b> is coupled to or integrated in the respiratory device <b>122</b> and includes a reservoir of water that can be used to humidify the pressurized air delivered from the respiratory device <b>122</b>. The respiratory device <b>122</b> can include a heater to heat the water in the humidification tank <b>129</b> in order to humidify the pressurized air provided to the user. Additionally, in some implementations, the conduit <b>126</b> can also include a heating element (e.g., coupled to and/or imbedded in the conduit <b>126</b>) that heats the pressurized air delivered to the user.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The respiratory system <b>120</b> can be used, for example, as a ventilator or as a positive airway pressure (PAP) system, such as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system, an automatic positive airway pressure system (APAP), a bi-level or variable positive airway pressure system (BPAP or VPAP), or any combination thereof. The CPAP system delivers a predetermined air pressure (e.g., determined by a sleep physician) to the user. The APAP system automatically varies the air pressure delivered to the user based on, for example, respiration data associated with the user. The BPAP or VPAP system is configured to deliver a first predetermined pressure (e.g., an inspiratory positive airway pressure or IPAP) and a second predetermined pressure (e.g., an expiratory positive airway pressure or EPAP) that is lower than the first predetermined pressure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Forcing pressurized air into the user's throat/airway using the respirator system can cause one or more adverse side effects, such as, for example, dryness in the nose and/or mouth, a sore throat, etc. The pressurized air can also force air into the stomach, causing general discomfort, bloating, and/or gas. As another example, the pressurized air can cause a vacuum effect leading to stomach reflux. If the engagement between the user and the interface does not form a substantially air-tight seal, pressurized air can leak from the interface causing undesirable noise that may wake the user and/or their bed partner, dryness or irritation of the eyes and/or skin, and/or lower the volume of air being delivered to the user (e.g., which may necessitate an increase in pressure), thereby impeding the proper delivery of therapy. Air leakage from the interface can occur, for example, if the user is laying on their side as opposed to laying on their back while sleeping.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In at least some cases, changing the physical position of the user or a portion of the user during the sleep session (e.g., tilting the head of the user forward to open the airway) can prevent and/or reduce the occurrence of one or more of the events described herein and/or reduce the severity of these events, for example, in instances of positional sleep apnea where apneic episodes are associated with the user's sleeping position, and modifying the sleeping position of the user can aid in reducing or preventing such events. For example, changing the physical position of the user (e.g., rotating the user onto their back) can aid in reducing or preventing air leakage from the interface. Adjustment(s) to the physical position of the user during the sleep session can be used in conjunction with the respirator system as a further measure to reduce, prevent, and/or address the occurrence of an event, or independently of the respirator system. Even if adjusting the position of the user does not by itself reduce, eliminate, and/or address an event, the adjusted position can reduce the required pressure that needs to be delivered by the respirator system to the airway of the user for effective therapy (e.g., 10% less pressure, 30% less pressure, 50% less pressure, 75% less pressure, etc.).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a portion of the system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), according to some implementations, is illustrated.

For example, if the first valve <b>376</b>B is open and the second valve <b>376</b>B is closed, the second compartment <b>374</b>B can be inflated or deflated via the tube <b>372</b>, whereas the first compartment <b>374</b>A will not be inflated or deflated. Conversely, if both the first valve <b>376</b>B and the second valve <b>376</b>A are open, fluid can flow from the second compartment <b>374</b>B and into the first compartment <b>374</b>A to cause inflation or deflation.

Alternatively, one or more of the valves <b>376</b>A-<b>376</b>C is a two-way or bi-directional valve that permits fluid to flow in both directions.

The event can be, for example, a positional event (e.g., positional apnea, positional snoring, or a mask or interface leak). As described herein, directing at least a portion of the pressurized air to the multi-compartment bladder modifies (e.g., inflates) the multi-compartment bladder and causes corresponding movement of at least a portion of the user (e.g., the head of the user).

Thus, in certain implementations, the user's body position can be changed in order to address or prevent respiratory events, even when the user is not wearing the interface <b>124</b> (but the respiratory device <b>122</b> is powered on). Step <b>904</b> can also include modifying the multi-compartment bladder to adjust the position of the user responsive to determining that the current position of the user is associated with a respiratory event (e.g., based on previously recorded data for the user) to aid in preventing or reducing the likelihood of the user experiencing the event. In other implementations, the system <b>100</b> includes the respiratory system <b>120</b>, and the user is wearing the interface <b>124</b>, and step <b>904</b> can include modifying the multi-compartment bladder to adjust the position of the user responsive to identifying a respiratory event (e.g., positional apnea, positional snoring, etc.) and substantially maintaining or reducing the pressure of the air delivered to the user via the user interface in response to detection of the positional event. Subsequent to the multi-compartment bladder being modified in step <b>904</b>, steps <b>901</b>-<b>903</b> can be repeated to determine if the user is still experiencing the respiratory event, in which case the pressure of the air delivered to the user can be increased to treat the positional event. Further, adjusting the position of the user can advantageously allow use of increased air pressure by, for example, moving the user's head or body to a position more conducive to better mask seal (see, for example, the above discussion in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some implementations, step <b>904</b> includes determining a location of the user <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) relative to the multi-compartment bladder.

As another example, using the location data, the control system <b>110</b> can determine an angle of the head of the user <b>210</b> relative to a horizontal plane (e.g., the mattress and/or the pillow).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some implementations, step <b>904</b> includes determining, based at least in part on the measured pressures from the one or more sensors <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), that a first compartment of the multi-compartment bladder is directly supporting at least a portion of the head of the user and a second compartment of the multi-compartment bladder is not directly supporting at least a portion of the head of the user. Responsive to determining that the first compartment is directly supporting the head of the user and that the second compartment is not directly supporting the head of the user, the control system <b>110</b> causes at least a portion of the supplied pressurized air from the respiratory device <b>122</b> to be directed to the first compartment of the multi-compartment bladder responsive to the determination that the user is experiencing or has experienced the event (step <b>903</b>). Because the first compartment is directly supporting the head of the user, directing the first volume of the pressurized air to the first compartment can cause corresponding movement of the user. Conversely, because the second compartment is not directly supporting the head, directing pressurized air to the second compartment may not move the head, or may move the head less than the movement caused by inflating the first compartment. In this manner, the volume of the pressurized air can be directed to the compartment(s) of the multi-compartment bladder that are more likely to cause movement of the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some implementations, step <b>904</b> includes modifying the multi-compartment bladder according to a predetermined inflation scheme that is associated with the determined event.

For example, the initial fill scheme can be selected by the user based on comfort to aid the user in falling asleep, selected to position the user to watch TV or read in bed, or more generally customized by the user as desired. Information describing the initial fill scheme can be stored in the memory device <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The multi-compartment bladder is then modified according to second inflation scheme responsive to determining that the user has experienced or is experienced an event (step <b>903</b>) or in response to determining that the user has fallen asleep (e.g., as determined based on the data from step <b>901</b> and analysis during step <b>902</b>).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some implementations, subsequent to the multi-compartment bladder being modified in step <b>904</b>, steps <b>901</b>-<b>903</b> are repeated to determine if the user <b>210</b> is still experiencing the event.

The multi-compartment bladders described herein can also be used to adjust a position of a user that is confined to a bed to prevent and/or reduce the likelihood of the user developing bed sores, back pain, etc. Furthermore, the multi-compartment bladders described herein can be used to balance the need to treat or prevent events, such as (positional) apnea events, mask leaks, etc., with the need to reduce or avoid development of bed sores, back pain, etc. For example, when no events are detected or predicted, the multi-compartment bladder can periodically adjust the position of a user to reduce or avoid development of bed sores, back pain, etc. In other examples, when no bed sores, back pain, etc. are detected or reported, the multi-compartment bladder can adjust the position of a user to treat or prevent events at a frequency and duration as required.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some implementations, respiratory events can be monitored (e.g., snoring events monitored by an acoustic sensor) relative to the user's position and/or the inflation status of the multi-compartment bladder.

For example, if actuation of the multi-compartment bladder early in a sleep session, and/or in a particular sleep state, results in awakenings, then actuation of the multi-compartment bladder during those times is minimized or avoided for that user.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">As used herein, a sleep session can be defined in a number of ways based on, for example, an initial start time and an end time.

The awake duration threshold can be, for example, about twenty percent of the sleep session, about fifteen percent of the sleep session duration, about ten percent of the sleep session duration, about five percent of the sleep session duration, about two percent of the sleep session duration, etc., or any other threshold percentage. In some implementations, the awake duration threshold is defined as a fixed amount of time, such as, for example, about one hour, about thirty minutes, about fifteen minutes, about ten minutes, about five minutes, about two minutes, etc., or any other amount of time.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as the entire time between the time in the evening at which the user first entered the bed, and the time the next morning when user last left the bed. Put another way, a sleep session can be defined as a period of time that begins on a first date (e.g., Monday, Jan. 6, 2020) at a first time (e.g., 10:00 PM), that can be referred to as the current evening, when the user first enters a bed with the intention of going to sleep (e.g., not if the user intends to first watch television or play with a smart phone before going to sleep, etc.), and ends on a second date (e.g., Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020) at a second time (e.g., 7:00 AM), that can be referred to as the next morning, when the user first exits the bed with the intention of not going back to sleep that next morning.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some implementations, the user can manually define the beginning of a sleep session and/or manually terminate a sleep session. For example, the user can select (e.g., by clicking or tapping) one or more user-selectable element that is displayed on the display <b>192</b> of the user device <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to manually initiate or terminate the sleep session.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Referring to the timeline <b>1100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the enter bed time t<sub>bed </sub>is associated with the time that the user initially enters the bed (e.g., bed <b>230</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) prior to falling asleep (e.g., when the user lies down or sits in the bed). The enter bed time t<sub>bed </sub>can be identified based on a bed threshold duration to distinguish between times when the user enters the bed for sleep and when the user enters the bed for other reasons (e.g., to watch TV). For example, the bed threshold duration can be at least about 10 minutes, at least about 20 minutes, at least about 30 minutes, at least about 45 minutes, at least about 1 hour, at least about 2 hours, etc. While the enter bed time t<sub>bed </sub>is described herein in reference to a bed, more generally, the enter time t<sub>bed </sub>can refer to the time the user initially enters any location for sleeping (e.g., a couch, a chair, a sleeping bag, etc.).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The go-to-sleep time (GTS) is associated with the time that the user initially attempts to fall asleep after entering the bed (t<sub>bed</sub>). For example, after entering the bed, the user may engage in one or more activities to wind down prior to trying to sleep (e.g., reading, watching TV, listening to music, using the user device <b>190</b>, etc.). The initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>) is the time that the user initially falls asleep. For example, the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>) can be the time that the user initially enters the first non-REM sleep stage.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The wake-up time t<sub>wake </sub>is the time associated with the time when the user wakes up without going back to sleep (e.g., as opposed to the user waking up in the middle of the night and going back to sleep). The user may experience one of more unconscious microawakenings (e.g., microawakenings MA<sub>1 </sub>and MA<sub>2</sub>) having a short duration (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.) after initially falling asleep. In contrast to the wake-up time t<sub>wake</sub>, the user goes back to sleep after each of the microawakenings MA<sub>1 </sub>and MA<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the user may have one or more conscious awakenings (e.g., awakening A) after initially falling asleep (e.g., getting up to go to the bathroom, attending to children or pets, sleep walking, etc.). However, the user goes back to sleep after the awakening A. Thus, the wake-up time t<sub>wake </sub>can be defined, for example, based on a wake threshold duration (e.g., the user is awake for at least 15 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 1 hour, etc.).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Similarly, the rising time t<sub>rise </sub>is associated with the time when the user exits the bed and stays out of the bed with the intent to end the sleep session (e.g., as opposed to the user getting up during the night to go to the bathroom, to attend to children or pets, sleep walking, etc.). In other words, the rising time t<sub>rise </sub>is the time when the user last leaves the bed without returning to the bed until a next sleep session (e.g., the following evening). Thus, the rising time t<sub>rise </sub>can be defined, for example, based on a rise threshold duration (e.g., the user has left the bed for at least 15 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 1 hour, etc.). The enter bed time t<sub>bed </sub>time for a second, subsequent sleep session can also be defined based on a rise threshold duration (e.g., the user has left the bed for at least 4 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 12 hours, etc.).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">As described above, the user may wake up and get out of bed one more times during the night between the initial t<sub>bed </sub>and the final t<sub>rise</sub>. In some implementations, the final wake-up time t<sub>wake </sub>and/or the final rising time t<sub>rise </sub>that are identified or determined based on a predetermined threshold duration of time subsequent to an event (e.g., falling asleep or leaving the bed). Such a threshold duration can be customized for the user. For a standard user which goes to bed in the evening, then wakes up and goes out of bed in the morning any period (between the user waking up (t<sub>wake</sub>) or raising up (t<sub>rise</sub>), and the user either going to bed (t<sub>bed</sub>), going to sleep (t<sub>GTS</sub>) or falling asleep (t<sub>sleep</sub>) of between about 12 and about 18 hours can be used. For users that spend longer periods of time in bed, shorter threshold periods may be used (e.g., between about 8 hours and about 14 hours). The threshold period may be initially selected and/or later adjusted based on the system monitoring the user's sleep behavior.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The total time in bed (TIB) is the duration of time between the time enter bed time t<sub>bed </sub>and the rising time t<sub>rise</sub>. The total sleep time (TST) is associated with the duration between the initial sleep time and the wake-up time, excluding any conscious or unconscious awakenings and/or micro-awakenings therebetween. Generally, the total sleep time (TST) will be shorter than the total time in bed (TIB) (e.g., one minute short, ten minutes shorter, one hour shorter, etc.). For example, referring to the timeline <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the total sleep time (TST) spans between the initial sleep time t<sub>sleep </sub>and the wake-up time t<sub>wake</sub>, but excludes the duration of the first micro-awakening MA<sub>1</sub>, the second micro-awakening MA<sub>2</sub>, and the awakening A. As shown, in this example, the total sleep time (TST) is shorter than the total time in bed (TIB).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some implementations, the total sleep time (TST) can be defined as a persistent total sleep time (PTST). In such implementations, the persistent total sleep time excludes a predetermined initial portion or period of the first non-REM stage (e.g., light sleep stage). For example, the predetermined initial portion can be between about 30 seconds and about 20 minutes, between about 1 minute and about 10 minutes, between about 3 minutes and about 5 minutes, etc. The persistent total sleep time is a measure of sustained sleep, and smooths the sleep-wake hypnogram. For example, when the user is initially falling asleep, the user may be in the first non-REM stage for a very short time (e.g., about 30 seconds), then back into the wakefulness stage for a short period (e.g., one minute), and then goes back to the first non-REM stage. In this example, the persistent total sleep time excludes the first instance (e.g., about 30 seconds) of the first non-REM stage.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some implementations, the sleep session is defined as starting at the enter bed time (t<sub>bed</sub>) and ending at the rising time (t<sub>rise</sub>), i.e., the sleep session is defined as the total time in bed (TIB). In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as starting at the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>) and ending at the wake-up time (t<sub>wake</sub>). In some implementations, the sleep session is defined as the total sleep time (TST). In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as starting at the go-to-sleep time (t<sub>GTS</sub>) and ending at the wake-up time (t<sub>wake</sub>). In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as starting at the go-to-sleep time (t<sub>GTS</sub>) and ending at the rising time (t<sub>rise</sub>). In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as starting at the enter bed time (t<sub>bed</sub>) and ending at the wake-up time (t<sub>wake</sub>). In some implementations, a sleep session is defined as starting at the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>) and ending at the rising time (t<sub>rise</sub>).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, an exemplary hypnogram <b>1200</b> corresponding to the timeline <b>1100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), according to some implementations, is illustrated. As shown, the hypnogram <b>1200</b> includes a sleep-wake signal <b>1201</b>, a wakefulness stage axis <b>1210</b>, a REM stage axis <b>1220</b>, a light sleep stage axis <b>1230</b>, and a deep sleep stage axis <b>1240</b>. The intersection between the sleep-wake signal <b>1201</b> and one of the axes <b>1210</b>-<b>1240</b> is indicative of the sleep stage at any given time during the sleep session.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The sleep-wake signal <b>1201</b> can be generated based on physiological data associated with the user (e.g., generated by one or more of the sensors <b>130</b> described herein). The sleep-wake signal can be indicative of one or more sleep states, including wakefulness, relaxed wakefulness, microawakenings, a REM stage, a first non-REM stage, a second non-REM stage, a third non-REM stage, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, one or more of the first non-REM stage, the second non-REM stage, and the third non-REM stage can be grouped together and categorized as a light sleep stage or a deep sleep stage. For example, the light sleep stage can include the first non-REM stage and the deep sleep stage can include the second non-REM stage and the third non-REM stage. While the hypnogram <b>1200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> as including the light sleep stage axis <b>1230</b> and the deep sleep stage axis <b>1240</b>, in some implementations, the hypnogram <b>1200</b> can include an axis for each of the first non-REM stage, the second non-REM stage, and the third non-REM stage. In other implementations, the sleep-wake signal can also be indicative of a respiration signal, a respiration rate, an inspiration amplitude, an expiration amplitude, an inspiration-expiration ratio, a number of events per hour, a pattern of events, or any combination thereof. Information describing the sleep-wake signal can be stored in the memory device <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The hypnogram <b>1200</b> can be used to determine one or more sleep-related parameters, such as, for example, a sleep onset latency (SOL), wake-after-sleep onset (WASO), a sleep efficiency (SE), a sleep fragmentation index, sleep blocks, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">The sleep onset latency (SOL) is defined as the time between the go-to-sleep time (t<sub>GTS</sub>) and the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>). In other words, the sleep onset latency is indicative of the time that it took the user to actually fall asleep after initially attempting to fall asleep. In some implementations, the sleep onset latency is defined as a persistent sleep onset latency (PSOL). The persistent sleep onset latency differs from the sleep onset latency in that the persistent sleep onset latency is defined as the duration time between the go-to-sleep time and a predetermined amount of sustained sleep. In some implementations, the predetermined amount of sustained sleep can include, for example, at least 10 minutes of sleep within the second non-REM stage, the third non-REM stage, and/or the REM stage with no more than 2 minutes of wakefulness, the first non-REM stage, and/or movement therebetween. In other words, the persistent sleep onset latency requires up to, for example, 8 minutes of sustained sleep within the second non-REM stage, the third non-REM stage, and/or the REM stage. In other implementations, the predetermined amount of sustained sleep can include at least 10 minutes of sleep within the first non-REM stage, the second non-REM stage, the third non-REM stage, and/or the REM stage subsequent to the initial sleep time. In such implementations, the predetermined amount of sustained sleep can exclude any micro-awakenings (e.g., a ten second micro-awakening does not restart the 10-minute period).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The wake-after-sleep onset (WASO) is associated with the total duration of time that the user is awake between the initial sleep time and the wake-up time. Thus, the wake-after-sleep onset includes short and micro-awakenings during the sleep session (e.g., the micro-awakenings MA<sub>1 </sub>and MA<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), whether conscious or unconscious. In some implementations, the wake-after-sleep onset (WASO) is defined as a persistent wake-after-sleep onset (PWASO) that only includes the total durations of awakenings having a predetermined length (e.g., greater than 10 seconds, greater than 30 seconds, greater than 60 seconds, greater than about 5 minutes, greater than about 10 minutes, etc.)</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The sleep efficiency (SE) is determined as a ratio of the total time in bed (TIB) and the total sleep time (TST). For example, if the total time in bed is 8 hours and the total sleep time is 7.5 hours, the sleep efficiency for that sleep session is 93.75%. The sleep efficiency is indicative of the sleep hygiene of the user. For example, if the user enters the bed and spends time engaged in other activities (e.g., watching TV) before sleep, the sleep efficiency will be reduced (e.g., the user is penalized). In some implementations, the sleep efficiency (SE) can be calculated based on the total time in bed (TIB) and the total time that the user is attempting to sleep. In such implementations, the total time that the user is attempting to sleep is defined as the duration between the go-to-sleep (GTS) time and the rising time described herein. For example, if the total sleep time is 8 hours (e.g., between 11 PM and 7 AM), the go-to-sleep time is 10:45 PM, and the rising time is 7:15 AM, in such implementations, the sleep efficiency parameter is calculated as about 94%.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The fragmentation index is determined based at least in part on the number of awakenings during the sleep session. For example, if the user had two micro-awakenings (e.g., micro-awakening MA<sub>1 </sub>and micro-awakening MA<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), the fragmentation index can be expressed as 2. In some implementations, the fragmentation index is scaled between a predetermined range of integers (e.g., between 0 and 10).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The sleep blocks are associated with a transition between any stage of sleep (e.g., the first non-REM stage, the second non-REM stage, the third non-REM stage, and/or the REM) and the wakefulness stage. The sleep blocks can be calculated at a resolution of, for example, 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In some implementations, the systems and methods described herein can include generating or analyzing a hypnogram including a sleep-wake signal to determine or identify the enter bed time (t<sub>bed</sub>), the go-to-sleep time (t<sub>GTS</sub>), the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>), one or more first micro-awakenings (e.g., MA<sub>1 </sub>and MA<sub>2</sub>), the wake-up time (t<sub>wake</sub>), the rising time (t<sub>rise</sub>), or any combination thereof based at least in part on the sleep-wake signal of a hypnogram.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In other implementations, one or more of the sensors <b>130</b> can be used to determine or identify the enter bed time (t<sub>bed</sub>), the go-to-sleep time (t<sub>GTS</sub>), the initial sleep time (t<sub>sleep</sub>), one or more first micro-awakenings (e.g., MA<sub>1 </sub>and MA<sub>2</sub>), the wake-up time (t<sub>wake</sub>), the rising time (t<sub>rise</sub>), or any combination thereof, which in turn define the sleep session.
