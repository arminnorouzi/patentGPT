Feeding the U.S., let alone the rest of the world is a difficult task. Despite the current difficulty, by 2050, the global population is expected to grow to 9.7 billion people. In response to this population growth, experts believe a 60% increase in food production is needed compared with 2005-2007 levels. <i>Nat Sustain </i>3, 821-835 (2020). Meeting this demand will not be easy given that resources involved&#x2014;such as farmable land&#x2014;are finite.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">In fact, while the U.S. enjoys an abundance of food, many in the world are unable to obtain their minimum nutritional needs. Therefore, food production and food security are important, pressing issues. There is general agreement, however, that the reasons we have not yet reached a full crisis is due to continuous innovation in food production and distribution. One of the most important, if not the most important innovation, has been agrochemicals.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">Beyond normal nutritional needs, maximizing and maintaining food production during times of war and is of importance, and may rise to the level of national security as well as a humanitarian necessity. Accordingly, maintaining food stores and production is of importance.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">As used herein, the term agrochemical includes compounds or ingredients registered or recognized as being biologically active against an agricultural pest. In general, agrochemical active ingredients include compounds listed in The Pesticide Manual, 12th edition, 2001, British Crop Protection Council. Agrochemicals include, but are not limited to herbicides, fungicides, other insecticides, bactericides, insect growth regulators, plant growth regulators, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of these preparations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">With respect to the importance of insecticides as agrochemicals, insecticides can be used to, e.g., (1) increase crop yields; (2) prevent spoilage of stored food; or (3) prevent diseases spread by pests. Moreover, insecticides can have importance in managing invasive species and protecting natural environments. Yet, discovering new insecticides is not an easy task, and there is an ever growing need due to the development of insecticide resistance in pest species.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">For instance, in 2003, it was estimated that the average cost for developing a new pesticide was more than $180 million and took 8-10 years. Charles Clift, <i>Intellectual Property Management in Health and Agricultural Innovation A Handbook of Best Practices </i>Volume Two 431, 431-435 (2007); see also Philips McDougall, <i>The Cost of New Agrochemical Product Discovery, Development, and Registration in </i>1995, 2000, 2005-8 <i>and </i>2010-2014. <i>R</i>&#x26;<i>D expenditure in </i>2014 <i>and expectations for </i>2019 4 (2016). During this development period, scientists would typically review 140,000 compounds. Since then, costs and development time have steadily increased. As indicated by the discovery and development costs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a survey of leading crop protection companies (BASF, Bayer, Dow, DuPont, and Syngenta) found that the cost of product development has risen to $286 million. Similarly, the time from first synthesis of a new crop protection molecule to its subsequent commercial introduction has risen from 8.3 years to 11.3 years.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">In general, the agrochemical development process can be split into three stages: (1) research/discovery; (2) development; and (3) registration. Research includes synthesizing hundreds of thousands of new molecules and screening them for biological activity and useful properties. The ultimate goal of research is discovering product candidates having good biological, chemical, toxicological, environmental and commercial characteristics for further development. Development encompasses the steps required to commercialize a product. This entails detailed biological and safety testing; manufacturing studies; and pilot plant startups. Once development is complete, the information produced will be sent to a regulatory body for the registration step. If the proposed product meets the registration agency's criteria, marketing of the product may begin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">The present disclosure relates to the discovery of one such compound, a compound of Formula (I),</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="56.56mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000082A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">and its agrochemical properties.

This mode of action is recognized in the Insecticide Resistance Classification (IRAC) as group 30&#x2014;a novel group. IRAC is a long-standing tool used for managing insecticide resistance by rotating between different modes of actions or chemical classes. Thomas C. Sparks, Ralf Nauen, <i>IRAC: Mode of action classification and insecticide resistance management</i>, Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology, Volume 121, 2015, Pages 122-128.
