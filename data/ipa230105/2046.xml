UAV <b>10</b> includes a body <b>12</b> having a rotor system <b>14</b>, a motivation system <b>16</b> attached to the body to motivate the UAV along the conductor, a battery <b>18</b> carried by the body and electrically connected to at least one of the rotary system <b>14</b> and the motivation system <b>16</b>, one or more monitoring tools <b>20</b> mounted with the body, and an energy harvesting system <b>22</b> configured to harvest electricity from the aerial power transmission line system and charge battery <b>18</b> and or to power one or more of the UAV systems directly. UAV <b>10</b> includes avionics, such a processor <b>24</b>, e.g. controller, in communication with the various UAV systems and having software and instructions for operating UAV <b>10</b> in response to instructions from a local or remote operator and/or to operate autonomously. UAV <b>10</b> may include navigation sensors <b>26</b>, such as global positioning sensors and proximity sensors, in communication with processor <b>24</b>. Processor <b>24</b> is configured to communicate with a remote site to transmit data from the one or more monitoring tools <b>20</b> and or receive instructions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Rotor system <b>14</b> includes rotor assemblies <b>28</b> including motors <b>30</b> driving rotor blades <b>32</b>. Rotor assemblies <b>28</b> may be gimballed. Motors <b>30</b> are electrically connected to battery <b>18</b> and or electricity harvesting system <b>22</b>. Those skilled in the art with benefit of this disclosure will understand that battery <b>18</b> includes other electric storage devices, such as capacitors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Motivation system <b>16</b> is configured to physically contact the aerial conductor (transmission line) and support the weight of the UAV and in some embodiments move UAV <b>10</b> along the aerial conductor. Motivation system <b>16</b> includes a set <b>34</b> of wheels <b>36</b> that are coaxially aligned to engage the same conductor. In the illustrated embodiment, UAV <b>10</b> has a single set <b>34</b> of wheels to engage and support UAV <b>10</b> on a single conductor. The exemplary set <b>34</b> of wheels <b>36</b> has two wheels <b>36</b>; however, the set of wheels may have more than two wheels. Additional co-axial wheels <b>36</b> may facilitate stability when motivation system <b>16</b> is used to move UAV <b>10</b> across a power line component such as a splice, suspender clamp, or cable spacer. In some embodiments, wheels <b>36</b> are electrically driven to rotate and to move UAV <b>10</b> along a conductor. In the illustrated example, each wheel <b>36</b> includes a motor <b>38</b>. Wheels <b>36</b> may include V-shaped grooves <b>40</b> to engage the conductor and conductor components.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Wheels <b>36</b> are connected to body <b>12</b> by arms <b>42</b>. Arms <b>42</b> position wheels <b>36</b> above body <b>12</b>. The center of gravity <b>45</b> of UAV <b>10</b> is positioned in the same plane as co-axial set <b>34</b> of wheels so that a single set <b>34</b> of wheels <b>36</b> support UAV <b>10</b> from a single conductor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">UAV <b>10</b> may include one or more monitoring tools <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, UAV <b>10</b> includes a camera for a monitoring tool. The camera may be an infrared camera. Monitoring tool <b>20</b> may be gimballed to provide visual coverage of the components to be visually inspected. For example, monitoring tool <b>20</b> may be used to inspect and monitor the conductor from which the UAV is suspended, adjacent conductors, conductor components, suspension towers and the like. Monitoring tools <b>20</b> may include other sensors and devices used to inspect and monitor aerial transmission line systems.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An exemplary energy harvesting system <b>22</b> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. With additional reference to the other figures, energy harvesting system <b>22</b> includes a coil <b>44</b>, for example open air or magnetic core, and an AC/DC power rectifier <b>46</b>. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, coil <b>44</b> is positioned at wheels <b>36</b> so as to be in close proximity to the AC power transmission line <b>48</b>. For example, coil <b>44</b> extends between the legs <b>42</b> connecting the set of wheels to body <b>12</b>. Wires <b>47</b> may extend from coil <b>44</b> through legs <b>42</b> to the AC/DC power rectifier <b>46</b> positioned in body <b>12</b> (e.g., frame) with the battery and other avionics. When UAV <b>10</b> is proximate to an AC transmission line <b>48</b>, i.e. conductor, a portion of the magnetic field <b>49</b> generated by transmission line <b>48</b> is converted by harvesting system <b>22</b> into power. The rectified power is used by battery <b>18</b> management system to recharge the batteries for use by UAV systems, such as rotor motors <b>30</b>, wheel motors <b>38</b>, controller <b>24</b>, and monitoring tools <b>20</b> and sensors <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A method of inspecting an aerial power transmission line system <b>50</b> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. Aerial power transmission line system <b>50</b> includes one or more power lines, generally referred to as conductor <b>48</b>, suspended above ground <b>52</b> by suspension towers <b>54</b>. Aerial power transmission line system <b>50</b> is illustrated herein as a high-voltage system, however, UAV <b>10</b> and the methods disclosed herein may be used in other systems. Aerial power transmission line system <b>50</b> may include various components, generally denoted <b>56</b>, that need to be inspected and the components may be an obstacle to be navigated by UAV <b>10</b>. A non-exclusive list of components <b>56</b> includes conductor splices, connectors, cable-spacers, dampers, suspension towers, suspension clamps, and marker balls. As will be understood by those skilled in the art with benefit of this disclosure, UAV <b>10</b> may navigate around, over, or past these components, e.g. obstacles, by operating the wheels to drive across the component and by operation of the rotor assemblies to fly around the component or to aide in powering the UAV across the component with the wheels contacting the conductor and the component. As is well known, conductors <b>48</b> have spans that have downgrades <b>58</b> where the conductor is declined downward from the tower in the direction of the UAV travel and inclines <b>60</b> where the UAV has to travel upward on the conductor. In accordance to some embodiments, the UAV rotor assemblies may be operated to brake and slow the descent of the UAV on downgrades <b>58</b> and the UAV rotor assemblies may be operated to help the UAV climb inclines <b>60</b> while maintaining wheels <b>36</b> on the conductor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, UAV <b>10</b> is deployed from the ground <b>52</b> and flown to and landed on a conductor <b>48</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. UAV <b>10</b> is landed by suspending UAV <b>10</b> on conductor <b>48</b> by set <b>34</b> of wheels <b>36</b>. In this example, UAV <b>10</b> is suspended from a single conductor <b>48</b>. UAV <b>10</b> may be deployed in direct response from an operator or UAV <b>10</b> may be self-deployed, for example, in response to instructions included in the on-board processors. In accordance to some embodiments, UAV <b>10</b> may be self-deployed and autonomous for example to continuously monitor a section of a transmission line.
