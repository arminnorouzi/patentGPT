The paperboard is cut, rolled and folded in advance, and paperboards in a paperboard stack are conveyed to a bending station through a feeding device for folding. After the box is well folded, a product is put in the box followed by a cover sealing operation. At present, manual operation is usually used when a paper box with a turnover cover is folded and sealed, so that the labor intensity is high, and the improvement of production efficiency is not facilitated. In Chinese Patent Publication No. CN208068982U, the punching mechanism needs to comprise a bottom-forming outer mold assembly and an inner mold punch. The outer mold assembly comprises a limit baffle and a forming limit structure, the folding and forming of the bottom box need to be achieved by adhesion with glue, and it is difficult to ensure that the side walls of the paper box are sequentially folded and adhered when the bottom box is bent and formed, so that the forming yield is low. Only by pre-bending through other devices, can the paper box be completely formed by pre-folding the overlapped adhesion portion, which increases the complexity of the device, and simultaneously, the inner mold punch is easy to conflict with the pre-folded portion when being pressed downwards.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aiming at the above technical defects in the prior art, the present invention provides a paper box package forming apparatus to realize automatic box folding and automatic cover sealing operations of a paper box and thus to improve the production efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technical solution of the present invention is as follows.
