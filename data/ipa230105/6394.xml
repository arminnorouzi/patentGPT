In order to fit such a connector well, it is conceivable to apply, for example, a connector guide mechanism described in JP2016-024952A.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The connector guide mechanism includes a plug, a socket, a plug-side guide, and a socket-side guide. The plug-side guide and the socket-side guide include a positioning portion that aligns the plug and a front end portion of the plug-side guide with predetermined positions in a direction around an axis when the plug is inserted into the socket. The positioning portion includes a protruding portion formed at the front end portion of the plug-side guide, and a groove formed in an opening portion of the socket-side guide such that the protruding, portion is inserted into the opening portion. According to this configuration, since the plug and the front end portion of the plug-side guide are restricted in a normal direction by the positioning portion, even when a central axis direction of the plug and a central axis direction of the socket are in an inclined relationship, the plug can be inserted and removed well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the connector guide mechanism disclosed in JP2016-024952A, in a plan view, the groove has a rectangular shape extending in a fitting direction, and the protruding portion has a rectangular shape corresponding to the groove. Therefore, in the connector guide mechanism, although an inlet side of the groove is widened, depending on an insertion angle at the time of plug insertion, the protruding portion may be caught by a groove wall surface in the vicinity of the inlet of the groove and the plug may not be smoothly fitted.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a connector fitting structure capable of smoothly inserting and fitting a connector.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an illustrative aspect of the present disclosure, a connector fitting structure includes: a first connector; and a second connector, in which the first connector and the second connector are fitted and electrically connected to each other. The first connector includes: a first housing that houses a first connection terminal; and a guide groove provided in the first housing. The guide groove includes: a first groove portion extending along a connector fitting direction; a second groove portion formed to gradually increase in width from a side of the first groove portion toward a side of the second connector; and a connection portion that connects the first groove portion and the second groove portion. The second connector includes: a second housing that houses a second connection terminal; and a projection portion provided on the second housing and inserted into the guide groove. The projection portion has a recessed portion formed on a front end side of the projection portion and on at least one side surface of the projection portion that faces groove side surfaces of the guide groove.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure has been briefly described above.

On the other hand, since the pick-up rib <b>19</b> of the embodiment does not interfere with the connection portion <b>85</b><i>c, </i>the pick-up rib <b>19</b> does not catch the connection portion <b>85</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, according to the connector fitting structure of the inlet <b>1</b> and the inlet plug <b>5</b> of the present embodiment, the recessed portions <b>191</b> are formed in the side surfaces of the pick-up rib <b>19</b>. With this configuration, even when the pick-up rib <b>19</b> is obliquely inserted into the fitting guide groove <b>85</b>, interference between the pick-up rib <b>19</b> and the connection portion <b>85</b><i>c </i>is avoided by the recessed portions <b>191</b>, and the pick-up rib <b>19</b> and the connection portion <b>85</b><i>c </i>are not caught by each other. Therefore, the inlet <b>1</b> and the inlet plug <b>5</b> can be smoothly fitted to each other. Therefore, the connector fitting structure of the present embodiment is particularly useful when the inlet <b>1</b> and the inlet plug <b>5</b> are fitted to each other automatically or semi-automatically. In addition, since the plurality of recessed portions <b>191</b> are formed on one side surface of the pick-up rib <b>19</b>, even when an approach angle of the pick-up rib <b>19</b> is changed, interference with the connection portion <b>85</b><i>c </i>can be avoided in any of the recessed portions <b>191</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described above, and modifications, improvements, and the like can be made as appropriate.

Further, the cross-sectional shape or the shape in the plan view of the recessed portion formed in the pick-up rib <b>19</b> is not limited to the curved shape, and may be formed by a bent straight line like the recessed portions <b>191</b> provided in a pick-up rib <b>19</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, in the above embodiment, the pick-up rib <b>19</b> in which the recessed portions are formed is provided on the inlet <b>1</b>, and the fitting guide groove <b>85</b> is provided in the inlet plug <b>5</b>, but the present disclosure is not limited to this configuration. One of two connectors to be fitted to each other may be provided with a projection portion corresponding to a pick-up rib in which a recessed portion is formed, and the other connector may be provided with a guide groove into which the projection portion is inserted.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a connector fitting structure includes: a first connector (inlet plug <b>5</b>); and a second connector (inlet <b>1</b>), in which the first connector (<b>5</b>) and the second connector (<b>1</b>) are fitted and electrically connected to each other. The first connector (<b>5</b>) includes: a first housing (plug housing <b>80</b>) that houses a first connection terminal; and a guide groove (fitting guide groove <b>85</b>) provided in the first housing (<b>80</b>).

The second connector (<b>1</b>) includes: a second housing (outer case <b>51</b>) that houses a second connection terminal: and a projection portion (pick-up rib <b>19</b>) provided on the second housing and inserted into the guide groove. The projection portion (<b>19</b>) has a recessed portion (<b>191</b>) formed on a front end side of the projection portion and on at least one side surface of the projection portion that faces groove side surfaces of the guide groove.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the connector having the configuration of the first aspect, since the recessed portion is formed on the side surface of the projection portion, even when the projection portion is obliquely inserted into the guide groove, interference between the projection portion and the connection portion of the guide groove is avoided by the recessed portion, and the projection portion and the connection portion of the guide groove are not caught. Therefore, the first connector and the second connector can he smoothly fitted to each other. The oblique insertion means that the projection portion is inserted into the guide groove while being inclined in a width direction of the guide groove with respect to the connector fitting direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, the recessed portion (<b>191</b>) may be each formed on both side surfaces of the projection portion (<b>19</b>) that face the groove side surfaces.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, the recessed portion (<b>191</b>) may include a plurality of recessed portions (<b>191</b>), and the plurality of recessed portions (<b>191</b>) may be formed in the projection portion for each predetermined interval along the connector fitting direction from the front end side.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to a fourth aspect of the present disclosure, a cross-sectional shape of the recessed portion taken planarly along a groove bottom surface of the guide groove (<b>85</b>) may have a curved shape.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to a fifth aspect of the present disclosure, the cross-sectional shape on the at least one side surface of the projection portion (<b>19</b>) may have a sine wave shape.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide a connector fitting structure capable of smoothly inserting and fitting a connector.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
