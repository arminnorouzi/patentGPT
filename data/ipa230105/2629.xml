FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an ultraviolet curable inkjet ink.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Accompanying the decrease in printing lot size and the diversification of needs, the prevalence of digital printing methods has rapidly advanced. A plate is not required with digital printing methods, thus, it is possible to reduce costs and reduce the size of printing equipment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inkjet printing method which is one type of digital printing method is a method in which very fine liquid droplets of ink are jetted from an inkjet head and deposited onto a recording medium (substrate) and form images or text on the recording medium to obtain a recorded item (hereinafter, referred to as the &#x201c;printed matter&#x201d;). Compared with other digital printing methods, the inkjet printing method is superior from viewpoints such as the size and cost of the printing apparatus, the running costs during printing, and the ease of making full color printed matters. In recent years, the inkjet printing method has been increasingly used in industrial printing applications. Further, recently, as the performance of inkjet heads has improved, the application of inkjet printing methods to other known printing markets such as offset printing has also been anticipated, and inkjet printers for the existing printing market have actually begun to be marketed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the future, in order to increase the share of inkjet printing methods in the existing printing market, it will be necessary to support the printing of numerous text and images. For example, there are often numerous portions having different printing rates in a single primed matter. Therefore, it is necessary to create a printed matter having a comparable quality regardless of the amount of ink applied on the recording medium.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the one hand, there are various types of inks used in the inkjet printing method such as aqueous-based, oil-based, solvent-based and, ultraviolet curable, but the demand for active energy ray-curable inkjet inks has been increasing due to characteristics such as the speed of the drying time and the strength of the cured film forming the print layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the development of an ultraviolet curable inkjet printing method for the existing printing market, it is remarkably difficult to ensure the uniformity of the printed matter quality regardless of the amount of ink applied on the recording medium as stated above. For example, in a printed matter which uses an ultraviolet curable ink, differences in the curability and flexibility tend to occur due to the thickness of the ink layer. The reasons for this include the influence (oxygen inhibition) of atmospheric oxygen in the ink layer surface, and, the formation of three-dimensional crosslinks due to a (polyfunctional) polymerizable monomer having a plurality of polymerizable groups.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, when using an ultraviolet curable inkjet printing method in an existing printing market, it is also necessary to support printing speeds which are equal or greater than the conventionally-used offset printing methods and the like. Generally, in order to support high speed printing with an ultraviolet curable inkjet printing method, it is necessary to improve the reactivity to ultraviolet rays which induce the polymerization reaction. For example, it is effective to use a polymerizable monomer having a large number of polymerizable groups in order to improve the aforementioned reactivity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when a set amount of the polymerizable monomer having a large number of polymerizable groups was used, there was the problem that although the scratch resistance is excellent, the flexibility deteriorates and the printed matter becomes remarkably fragile due to the crosslink density of the cured ink layer becoming high.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the first place, the viscosity of an ink for use with an inkjet printing method is preferably designed to a low viscosity for a smooth and stable discharge from the inkjet head. Therefore, it is necessary to use a low viscosity polymerizable monomer to design the ink, and in general, as the viscosity is high, there is a limit to the polymerizable monomers having a large number of polymerizable groups which are used.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As an examination in order to solve the aforementioned problems, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses a photocurable ink composition for an inkjet recording for ensuring the extensibility (flexibility) of an ink layer and suppressing wrinkling during film thickening, comprising a vinyl ether group-containing (meth)acrylate having a specific structure, a monofunctional (meth)acrylate, and, a polyfunctional (meth)acrylate and the like. However, Patent Document 1 focusses only on the curability of thick films, and does not consider the curability of thin films. As mentioned above, it can be said that the configuration disclosed in Patent Document 1 is insufficient in order to support the printing of numerous text and images.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, Patent Document 2 discloses a configuration, as a photocurable ink for inkjet printing having excellent curability of a thin film when using an ultraviolet light-emitting diode, adhesion to a polyvinyl chloride sheet substrate, discharge stability and the like, containing 65 to 85 percent by mass of a monofunctional monomer containing a cyclic structure relative to a polymerizable monomer, and furthermore, containing an ether group-containing monofunctional monomer, an amino group-containing polyfunctional monomer, a monomer containing a trimethylol propane skeleton and the like. However, Patent Document 2 does not examine the curability of thick films as opposed to Patent Document 1. Furthermore, the aforementioned photocurable ink compositions for inkjet recording has a high content of the monofunctional monomer, thus, there is the risk that the curability will be insufficient when used under high-speed printing conditions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, an ink (ultraviolet curable ink for inkjet recording) which is used in an ultraviolet curable inkjet printing method with which a printed matter excellent in curability and flexibility of the coating film can be obtained regardless of the amount of ink applied on the recording medium and furthermore having an excellent discharge stability has not existed until now.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p

Further, it is known that an ink containing an acylphosphine oxide photopolymerization initiator has an excellent curability compared to an ink containing other types of photopolymerization initiators. On the other hand, ethoxyphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;EO-TPO&#x201d; in the present description) belonging to acylphosphine oxide photopolymerization initiators is inferior in terms of improving the curability compared to other acylphosphine oxide photopolymerization initiators (for example, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;BTPO&#x201d; in the present description), and, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosohine oxide (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;TPO&#x201d; in the present description)). The aromatic ring structure in the photopolymerization initiator molecule is involved in the absorption of ultraviolet rays, thus, it is considered that an EO-TPO having a lower number of aromatic ring structures than BTPO and TPO is inferior in terms of absorption ability of ultraviolet rays.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When using EO-TPO in an inkjet ink, conventionally, it was necessary to assist the curability with some other method. For example, increasing the amount of photopolymerization initiator in the ink can be considered but, there is the risk that increasing the photopolymerization initiator amount will lead to deterioration of the discharge stability.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, the present inventors performed keen research, and as a result, discovered that by combining EO-TPO with the compound represented by General formula (A) in a predetermined blending ratio, the curability is significantly improved without the excessive use of EO-TPO. The detailed mechanism of this is unclear, but the present inventors have the following speculation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is considered that EO-TPO and the compound represented by General formula (A) have a high affinity as both compounds have an ethoxy group, and EO-TPO is uniformly present in the ink along with the compound represented by General formula (A). Therefore, the radical generated from EO-TPO can react quickly with the compound represented by General formula (A) which exists in close proximity. Further, when a polymerizable monomer other than the compound represented by General formula (A) is present, the radical from the compound represented by General formula (A) is received and is involved in the growth reaction. In addition, as mentioned above, EO-TPO is an acylphosphine oxide photopolymerization initiator, and in the first place, is an effective material for improving the curability on the inside of an ink. Further, it is considered that EO-TPO exists uniformly on the inside of an ink along with the compound represented by General formula (A). As a result of the above, it is considered that curing progresses rapidly without differences in the curing speed occurring on the inside of an ink and on the ink surface, and both the curability and the coating film flexibility can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, in this case, if either EO-TPO or the compound represented by General formula (A) is present in excess, there is the risk that the curability and/or coating film flexibility will deteriorate due to the compound represented by General formula (A) being unable to receive the radical generated from EO-TPO, or, the radical which is necessary for the polymerization reaction of the compound represented by General formula (A) being present in an insufficient amount. Therefore, in the embodiment of the present invention, the content ration of EO-TPO and the compound represented by General formula (A) is prescribed at 2:1 to 8.5:1, and both the curability and the coating film flexibility are achieved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that, even in the absence of an excessive amount of EO-TPO, a sufficient curability and coating film flexibility can be obtained by the presence of the compound represented by General formula (A) at a predetermined amount, thus, there is no risk of the aforementioned deterioration of the discharge stability. Further, it is considered that the interaction among the ethoxy groups which are present in the compound represented by General formula (A) causes the optimization of the microscopic viscoelasticity of the ink, and, the formation of an intermolecular chain network on the inside of the cured ink, and further improves the discharge stability and the coating film flexibility.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above the configuration of the embodiment of the present invention is indispensable in order to obtain the printed matter having an excellent curability and coating film flexibility regardless of the amount applied to the recording medium, and to obtain the ink having an excellent discharge stability.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, each component constituting the ink of the embodiment of the present invention be described in detail below.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Polymerizable Monomer</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The polymerizable monomer has the functions which cause a polymerization or a crosslinking reaction an initiating species such as a radical generated from a photopolymerization initiator which will be described later, and which cures a composition comprising the polymerizable monomer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As mentioned above, the ink of the embodiment of the present invention contains the compound represented by the following General formula (A) as the polymerizable monomer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CH&#x2014;CO&#x2014;(O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;R&#x2003;&#x2003;General formula (A):<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In the aforementioned General formula (A), R represents an acrylolyl group or a vinyl group, and n represents an integer from 2 to 10.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">As mentioned above, it is possible to achieve both the curability and the coating film flexibility by use of the compound represented by General formula (A) with EO-TPO.

By maintaining the content within this range, the reactivity of the ink can be greatly improved while maintaining the flexibility of the coating film as is.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The ink of the embodiment of the present invention may also contain polymerizable monomers (hereinafter, referred to as the &#x201c;other polymerizable monomers&#x201d;) other than the aforementioned compound represented by General formula (A).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The other polymerizable monomers are not specifically limited as long as they have characteristics of the aforementioned polymerizable monomer, and can be used regardless of the type of monomer, oligomer, or polymer.
