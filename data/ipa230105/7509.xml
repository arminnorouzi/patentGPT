In an embodiment, upon accessing the AP, the direct-connected device may transmit the access information, e.g., the SSID and the password, of the AP. The AP may check whether the SSID and password transmitted by the direct-connected device are identical to the SSID and password set in the AP. If the SSID and password transmitted by the direct-connected device are identical to the SSID and password set in the AP, the AP may identify that the direct-connected device is a direct-connected device included in the IoT network including the AP.

In an embodiment, the ping has been described as an example of the signal for checking whether it is possible for the direct-connected device to communicate with the cloud server, but any signal may be used as long as it is possible to check whether it is possible for the direct-connected device to communicate with the cloud server as well as the ping.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">If the response to the ping is not received from the direct-connected device, the cloud server may determine that the direct-connected device is not connected to the cloud server, for example, that a connection between the cloud server and the direct-connected device is released.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Location information of the direct-connected device may be, for example, coordinate information of the direct-connected device.
