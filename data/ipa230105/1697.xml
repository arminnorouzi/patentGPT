The leg unit <b>14</b> is in contact with an installation surface Al on which the recording device <b>11</b> is installed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The recording device <b>11</b> includes a recording unit <b>15</b>. The recording unit <b>15</b> is accommodated in the housing <b>12</b>. The recording unit <b>15</b> is configured to eject liquid onto the medium <b>99</b>. An image is recorded on the medium <b>99</b> when the recording unit <b>15</b> ejects the liquid onto the medium <b>99</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this example, the recording unit <b>15</b> includes a head <b>16</b> and a carriage <b>17</b>.

The carriage <b>17</b> scans the medium <b>99</b>. Specifically, the carriage <b>17</b> moves in a first direction X<b>1</b> and a second direction X<b>2</b> in the housing <b>12</b>. With this, the head <b>16</b> ejects the liquid over the width of the medium <b>99</b>. In this manner, the recording device <b>11</b> in this example is a serial printer.

In other words, the second medium holding unit <b>24</b> is located outside of the housing <b>12</b>. The second medium holding unit <b>24</b> may be accommodated in the housing <b>12</b>. In this example, the second medium holding unit <b>24</b> is located downstream of the first medium holding unit <b>23</b> in the transport direction Y. In this example, the second medium holding unit <b>24</b> is located downstream of the recording unit <b>15</b> in the transport direction Y.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this example, the first medium holding unit <b>23</b> and the second medium holding unit <b>24</b> transport the medium <b>99</b>. The recording device <b>11</b> may additionally include a transport unit such as a roller and a belt for transporting the medium <b>99</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this example, the recording device <b>11</b> performs recording on the medium <b>99</b> having a continuously elongated shape. The recording device <b>11</b> may perform recording on the medium <b>99</b> in a cut form, instead of the elongated medium <b>99</b>. In this case, for example, the first medium holding unit <b>23</b> may include a cassette that accommodates the medium <b>99</b> before recording. For example, the second medium holding unit <b>24</b> may include a tray on which the medium <b>99</b> after recording is stacked. The recording device <b>11</b> may perform recording on the medium <b>99</b> inserted into the housing <b>12</b> by a user, instead of the medium <b>99</b> fed out from the first medium holding unit <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the recording device <b>11</b> includes a main body frame <b>27</b>.
