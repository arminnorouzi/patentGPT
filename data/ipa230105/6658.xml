Examples of devices that may be used to generate clock signals include crystal (e.g., quartz) oscillators and oscillator circuits (e.g., voltage-controlled oscillators, or VCOs). Duty-cycles of the clock signals that these devices provide may not be perfect in an as-fabricated electronic device, and may vary during operation of the device. For example, it may be desired to operate an electronic device using a clock signal that has a 50% duty-cycle. Deviations from a desired duty-cycle in a clock signal may be problematic for operation of some electronic devices.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While this disclosure concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming specific embodiments, various features and advantages of embodiments within the scope of this disclosure may be more readily ascertained from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a memory device, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an electrical circuit schematic illustration of a duty-cycle corrector, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an electrical circuit schematic illustration of an amplifier circuit, which may be used as an amplifier circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, according to some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a signal timing diagram of examples of signals of the duty-cycle corrector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with a duty-cycle of the input clock signal at substantially 50%;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a signal timing diagram of examples of signals of the duty-cycle corrector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with a duty-cycle of the input clock signal at substantially 30%;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of correcting a duty-cycle of an input clock signal, according to some embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computing system, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific examples of embodiments in which the present disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the present disclosure. However, other embodiments enabled herein may be utilized, and structural, material, and process changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The illustrations presented herein are not meant to be actual views of any particular method, system, device, or structure, but are merely idealized representations that are employed to describe the embodiments of the present disclosure. In some instances similar structures or components in the various drawings may retain the same or similar numbering for the convenience of the reader; however, the similarity in numbering does not necessarily mean that the structures or components are identical in size, composition, configuration, or any other property.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description may include examples to help enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the disclosed embodiments. The use of the terms &#x201c;exemplary,&#x201d; &#x201c;by example,&#x201d; and &#x201c;for example,&#x201d; means that the related description is explanatory, and though the scope of the disclosure is intended to encompass the examples and legal equivalents, the use of such terms is not intended to limit the scope of an embodiment or this disclosure to the specified components, steps, features, functions, or the like.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It will be readily understood that the components of the embodiments as generally described herein and illustrated in the drawings could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following description of various embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure, but is merely representative of various embodiments. While the various aspects of the embodiments may be presented in the drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale unless specifically indicated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, specific implementations shown and described are only examples and should not be construed as the only way to implement the present disclosure unless specified otherwise herein. Elements, circuits, and functions may be shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the present disclosure in unnecessary detail. Conversely, specific implementations shown and described are exemplary only and should not be construed as the only way to implement the present disclosure unless specified otherwise herein. Additionally, block definitions and partitioning of logic between various blocks is exemplary of a specific implementation. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced by numerous other partitioning solutions. For the most part, details concerning timing considerations and the like have been omitted where such details are not necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the present disclosure and are within the abilities of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. Some drawings may illustrate signals as a single signal for clarity of presentation and description.

Although a flowchart may describe operational acts as a sequential process, many of these acts can be performed in another sequence, in parallel, or substantially concurrently. In addition, the order of the acts may be re-arranged.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Any reference to an element herein using a designation such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and so forth does not limit the quantity or order of those elements, unless such limitation is explicitly stated. Rather, these designations may be used herein as a convenient method of distinguishing between two or more elements or instances of an element. Thus, a reference to first and second elements does not mean that only two elements may be employed there or that the first element must precede the second element in some manner. In addition, unless stated otherwise, a set of elements may include one or more elements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in reference to a given parameter, property, or condition means and includes to a degree that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the given parameter, property, or condition is met with a small degree of variance, such as, for example, within acceptable manufacturing tolerances. By way of example, depending on the particular parameter, property, or condition that is substantially met, the parameter, property, or condition may be at least 90% met, at least 95% met, or even at least 99% met.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; refers to both direct electrical connection (i.e., no intervening objects electrically connected between) and indirect electrical connection (i.e., one or more intervening objects electrically connected between).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;assert&#x201d; and other forms of the term &#x201c;assert&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;asserted,&#x201d; &#x201c;asserting,&#x201d; &#x201c;assertion&#x201d;), when used to indicate the state of an electrical signal, refer to transitioning and/or holding the electrical signal to and/or in a state that triggers circuitry that receives the electrical signal to perform a predetermined function. For example, an operational amplifier may have an enable input terminal, and may be activated responsive to an assertion (e.g., a transition from a logic level low voltage potential to a logic level high voltage potential) of an enable signal provided to the enable input terminal. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that an assertion of an electrical signal may include a transition from a logic level low voltage potential to a logic level high voltage potential, a transition from a logic level high voltage potential to a logic level low voltage potential, a maintenance of a logic level high voltage potential, a maintenance of a logic level low voltage potential, a transition from a first logic level voltage potential to a second logic level voltage potential (e.g., in a system including three or more logic level voltage potentials), or combinations thereof. Also, as used herein, the term &#x201c;de-assert&#x201d; and other forms of the term &#x201c;de-assert&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;de-asserted,&#x201d; &#x201c;de-asserting,&#x201d; &#x201c;de-assertion&#x201d;) refer to transitioning and/or holding an electrical signal to and/or in a state that disables circuitry that receives the electrical signal from performing a predetermined function.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;active material&#x201d; refers to a semiconductor material that has been doped to function as a channel material in a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistor (FET) (MOSFET). A MOSFET transistor having a channel material that has been doped predominantly with donor impurities is referred to herein as an N-type MOS (NMOS) transistor because the active material serving as the channel material for the NMOS transistor includes N-type semiconductor material. Similarly, a MOSFET transistor having a channel material that has been doped predominantly with trivalent or acceptor impurities is referred to herein as a P-type MOS (PMOS) transistor because the active material serving as the channel material for the PMOS transistor includes P-type semiconductor material.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Quality of clock signals (e.g., the clock signal duty-cycle and clock signal jitter) in electronic devices (e.g., memory devices) is relevant to high-frequency data transfer. Some systems that use complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) signaling may benefit from duty-cycle trimming. One way to perform duty-cycle trimming of a clock signal is to use a string of inverters with at least one inverter having variable strength PMOS field effect transistors (PFETs) and NMOS field effect transistors (NFETS). A number of transistors of the inverter used to drive a signal (e.g., a clock signal) may be controlled by electrically connecting and disconnecting transistors using switches. A rising time and a falling time, and correspondingly the duty-cycle, may be adjusted based on switching of the transistors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another way to perform duty-cycle trimming of a clock signal may be to use pull-up and pull-down resistors that are selectively electrically connectable to an input of an inverter. By connecting or disconnecting additional pull-up or pull-down resistors toward a positive supply or a negative supply (e.g., ground), respectively, an operational point (e.g., a voltage potential) at the input of the inverter may be adjusted, which may adjust the duty-cycle of an output of the inverter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">These approaches to trimming duty-cycles may be applicable to one time trimming (e.g., at manufacturing of an electronic device, at power-up of an electronic device), but may not be able to compensate duty-cycle error during operation (e.g., due to temperature change). Also, manipulations of switches in duty-cycle trimmers may destroy one of the clock cycles at an output of a duty-cycle trimmer if such switch manipulations are done over a running clock.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments a duty-cycle of a signal (e.g., a clock signal) may be tracked &#x201c;on the fly.&#x201d; In other words, the duty-cycle of the signal may be measured and regulated over the running clock signal during operation of an electronic device that is using the clock signal. By way of non-limiting example, the duty-cycle may be measured using an integrating resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. Assuming that a 50% duty-cycle is desired, an integrating RC circuit electrically connected to an output of a duty-cycle trimmer may charge to a voltage potential that is halfway between logic level voltage potentials (e.g., halfway between a logic level high voltage potential and a logic level low voltage potential). Circuitry may compare the output of the duty-cycle trimmer to a reference voltage potential (e.g., using a comparator or an operational amplifier, without limitation). By way of non-limiting example, the reference voltage potential may be generated using a simple resistive voltage divider circuit (e.g., to provide a reference voltage potential that is halfway between the logic level voltage potentials). An operational amplifier may derive an error signal, amplify the error signal, and feed the error signal back to an intermediate point between two inverters in order to correct for any duty-cycle distortion. As a result, the duty-cycle of a clock signal provided by the duty-cycle trimmer may be maintained close to 50% over variations of the power supply voltage potentials, the logic level voltage potentials, temperature, and transistor degradation over time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Many electronic devices, including some electronic devices that are sensitive to duty-cycle of clock signals, may sometimes operate in low-power modes and/or may shut down operation to preserve power. During low-power modes and/or shut down modes an input clock signal may be maintained at one logic level voltage potential rather than continue to oscillate between two logic level voltage potentials. As a result, an error signal provided by an integrating RC circuit may saturate to the logic level voltage potential that the input clock signal is held at. When the input clock signal is later activated, it may take many clock cycles before the error signal deviates from saturation at the logic level voltage potential that the input clock signal was held at during the low-power and/or shut down mode. As a result, the corrected clock signal provided by the duty-cycle trimmer may be distorted for many clock cycles, and some clock periods of the corrected clock signal may even disappear completely. By way of non-limiting example, it may take ten to twenty clock cycles before the error signal deviates sufficiently from a logic level voltage potential to enable the duty-cycle trimmer to operate correctly.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although data transitions in some electronic devices such as memory devices may not start with a first clocking edge after transition from a low-power or deactivated state, some no-operation (NOP) edges may be required for proper operation. In other words, for some electronic devices such as memory devices, if the clock signal output by the duty-cycle trimmer does not resolve within substantially one clock cycle of activation, problems in operation may result.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, at high frequency, rising and falling edges of a clock signal may not be linear, and an integrator that receives the clock signal may not be at exactly halfway between the logic level voltage potentials even if the duty-cycle is at the desired level. One way to deal with this issue may be to store a value indicating a voltage potential of an error signal at the integrator at a time of transition to a low-power mode or a deactivated mode. A voltage potential substantially at the stored value may be provided to the integrator when the clock signal is reactivated. Unfortunately, digitization (e.g., using an analog to digital converter) of the error signal and storage (e.g., using specialized registers) of the digitized value at deactivation may increase the complexity of the electronic device. Also, system parameters (e.g., power rail voltage potentials, temperature) may drift during down-time, which may render the stored value invalid for the parameters at reactivation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Disclosed herein are duty-cycle correctors that measure and regulate duty-cycles of clock signals during operation of electronic devices that use the clock signals. These duty-cycle correctors may use clock detectors to disable the duty-cycle correction responsive to detecting that input clock signals provided thereto are disabled. Accordingly, error signals indicating errors in duty-cycles of corrected clock signals provided by these duty-cycle correctors may not saturate while the input clock signals are disabled. As a result, the error signals may already be at appropriate levels at reactivation of the input clock signals, and the corrected clock signals may be regulated within a clock cycle or a few clock cycles of reactivation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments an apparatus includes an integrator circuit, an amplifier circuit, and an electrically controllable switch. The integrator circuit is configured to receive a corrected clock signal and a complementary corrected clock signal. The complementary corrected clock signal is complementary to the corrected clock signal. The integrator circuit is configured to provide an integrator signal indicating substantially an integral of the corrected clock signal. The integrator is also configured to provide a complementary integrator signal indicating substantially an integral of the complementary corrected clock signal. The amplifier circuit is configured to control corrections made to a duty-cycle of the corrected clock signal. The amplifier circuit is configured to be disabled responsive to a detection that an input clock signal is disabled. The amplifier circuit includes a first amplifier input terminal configured to receive the integrator signal. The amplifier also includes a second amplifier input terminal configured to receive the complementary integrator signal. The electrically controllable switch is configured to selectively electrically connect the first amplifier input terminal to the second amplifier input terminal responsive to the detection that the input clock signal is disabled.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments an apparatus includes a duty-cycle adjuster, an integrator circuit, an amplifier circuit, and a clock detector. The duty-cycle adjuster is configured to receive an input clock signal and correct a duty-cycle of a corrected clock signal relative to an input duty-cycle of the input clock signal. The integrator circuit is configured to generate an integrator signal responsive to the corrected clock signal. The integrator signal substantially indicates an integral of the corrected clock signal over time. The amplifier circuit is configured to control corrections made to the duty-cycle of the corrected clock signal by the duty-cycle adjuster responsive to the integrator signal.
