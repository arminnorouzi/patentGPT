the laboratory testing of any vehicle for which it is desirable for the vehicle to either steer itself, in the case of autonomous vehicles, or be steered during the testing, in the case of non-autonomous vehicles or autonomous vehicles with their autonomous features disabled. Vehicle types include autonomous vehicles, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), and semi-autonomous vehicles with some autonomous control features or functions. Depending the on the vehicle powertrain type, it may relate to automotive exhaust gas emissions measurement and analysis (internal combustion engine vehicles), the measurement of the fuel economy or energy efficiency of automobiles, and the control or evaluation of autonomous control systems for automobiles. More specifically, it relates to testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles without disengaging automated or emergency steering functions, the effectiveness or performance of autonomous vehicle systems and functions, the impacts of autonomous features or steering a non-autonomous vehicle, on the fuel economy, energy efficiency, or emissions performance of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chassis roll dynamometers for applying loads to complete vehicles during laboratory testing have been available for decades and powertrain dynamometers for applying loads to individual drive wheels, axles, or hubs are also available. Such dynamometers have not traditionally allowed the vehicle to be steered, or self-steered, in the case of a non-autonomous or autonomous vehicle, respectively.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the growing popularity of vehicles with autonomous features that involve either automated steering of the vehicle itself, or automated control of the powertrain based, at least in part, on the steering angle input by the driver of the vehicle, it is becoming increasingly important to allow a vehicle to be steered either manually or automatically during laboratory-based dynamometer testing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous designs for allowing vehicle steering during chassis dynamometer testing are being investigated by various dynamometer suppliers. The designs tend to be very complex and expensive, however, and cannot be retrofitted to existing dynamometers. There exists a need for a low-cost apparatus and method for enabling vehicle steering on existing chassis and powertrain dynamometer designs, as well as for retrofitting to existing dynamometers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, certain embodiments may relate to conducting laboratory testing of vehicles in which vehicle steering angle is an input to a vehicle control system, for example a vehicle with longitudinal speed control that uses steering angle to determine whether or not another vehicle or object is in the path of the vehicle. Other embodiments may relate to testing of vehicles in which steering angle is an output to a vehicle control system, for example an autonomous vehicle with automatic lane changing capabilities, Lane Keep Assist (LKA) functionality, or automated steering for emergency obstacle avoidance. The exemplary embodiments herein show apparatuses and methods that allow the emissions and energy efficiency impacts, and the performance of automatic or emergency steering actions of autonomous control vehicle functions to be accurately determined. When used in conjunction with simulating or replicating real-world traffic events in a controlled environment, emissions, energy efficiency, system, and safety system performance can be calibrated, evaluated, and improved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, and <b>1</b>E</figref> show, respectively, front, side, bottom, top, and top views of an apparatus for enabling dynamic vehicle steering in conjunction with a conventional vehicle powertrain or axle shaft dynamometer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> show, respectively, front, side, and top views of a variation of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref> comprising an alternative means for enabling dynamic vehicle steering in conjunction with a conventional vehicle powertrain or axle shaft dynamometer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D</figref> show, respectively, front, side, top, and side views of another variation of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref> comprising another alternative means for enabling dynamic vehicle steering in conjunction with a conventional vehicle powertrain or axle shaft dynamometer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref>, show, respectively, front, side, and top views of an apparatus for enabling dynamic vehicle steering in conjunction with a conventional chassis dynamometer with fixed rolls.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show, respectively, top and side views of an apparatus that uses an electronic link to synchronize driven and non-driven wheel hub speeds.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a top view of an apparatus that uses a mechanical link to synchronize driven and non-driven wheel hub speeds.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments are described herein. It is to be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely examples and other embodiments may take various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale. Some features could be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various features illustrated and described with reference to any one of the figures may be combined with features illustrated in one or more other figures to produce embodiments that are not explicitly illustrated or described. The combinations of features illustrated provide representative embodiments for typical applications. Various combinations and modifications of the features consistent with the teachings of this disclosure, however, could be desired for particular applications or implementations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain embodiments allow a vehicle to be steered by a driver, or in the case of an automated vehicle, self-steered by an autonomous control system of the vehicle while a dynamometer applies a load to the vehicle during a laboratory test of the vehicle. The test may be for purposes of verifying performance or functionality of autonomous control systems or algorithms, for measuring the exhaust emissions or energy efficiency of the vehicle under autonomous driving control, or for any other purpose for which it is necessary or advantageous for the steering angle of the vehicle to be changed, or allowed to change, during the test.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A first embodiment is the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref> for use with a powertrain dynamometer <b>11</b>. Prior to testing with one or more powertrain dynamometers <b>11</b> for placing a desired load on each driven axle shaft, each of the driven wheels (not shown) of a vehicle <b>1</b> is removed and replaced with a special automobile free-wheeling bearing wheel <b>6</b>. The bearing wheel <b>6</b> comprises a rim <b>60</b>, hub bearings <b>53</b>, retractable floor bearings <b>9</b>, rim passages <b>55</b> for the floor bearings <b>9</b> to pass through, tire passages <b>12</b> for the floor bearings <b>9</b> to pass through, floor bearing retraction rods <b>57</b>, and a non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b>. The hub bearings <b>53</b> mate with the vehicle <b>1</b> driven hub (obscured by the brake disc <b>19</b> in the figures) on the inside of the bearing wheel <b>6</b>, allowing the driven hub to rotate with the free-wheeling hub bearings <b>53</b>, independently of the wheel or non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b>. The brake caliper <b>21</b> is also shown for reference.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The floor bearings <b>9</b> of each bearing wheel <b>6</b> are retracted through the rim <b>60</b> prior to the vehicle <b>1</b> being moved or rolled into position for testing. The retraction of the floor bearings <b>9</b> is accomplished by adjusting the floor bearing retraction rods <b>57</b>, accessible near the bearing wheel <b>6</b> hub, to move the floor bearings <b>9</b> beneath the outer surface of the non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b>, through the tire passages <b>12</b> and wheel passages <b>55</b>. With the floor bearings <b>9</b> retracted neatly into the bearing wheel <b>6</b>, i.e. inside the rim <b>60</b> and recessed below the outer surface of the non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b>, the vehicle can be pushed or rolled into the desired position for testing whereby the rims <b>60</b> rotate independently from the vehicle wheel hubs and other vehicle powertrain components.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">After the vehicle <b>1</b> is placed into position for testing, each of the rims <b>60</b> is rotated until the floor bearings <b>9</b> are in close proximity to, and approximately centered with respect to the laboratory floor <b>2</b>. By adjusting the retraction rods <b>57</b> associated with each bearing <b>9</b>, the floor bearings <b>9</b> are then extended radially outward through the rim passages <b>55</b>, to be outside the rim <b>60</b> and protruding out from the surface of the non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b> through tire passages <b>12</b> aligned or in registration with the rim passages <b>55</b>, until normal vehicle height with respect to the laboratory floor <b>2</b> is achieved, thereby raising the non-pneumatic tire <b>59</b> off of the laboratory floor <b>2</b> so the bearing wheels <b>6</b> only contact the laboratory floor <b>2</b> via the floor bearings <b>9</b>. In this way, each rim <b>60</b> is free to steer with respect to the laboratory floor <b>2</b> or test cell bedplate, with little friction against the floor <b>2</b> or bedplate surface. The combination of the two floor bearings <b>9</b> also provides a stable platform for each rim <b>60</b> that prevents the rim <b>60</b> from rotating with the wheel hub during testing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref>, a telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> comprises variable angle joints, e.g. Constant Velocity joints or universal joints, on opposite ends thereof, a sliding connection to a drive shaft, e.g. using splines, configured to be mounted out-board of an automobile wheel or a free-wheeling automobile wheel. The telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> may also comprise a variable length linkage, e.g. a spring, or actuator having a fixable end, and a movable portion including a mount configured to be attached to the telescoping drive shaft and permit the telescoping drive shaft to rotate therein, wherein the variable length linkage is configured to apply a translational force to the telescoping drive shaft to establish a predetermined angle, in the absence of other steering forces, between a longitudinal axis of the telescoping drive shaft and a central axis of one of the variable angle joints.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref> is a telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> comprising an internally-splined drive shaft <b>27</b>, an inner Constant Velocity Joint (CVJ) <b>23</b> with inner CVJ external splines <b>29</b>, an inner hub flange adapter <b>31</b>, an outer CVJ <b>25</b> with outer CVJ external splines <b>30</b>, and an outer shaft adapter <b>33</b>. The inner CVJ external splines <b>29</b> mate with the internal splines (not shown) on inner end of the internally-splined dynamometer drive shaft <b>27</b>, thereby providing a sliding fit. The outer CVJ external splines <b>30</b> mate with the internal splines (not shown) on the outer end of the internally-splined dynamometer drive shaft <b>27</b>, thereby providing an additional sliding fit. The sliding fits of the two sets of splines effectively create a variable length or telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> that automatically compensates for dynamic changes in distance between the connection point at the vehicle hub end and the dynamometer as steering angle changes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The outside of the bearing wheel <b>6</b> is mated to the inner CVJ <b>23</b> or universal joint via the inner hub flange adapter <b>31</b>. The outer CVJ <b>25</b> mates with a dynamometer shaft flange <b>35</b> via a shaft adapter <b>33</b>, thereby driving the dynamometer shaft <b>37</b>, or being driven by the dynamometer shaft <b>37</b>, depending upon the operating modes of the vehicle <b>1</b> and the dynamometer <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By installing bearing wheels <b>6</b> on the vehicle <b>1</b>, connecting the bearing wheel assemblies to the dynamometers <b>11</b> as described above, and securing the vehicle <b>1</b> according to normal practices, the vehicle <b>1</b> is prepared for dynamometer testing whereby the dynamometers <b>11</b> place a load on the vehicle powertrain through the bearing wheels <b>6</b> without causing rolling rotation of the bearing wheels <b>6</b> themselves. The vehicle can be easily steered with little friction against the surface of the floor <b>2</b> due to the action of the floor bearings <b>9</b>. Additionally, the combination of inner CVJ <b>23</b>, outer CVJ <b>25</b>, splined shafts <b>29</b> that slide within the drive shaft <b>27</b> allow for a sliding connection to the dynamometer to adjust for changes in the needed shaft length corresponding to the hub <b>19</b> steering angle. The top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E</figref> show the geometry of the dynamometer shaft <b>27</b> for straight steering vs. a right turn in which there is a rotation of the vehicle <b>1</b> hub about a ball joint <b>15</b> due to the action of the steering system tie rod <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A vehicle traveling on a road experiences a steering centering force that causes the steering angle to return to zero when no external force is applied by the driver or by an automated steering system. To simulate this centering force during laboratory testing, an external actuator <b>39</b> is connected to a laboratory bed plate or floor <b>2</b> at one end, and a fixed driveshaft bearing mount <b>47</b> by an actuator rod <b>43</b> and rod joint <b>45</b>, at the other end as shown. The external actuator <b>39</b> then applies a centering force to the dynamometer driveshaft <b>27</b>, biasing the driveshaft <b>27</b> to remain centered, or in a straight line with respect to the inner CVJ <b>23</b> and vehicle wheel hub. The force exerted by the external actuator <b>39</b> can be constant, or can be made dependent upon steering angle, depending on testing needs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A second embodiment is the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>C</figref>. It does not require vehicle drive wheels <b>67</b> to be removed or replaced with specialized wheels. To allow the drive wheels <b>67</b> to spin and the steering angle to change, a turntable assembly <b>61</b> employing a pair of rotatable rolls <b>63</b> is placed under each vehicle drive wheel <b>67</b>. An inner CVJ <b>223</b> is attached to the vehicle wheel hub using extended lugs passing through the hub adapter <b>231</b>. Otherwise, the apparatus is the same as the first apparatus described above. Wheel spinning is accommodated by the rolls <b>63</b>, which are free to spin, and dynamic steering angle is accommodated by a rotatable table <b>73</b> of the turntable assembly <b>61</b>. Spring attachments <b>69</b> non-rigidly secure the rotatable table <b>73</b> to a turntable frame <b>71</b>, allowing a turntable roll assembly <b>73</b> comprising the rotatable rolls <b>63</b> to move in a plane in response to movements of the mating drive wheel <b>67</b> as steering angle changes, i.e. for accommodating for changes in the steering angle, while also compensating for any offsets in drive wheel <b>67</b> position caused by an axis of steering rotation offset from the center of the drive wheel <b>67</b> itself. Compression or extension of the spring attachments <b>69</b> or similar mechanism creates a steering centering force to return the roll assembly <b>73</b> to be in line with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle <b>1</b> whenever no steering forces are applied by a driver or autonomous vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A third embodiment is the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>D</figref>. It requires the vehicle drive wheels to be removed and replaced with specialized free-wheel hub wheel assemblies <b>167</b> comprising a wheel <b>60</b>, a tire <b>159</b>, and a hub bearing <b>153</b> with an inner bearing race <b>162</b>. The hub bearing <b>153</b> isolates spinning of the inner bearing race <b>162</b> from the wheel <b>160</b> and tire <b>159</b>, i.e. when attached to the vehicle driven hub via the hub adapter <b>31</b>, it allows the vehicle driven hub to spin with a connected powertrain dynamometer <b>11</b> without causing any spinning of the wheel <b>160</b> itself. A turntable assembly <b>381</b> comprising a wheel chock assembly <b>392</b>, itself comprising a pair of fixed, non-rotating wheel chocks <b>383</b> placed under each tire <b>159</b> so the wheel chocks <b>383</b> cradle the tire and support the weight of the vehicle <b>1</b>. Steering angle changes under manual or automated driving conditions are accommodated by a rotatable table <b>393</b> supporting the chock assembly <b>392</b>. Spring attachments <b>389</b> non-rigidly secure the rotatable table <b>393</b> to a turntable frame <b>391</b>, allowing the chock assembly <b>392</b> to move in a plane in response to movements of the cradled tire <b>159</b> as the steering angle changes, i.e. for accommodating any changes in the steering angle, and dynamic offsets in the free-wheel hub wheel assembly position caused by an axis of steering rotation displaced from the lowest contact point of the wheel assembly <b>167</b> itself. Compression or extension of the spring attachments <b>389</b> or similar mechanism creates a steering centering force to return the rotatable table <b>393</b> back to its original position, and thereby return the wheel chocks <b>383</b> and cradled tire <b>159</b> back in line with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle <b>1</b> whenever no steering forces are applied by a driver or autonomous vehicle system. The inner CVJ <b>23</b> is attached to the wheel assembly <b>167</b> by the hub adapter <b>31</b>. Otherwise, the apparatus and its function is the same as the apparatuses described above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A fourth embodiment is the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>C</figref>, which is for use with a chassis roll dynamometer <b>62</b>. Prior to testing a vehicle <b>1</b> in conjunction with a chassis roll dynamometer <b>62</b> that applies a load to the vehicle powertrain via the drive wheels, the vehicle <b>1</b> is placed on the chassis dynamometer <b>62</b>, in the normal manner, and supported by a jacking device or a set of jacks <b>80</b>, strategically placed to avoid contact with the dynamometer rolls <b>64</b>. Each of the driven wheels (not shown) of the vehicle <b>1</b> is then removed. A deep well dedicated wheel <b>66</b> with mounted tire <b>78</b> is mated with a wheel mounting arm bracket <b>74</b> bearing flange <b>72</b> via the outer shaft adapter <b>33</b>. The tire <b>78</b> is placed in rolling contact with the dynamometer rolls <b>64</b> and the bracket mounting arm <b>68</b> is adjusted to maintain a downward force on the deep well wheel <b>66</b> equal to the weight that is normally supported by the original vehicle wheel. The downward force is maintained by the strut <b>70</b>, while the strut <b>70</b> also allows for some vertical movement between the bracket <b>74</b> and the mounting arm <b>68</b> to compensate for small changes in tire <b>78</b> diameter due to changes in tire <b>78</b> pressure and speed, as well as imperfections in the geometries of the rolls <b>64</b> and wheel <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The inner CVJ <b>23</b> also mates to the vehicle <b>1</b> wheel hub (not shown) located inside the brake disc <b>19</b> or brake drum, via the shaft flange adapter <b>31</b>, thereby connecting the dynamometer rolls <b>64</b> to the vehicle <b>1</b> powertrain via the tire <b>78</b>. By installing a deep well wheel <b>66</b> between each of the vehicle <b>1</b> driven hubs or axles and the dynamometer rolls <b>64</b> as described above, the vehicle <b>1</b> is prepared for chassis roll dynamometer testing whereby the chassis roll dynamometer <b>62</b> places a load on the vehicle powertrain through the deep well wheels. The vehicle <b>1</b> can be easily steered or self-steered without causing rotation of the tire <b>78</b> on the dynamometer rolls <b>64</b>. As the vehicle hubs rotate with changes in steering angle, the rotational motion of the hubs is arrested by the geometric change and overall length change of the driveshaft assembly comprising the inner CVJ <b>23</b>, outer CVJ <b>25</b>, and sliding splined shafts <b>29</b>, and not transmitted to the deep well wheel <b>66</b> or tire <b>78</b>. The top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> shows the geometry of the dynamometer drive shaft <b>27</b> for steering during a right turn in which there is a rotation of the vehicle hub and mated brake disc <b>19</b> about the ball joint <b>15</b> on control arm <b>17</b> due to the action of the steering system tie rod <b>14</b>. The steering angle change is not transmitted to the deep well wheel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, a vehicle traveling on a road experiences a steering centering force that causes the steering angle to return to zero when no external force is applied by the driver or by an automated steering system. Once again, to simulate this centering force during laboratory testing, an external actuator <b>39</b> is used. The actuator <b>39</b> is connected to a laboratory bed plate or floor <b>2</b> at one end by the actuator bracket <b>41</b>, and a drive shaft bearing mount <b>47</b> by an actuator rod <b>43</b> and rod joint <b>45</b>, at the other end as shown. The external actuator then applies a centering force to the dynamometer drive shaft <b>27</b>, biasing the drive shaft <b>27</b> to remain centered, or in a straight line with respect to the inner CVJ <b>23</b> and vehicle wheel hub. The force exerted by the external actuator <b>39</b> can be constant, or can be dependent upon steering angle, depending on testing needs.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show a simplified and lower cost embodiment compared with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A</figref> though <b>1</b>E. It is for testing autonomous vehicle control systems when it is not necessary to place an external load on the vehicle's powertrain, but when it is necessary for all of the vehicle wheels to be spinning in a manner acceptable to the vehicle's control system, e.g. to avoid the detection of a malfunction by having one or more unacceptable wheel speeds.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The vehicle <b>1</b> is placed on a jack or jack stands <b>4</b> on the test cell floor <b>2</b> or bedplate to support the vehicle's weight, all of the wheels are then removed, exposing the brake disks <b>19</b> (or brake drums) fitted over each of the vehicle wheel hubs (not shown). A telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> is mounted outboard of each wheel hub by attaching an inner hub flange adapter <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref>) to the vehicle hub, through the brake disk <b>19</b>. An external actuator <b>39</b>, a spring return actuator <b>22</b>, or both, is attached to the drive shaft <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>E</figref>) on one end using bearing mount <b>47</b>, for each telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> mounted to a steerable wheel hub. The other end is attached to the laboratory floor <b>2</b> or test cell bed plate as described above. Non-steerable wheel hubs do not require an external actuator <b>39</b> or spring return actuator <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The outer end of each telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> attached to a driven wheel hub is attached to a master motor <b>18</b> with an encoder (or just an encoder) to measure the speed of each of the driven wheels. An electronic link, e.g. a speed control signal is generated by the master motor <b>18</b> to control the speed of a corresponding slave motor <b>20</b> to synchronize the rotational speeds of the connected wheel hubs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The outer end of each telescoping driveshaft <b>13</b> attached to a non-driven wheel hub is attached to a slave motor <b>20</b> that controls and synchronizes the speed of the corresponding non-driven wheel hub to equal the speed of its corresponding driven wheel hub. In this way, generation of vehicle fault codes due to unacceptable wheel speeds is prevented during stationary vehicle testing.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the vehicle's autonomous control systems are being tested, including those causing dynamic changes in steering angle, the vehicle steering system <b>24</b> is free to move under control of the vehicle's autonomous control system while the rotational speeds of the driven wheel hubs are controlled by the vehicle's autonomous control system.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An alternative embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. This embodiment uses a mechanical link, rather than an electronic link to synchronize the speeds of the driven and non-driven wheel hubs. For example, a belt <b>26</b> or chain connects the front and rear outer CV joint mounting flanges together on the left and right sides of the vehicle <b>1</b> as shown, rather than using master and slave motors as described in the previous embodiment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The algorithms, methods, or processes disclosed herein can be deliverable to or implemented by a computer, controller, or processing device, which can include any dedicated electronic control unit or programmable electronic control unit.
