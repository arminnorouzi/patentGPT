Specifically, when an unintended overcurrent flows in an electric circuit, a fusion part of a fuse element built in the fuse is fused by heat generated due to the overcurrent, which protects various electric components from having excessive current flowing through them.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Then, the fuse has various types according to the application, and for example, a fuse described in Patent Literature 1 for protecting from a relatively large overcurrent is known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The fuse described in Patent Literature 1 is of a type in which a fuse element is housed inside a tubular casing, and includes a pair of terminal portions and a fuse element including a fusion part provided between the terminal portions. In addition, when the capacity of the fuse is increased, it is necessary to increase the size of the casing so that a plurality of fusion parts are connected in parallel between the terminal portions and the plurality of fusion parts arranged in parallel can be housed. Since this casing has a tubular shape, it is necessary to increase the diameter in order to house the plurality of fusion parts. However, although a space for enclosing an arc-extinguishing material for extinguishing the arc generated from the fusion part is required inside the casing, in the casing having a large diameter, there is an extra space more than a space required for enclosing the arc-extinguishing material, leading to waste of space.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATIONS LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2018-26202</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the present application invention provides a fuse capable of saving space inside a casing even when the casing includes a plurality of fusion parts arranged side by side.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the above problems, a fuse of the present application invention includes: a fuse element including a fusion part provided between a pair of terminal portions; and a casing configured to house a part of the fuse element while causing the terminal portions to protrude outward. Two or more of the fusion parts are arranged in a lateral direction orthogonal to a terminal portion direction connecting the terminal portions and connected to the terminal portions. The casing includes two casing split pieces configured to house the fuse element so as to sandwich the fuse element. The respective casing split pieces are fixed to each other by a frame-shaped fixing member configured to make one round of a periphery of the respective casing split pieces. A housing space of the casing has a maximum width in the vertical direction narrower than a maximum width in the lateral direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the above characteristics, since the maximum width in the vertical direction of the housing space is narrower than the maximum width in the lateral direction, the space in the vertical direction of the housing space of the casing can be made smaller than that in the conventional case, and an extra space can be omitted. In addition, the casing split pieces are fixed to each other by the frame-shaped fixing member that makes one round of the periphery of the respective casing split pieces, so that it is possible to strongly withstand the gas pressure from the inside to the outside of the casing split pieces, and the casing is prevented from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in the fuse of the present application invention, the frame-shaped fixing member fixes the respective casing split pieces to each other so as to surround the terminal portions from the terminal portion direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the above characteristics, in the casing portion through which the terminal portions of the fuse element penetrates, the fixing force between the casings is prevented from weakening, and the casing is prevented from being damaged by the gas pressure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, in the fuse of the present application invention, the frame-shaped fixing member has a maximum width in the lateral direction larger than a maximum width in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the above characteristics, since the frame-shaped fixing member has a structure extending in the lateral direction, it is possible to surround and fix a wider range along the lateral direction in a portion (for example, the bottom wall) of the casing to which the gas pressure is strongly applied, whereby the casing is more effectively prevented from being damaged by the gas pressure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, in the fuse of the present application invention, the frame-shaped fixing member has an elliptical shape and has a shape corresponding to a portion of a periphery of respective casing split pieces configured to fix the frame-shaped fixing member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the above characteristics, since a gap is less likely to be generated between a part of the periphery of the casing split pieces and the frame-shaped fixing member, a portion where a fixing force to the casing split pieces by the frame-shaped fixing member is locally weakened is less likely to be generated. As a result, this prevents the casing from being damaged by the gas pressure more effectively.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, in the fuse of the present application invention, the terminal portions and the fusion part are integrally formed of an identical material.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above characteristics, the fuse element can be easily manufactured, and the fusion part and the terminal portions can be reliably electrically connected.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, in the fuse of the present application invention, the fusion part has a smaller plate thickness than another portion of the fuse element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above characteristics, it is easy to form the fusion part and to machine the peripheral member.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, according to the fuse of the present application invention, it is possible to save the space inside the casing even when the casing includes a plurality of fusion parts arranged side by side.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferred and alternative examples of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the following drawings.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is a plan view of a fuse element of a fuse according to a first embodiment of the present application invention in a state of being developed, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a plan view of the fuse element in a state of being formed by bending.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an overall perspective view of the fuse element formed by bending, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a side view of the fuse element formed by bending.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an overall perspective view of a casing split piece, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a side view of the casing split piece, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the casing split piece taken along line A-A.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an overall perspective view showing each member constituting the fuse in an exploded manner, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is an overall perspective view showing a state in which a frame-shaped fixing member is to be attached.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an overall perspective view of a completed fuse, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a side view of the fuse.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line B-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is a side view of a fuse according to a second embodiment of the present application invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a side view of a fuse according to a third embodiment of the present application invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><b>100</b> Fuse element</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><b>110</b> Terminal portion</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><b>120</b> Fusion part</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><b>200</b> Casing split piece</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><b>290</b> Casing</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><b>300</b> Frame-shaped fixing member</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">N<b>1</b> Housing space</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">X Lateral direction</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Y Terminal portion direction</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Z Vertical direction</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Maximum width L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b></p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present application invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

In one metal plate shaped into a predetermined shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, terminal portions <b>110</b> at both ends, a flat intermediate portion <b>130</b> between the terminal portions <b>110</b>, and a plurality of fusion parts <b>120</b> in the intermediate portion <b>130</b> are formed. More specifically, the fusion part <b>120</b> includes a plurality of linear fusion places <b>120</b><i>a </i>having a locally narrow width by providing small holes in the intermediate portion <b>130</b>, and each of the fusion places <b>120</b><i>a </i>generates heat and is fused to cut off an overcurrent when an unintended overcurrent flows through an electric circuit or the like. It should be noted that the fusion part <b>120</b> is not limited to including the linear fusion places <b>120</b><i>a </i>having a narrow width, and as long as the fusion part <b>120</b> can generate heat and be fused to cut off an overcurrent when an unintended overcurrent flows through the electric circuit or the like, the fusion part <b>120</b> can adopt any configuration such as locally disposing a metal material to be easily fused in the intermediate portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the vicinity of the connecting place between the intermediate portion <b>130</b> and each of the terminal portions <b>110</b> is bent upward at a folding line L<b>1</b>. Then, the intermediate portion <b>130</b> comes into a state of being connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b> so as to slightly swell upward from the terminal portions <b>110</b>. The folding line L<b>1</b> is parallel to a direction orthogonal to the terminal portion direction Y. Furthermore, in the folding line K<b>1</b> parallel to the terminal portion direction Y of the fuse element <b>100</b>, the side-by-side terminal portions <b>110</b> are bent so as to vertically overlap each other. It should be noted that the terminal portion direction Y of the fuse element <b>100</b> is a direction parallel to an axis connecting the terminal portions <b>110</b> on both sides. Therefore, the folding line K<b>1</b> is also parallel to the axis connecting the terminal portions <b>110</b> on both sides.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, the three-dimensionally bent fuse element <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> and <b>2</b> is completed. The fuse element <b>100</b> is in a state where two intermediate portions <b>130</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X and connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b>. That is, since the two fusion parts <b>120</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X and connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b>, the capacity of the fusion part increases in the entire fuse. Then, since the fusion parts <b>120</b> of the intermediate portions <b>130</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X, the width H<b>2</b> in the lateral direction X is larger than the height H<b>1</b> in the vertical direction Z on the terminal portions <b>110</b> side of the fuse element <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. It should be noted that the lateral direction X is a direction orthogonal to the terminal portion direction Y. In addition, the terminal portions <b>110</b> extend along a plane defined by the lateral direction X and the terminal portion direction Y, that is, an X-Y plane. In addition, the vertical direction Z is a direction orthogonal to each of the lateral direction X and the terminal portion direction Y.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the intermediate portions <b>130</b> facing each other in the vertical direction Z are configured to bulge outward with the terminal portion <b>110</b> interposed therebetween. Since the intermediate portions <b>130</b> are bent along the folding line L<b>1</b> in directions separated from each other, the fusion parts <b>120</b> of the upper and lower intermediate portions <b>130</b> are less likely thermally affected by each other, and can exhibit desired fusion characteristics. It should be noted that in the fuse element <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the two intermediate portions <b>130</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X and connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b>, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and three or more intermediate portions <b>130</b> may be arranged in the lateral direction X and connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b>. It should be noted that when three or more fusion parts <b>120</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X and connected to the terminal portions <b>110</b>, the fuse element <b>100</b> has the width H<b>2</b> in the lateral direction X still larger than the height H<b>1</b> in the vertical direction Z.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, since the fusion parts <b>120</b> and the terminal portions <b>110</b> of the fuse element <b>100</b> are integrally formed of the same material, the fuse element <b>100</b> can be easily manufactured, and the fusion parts <b>120</b> and the terminal portions <b>110</b> can be reliably electrically connected. It should be noted that although the fusion parts <b>120</b> and the terminal portions <b>110</b> of the fuse element <b>100</b> are integrally formed of the same material, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the intermediate portions <b>130</b> including the fusion parts <b>120</b>, and the terminal portions <b>110</b> may be manufactured separately and connected to each other by welding or the like. Furthermore, the fuse element <b>100</b> is formed by punching a flat plate material made of a conductive metal, such as copper or an alloy thereof, into a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> with a pressing machine or the like, and this plate material is one plate material in which only the plate thickness of the intermediate portions <b>130</b> including the fusion parts <b>120</b> is smaller, and the plate thickness of the terminal portions <b>110</b> is larger, that is, one plate material (deformed material) in which the thickness is not uniform, and only the plate thickness of the portions constituting the fusion parts <b>120</b> is smaller than the plate thickness of the other portions (such as the terminal portion <b>110</b>). Therefore, it is not necessary to separately prepare the fusion part <b>120</b> made of a plate material having a smaller plate thickness and the terminal portion <b>110</b> made of a plate material having a larger plate thickness and weld them to each other, so that the fuse element <b>100</b> can be easily manufactured.

The housing space N<b>1</b> is configured by connecting the openings <b>250</b> of the upper and lower casing split pieces <b>200</b> so as to face each other. In addition, since the casing <b>290</b> has a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape, the housing space N<b>1</b> also has a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Here, a maximum width L<b>2</b> of the casing <b>290</b> in the lateral direction X needs to be increased by that amount as the number of the fusion parts <b>120</b> to be arranged is increased so that a plurality of fusion parts <b>120</b> can be arranged in the lateral direction X and housed. Therefore, when the casing has a tubular shape as in the conventional case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the fusion parts <b>120</b> are housed in a tubular casing <b>290</b>&#x2032; having the maximum width L<b>2</b> in diameter. However, although an arc-extinguishing material (not shown) for extinguishing an arc is enclosed in the housing space N<b>1</b>&#x2032; of the casing <b>290</b>&#x2032;, the housing space N<b>1</b>&#x2032; present in the vertical direction Z of the fusion parts <b>120</b> is larger than necessary, and in particular, there is an extra space more than the space necessary for enclosing the arc-extinguishing material, leading to waste of space.

Therefore, in order to further simplify the assembling work, the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention adopts a simple and workable configuration in which the fuse element <b>100</b> is sandwiched and housed in the vertical direction Z by the casing split pieces <b>200</b>. On the other hand, in the fuse element <b>100</b> of the present application invention, since two or more fusion parts <b>120</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X, the pressure P of the gas generated when the fusion part <b>120</b> is fused due to overcurrent tends to be increased by that amount of the increased number of the fusion parts <b>120</b>. Then, the respective casing split pieces <b>200</b> vertically assembled are pushed out in a direction of being separated from each other by the gas pressure P and detached, and the casing <b>290</b> may be damaged. Therefore, in the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention, the upper and lower casing split pieces <b>200</b> are fixed to each other by the frame-shaped fixing members <b>300</b> each of which make one round of the periphery of the respective casing split pieces <b>200</b>, so that it is possible to strongly withstand the gas pressure P from the inside to the outside of the casing split pieces <b>200</b>, and the casing <b>290</b> is prevented from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, in the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, since the respective casing split pieces <b>200</b> are fixed to each other so as to surround the terminal portions <b>110</b> from the terminal portion direction Y by the frame-shaped fixing members <b>300</b>, the casing <b>290</b> is more effectively prevented from being damaged. Specifically, in order to connect the fuse <b>400</b> to an electric circuit or the like, each of the terminal portions <b>110</b> needs to protrude from the side of the casing <b>290</b>. Then, since the terminal portion <b>110</b> is interposed in the portion (see, for example, the placement surface <b>224</b> of the casing split piece <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.) through which the terminal portion <b>110</b> penetrates, the upper and lower casing split pieces <b>200</b> cannot be directly assembled to each other, and the fixing force of the portion through which the terminal portion <b>110</b> penetrates tends to be locally weak. Therefore, in the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the respective casing split pieces <b>200</b> are fixed to each other so as to surround the terminal portion <b>110</b> from the terminal portion direction Y by the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b>, which prevents the fixing force of the portion through which the terminal portion <b>110</b> penetrates from being weakened and prevents the casing <b>290</b> from being damaged by the gas pressure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, in the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a maximum width L<b>3</b> in the lateral direction X of the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> is larger than a maximum width L<b>4</b> in the vertical direction Z. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in the fuse element <b>100</b> of the present application invention, since two or more fusion parts <b>120</b> are arranged in the lateral direction X, the pressure P of the gas generated when the fusion part <b>120</b> is fused due to overcurrent tends to be increased by that amount of the increased number of the fusion parts <b>120</b>, and in particular, the gas pressure P in the vertical direction Z increases and is strongly applied to the bottom wall <b>210</b> of the casing <b>290</b> facing the plurality of fusion parts <b>120</b>. Therefore, making the maximum width L<b>3</b> in the lateral direction X of the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> larger than the maximum width L<b>4</b> in the vertical direction Z causes the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> to have a structure extending in the lateral direction X, that is, a horizontally long structure. Then, since the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> has a structure extending in the lateral direction X, it is possible to surround and fix a wider range along the lateral direction X in a portion (for example, the bottom wall <b>210</b>) of the casing <b>290</b> to which the gas pressure P is strongly applied. This prevents the casing <b>290</b> from being damaged by the gas pressure P more effectively.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, in the fuse <b>400</b> of the present application invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, in a side view, the maximum width L<b>3</b> of the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> in the lateral direction X is larger than the maximum width L<b>4</b> in the vertical direction Z, and the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> has an elliptical shape. Then, a part of the periphery of the casing split piece <b>200</b> (for example, outer surface <b>222</b>) fixing the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> and the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> have corresponding shapes so as to match with each other. Thus, the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> can be easily attached to a part (outer surface <b>222</b>) of the casing split piece <b>200</b>, and the fuse <b>400</b> can be easily assembled. In addition, since the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> has an elliptical shape and a gap is less likely to be generated between the frame-shaped fixing member and a part (outer surface <b>222</b>) of the casing split piece <b>200</b>, a portion where a fixing force to the casing split piece <b>200</b> by the frame-shaped fixing member <b>300</b> is locally weakened is less likely to be generated.
