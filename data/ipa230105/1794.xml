Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for operating a vehicle which has an electric drivetrain as an alternative to or else in addition to an internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In an electric drivetrain of an electrically driven vehicle, preferably AC motors having three or more phases are used which have a good degree of efficiency and, in contrast to DC motors, manage without any wear-susceptible brushes. Electrical energy sources which can be carried along in the vehicle, such as, for example, batteries or fuel cells, generally produce a DC voltage, however. In order to convert this DC voltage into an AC voltage having three or more phases, voltage converters, such as, for example, inverters, are used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this case, the voltage converter is generally fed from a high-voltage vehicle power supply system which conducts a DC voltage of several hundred volts. This high-voltage vehicle power supply system is typically isolated from the DC-voltage source when the vehicle is parked. This ensures that the high voltage poses no risk while the vehicle is unattended. At the same time, it avoids a situation whereby, for example, a battery discharges gradually owing to a power loss which is continuously incident in the inverter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 10 2014 200 262 A1 discloses a battery system whose high-voltage battery is connected via at least one contactor and can be isolated from the high-voltage vehicle power supply system by means of this contactor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Within the scope of the invention, a method for operating a vehicle having an electric drivetrain has been developed. The drivetrain can drive the vehicle on its own or else, in the case of a hybrid vehicle, in combination with an internal combustion engine. The electric drivetrain is fed via a DC-voltage source and a converter for converting the DC voltage into a single-phase or polyphase AC voltage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method begins with the establishment of whether the vehicle is parked. &#x201c;Parked&#x201d; is in this case in particular understood to mean a state in which the vehicle is protected from rolling away in the sense of the traffic code so that the driver can leave his driver's seat without any risk being posed. The establishment of the fact that the vehicle is parked can be taken from any desired source. For example, the activated position of a parking brake, the switch position of a switch operable by the driver for the drivetrain or else the presence of an access medium (for example key) in a receptacle provided for this purpose can be monitored. The relationship between the presence of a key and protection from rolling away can be enforced, for example, via a lock which only enables withdrawal of the key when the protection from rolling away has been performed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Using at least one preset criterion, a check is performed to ascertain whether the vehicle is likely to be parked for only a short time or not. In this case, the precise criterion may be specific to the respective vehicle. Essential to the progress of the method is merely the fact that a decision is made as to whether the vehicle is likely to be parked for only a short time or not.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In response to the fact that the vehicle is likely to be parked for only a short time, the vehicle is shifted into a blocking state. In this blocking state, the vehicle is protected from unauthorized use. This means that the vehicle can only be driven from its own drive by persons authorized to do so. The blocking can take place, for example, by means of software by virtue of, for example, activation of the drive for driving being suppressed. The blocking can also take place, for example, by means of hardware, however, by virtue of, for example, the steering, a transmission or a parking brake being blocked. In the blocking state, the converter continues to be supplied the DC voltage from the DC-voltage source.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In response to the fact that the vehicle is likely not to be parked for only a short time, at least one function check is performed on the electric drivetrain which is intended to ramp down the electric drivetrain. Once this function check has concluded, the vehicle is shifted to a switched-off state, in which the vehicle is protected from unauthorized use and the supply to the converter from the DC-voltage source is interrupted. In this case, the protection from unauthorized use can in particular be activated, for example, already prior to the function check.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been identified that it can impair the life of an electric drivetrain when this drivetrain is ramped up and ramped down too often. Thus, for example, switches which disconnect the DC-voltage source from the high-voltage vehicle power supply system can only be designed for a limited number of the order of magnitude of 100,000 switching cycles, and this maximum number is also only available when switching does not take place under load. Every time the switch needs to disconnect high currents in the event of a fault and in the process needs to quench arcs, for example, this places an even more substantial load on it.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further component which may be susceptible to wear in the case of frequent ramping-up and ramping-down is the capacitor in the converter which buffer-stores the DC voltage. This capacitor is charged from the completely empty state to the completely full state via a resistor when the drivetrain is ramped up and is completely discharged again during ramping-down. During driving operation, relatively small quantities of energy are taken from the capacitor in order to cover peak demands and then recharged again. While this exchange of relatively small quantities of energy is negligible in relation to the life of the capacitor, the complete discharge and later complete charging promotes ageing of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, complete ramping-down and then ramping-up of the electric drivetrain also costs energy. Such a cycle can cost more energy in the case of parking of the vehicle for only a short time than is saved in the switched-off state, which results in a reduced range owing to the limited energy reserve which can be carried along in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Vehicles which are parked for only a short time very often are in particular utility vehicles for delivering goods, consignments of letters, consignments of packages and/or piece goods. On a delivery run in a densely built-up area, often only a few meters are driven until the vehicle is parked again and the driver searches for the next house. Model calculations have therefore shown that, for example, said switch for the disconnection of the DC voltage source from the high-voltage vehicle power supply system, which is designed for 100,000 switching operations, can last in a passenger vehicle completely for the entire use duration of this passenger vehicle. A delivery vehicle of the mentioned type, on the other hand, would already come across many more switching operations, with the result that, within the use duration of the vehicle, a replacement of the switch would be due once or even more than once. By virtue of unnecessary switching operations being avoided, therefore unnecessary downtimes and repair costs can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The criterion for the check as to whether the vehicle is likely to be parked for only a short time or not is freely selectable and can in particular also depend on the type and intended use of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the criterion can comprise a comparison of the present position of the vehicle with at least one geographical area which is associated with a short-term or non-short-term parking of the vehicle. In the mentioned example of the delivery vehicle, for example, the delivery depot in which the vehicle is completely filled with consignments is a location at which the vehicle is generally at a standstill for a relatively long period of time. The delivery area in which the consignments are delivered, on the other hand, is an area in which the vehicle is very often parked for only a short time in the described way and then driven again for a few meters in order that the delivery person does not have to carry heavy packages, for example, further than is absolutely necessary.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As an alternative or else in combination with this, the preset criterion can comprise, for example, a removal from the vehicle of a mobile electronic device which is carried along in the vehicle prior to the parking of the vehicle. Behind this lies the knowledge that activities outside the vehicle which, when concluded, are followed by the vehicle being brought into operation again soon, often take place in the direct vicinity of the vehicle. When, for example, a driver of a hybrid vehicle fills up with fuel, though he needs to leave the vehicle, he will continue to drive again as early as after a few minutes. Likewise, a delivery driver on his delivery run will remove himself from his vehicle only by a few ten to a maximum a few hundred meters and bring the vehicle back into operation as soon as he has delivered all of the consignments for a specific location. The distance can be measured by any desired means, such as, for example, by virtue of the signal strength on a radio path over which the vehicle communicates with the device. The device can, however, also determine its position, for example, by evaluation of the signals received from satellites of a navigation system and/or by evaluation of the signals received from WLAN networks and other terrestrial sources and then send it to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mobile electronic device may in particular be, for example, a mobile telephone, a tablet computer, a device for accepting card payments, a device for confirming the delivery of consignments and/or a vehicle key. These devices are generally carried along when the vehicle is left for activities outside the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The device for accepting card payments and the device for confirming the delivery of consignments in this case also have the particular advantage that it can be hereby decided whether the vehicle is actually being left for the delivery of goods or consignments or for a different reason. If the vehicle is being left for a different reason, devices which are used specifically in the delivery of goods or consignments are generally not taken along.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A mobile telephone has the particular advantage that it is often already known to the hands-free device of the vehicle via Bluetooth or another short-range radio technology, and the vehicle key is known to the vehicle itself. However, the mobile telephone can communicate with the vehicle over a greater range than the radio key, whose radio radius is only a few meters for security reasons.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Finally, the driver of the vehicle can also himself make an input in respect of whether short-term or non-short-term parking of the vehicle is intended. An automated prognosis as to whether the vehicle is parked for only a short time or not naturally has the advantage that the driver does not need to think about protecting the electric drivetrain.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The preset criterion can alternatively or in combination with this also operate on further data sources. For example, sensor data which are detected in or on the vehicle and/or the present time of day can be correlated with an activity plan for the vehicle and/or for the driver.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Advantageously, in the blocking state, a check continues to be performed using at least one preset criterion to ascertain whether the vehicle is likely to be parked for only a short time. In response to the fact that, in accordance with this check, the vehicle is likely not to be parked for only a short time, it is shifted to the switched-off state. The criterion checked in the blocking state can be identical to the criterion on the basis of which the vehicle was previously shifted to the blocking state. However this is not essential. The check in the blocking state as well has the advantage that, in the case of activities outside the vehicle which were originally planned as short activities but then last longer than planned, excessive discharge of the battery can be avoided without the driver needing to act on the vehicle from afar or even come back to the vehicle for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Irrespective of this check, generally the vehicle can be shifted from the blocking state to the switched-off state, for example, in response to the fact that a preset time span has elapsed since the transition from the drive-ready state to the blocking state. This avoids an unnecessary energy consumption by the converter, for example an inverter, and at the same time ensures that it is not possible for a hazard to arise as a result of the high DC voltage when the vehicle is left unattended for a relatively long time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vehicle can also be shifted from the blocking state to the switched-off state, for example, in response to the fact that the energy reserve of the DC-voltage source falls below a preset threshold value. In this way, it is possible in particular to avoid a situation whereby the remaining residual range of the vehicle falls below a value which is required for a planned continued journey.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, the vehicle is shifted to the drive-ready state starting from the blocking state, and/or from the switched-off state, in response to the fact that a driver of the vehicle is legitimized with respect to the vehicle. This legitimization can take place in any desired manner, for example by means of a vehicle key, by means of another personalized access medium (such as, for example, a mobile telephone), by means of biometric identification of the driver and/or by means of input of a password, a PIN or another secret. In this case, different legitimization criteria can apply in particular, for example, for the transition from the blocking state to the drive-ready state, on the one hand, and for the transition from the switched-off state to the drive-ready state, on the other hand. Thus, for example, the legitimization can be simplified starting from the blocking state since it is performed very often in the course of a working day.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The transition from the blocking state to the switched-off state can in particular include, for example,<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0027">switching off a switch in the form of a mechanical switch or in the form of a contactor for the supply to the converter from the DC-voltage source, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0028">discharging a capacitor in the converter which buffer-stores the DC voltage from the DC-voltage source.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">In this case, a contactor does not necessarily need to operate electromechanically and/or electromagnetically, but can also use, for example, power semiconductors as switching elements.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">As previously explained, precisely said switches can only be designed for a limited number of switching cycles, and a complete discharge and later complete charging of the capacitor promotes ageing thereof. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary cycles extends the life of these components.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">The method can in particular be wholly or partially computer-implemented. Therefore, the invention also relates to a computer program having machine-readable instructions which, when implemented on one or more computers, instruct the computer(s) to implement the method.
