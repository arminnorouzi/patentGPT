For example, intricate designs and theatrical makeup are typically applied by certified makeup professionals. Additionally, self-application can be a challenge generally for those with limited mobility or vision. Currently, handheld tools, such as cartridge-plus-dispenser solutions, typically implement printed and/or patterned makeup application through a unitary printing head to apply the final design directly to the skin. Despite representing a technological alternative to brushes, such tools are limited by cartridge sizes, cleaning methods, inability to mix or blend colors, short battery life, and lack of location awareness. Also, by depending on a handheld device, such tools do not address accessibility concerns.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Techniques are described for applying a cosmetic design guide to a target body surface of a biological subject, such as a subject's face or other region of interest, using an applicator array device. Described embodiments employ electroactive polymer circuits to initialize an applicator array including multiple applicator elements. Subsequent initialization, a pigment may be selectively applied to those applicator elements that are proud of or otherwise raised from an applicator surface. Transferring the cosmetic design guide to the target body surface aids in the application of cosmetics in accordance with a cosmetic design. The techniques, therefore, improve the manual application of cosmetics.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Described embodiments include using image sensors to define one or more contour mappings of the target body surface using a 3D mapping of the target body surface. Described embodiments are useful in many contexts, including cosmetics or body art applications, skin feature mapping or monitoring, dermatological diagnosis or treatments, or telehealth applications. In the context of such applications, described embodiments provide precision and greater ease of use over complex manual routines.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The forthcoming description focuses on embodiments of a system for applying cosmetic designs and/or cosmetic design guides, but embodiments are not limited as such. In some embodiments, the systems, methods, and materials described include techniques for applying cosmetic treatments to a target body surface. The cosmetic treatments may include, but are not limited to, cosmetic treatments directed at reducing the appearance of skin lines, wrinkles, loose skin, acne, scars, or other aesthetic treatments. The cosmetic treatments may be implemented through application of active ingredients additionally or alternatively to cosmetic pigments. For example, devices described herein may apply ultraviolet-absorber material, antipruritic material, and/or antiseptic materials, as part of a cosmetic design to conceal and treat features including, but not limited to blemishes, acne, cuts, or scars. In this way, the cosmetic treatments may impart similar cosmetic benefits as treatments employing both cosmetic formulations and active ingredients.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an example system <b>100</b> for application of cosmetic designs, in accordance with various embodiments. The example system <b>100</b> includes an applicator array device <b>110</b>, a pigment applicator <b>120</b>, one or more client computing devices <b>130</b>, a camera <b>140</b>, and one or more remote computer systems <b>160</b>, also referred to as server(s). As part of the example system <b>100</b>, the constituent system components may be operably coupled through wireless communication and/or through wired communication. In some embodiments, constituent components may communicate directly through wireless pairing (e.g., Bluetooth) and/or via a local wireless network (e.g., through a wireless router). In some embodiments, constituent components may communicate over one or more networks <b>170</b>, which may be or include a public network (e.g., the internet) or a private network (e.g., an intranet). In this way, the example system <b>100</b> may include multiple distinct devices configured to communicate electronic information through wireless connections. Additionally or alternatively, some of the constituent components may be integrated into a single device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an illustrative example, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may integrate the client computing device <b>130</b> and/or the camera <b>140</b>. Similarly, the client computing device <b>130</b> may incorporate the camera <b>140</b> and/or the pigment applicator <b>120</b>. Similarly, the example system <b>100</b> may include multiple client computing devices <b>130</b>, where a first client computing device <b>130</b> is a mobile electronic device (e.g., a tablet, smartphone, or laptop) that is configured to host user interface elements and to connect to the server(s) <b>160</b> over the network(s) <b>170</b>, while a second client computing device <b>130</b> is integrated with the pigment applicator <b>120</b> and the camera <b>140</b> and is configured to coordinate the operation of the applicator array device <b>110</b> with the first client computing device <b>130</b>. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the constituent components of the example system <b>100</b> may be provided with computer-executable instructions (e.g., software, firmware, etc.) to implement and coordinate the operation of one or more features of the example system <b>100</b>. In this way, the operation of the example system <b>100</b> may be coordinated via a user interface, accessed via one or more of the constituent components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may incorporate electronic components including, but not limited to, control circuitry, power supply circuitry, and communication circuitry. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> receives a cosmetic design from one or more constituent components of the example system <b>100</b> and initializes an applicator array <b>111</b> in accordance with the cosmetic design. The applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design through communication with one or more of the constituent components of the example system <b>100</b>, for example, through wireless communication circuitry <b>113</b>, including but not limited to a near-field radio transmitter/receiver (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.), an infrared optical link, or other data transmission techniques. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design(s) from the client computing device <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design(s) from the client computing device <b>130</b> via a link with the pigment applicator <b>120</b>. For example, the applicator array device <b>110</b> and the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may communicate automatically (e.g., without human intervention) either wirelessly or through a reversible physical coupling (e.g., through communication circuitry including electrical contacts). In this way, cosmetic design data may be transferred either directly to the applicator array device <b>110</b> (e.g., over the network <b>170</b> or through a wireless pairing with the client computing device(s) <b>130</b>), or indirectly via the pigment applicator <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The applicator array device <b>110</b> may include electronic circuitry to individually address multiple applicator elements that together define the applicator array <b>111</b>, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. The applicator elements may include electroactive polymer actuators to switch the applicator elements between a raised position and a neutral or recessed position. In this way, the cosmetic designs received by the applicator array device <b>110</b> may be or include an array of binary values (e.g., a &#x201c;true&#x201d; value and a &#x201c;false&#x201d; value) corresponding to the array of applicator elements. The applicator array device <b>110</b> may initialize the applicator array <b>111</b> in accordance with the binary values, where each value may correspond to an individual applicator element of the applicator array <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pigment applicator <b>120</b> may be or include electronic circuitry and/or mechanical components to selectively apply pigment to one or more applicator elements making up the applicator array <b>111</b>. In some embodiments, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> includes a mechanical coupling <b>121</b> that is fitted to receive or otherwise reversibly join with the applicator array <b>111</b> and/or the applicator array device <b>110</b>, such that an operative surface of the applicator array <b>111</b> contacts the pigment applicator. For example, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may be or include an applicator <b>123</b> including a pigment applicator pad, positioned such that only the applicator element(s) that are in the raised position (e.g., the &#x201c;true&#x201d; position in the cosmetic design) are contacted during the reversible coupling with the applicator array device <b>110</b>. In this way, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may provide a controlled application of pigment to each applicator element that is proud of the operative surface, while leaving applicator elements that remain flush with the operative surface or may be recessed behind the operative surface (e.g., the &#x201c;false&#x201d; position in the design) substantially free of pigment. In this context, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used to describe a condition where a limited or a negligible amount of pigment remains or is deposited on elements not directly contacting the pigment applicator pad. In some embodiments, the mechanical coupling <b>121</b> may include charging contacts to transfer electrical power to the applicator array device <b>110</b>, for example, to charge batteries internal to the applicator array device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, more than one pigment may be applied by the pigment applicator <b>120</b>. For example, the applicator <b>123</b> may include multiple applicator pads corresponding to different colors or types of pigments and may include mechanisms for exchanging the applicator pads between an operative position and an inoperative position. In this way, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may initialize the applicator <b>123</b> by selecting an appropriate pigment corresponding to a received cosmetic design but may also change pigments during application of pigment to the applicator array <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the applicator <b>123</b> includes a controllable pigment applicator head. The pigment applicator head may be or include a controllable nozzle, ribbon, or other pigment source that is driven to positions in a plane (e.g., using an x-y translation stage) that correspond to the applicator elements of the applicator array <b>111</b> that are extended from the operative surface of the applicator array <b>111</b>. In an illustrative example, the pigment includes charged components, such as ionic species, and the pigment is applied to the applicator element(s) through reversible application of an electric field using the pigment applicator head.

In this way, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> refers to one or more processes to place the applicator elements <b>231</b> of the applicator array <b>230</b> into the positions corresponding to the cosmetic design <b>210</b>. For example, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> may describe switching a subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b> from the raised position <b>235</b> to the neutral position <b>233</b>. Similarly, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> may describe switching a subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b> from the neutral position <b>233</b> to the raised position <b>235</b>.

In some embodiments, the pigment applicator incorporates circuitry and components to facilitate cleaning operations. For example, the pigment applicator may include a reservoir of cleaning fluid and an ultrasonic resonator (e.g., a sonic bath) to which the applicator array device <b>220</b> can reversibly couple, at least partially submerging the applicator array <b>230</b>. In this way, residual pigment may be removed from the applicator array <b>230</b> and its constituent applicator elements <b>231</b>. While cleaning is described as an optional operation of the example technique <b>200</b>, it is understood that cleaning may also be included as part of initializing the applicator array <b>230</b>. For example, where some of the operations of the example technique <b>200</b> are performed while the applicator array device <b>220</b> is reversibly coupled with the pigment applicator, cleaning and initializing may be performed concurrently (e.g., at least partially overlapping in time), under the control of one or more processors of the pigment applicator and/or the applicator array device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Subsequent initializing the applicator array <b>230</b>, the example technique <b>200</b> includes applying a pigment <b>237</b> to a portion of the applicator array <b>230</b> at operation <b>207</b>.

The emitter(s) <b>221</b> may be calibrated to emit one or more patterns onto the surface <b>211</b> to indicate the position of the applicator array <b>230</b> relative to the surface <b>211</b>. In an illustrative example, the emitter <b>221</b> may emit a line onto the surface <b>211</b> indicative of the application position of the applicator array <b>230</b>. In this way, the applicator array <b>230</b> may be guided to the correct position on the surface by aligning the projection generated by the emitter <b>221</b> with the registration mark <b>215</b>. While an emitter <b>221</b> is illustrated external to the applicator array <b>230</b>, the emitter(s) <b>221</b> may be disposed between the applicator elements <b>231</b> of the applicator array <b>230</b>. For example, an emitter <b>221</b> may be a calibrated to emit one or more patterns or beams onto the surface <b>211</b> from a point- and/or line-source located on the operative surface of the applicator array <b>230</b> (e.g., a beam-forming optic being optically coupled to one or more light-emitting diodes positioned within the body of the applicator array device <b>220</b>). In this way, the emitter <b>221</b> may project a pattern and/or beam onto the surface <b>211</b> without occlusion by the applicator array <b>230</b> when the applicator array device <b>220</b> approaches the surface <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, applying the design includes multiple iterations of the operations of example technique <b>200</b>.

In this context, the term &#x201c;bistable&#x201d; refers to a polymeric material that absorbs electromagnetic radiation at a characteristic energy (h&#x3bd;) to form crosslinking bonds that may be reversed upon exposure to different EM radiation in the UV/visible spectral ranges. Formation of the temporary crosslinking bonds may shift the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from a fluid <b>341</b> to a solid <b>343</b>, and removal of crosslinking bonds may shift the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from a solid <b>343</b> to a liquid <b>341</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid <b>341</b> may be characterized by a viscosity that permits the bistable pigment <b>337</b> to transfer to the surface (e.g., surface <b>211</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In contrast, the solid <b>343</b> may be or include a solid and or a viscous fluid, either of which may be resistant to transfer onto the surface. In this way, the resulting applicator array <b>330</b> may be patterned by localized exposure to the activation wavelength to switch the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from one phase to another, leaving a subset of the applicator elements <b>331</b> with bistable pigment <b>337</b> as liquid <b>341</b>.

The exchange reaction may be modulated by mild basic or mild acidic catalysts, which are released by exposure of the polymer matrix to EM radiation at the characteristic activation wavelength(s) at operation <b>307</b>. Examples of the characteristic activation wavelength may include, but are not limited to, wavelengths in a range from 300 nm to 500 nm.
