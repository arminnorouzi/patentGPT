of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Research and development for an augmented reality (AR) function and its use are increasing. Augmented reality can be a technology for synthesizing virtual related information (e.g., a text, an image, etc.) to a real thing (e.g., a real environment) and showing. Augmented reality can, unlike virtual reality (VR) aiming at only a virtual space and thing, provide a virtual object on an object called a real environment. Virtual reality can be a virtual space which is implemented to have a similar experience with reality with respect to the virtual space and a virtual thing. Mixed reality (MR) can mean a space which is made by combining and merging virtual information and reality information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To provide virtual and/or augmented reality contents, a camera of an electronic device can acquire a rendering image continuously tracking a user who is a subject which is a photographing target and reflecting a location, look or/and direction, etc. of the user. In this case, because the camera included in the electronic device has a restricted angle range of view (e.g., general angle (standard angle), wide angle or narrow angle (e.g., telescope angle)), there is a limit in tracking a location, look and/or direction, etc. of the user, when the user moves.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various example embodiments can offer a technique/method for setting various events capable of occurring when a virtual realty service is used by using an electronic device and a wearable device, and offering virtual and/or augmented reality contents wherein the virtual reality service can be seamlessly smoothly used by using peripheral space information of a user, and an electronic device supporting the same.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with various example embodiments of the present disclosure, an electronic device can include a communication module comprising communication circuitry, a camera, and at least one processor (comprising processing circuitry) operably coupled with the communication module and the camera.
