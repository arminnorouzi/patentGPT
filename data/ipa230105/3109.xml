Once the fracturing operation has been completed, production ports can be opened to allow hydrocarbons to flow from the reservoir into the well and up to the surface. In addition, it can be desirable to deploy tracers in the formation in order to monitor hydrocarbon or water production. For example, tracer materials can be used to determine if a certain stage along a wellbore is effectively producing oil. Tracer materials are conventionally added to the fracturing fluid and are therefor supplied with the liquid and proppant from the surface, down the well and then into the fractured stage. The tracer is thereby carried into the reservoir where it can associate with reservoir oil or water so as to be detectable in the production fluid in order to facilitate monitoring. Tracers can be used, for example, to confirm whether successful fracturing of each stage along the well has been achieved. However, there are a number of challenges with deploying and detecting tracers and there is a need for improved technologies in this space.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to an aspect, a fracturing and tracer-delivery valve assembly for integration within a wellbore string disposed within a hydrocarbon-containing reservoir is provided.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As will be described below in relation to various implementations, a convertible valve assembly is provided and enables fracturing of a surrounding stage of a formation and also delivering tracer material into the production fluid for recovery at surface during production.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Broadly described, the valve assembly is configured to be integrated as part of a wellbore string disposed within a hydrocarbon-containing reservoir. The valve assembly is operable between various configurations for allowing fracturing fluid to be injected within the reservoir, and production fluid to be produced from the reservoir via the same wellbore string. In other words, the valve assembly is configured to allow both fracturing and production operations within the reservoir. The valve can also include a tracer compartment in which a tracer material, or various tracer materials, is provided so that the tracer can be deployed within the valve assembly instead of being pumped downhole as part the fracturing fluid. The valve assembly can be configured to provide a first flow pathway to enable flow of fracturing fluid to enable fracturing, and a second flow pathway that accommodates tracer material and is configured to receive production fluid during the production operation and allow tracer to be entrained with the production fluid.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The valve assembly is thus multifunctional, enabling fracturing and tracing of production fluid, while facilitating deployment of tracer material that is pre-packaged within the valve assembly. The valve assembly can be shifted, or otherwise moved, into different configurations to provide the first or second flow pathways at different stages of the operation. As will be described further below, it should be understood that the first and second flow pathways can be defined by two partially independent passages along which fluid can flow. In other words, and for example, the first and second flow pathways are not identical (e.g., structurally), but can share common components, such as inlets.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">More specifically, in some implementations, the valve assembly includes a valve housing having a central passage therethrough and a plurality of frac ports extending radially through a tubular wall of the housing for establishing fluid communication between the passage and the reservoir. The valve assembly further includes a pair of sleeves, which can be slidably mounted within the housing and configured to selectively close and open the frac ports. The housing and the sleeves also define at least two fluid pathways isolated from one another along which fluid flows to and from the reservoir. As will be described further below, one of the pathways includes a tracer compartment provided with tracer material configured to be recovered by the fluid flowing through it. The tracer material can then be recovered in the production fluid at surface and can be analyzed in order to assess or quantify the fluids recovered from the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">It will be understood that the valve assembly described herein can be used in relation with multistage fracturing (also referred to as &#x201c;fracking&#x201d;) operations. The fracturing operation can include a number of steps, some of which are described below.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In fracturing operations, the wellbore can first be dug out (e.g., drilled) and lined with casing, and then cement slurry can be pumped down the casing towards a toe of the wellbore and back up an annulus defined between the casing and the reservoir (i.e., the walls of the wellbore). In order to push the cement slurry past the toe and into the annulus, a wiper plug can be pumped down the casing to effectively wipe the slurry from the interior of the wellbore. Once within the annulus, the cement can be allowed to cure, thus cementing the casing within the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In &#x201c;plug and perf&#x201d; fracturing operations, a perforating gun is lowered down the casing and fired to form perforations through the casing at the lowest stage of the well. Then fracturing fluid is pumped down to fracture the reservoir through those perforations. A plug can then be placed above (i.e., uphole) the fractured perforations, and the process can be repeated one stage up, and so on, up the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the context of the present disclosure, instead of forming perforations as in &#x201c;plug and perf&#x201d; operations, the valve assembly can be installed between lengths of casing at desired locations. These locations can be determined based on where the perforations would have been if a perforating gun was used. After the casing and valve assemblies are in place in the open wellbore, the casing and valve assemblies are cemented in place using cementing techniques such as those noted above. The cementing process can interfere with the operation of the sleeves or other moving parts of the valve assembly. The sleeves can therefore be designed to accommodate the cementing process whereby cement is prevented from entering any ports, slots, recesses and the like, that might not be cleaned by the wiper plug, for example. Furthermore, in order to prevent the sleeves from being moved by the wiper plug (or by subsequent well equipment, cleaning, etc.), the sleeves can be held in position by shear pins or other securing mechanisms, as will be described further below. Therefore, in some implementations, to actuate the sleeves, a first shift force is required to break the pins and move the sleeves.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some implementations, each stage of the wellbore can be provided with a corresponding valve assembly allowing fracturing of and production from the reservoir at each stage along the wellbore. The valve assemblies can be installed downhole between lengths of casing, cemented in place, and shifted using appropriate downhole tools, such as shifting tools deployed on coiled tubing, for example.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref>, an example implementation of the valve assembly <b>10</b> is illustrated. As mentioned above, the valve assembly <b>10</b> includes a casing or housing <b>12</b> having a central passage <b>14</b> for allowing fluid flow therethrough. The housing <b>12</b> has an uphole end <b>15</b> and a downhole end <b>16</b> configured to be connected between lengths of casing in order to integrate the valve assembly within the wellbore string, which is typically cemented in place. It should be understood that, as used herein, the expressions &#x201c;uphole&#x201d; and &#x201c;downhole&#x201d; refer to directional/orientational expressions using the configuration of the wellbore as reference. More specifically, the uphole direction is generally the direction leading to the surface, and the downhole direction is generally the direction leading away from the surface. Moreover, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the uphole direction is generally towards the left, while the downhole direction is generally towards the right.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">It is noted that the casing sections are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to<b>10</b></figref>, but would be located on either end of the valve assembly <b>10</b> and can be coupled to the opposed ends of the housing <b>12</b>, for example. During the cementing process, the cement can pass within the annulus defined between the wellbore and the casing for casing segments and within the annulus defined between the wellbore and the housing where the valve assemblies are located. The cement can thus form a continuous mass that surrounds and adheres to the outer surfaces of the casing and the housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some implementations, the housing <b>12</b> can include a plurality of sections, or &#x201c;subs&#x201d;, configured to connect to one another in an end-to-end fashion, although it is appreciated that other configurations and constructions are possible. It should be understood that, in the context of the present disclosure, the expression &#x201c;sub&#x201d; refers to a division or part of an ensemble or structure. More particularly, the housing <b>12</b> can include a top sub <b>18</b> provided at the uphole end <b>15</b>, a bottom sub <b>20</b> provided at the downhole end <b>16</b>, and a central sub <b>22</b> disposed between the top and bottom subs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The top and bottom subs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can be shaped and configured to be connected to corresponding parts of the wellbore string. For example, the top and bottom subs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can be threaded in order to connect to corresponding threaded parts of the wellbore string. Alternatively, the top and bottom subs can be shaped and sized for insertion within the wellbore string via a press-fit connection.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The subs are illustratively connected to each other via outer tubular sections, or barrels <b>23</b>, with a top barrel <b>24</b> and a bottom barrel <b>25</b> connecting the central sub <b>22</b> to the top and bottom subs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> respectively. It is noted that the passage <b>14</b> extends through each sub and barrel such that fluid flow remains unimpeded between the uphole and downhole ends <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. The barrels can be connected to the subs using any suitable method or configuration. For example, the barrels can be threaded onto the subs or connected thereto via press-fit, although it is appreciated that other connection methods are possible.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this illustrated implementation, the housing <b>12</b> further includes a plurality of frac ports <b>26</b> extending radially about the housing <b>12</b> for establishing fluid communication between the passage <b>14</b> and the surrounding reservoir. It is appreciated that the housing <b>12</b> can include any suitable number of frac ports <b>26</b>, and that the frac ports can be evenly or unevenly spaced and/or aligned about the housing <b>12</b>, although other configurations are possible. In the illustrated implementations, there are eight frac ports (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>10</b></figref>) evenly distributed about the circumference of a part of the housing, although it is appreciated that any other suitable number of frac ports can be used. It is also possible to have a single frac port instead of several. In the illustrated implementation, the frac ports <b>26</b> extend through the central sub <b>22</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the frac ports <b>26</b> can extend through the top sub <b>18</b>, the bottom sub <b>20</b>, or any other suitable location of the housing <b>12</b>, or combination thereof. In alternate implementations, the valve housing <b>12</b> can be made as a single-piece unit (i.e., with no separate subs and barrels). However, having a plurality of subs and/or barrels can facilitate manufacturing of certain features of the valve assembly <b>10</b>, such as the frac ports <b>26</b>, for example. The frac ports can also have different cross-sectional areas and shapes, e.g., cylindrical, frustoconical, tapered toward or away from the reservoir, etc. The frac ports can also be open during deployment downhole or could have a temporary plug or cap that is expelled due to the pressure of the fracturing fluid during the fracturing operation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some implementations, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can be configurable between a closed configuration, where the frac ports <b>26</b> are effectively blocked or closed; a fracturing configuration, where the frac ports <b>26</b> are unobstructed or open and fracturing fluid can be injected within the reservoir via the frac ports <b>26</b>; and a tracing configuration, where production fluid is produced from the reservoir and flows through the tracer compartment so that tracer material is entrained and recovered for analysis. The valve assembly <b>10</b> can also move to a configuration where production fluid is received within the passage <b>14</b> but does not pass through the tracer compartment if the latter is kept enclosed and sealed. In order to operate the valve assembly <b>10</b> in these various configurations, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can include inner sleeves, or valve sleeves <b>30</b>, operatively mounted within the housing <b>12</b> and displaceable between various positions.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The sleeves <b>30</b> can be provided with various features and/or in various configurations in order to be displaceable and to provide the different (e.g., non-identical) flow paths for fracturing and tracing. Some features and implementations of possible sleeve arrangements are described below.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref>, and with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> are operatively mounted within the housing <b>12</b> for selectively closing and opening the frac ports <b>26</b>. In this implementation, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> include a pair of valve sleeves slidably mounted within the housing <b>12</b> for moving axially therealong (i.e., sliding or shifting along inner surfaces of the housing within the passage <b>14</b>). More particularly, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> include a bottom sleeve <b>32</b> (or downhole sleeve) mounted within a downhole portion of the housing <b>12</b>, and a top sleeve <b>34</b> (or uphole sleeve) mounted within an uphole portion of the housing <b>12</b>. The valve sleeves <b>30</b> can be substantially aligned with one another and both include a bore therethrough such that fluid can flow freely along the valve assembly <b>10</b> (e.g., from one sleeve to the other and through the housing). As will be described below, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> can be independently displaced with respect to one another along the passage <b>14</b> and can be arranged in various positions in order to direct fluid flow into predetermined fluid pathways of the valve assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The valve sleeves <b>30</b> can be mounted within the housing <b>12</b> in a manner allowing the sleeves to shift from one position to another. It should be understood that the expression &#x201c;shift&#x201d; can refer to the displacement of the valve sleeves <b>30</b> using a shifting tool, for example, or a self-shifting mechanism provided as part of the valve assembly. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> can be mounted in the downhole region of the housing <b>12</b> (e.g., along the bottom barrel <b>25</b>) in an occluding, or closed position, where the frac ports <b>26</b> are blocked by the bottom sleeve <b>32</b>. Moreover, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be mounted in the uphole region of the housing <b>12</b> (e.g., along the top barrel <b>24</b>) in a first position, or &#x201c;run-in-hole position&#x201d;. It is appreciated that, when the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> is in the closed position, the top sleeve <b>34</b> remains in the first position. In some implementations, the top and bottom sleeves <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can be shaped and configured to sealingly engage one another within the housing <b>12</b> in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In other words, the downhole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b> can contact the uphole end of the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> and create a seal therebetween. While deploying a shifting tool can be a preferred way to shift the sleeves, in an alternative scenario the sleeves can be shifted or otherwise displaced remotely.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The valve sleeves <b>30</b> can be secured in their respective positions using any suitable method. The valve sleeves <b>30</b> can be shaped and configured to engage some inner surfaces of the corresponding housing portion. For example, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> can have one or more sections having a greater outer diameter for sealingly engaging with the housing <b>12</b>, and thus maintain the sleeves in position (e.g., press-fit connection). Alternatively, or additionally, the housing <b>12</b> can have portions that extend inwardly (i.e., into the passage <b>14</b>) at predetermined sections for engaging with corresponding parts of the valve sleeves <b>30</b> and further securing or stabilizing the valve sleeves <b>30</b> in position. In some implementations, the valve sleeves <b>30</b> can alternatively, or additionally, be secured in position using one or more fasteners, such as shear pins <b>35</b> extending from the housing <b>12</b> and engaging the valve sleeves <b>30</b>. The shear pins <b>35</b> are configured to break in order to allow the valve sleeves <b>30</b> to be shifted between positions. In this implementation, the shear pins <b>35</b> are configured to retain the sleeves in their initial positions during the completion of the wellbore, and more specifically during cementing of the casing. In other words, the shear pins <b>35</b> are configured to retain the sleeves while the sleeves are being installed along the wellbore, and while the wiper plug cleans the interior of the wellbore, as previously described.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>6</b></figref>, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can further include collets, or sealing rings <b>36</b>, adapted to extend between the inner surface of the housing <b>12</b> and the outer surface of at least one of the valve sleeves <b>30</b>, depending on the configuration of the valve assembly <b>10</b>. In this implementation, the housing <b>12</b> is provided with a pair of sealing rings <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>provided on either side of the frac ports <b>26</b> and extending inwardly from the inner surface of the housing <b>12</b> to engage the valve sleeves <b>30</b> when they are in different positions. The sealing rings <b>36</b> can be adapted to prevent, or at least reduce, axial displacement of the valve sleeves <b>30</b> within the housing <b>12</b> prior to shifting the sleeves using the shifting tool. The sealing rings <b>36</b> can further be adapted to provide fluid-sealed engagement between the housing <b>12</b> and the valve sleeve <b>30</b> to prevent fluid from flowing between the rings <b>36</b> and the sleeve <b>30</b> in certain positions. It is noted that the force required to break the shear pins <b>35</b> and initially move the sleeves <b>30</b> is greater than the force required to move the sleeves <b>30</b> for simply countering the retainment of the sealing rings <b>36</b>. For example, the force required to break the shear pins <b>35</b> can be approximately 20,000 psi, while the force required to move the sleeves <b>30</b> afterwards can be between 4,000 and 8,000 psi.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, when the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> is in the closed position, the uphole end of the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> covers the frac ports <b>26</b> such that fluid cannot flow therethrough. The bottom sleeve <b>32</b> further engages both sealing rings <b>36</b> such that fluid flow is prevented, or at least reduced, within interstices defined by the housing (e.g., central sub <b>20</b>) and the bottom sleeve <b>32</b>. In some implementations, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can include additional elements adapted to prevent, or at least reduce, movement of the sleeves and/or fluid flow into certain regions. For example, in the illustrated implementation, the valve assembly <b>10</b> includes a pair of O-rings <b>37</b> provided proximate each sealing ring <b>36</b>. More specifically, a first O-ring <b>37</b><i>a </i>is provided uphole of the sealing rings <b>36</b>, and a second O-ring <b>37</b><i>b </i>is provided downhole of the sealing rings <b>36</b>. However, it is appreciated that other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>6</b></figref>, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can be run in hole in the closed configuration as part of the wellbore string, where the frac ports <b>26</b> are effectively closed or blocked. The tracer compartment is also in its enclosed configuration. In the closed configuration, at least one of the top and bottom sleeves <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is positioned within the housing <b>12</b> in a manner such that the frac ports <b>26</b> are occluded. In this implementation, the closed configuration includes positioning the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> in the closed position to prevent fluid flow between the passage <b>14</b> and the reservoir. Therefore, fluid flowing along the wellbore string flows into the valve assembly <b>10</b> at the uphole end <b>15</b>, and simply flows along the central passage <b>14</b> and the internal bores of the sleeves and then out of the valve assembly at the downhole end <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Once the wellbore string has been positioned and installed at the desired location within the reservoir, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can be operated in the fracturing configuration in order to initiate fracturing of the reservoir. Fracturing generally includes injection of fracturing fluid into the reservoir at high pressure for fracturing the subterranean formation surrounding the valve assembly. The injection of fluid causes the rock of the formation to fracture and the fluid with proppant flows into the fractures. The proppant holds the fractures open to facilitate subsequent production.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, it should be understood that the fracturing fluid is injected within the reservoir from the surface via the wellbore string, and more particularly via the frac ports <b>26</b> of the valve assembly <b>10</b>. It should thus be noted that, when in the fracturing configuration, the frac ports <b>26</b> are substantially unobstructed to allow fracturing fluid to be injected into the reservoir. In this implementation, in order to operate the valve assembly <b>10</b> in the fracturing configuration, the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> can be shifted to a non-occluding position, or open position, in order to open the frac ports <b>26</b>. In some implementation, the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> is displaced in the downhole direction until the frac ports <b>26</b> are open, thus allowing fluid to be injected into the reservoir. However, it is appreciated that other configurations are possible. Furthermore, it should be noted that the top sleeve <b>34</b> preferably remains in the first position when operating the valve assembly <b>10</b> in the fracturing configuration in order to maintain the frac ports <b>26</b> open.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, in this implementation, the valve assembly <b>10</b> defines a fracturing fluid pathway (A) along which the fracturing fluid flows to reach the frac ports <b>26</b>. The fluid flowing along the fracturing fluid pathway (A) enters the passage of the housing <b>12</b> via the top sub <b>18</b>, flows through the bore of the top sleeve <b>34</b> and exits the housing <b>12</b> (i.e., enters the reservoir) via the frac ports <b>26</b> of the central sub <b>22</b>. However, it is appreciated that other pathways and configurations are possible for routing the fracturing fluid to the reservoir. As described above, the fracturing fluid can be forced through the frac ports <b>26</b> due to pressure build-up within the housing <b>12</b> caused by the presence of a packer, frac plug, or other obstruction (not illustrated) deployed downhole of the valve assembly <b>10</b>, for example. Furthermore, once fracturing has occured, the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> can be shifted uphole, back to the closed position (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) to prevent back flow of the fracturing fluid from the formation and allow &#x201c;healing&#x201d; or equilibration of the reservoir prior to production.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some implementations, production can be initiated using a pump coupled to the wellbore string configured to pump hydrocarbon-containing fluid uphole along the valve assembly <b>10</b> and the wellbore string for recovery thereof at surface. Production can be enabled by a downhole pump, a surface pump or artificial lift, as the case may be. It should be understood that production fluid can be recovered when the valve assembly <b>10</b> is in the so-called &#x201c;fracturing configuration&#x201d;, whereby fluid is pumped through the frac ports into the housing <b>12</b> and follows the fracturing fluid pathway (A) in the opposite direction (i.e., uphole towards the surface). In some operations, the valve assembly is indeed operated in this manner at least for some time. This operating mode can be referred to as a non-tracing production mode, as the tracing compartment remains closed. However, as will be described below, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can be operated in a tracing and production configuration, whereby a separate fluid pathway is defined to allow production fluid to flow from the reservoir to the wellbore string through the tracer compartment, and ultimately to surface. It is noted that all of the production fluid being recovered via a particular valve assembly while in the tracing and production configuration can be routed to flow through the tracer compartment.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the tracing and production configuration allows production of water or hydrocarbon-containing fluid via the wellbore string for recovery thereof at surface. More specifically, the production configuration defines a production fluid pathway (B) along which the production fluid flows to reach the passage <b>14</b> of the valve assembly <b>10</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be disposed within the housing <b>12</b> in a manner defining an annulus <b>38</b> between at least a section of the top sleeve <b>34</b> and the housing <b>12</b>, and more particularly between the outer surface of the top sleeve <b>34</b> and the inner surface of the central sub <b>22</b> and top barrel <b>24</b>. In some implementations, the top sleeve <b>34</b> and the housing <b>12</b> are substantially concentric and a relatively constant flow area is defined through the annulus <b>38</b>. As such, the amount of fluid flowing past any given point within the annulus <b>38</b> is known and can be used to determine flow rates, for example. However, it is appreciated that other configurations are possible, such as having an annulus with a varying flow area along the top sleeve <b>34</b>, for example, or defining the second fluid pathway in other ways. In the illustrated implementation, the annulus <b>38</b> defines a notable portion of the production fluid pathway (B) and is configured to allow fluid flowing from the reservoir to reach the passage <b>14</b> during production.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some implementations, the production configuration is achieved by shifting the top sleeve <b>34</b> downhole to a tracing position such that the downhole end thereof is positioned facing the frac ports <b>26</b>. It is noted that positioning the top sleeve <b>34</b> in the tracing position can push the bottom sleeve <b>32</b> to the open position simultaneously. Furthermore, in this implementation, shifting the top sleeve <b>34</b> to the tracing position establishes fluid communication between the reservoir and the annulus <b>38</b> via the frac ports <b>26</b>, thereby opening the tracer compartment to fluid flow. However, it is appreciated that other configurations are possible for establishing fluid communication between the reservoir and the annulus <b>38</b>. For example, the housing <b>12</b> can be provided with a second set of ports configured to be open upon moving the valve assembly <b>10</b> to the production configuration so that those ports communicate with the reservoir and the annulus.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, fluids flowing along the production fluid pathway (B) enter the housing <b>12</b> through the frac ports <b>26</b>, flow along the annulus <b>38</b> and then enter the central passage <b>14</b> at an uphole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b>. However, it is appreciated that other configurations are possible for establishing fluid communication between the reservoir and the annulus <b>38</b> and/or the opened tracer compartment. For example, the housing <b>12</b> can be provided with a second set of ports configured to be opened upon configuring the valve assembly <b>10</b> in the production configuration. The tracer compartment can also be defined as an annular volume in between the top sleeve and the housing, or as a section of the annulus, or by another volume. The top sleeve <b>34</b> can include an inlet portion <b>40</b> proximate the downhole end having a reduced diameter. The inlet portion <b>40</b> is illustratively positioned opposite the frac ports <b>26</b> to facilitate the inflow of fluid within the annulus <b>38</b> during production. Therefore, it is appreciated that, in some implementations, production fluid can enter the housing <b>12</b> through the frac ports <b>26</b> and flow into the annulus <b>38</b> via the inlet portion <b>40</b> provided at the downhole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b>. The production fluid then flows along the annulus <b>38</b> towards the uphole end and into the passage <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In this implementation, the annulus <b>38</b> includes a tracer compartment <b>42</b> provided with tracer material configured to be recovered by fluid flowing through the annulus <b>38</b>, and thus through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> in an open position. It should be noted that, in this implementation, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> is fluidly sealed from the rest of the valve assembly <b>10</b> prior to shifting the top sleeve <b>34</b> to the tracing position. Therefore, tracer material remains within the annulus <b>38</b> until the valve assembly <b>10</b> is operated in the production configuration (which can also be referred to as the tracing configuration). More specifically, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be shaped and configured to create a seal with the housing <b>12</b> at one or both ends thereof when in the first position, thereby isolating the tracer compartment <b>42</b> within the annulus <b>38</b>. For example, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can have a greater outer diameter at opposite ends thereof for engaging the housing <b>12</b> and thus maintain the sleeve sealed and in position. Alternatively, or additionally, the housing <b>12</b> can have portions that extend inwardly (i.e., into the passage <b>14</b>) at predetermined sections for engaging the top sleeve <b>34</b> and further securing the top sleeve <b>34</b> in position. It is also noted that other methods of sealing the tracer compartment <b>42</b> are possible, such as using a blow-out disk (or rupture disk), or via the use of grease to occlude fluid passage, for example. Such devices could be incorporated in various ways into the assembly.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some implementations, at least one of the housing <b>12</b> and top sleeve <b>34</b> can be shaped and configured to provide predetermined fluid dynamic conditions (e.g., having a known and/or constant flow area, surface area and/or flow volume) within the annulus <b>38</b>. For example, the housing and/or top sleeve can include flow straighteners (not shown) configured to promote axial flow of fluids throughout the annulus <b>38</b>. The flow straighteners can include a plurality of substantially parallel plates extending within and along the annulus <b>38</b> configured to eliminate, or at least reduce, radial movement of fluid. In addition, the flow straighteners can be adapted to favour or cause laminar flow throughout the annulus <b>38</b> such that the flow rate through the annulus can be controlled to have a laminar flow regime. Therefore, the flow rate along the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, combined with the amount of tracer material recovered by the production fluid, can also be controlled, or at least be more predictable. It is noted that other methods of providing predetermined fluid dynamic conditions in order to obtain a consistent and/or predictable flow throughout the annulus <b>38</b> are possible.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the top sleeve can engage the housing <b>12</b>, and more specifically engage the sealing ring <b>36</b><i>b </i>downhole of the frac ports <b>26</b>, but does not engage the sealing ring <b>36</b><i>a </i>uphole of the frac ports, which provides a fluid pathway past this uphole sealing ring. As such, fluid flowing through the frac ports <b>26</b> is substantially confined to flow along the annulus <b>38</b>. In other words, the entire volume of production fluid flows into the housing, along the annulus <b>38</b>, through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> and past the tracer material contained therein. The uphole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be similarly shaped and configured to engage the housing <b>12</b> to further hold the top sleeve in position. In this implementation, the uphole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be connected to the housing via a press-fit connection, although it is appreciated that other configurations are possible, such as using fasteners, for example. Alternatively, the uphole end of the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be free of contact from the housing <b>12</b> to allow fluid from within the annulus <b>38</b> to flow into the central passage <b>14</b> by simply flowing past the uphole edge of the top sleeve <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the illustrated implementation, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be provided with production ports <b>44</b> for allowing fluid to flow from the annulus <b>38</b> to the central passage <b>14</b> when both ends of the top sleeve are sealingly engaged with the housing <b>12</b>. The production ports <b>44</b> extend through a wall thickness of the top sleeve <b>34</b> and are configured to establish fluid communication between the annulus <b>38</b> and the central passage <b>14</b>. It should be understood that the production ports <b>44</b> allow fluid flow therethrough when the top sleeve <b>34</b> is in the tracing position, and that the production ports <b>44</b> are closed when the top sleeve <b>34</b> is in the first position. For example, when the top sleeve <b>34</b> is in the first position (e.g., seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b></figref>), part of the housing <b>12</b> engages the top sleeve <b>34</b> so as to cover the production ports <b>44</b>. More particularly, the top sub <b>18</b> engages the top sleeve <b>34</b> in order to hold it in the first position, and simultaneously occludes the production ports <b>42</b>. The portion of the housing <b>12</b> that occludes the production ports can be designed to have a smaller internal diameter than the internal diameter along the annulus <b>18</b>, thereby blocking the production ports <b>42</b> when the top sleeve <b>34</b> is in the first position. Alternatively, or additionally, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can have a larger outer diameter proximate the production ports <b>42</b> to engage the housing.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some implementations, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be repeatedly shifted between the first position and the tracing position. Therefore, tracer material can be released into the production fluid by shifting the top sleeve <b>34</b> to the tracing position, and then the tracer material can be re-sealed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b> for future use by shifting the top sleeve <b>34</b> back in the first position, thus extending the lifespan of the tracer material. As mentioned above, production fluid can still be produced through the frac ports <b>26</b> and the first fluid pathway when the top sleeve <b>34</b> is in the first position, although tracer material will not be contacted in that mode. It is also noted that after fracturing, the valve assembly can initially be operated so that the production fluid flows via the first fluid pathway (i.e., in an uphole direction) and therefore does not absorb or entrain any tracer material initially, and then at some future stage the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be displaced to change the fluid pathway for the production fluid to the second fluid pathway, thereby initiating tracing operations. As mentioned above, the top sleeve <b>34</b> can be shifted back into the first position in order to operate the valve assembly in the non-tracing production configuration, thus re-isolating the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, and thus the tracer material, within the annulus <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> is disposed within the annulus <b>38</b> between the frac ports <b>26</b> and the production ports <b>42</b>. Therefore, production fluid flowing along the production fluid pathway (B) flows through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> and simultaneously recovers tracer material. In some implementations, the housing <b>12</b> and/or top sleeve <b>34</b> can be shaped and configured to provide a certain size of the annulus <b>38</b> (e.g., having recessed surfaces of the sleeve or corresponding barrel of the housing to provide a larger volume compared to flat surfaces). The sizing of the annulus can be done in order to provide pre-determined surface area, length, cross-sectional flow area and/or volume in order to facilitate quantification analyses, since known fluid dynamics and tracer contact areas within the compartment can be correlated to oil or water flow rates.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">It should be understood that, as used herein, the expression &#x201c;quantification&#x201d; can refer to the correlation or estimation of the detected tracer to the amount of oil and/or water produced from that stage and has therefore contacted and entrained the tracer. For instance, the amount (e.g., weight or concentration) of the tracer can be measured at the surface, and this measurement can be used to determine an approximate mass or volume of oil and/or water that was produced via a certain stage or stages. When different tracers are used in respective valve assemblies that are located at respective stages along the well, the surface measurements of the tracers can be used to quantify production features of each stage, which can be quite useful to assess the performance of the different stages. Quantifying each stage of the wellbore can therefore involve determining flow rates of certain fluids (e.g., oil and/or water) along the wellbore. As such, it is possible to determine if a particular stage is producing fluid, and if it is, which fluid it is producing (e.g., oil or water) and in what amount or relative proportion to other fluids produced from that stage.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, the stages can be compared or ranked according to the amount of fluid being produced, which can assist in determining subsequent operations over the lifetime of the well.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Quantification analyses can be facilitated by a number of features related to the construction of the valve assembly and other factors. For example, the valve assembly can be configured such that the tracer compartment has predetermined geometrical characteristics when the second flow pathway is open and receiving production fluid. The tracer compartment can have one or more features that facilitate quantification, such as a predetermined volume; a predetermined surface area over which tracer is present and in contact with the production fluid; a predetermined shape and size in which the production fluid would have known fluid flow properties (e.g., flow regime); a tracer material that is provided in order to have predetermined desorption or release rates in response to certain conditions (e.g., fluid flow, temperature, pressure, fluid composition); a predetermined tracer concentration, mass or availability within the tracer compartment; a configuration that forces all of the production fluid flowing through the valve assembly from the well and into the well to pass through the tracer compartment; and so on. For instance, by having predetermined tracer release rates and tracer compartment geometries, correlations can be developed such that the measured tracer concentration at surface can be used to determine the flow rate of fluids from that particular stage.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In another example, the tracer compartment can be provided as an annular compartment with a predetermined volume and internal surface area defined by smooth walls, where an oil-soluble tracer is provided over a predetermined surface area and has a generally known release rate within certain operating envelopes of production fluid flow and composition. The oil-soluble tracer would then be released into the oil phase of the production fluid depending on the concentration and flow rate of the production fluid. At surface, the combined production fluid could be analysed to determine the concentration of that particular oil-soluble tracer, and this concentration could be used to determine the quantity of oil being produced by that particular stage of the well. The correlations that could be used for quantifying certain properties of the stages (e.g., water production, oil production, overall fluid production, etc.), could be developed in various ways, such as building calibration models based on laboratory tests. In some implementations, the tracer compartment has a geometry that facilitates modelling; for example, when the tracer compartment is substantially annular and/or defined by opposed walls that are parallel to each other, then fluid dynamics and modelling related to flow through parallel plates or annuli can be used.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The tracer compartment <b>42</b> can also be sized size to accommodate pre-determined or desired quantities of tracer material. It can be desirable to provide large amounts of tracer material in the tracer compartment in order to facilitate tracing over a long period of time. The tracer material can also be provided with slow and/or known desorption or release properties to facilitate quantification analyses. In some implementations, the tracer material is selected and provided to have a slow release rate into the production fluid, which results in low concentrations of tracer being present in the production fluid, but the tracer fluid is also selected to have high detectability at low concentrations (e.g., in the parts per billion or trillion range). An example tracer material with highly sensitive detectability is nucleic acid-based tracers that can be amplified in a sample. In some implementations, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> can include an annular region that forms most of its volume.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The tracer material can be provided in various forms within the tracer compartment and the given method for providing the tracer into the production fluid may depend at least in part on the type and form of tracer material. The tracer can have various properties and chemical structures. For instance, the tracer material can include an oil-soluble tracer or a water-soluble tracer, and can be based on various chemistries. The tracer chemical itself can be provided in various ways, including directly by itself, associated on or in particles that are provided in the tracer compartment, associated with a solid matrix that is provided in the tracer compartment (e.g., coated onto its surfaces), as part of a solution or dispersion that is provided in the tracer compartment, and so on.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The delivery of tracer material into the production fluid can be done in various ways. For instance, the tracer compartment can be provided as part of the production flowpath, as per the main implementations described herein and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>10</b></figref>. The tracer compartment can for instance be defined within an annulus in between two seals and in between the sleeve and the housing when in the fracturing position, and then the tracer compartment is opened up and becomes part of the production fluid flow path in the tracing position.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Alternatively, the tracer material can be delivered into the production fluid flowpath in other ways. For example, the tracer material can be housed in a separate compartment configured so that it can become in fluid communication with the production flowpath so that tracer flows into the production fluid. In such scenarios, the tracer can be delivered into the annulus <b>38</b>, into part of the anulus, or into another conduit or flowpath that could be located or constructed within the annuls. Such embodiments are particularly applicable when the tracer material is a liquid or is provided in a liquid carrier fluid. The tracer material delivered into the production fluid from the separate compartment can be metered based on the flow of production fluid flowing through the sleeves of the valve assembly. For example, the annulus <b>38</b> could be be provided with a tracer compartment that is separate from the production fluid flowpath, while allowing fluid communication between the tracer compartment and the production fluid flowpath, and arranged to enable metering the tracer material being released from the tracer compartment based on flow rate(s) or volume of fluids passing through the production fluid flowpath. In some implementations, the production fluid flowpath could be similar to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>10</b></figref>, and thus be generally defined by the annulus between the sleeve and the housing with the inlet being the frac port in the housing and the outlet being a port at an uphold end of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, the separate tracer compartment <b>100</b> can be fluidly connected to the production flowpath <b>102</b> via a tracer feed conduit <b>104</b>. The tracer can be provided as a tracer liquid <b>106</b> and the driving force for forcing the tracer liquid <b>106</b> to flow from the separate tracer compartment <b>100</b> into the production flowpath <b>102</b> can be provided by a venturi system <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) or a gear pump or paddle wheel system <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). In both of these embodiments, the flow of the production fluid influences the flow rate of the tracer liquid <b>106</b> that enters the production fluid. By coupling the production flow rate with the tracer liquid flow rate, certain quantification techniques (e.g., determining production flow rate from that stage) can be facilitated. In such cases, higher production flow rate causes higher tracer flow rates into the production fluid, and therefore higher tracer concentrations measured at surface can be correlated to higher production flow rates at the given stage.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The venturi system or the gear pump system can be integrated into the valve assembly in various ways. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, one example is shown where the venturi system <b>108</b> is integrated into the annulus <b>38</b> defined between the housing <b>12</b> and the top sleeve <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">It is also noted that configurations other than the venturi system and the gear pump system are possible for metering the release of tracer within the production fluid flowing through the valve assembly.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the tracer compartment can be provided in the annulus and the production port can be provided with a pressure-responsive member <b>112</b> that opens in response to elevated pressure. The pressure-responsive member <b>112</b> can include a burst disc or check valve, for example. When the production fluid exerts pressure on the tracer liquid <b>106</b>, the elevated pressure causes the pressure-responsive member <b>112</b> to open, thus allowing a bolus of the tracer to be released. The burst disc would rupture in order to allow the tracer and production fluid to flow, while the check valve would open above a certain pressure level.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The tracer material can be one or more of the following:</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Water/Oil Tracers</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Esters, alcohols, carboxylic acids, benzene sulfonic acids, halogenated benzene, sulfonic acids, polyaromatic sulfonates, halogenated benzoic acids, halogenated benzoic aldehyde, halogenated benzoic alkylaldeydes, fluorophores, thiocyanates, nitrates, iodides, bromides, alcohols, kentones, metal cyanides (e.g., Co(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x2212;</sup>; Ni(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>; Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>; Au(CN)<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Au(CN)<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>)), magnetic nanoparticles, any of the above compounds tagged with 13C atoms, any of the above compounds tagged with deuterium, heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O); tritiated water, alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, etc., optionally tagged with 13C atoms; alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, etc., optionally tagged with deuterium; amides, amines, optionally tagged with <b>15</b>N; metal cyanides, metal cyanides tagged with <b>15</b>N; nitrate- and nitrite-containing compounds optionally tagged with <b>15</b>N; iodine-containing compounds optionally tagged with 1311 or 1251; bromine-containing compounds tagged with 82Br; cobalt-containing compounds optionally tagged with 58C or 57C; sodium-containing compounds optionally tagged with 22Na or 24Na; iron-containing compounds tagged with 59Fe; sulfur-containing compounds tagged with <b>34</b>S.

For example, one or more oligonucleotides could be deployed in the tracer compartment. RNA or DNA molecules could be used. These types of tracers have a benefit of having low detection levels and therefore smaller volumes of the tracer is required. This low level detection feature can also be beneficial when used in valve assemblies that have a tracer compartment that is relatively limited in volume (e.g., when it is defined in the annulus between the sleeve and the housing, as in the figures), as lower tracer volumes results in greater free volume for fluid flow through the second fluid flow path. The oligonucleotides can be small fragments having up to 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 residues, for example, or can be larger molecules. The sequences of the oligonucleotides can be provided such that different ones are provided for each valve assembly of each stage of each wellbore, although other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Turning back to the figures, preferably, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> is defined between the inner surface of the housing <b>12</b> and the outer surface of the top sleeve <b>34</b>, as illustrated. However, the tracer compartment could also be defined by other structures that are disposed within the annulus, if desired. The tracer compartment is preferably defined as an annular volume with substantially constant area over its length, as illustrated, although it could be designed to have various other configurations and shapes.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some implementations, the tracer material can be soluble in at least one component of the production fluid (e.g., oil or water or gas), such that fluid flow during production recovers tracer material from the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. More specifically, the tracer material can include at least one of a water-soluble tracer material, a hydrocarbon-soluble tracer material and a gas-soluble tracer material, among others. Therefore, it should be understood that components and phases of the production fluid can be determined based on the type of tracer material recovered at surface. In some implementations, each stage of the wellbore has a valve assembly that is provided with at least one unique tracer material that is not present in any other valve assembly or stage, such that recovery and analysis of that unique tracer material can allow identification of the stage from which fluid or phase was recovered. It is appreciated that any suitable or known type of tracer material can be used, such as radioisotope tracers (e.g., deuterium), radioactive tracers, fluorescent tracers and/or chemical tracers, for example. Polynucleotide tracer materials, such as DNA-based tracers, can also be used and can be particularly suitable for lowering the required detection levels (e.g., to less than parts-per-billion or trillion levels), which can consequently reduce the amount of tracer material needed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The tracer material can be provided in the form of strips, rings, or coatings comprising the tracer material <b>45</b> disposed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. The strips <b>45</b> can be adhered to the outer surface of the top sleeve <b>34</b>, the inner surface of the top barrel <b>24</b>, or a combination thereof, such that fluid flowing through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> contacts the strips <b>45</b> and recovers tracer material. In some implementations, the strips <b>45</b> are disposed substantially parallel to one another about the top sleeve <b>34</b> and can be further parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sleeve <b>34</b>. Alternatively, the strips <b>45</b> can be formed as rings surrounding the top sleeve <b>34</b> or coiled about the top sleeve <b>34</b> which can control (e.g., restrict) fluid flow through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> while increasing the amount of tracer material installed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. The strips can have a thickness that is substantially the same as the annulus, thereby filling the annulus along their length. Alternatively, the strips could have a thickness that is less than that of the annulus in order to provide a space in between the top surface of the strips and the opposing surface (e.g., the inner surface of the housing).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The strips <b>45</b> of tracer material can also be provided within recesses formed in the walls of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> (e.g., in the top sleeve <b>34</b> or in the top barrel <b>24</b> of the housing) such that the strips <b>45</b> are at least partially embedded therein. As such, the walls, in combination with the embedded strips, can have a substantially flat surface throughout the tracer compartment <b>42</b> in order to facilitate fluid flow therethrough. In other words, the top surface of the strips of tracer material can be substantially co-planar, or contiguous, with the outer surface of the top sleeve <b>34</b>. In some implementations, at least some of the strips <b>45</b> can have a thickness extending within the flow area of the annulus <b>38</b> in order to act as flow straighteners, for example, although other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some implementations, each strip <b>45</b> or subgroup of strips can include a different type of tracer material. For example, some strips can include water-soluble tracer material, and other strips can include hydrocarbon-soluble tracer material. Moreover, the plurality of strips <b>45</b> can be disposed about the top sleeve <b>34</b> in order to alternate between the different types of tracer materials. Alternatively, the top half of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> (e.g., circumferentially) can be provided with hydrocarbon-soluble tracer material, and the bottom half can be provided with water-soluble tracer material, or vice-versa. It should be noted that the strips <b>45</b> of tracer material can be disposed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b> in any suitable manner in order to allow the production fluid to recover tracer material during production.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Alternatively, or additionally, the tracer material can include a substantially uniform coating of tracer material provided within the tracer compartment <b>42</b> (e.g., within the annulus <b>38</b>). The tracer coating can be provided to have a substantially uniform thickness and composition over its application area, for example. This can facilitate production fluid to have a generally constant contact area with the tracer material to promote quantifiable recovery of the tracer. The coating can have a thickness between about 0.02 inches and about 0.12 inches, although other thicknesses are possible. The coating can be applied conformally over the applied surface to provide a constant thickness and a particular surface area that can be defined as substantially cylindrical, for example. It should thus be understood that the thickness of the coating of tracer material can gradually decrease as tracer material is recovered by the production fluid, consequently reducing the cross-sectional flow area of the tracer compartment. In some embodiments, the reduction of the cross-sectional flow area is less than about 10%, although it is appreciated that other configurations are possible. The coating can be provided over a surface area within the tracer compartment that is subject to similar or constant fluid flow conditions, to further control the conditions for facilitating quantification analyses. Furthermore, in some implementations, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> can be provided with a plurality of coatings of tracer material, whereby each coating includes a different type of tracer material (e.g., hydrocarbon-soluble, water-soluble or gas-soluble, among others). In a similar fashion to the strips <b>45</b>, the coatings of tracer material can be disposed side-by-side and alternate about the top sleeve <b>34</b> within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the plurality of coatings can be superposed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, although other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In yet another alternative implementation, the tracer material can be provided in channels (not shown) provided along or about the top sleeve <b>34</b> and extending through the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. Each channel can be provided with a unique tracer (e.g., water-soluble or oil-soluble, among others) and be selectively opened and closed. For example, each channel can include an access mechanism to allow fluid flow therethrough for controlling the amount of production fluid being produced at any given time, and for controlling the type of tracer being recovered. Alternatively, the production fluid pathway can define a path leading to a single channel at a time, and the channels can be configured to align with the production fluid pathway via rotation thereof for example. By rotating the channel-system, a given channel can be selected to align with the production fluid pathway so that production fluid flows only through that selected channel, thereby receiving only the unique tracer that is present in that channel. When a new tracer is desired, the channel-system can be rotated to align another channel with the production fluid pathway so that the new tracer is released into the production fluid. In this manner, a system that includes multiple channels can be used to rotationally &#x201c;dial&#x201d; the system to the desired tracer at different points in time and depending on various factors. The production fluid pathway can also be configured so that it can align with a single tracer channel at a time, and it can thus be constructed as part of the annulus, for example.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Regarding the deployment of the tracer material within the tracer compartment, various methods can be used. For example, the tracer material can be bonded to or within a carrier or matrix, which can in turn be disposed within the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. In some implementations, the matrix can be a polymer matrix, which can be formulated and provided so that the production fluid flowing along the production fluid pathway effectively weakens the bonds between the tracer material and the matrix in order to cause the release of molecules of tracer material for recovery to surface. The released molecules of tracer material can then be analyzed to determine certain variables, such as the component of the production fluid (e.g., determine if the fluid contains hydrocarbons and/or water) and/or flow rates of each fluid component. The matrix can be made of one or more polymeric materials, such as polyurethane, epoxy or polystyrene, for example. The polymer matrix and its association with the tracer material can be provided such that the tracer material is released at a generally known rate under certain fluid conditions. In some implementations, the tracer release rate can be determined experimentally, and calibration curves can be developed in advance of deployment, to facilitate analyses during operation. The tracer material can be associated with or supported by the matrix in various ways, including covalent bonds, adsorption, entrapment, etc. The polymer matrix can be designed such that it retains its general structure during release of the tracer material, or such that it dissolves or disintegrates in order to release the tracer material.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In another possible implementation, the tracer material could be entrapped within carrier chambers that are located in the tracer compartment, where the carrier chambers are made of a material that dissolves or disintegrates at a known rate in response to certain fluid conditions (e.g., composition, flow). The carrier chambers could be provided with different disintegration properties, such that the detection of a certain tracer at surface would indicate that a certain carrier chamber has broken down and, therefore, certain fluid conditions are present at that particular stage. In this scenario, the predetermined properties of the carrier chamber material could facilitate quantification rather than predetermined properties of the particular tracer material itself.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">It should thus be understood that the valve assembly <b>10</b> can be used as a diagnostic tool during production of the reservoir via the wellbore. More specifically, when a wellbore starts to produce greater amounts of water, the recovered tracer material can be analyzed to determine which stage of the wellbore is producing water, and the necessary means can be deployed to reduce the amount of water being produced. For example, the valve assembly <b>10</b> corresponding to the stage over-producing water can be moved to a closed or semi-closed or choked configuration to cease or reduce production.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, various implementations of a valve assembly <b>10</b> comprising a single valve sleeve <b>30</b> are shown. The single valve sleeve <b>30</b> can be slidably mounted within the housing <b>12</b> for moving axially therealong (i.e., sliding or shifting along inner surfaces of the housing within the passage <b>14</b>). Similar to previously described implementations, the single valve sleeve is operable between a closed position, an open position and a tracing position. Moreover, the tracer compartment <b>42</b> can be defined between the housing <b>12</b> and the valve sleeve <b>30</b> provided therein. Referring more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>19</b></figref>, in this implementation the valve assembly <b>10</b> includes a bypassing mechanism <b>50</b> adapted to establish fluid communication between the reservoir and the tracer compartment <b>42</b> while the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is in any one of the open, closed and tracing positions. However, and as will be described further below, the bypassing mechanism <b>50</b> can be adapted to prevent fluid communication between the frac ports <b>26</b> and the tracer compartment <b>42</b> during certain operations.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some implementations, the bypassing mechanism <b>50</b> illustratively includes a plurality of shunts <b>52</b> extending between the frac ports <b>26</b> and the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, therefore establishing fluid communication therebetween. The shunts <b>52</b> can be substantially tubular, each having a shunt inlet communicating with one or more frac ports <b>26</b>, a shunt outlet communicating with the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, and an inner passage allowing fluid flow therethrough and extending between the frac ports <b>26</b> and the tracer compartment <b>42</b> along the outer surface of the housing <b>12</b>. By positioning the shunts along the outer surface of the housing <b>12</b>, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> can have a generally tubular shape with a constant cross-sectional area along its length (i.e., the inner and/or outer diameters of the valve sleeve does not vary along its length).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref>, the valve sleeve is in the closed position, with the body of the valve sleeve occluding the frac ports <b>26</b>. It should thus be understood that, when in the closed position, production of fluids from the reservoir via the frac ports <b>26</b> and injection of fluids into the reservoir via the frac ports <b>26</b> are prevented. In addition, while in the closed position, the uphole and downhole ends of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> are similarly blocked by the valve sleeve <b>30</b> in order to contain the tracer material therein and prevent fluids flowing along the passage <b>14</b> to contact the tracer material.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The valve sleeve <b>30</b> can be shifted downhole for operating the valve sleeve <b>30</b> in the open position, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. As such, fluid communication is established between the passage <b>14</b> and the reservoir for either production or injection purposes.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In this implementation, each shunt <b>52</b> of the bypassing mechanism <b>50</b> can be provided with a flow regulator (not shown) configured to prevent fluid flow in at least one direction along the shunts <b>52</b>. For example, the flow regulators can be check valves configured to prevent fluids from flowing from the tracer compartment <b>42</b>, along the shunts <b>52</b>, and into the frac ports <b>26</b> and reservoir. It is thus noted that fluid can typically flow along the shunts <b>52</b> during production operations as fluids enters the frac ports <b>26</b> from the reservoir. When in the open configuration, regular production operations can be initiated, effectively producing fluids through the frac ports <b>26</b> and up to surface. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the downhole end of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> remains sealed by the valve sleeve <b>30</b>, therefore preventing tracer material to be carried to surface by production fluids which have entered the tracer compartment <b>42</b> via the shunt <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Moving the valve sleeve <b>30</b> to the tracing position effectively establishes fluid communication between the tracer compartment <b>42</b> and the passage <b>14</b>. In this implementation, and as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shifted uphole in order to block the frac ports <b>26</b> while also uncovering the downhole end of the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. It should be understood that blocking the frac ports <b>26</b> during production operations can effectively force all of the production fluids to flow through the shunts <b>52</b>, and thus through the tracer compartment <b>42</b> for entraining tracer material. The downhole end of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> is illustratively in communication with the passage <b>14</b>, such that fluids flowing towards the surface along the passage <b>14</b> can drag production fluids from the tracer compartment <b>42</b> into the passage <b>14</b> (e.g., create a venturi-type delivery system). It is appreciated that production fluids flowing into the tracer compartment <b>42</b> via the shunts <b>52</b> flow in a downhole direction prior to flowing into the passage <b>14</b>, and finally uphole towards the surface.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> to <b>22</b></figref>, another implementation of the valve assembly <b>10</b> comprising a single valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shown. In this implementation, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shaped and configured to block the frac ports <b>26</b> and seal the tracer compartment <b>42</b> when in the closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>), open the frac ports <b>26</b> and maintain the tracer compartment <b>42</b> sealed when in the open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), and establish fluid communication between the reservoir and the tracer compartment <b>42</b> when in the tracing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). The valve assembly <b>10</b> can include retaining mechanisms (e.g., sealing rings <b>36</b>, shear pins, etc.) adapted to prevent, or at least reduce, axial displacement of the valve sleeve <b>30</b> within the housing <b>12</b> prior to shifting the sleeve using a shifting tool, for example.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the uphole portion of the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shaped and sized to cover the frac ports <b>26</b> when in the closed position. Therefore, to uncover the frac ports <b>26</b>, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shifted downhole in the open position, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. The uphole portion remains engaged with the interior surface of the housing <b>12</b> to maintain the tracer compartment <b>42</b> sealed and isolated from fluid flowing into the frac ports <b>26</b> and along the passage <b>14</b>. In this implementation, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> includes an inlet portion <b>40</b> having a reduced diameter such that, when in the tracing position, the inlet portion <b>40</b> is positioned opposite the frac ports <b>26</b> to facilitate the inflow of fluid within the tracer compartment <b>42</b> during production. In this implementation, the inlet portion <b>40</b> is provided proximate the uphole end of the valve sleeve <b>30</b>, such that shifting the valve sleeve uphole effectively positions the inlet portion <b>40</b> opposite the frac ports <b>26</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. Therefore, it is appreciated that production fluids can enter the housing <b>12</b> through the frac ports <b>26</b> and flow into the tracer compartment <b>42</b> via the inlet portion <b>40</b> provided at the uphole end of the valve sleeve <b>30</b>. The production fluid then flows along the tracer compartment <b>42</b> in a downhole direction (i.e., towards the downhole end of the tracer compartment <b>42</b>) into the passage <b>14</b>. Once in the passage <b>14</b>, production fluids containing tracer material are produced uphole towards surface.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In other implementations, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b> and <b>24</b></figref>, the valve assembly <b>10</b> can include a single valve sleeve <b>30</b> operable in a similar manner as previously described. For example, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> can be operated in a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>), where the frac ports <b>26</b> are occluded and the tracer compartment <b>42</b> is sealed within the housing <b>12</b>, an open position to enable fracturing operations (not shown here), and a tracing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>) where fluid communication between the tracer compartment <b>42</b> and the passage <b>14</b> is established. However, in this implementation, and as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the valve sleeve <b>30</b> is shifted downhole in order to be operated in the tracing position, with the uphole end of the tracer compartment <b>42</b> opening into the passage <b>14</b> of the valve. It should be noted that, in this implementation, production fluid does not flow directly through the tracer compartment <b>42</b>. Therefore, tracer material can enter the passage <b>14</b>, to be produced along with production fluids, by any suitable method, such as by diffusion or any of the previously described mechanisms (e.g., a venturi-type system).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">It will be appreciated from the foregoing disclosure that there is provided a valve assembly, which can define two mutually isolated fluid pathways for respectively fracturing the wellbore and tracing the production fluid. The valve assembly further allows for each stage of the wellbore to be monitored and diagnosed for the production of water, for example, during production of the wellbore. The monitoring enabled by the valve assembly and associated methods can facilitate qualitative determinations (e.g., whether or not water is being produced by a certain stage; whether or not oil or any fluids are being produced by a certain stage, etc.). In some implementations, the monitoring includes quantitative analyses of flow rates and fluid composition to provide a more detailed assessment regarding the production at one or more stages. The quantitative analyses can be facilitated by providing controlled and pre-determined geometries and flow conditions within the tracer compartment, as well as correlations or relationships between variables&#x2014;such as tracer type, desorption rates, flow rates, fluid compositions, etc., based on the detected tracer concentrations in the production fluid.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The above-described valve assembly allows for providing tracer material in a frac sleeve device such that the tracer is pre-installed within the well, rather than pumped downhole into the formation from surface. The valve assembly therefore prevents tracer particulates from settling out in the surface equipment, and further prevents (or at least reduces) the risk of contamination of the tracer material since it can remain sealed within the tracer compartment prior to production. Additionally, the use of tracer material having low detection levels (e.g., oligonucleotides) can enable smaller volumes of tracer being used and increasing the lifespan of the tracer within the compartment.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">It is also noted that, for disclosure purposes, the figures can be viewed as disclosing relative sizes and proportions of the components illustrated therein.
