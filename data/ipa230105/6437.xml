If the excess current flows continuously, the power converter is damaged by energization of large current.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Then, previously, when excess current flows, damage of the electrical components is prevented by fusing a current fuse (a tube fuse), the tube fuse is installed in a part through which the short-circuit current of apparatus flows, and the tube fuse is fused by a larger current value than the rated current of apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unlike the tube fuse, a part of circuit board pattern is formed by a wiring pattern thinner than others, this thin wiring pattern part is fused at the short circuit of an electrical component or a closed circuit, and current is broken (for example, JP 2000-3662A).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the technology of JP 2000-3662 A targets the commercial power. Since the commercial power is AC current, the zero point of current exists. Accordingly, even if the arc discharge is generated after fusing of the thin wiring pattern part, when current becomes the zero point, the arc discharge disappears and current is broken. However, in the case of DC current, since the zero point of current does not exist, after fusing of the thin wiring pattern part, the arc discharge is continuously generated and the current continuously flows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the technology of JP 2000-3662 A, since the thin wiring pattern part is provided in the outer layer of the circuit board, the fused material scatters to other circuits at fusing, and there is a possibility of damaging the electrical component.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Then, in the case where the breaking mechanism of excess current is formed by a circuit pattern of a circuit board, the purpose of the present disclosure is to provide a power converter and a breaking mechanism which can break a DC current and can suppress that a fused material scatter to other circuits at fusing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A power converter according to the present disclosure, including:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a semiconductor element;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a breaking mechanism that breaks current when excessive current flows; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a wiring member that connects the semiconductor element and the breaking mechanism,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the breaking mechanism is provided with<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a multilayer circuit board in which a plurality of conductive patterns including a fuse pattern which fuses when excessive current flows and a plurality of insulating members are laminated, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a support member which is provided with a support body part; a fixation projection part which projected from the support body part to the multilayer circuit board side and to which the multilayer circuit board was fixed; and a support projection part which projected from the support body part to the multilayer circuit board side and supports an one side circuit board face of the multilayer circuit board,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">wherein the fuse pattern is provided in an inner layer of the multilayer circuit board, and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">wherein the support projection part overlaps with at least one part of a fusing part of the fuse pattern, viewing in a normal direction of the circuit board face of the multilayer circuit board.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">A breaking mechanism that breaks current when excessive current flows according to the present disclosure, the breaking mechanism including:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">a multilayer circuit board in which a plurality of conductive patterns including a fuse pattern which fuses when excessive current flows and a plurality of insulating members are laminated, and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">a supporting member which is provided with a support body part; a fixation projection part which projected from the support body part to the multilayer circuit board side and to which the multilayer circuit board was fixed; and a support projection part which projected from the support body part to the multilayer circuit board side and supports an one side circuit board face of the multilayer circuit board,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">wherein the fuse pattern is provided in an inner layer of the multilayer circuit board, and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">wherein the support projection part overlaps with at least one part of a fusing part of the fuse pattern, viewing in a normal direction of the circuit board face of the multilayer circuit board.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">According to the power converter and the breaking mechanism of the present disclosure, the arc discharge may be generated after the fuse pattern fuses by excess current. The fuse pattern is disposed in the inner layer and is surrounded by the insulating member of the multilayer circuit board. Therefore, the arc discharge is limited in the space within the insulating member, and the cross-section area of the arc discharge does not become large. Decomposition gas is emitted from the insulating member by exposing the insulating member of the multilayer circuit board to the arc discharge. By the decomposition gas, the cross-section area of the arc discharge becomes smaller than the cross-section area of the space within the insulating member (the ablation effect). As a result, a resistance value of the arc discharge in inverse proportion to the cross-section area of the arc discharge becomes high, and the arc voltage becomes high. Therefore, the arc discharge current which is generated after fusing can be decreased gradually, and the DC current can be broken. Since the fuse pattern is provided in the inner layer, it can be suppressed that the fused material of the fuse pattern and the like scatter to other circuits.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">Since high energy is generated inside the multilayer circuit board when the fuse pattern fuses, the fuse pattern and the insulating member exfoliate and the space where the fusing part is provided may be expanded. The cross-section area of the arc discharge becomes large, and the arc discharge cannot be broken. The part of the multilayer circuit board where the fusing part generating force at fusing was provided can be pressed also from the other side circuit board face side by the support projection part, and the multilayer circuit board can be suppressed effectively from exfoliating due to the force generated at fusing. And, since the fixation projection part and the support projection part are provided, the multilayer circuit board can be supported while spacing from the support body part, and it is easy to secure the insulation between the fuse pattern and the like and the support member at fusing and at un-fusing. The support projection part can support intensively the part of the multilayer circuit board where the fusing part was provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of the power converter according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of each layer of the multilayer circuit board according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the B-B cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a circuit diagram explaining the short-circuit current according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a figure explaining the characteristics of the arc voltage of the fuse part of the outer layer and the fuse part of the inner layer according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view of each layer of the multilayer circuit board according to Embodiment 2;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> according to Embodiment 2;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the B-B cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> according to Embodiment 2;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to Embodiment 3;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a plan views of the breaking mechanism according to Embodiment 4;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> according to Embodiment 4;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the B-B cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> according to Embodiment 4;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the C-C cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> according to Embodiment 4;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a plan views of the breaking mechanism according to Embodiment 5;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> according to Embodiment 5;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the B-B cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> according to Embodiment 5;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the breaking mechanism according to other embodiments;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref> are a plan view of the shape of the fuse part according to other embodiments;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to other embodiments;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the multilayer circuit board cut at the A-A cross section position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to other embodiments;
