The processes utilize diffusion between a region undergoing a polymerization reaction preferentially polymerizing one monomer component and an unreactive region. Diffusion and subsequent/concurrent polymerization results in a higher concentration of the more reactive monomer component in the reacting region and a higher concentration of the less reactive monomer components in the unreactive region. The unreactive region may be later polymerized. In embodiments, photopolymerization is used and the regions are generated by a mask or other mechanism to pattern the light.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="204.72mm" wi="90.42mm" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="259.42mm" wi="160.95mm" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="261.11mm" wi="183.56mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="265.01mm" wi="174.33mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="265.51mm" wi="175.43mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="257.81mm" wi="126.49mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="255.44mm" wi="132.93mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="266.02mm" wi="180.42mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002529A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

To achieve these objectives, orthodontic appliances such as braces, retainers, shell aligners, and the like can be applied to the patient's teeth by an orthodontic practitioner. The appliance is configured to exert force on one or more teeth in order to effect desired tooth movements. The application of force can be periodically adjusted by the practitioner (e.g., by altering the appliance or using different types of appliances) in order to incrementally reposition the teeth to a desired arrangement. There remains a need for improved dental appliance fabrication.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure provides methods, systems, and devices for the generation of composite materials from a single resin using light exposure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various aspects, the present disclosure provides a process for making a composite polymer composition, said process comprising the steps of: providing a light polymerizable liquid composition comprising a first polymerizable component, a second polymerizable component, and a photoinitiator, wherein the light polymerizable liquid composition is characterized by a liquid ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component; generating a first polymer region having a first ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component by exposing the light polymerizable liquid composition to a first exposure of light characterized by a first exposure region; and polymerizing the light polymerizable liquid composition in a second region different than the first region and adjacent to, contacting, or overlapping with the first exposure region, wherein the second region has a second ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component, and wherein the liquid ratio, the first ratio, and the second ratio are different.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the light polymerizable liquid composition is homogenous. In certain aspects, the liquid ratio has a variation, and the variation is dependent on localization. In certain aspects, the first polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the light polymerizable liquid composition. In some aspects, the second polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the light polymerizable liquid composition.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain aspects, the first ratio is greater than the liquid ratio, and the liquid ratio is greater than the second ratio. In some aspects, the first ratio is greater than the second ratio, and the second ratio is greater than the liquid ratio. In certain aspects, the second ratio is greater than the liquid ratio, and the liquid ratio is greater than the first ratio. In some aspects, the second ratio is greater than the first ratio, and the first ratio is greater than the liquid ratio.

More specifically, in some aspects, the present disclosure relates to methods, systems, devices, and kits for forming composite materials having structure, wherein the structure is generated using 3D printing techniques and light exposure. In certain aspects, the methods utilize diffusion between a first region undergoing a polymerization reaction, wherein one monomer component is preferentially polymerized, and a second region wherein the monomer component less polymerized. In certain embodiments, the first region is a three-dimensional space. In some embodiments, the second region is a three-dimensional space. In preferred embodiments, the first region is defined by a 3 dimensional X,Y,Z-space. In another embodiment, the second region is defined by a 3 dimensional X,Y,Z-space.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, the first region has an aspect ratio. In some embodiments, the second region has an aspect ratio. In some embodiments, both the first region and the second region have an aspect ratio. In some embodiments, the aspect ratio is greater than 1. In some embodiments, the aspect ratio comprises a diameter-width aspect ratio. In other embodiments the aspect ratio comprises a cube-volume aspect ratio.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Composite Components</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Diffusion and subsequent and/or concurrent polymerization results in a higher concentration of the more reactive monomer component in the reactive first region and a higher concentration of the less reactive monomer components in the unreactive second region. The monomer components in the unreactive region may later be polymerized. In some embodiments, photopolymerization is used and the regions are generated by patterning the light. In certain embodiments, a mask is used to pattern the light. In some embodiments, a reactive region is characterized by exposure to light, while an unreactive region is characterized by a decreased or minimized exposure to light.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Polymer composites may have enhanced physical properties when compared with homopolymers of similar monomer species. For example, a composite with a first polymer having high strength (e.g., storage modulus) and a second polymer having high flexibility can result in a composite with higher toughness than a homopolymer of either monomer species.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the polymer is a molecule composed of repeating structural units connected by covalent chemical bonds characterized by a substantial number of repeating units. In some embodiments, a polymer comprises equal to or greater than 10 repeating units. In certain embodiments, a polymer comprises equal to or greater than 50 repeating units. In some embodiments, a polymer comprises equal to or greater than 100 repeating units. In some embodiments, a polymer has a high molecular weight (e.g., greater than or equal to 10,000 Da). Polymers are commonly the polymerization product of one or more monomer precursors. In certain embodiments, a polymer is a homopolymer, wherein the polymer backbone consists of a single repeating monomer subunit. In some embodiments, a polymer is a copolymer, wherein the polymer comprises two or more different types of monomers linked in the same polymer. Copolymers may comprise two or more monomer subunits, and include random, block, alternating, segmented, grafted, tapered, and other copolymers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, a plurality of monomeric units form an oligomer, and the oligomer is composed of repeating structural units connected by covalent chemical bonds which can be characterized by a number of repeating units less than that of a polymer (e.g., equal to or less than 10 repeating units) and/or a lower molecular weights (e.g., less than or equal to 10,000 Da) than polymers. In some embodiments, oligomers are the polymerization product of one or more monomer precursors.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In certain embodiments, a polymer is formed via a polymerization reaction of polymer precursors. In some embodiments, a resin is a viscous substance comprising polymer precursors. In some embodiments, a resin can comprise a plurality of monomer components, which can be selectively activated to form polymers (e.g., they are polymerizable components). The monomer components within the resin may undergo polymerization to form a polymer. In some embodiments, a resin comprises more than one type of monomer component. In preferred embodiments, a resin comprises a first monomer component that is more reactive than a second monomer component. In some embodiments, a resin comprises a third monomer component that can undergo polymerization.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, a resin is a light polymerizable liquid composition. The resin can comprise a first polymerizable component, a second polymerizable component, and a photoinitiator. In some embodiments the resin has a liquid ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component. In some embodiments, the liquid ratio is the same throughout the resin (e.g., a homogenous resin). In certain embodiments, the liquid ratio has localized characteristics, wherein the ratio depends on the location in the resin that the ratio is determined. As a non-limiting example, differences in density and/or immiscibility may cause separation of polymerizable components into sections, wherein one localized point of the resin can comprise a liquid ratio that is different from the liquid ratio of a different localized point within the resin. In some embodiments the resin is exposed to a region of light (a first exposure region), which can initiate polymerization and generate a first polymer region. The first polymer region has a first ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component. The light exposure in the first exposure region can activate the polymerization of a first polymer. In some embodiments, the first polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the resin, the second polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the resin, both the first and the second polymerizable components can diffuse freely through the resin, the first polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the first polymer, the second polymerizable component can diffuse freely through the first polymer, or both the first and the second polymerizable components can diffuse freely through the first polymer.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the polymerizable components can diffuse through the resin during the polymerization of the first polymer region, thus increasing or decreasing the amount of polymerizable component in the region. As a non-limiting example, the light activated polymerization of the first polymerizable component into the first polymer in the first polymer region, combined with diffusion of the components, can result in the migration of first polymerizable components into the first polymer region, thus increasing the first ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component within the first polymer region, while decreasing the ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component in a second region (the second ratio). In some embodiments, the second region is adjacent to, contacting, or overlapping with the first exposure region, and the second region is different from the first region. In certain embodiments, the resin ratio (the liquid ratio), the first region ratio, and the second region ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component are different.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As a non-limiting example, a resin comprising a ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component of 1:1 can undergo photoinitiated polymerization in a first exposure region. A first polymer is formed from the first polymerizable material, and diffusion results in an increased amount of the first polymerizable material within the first exposure region. Following the photoinitiated polymerization, the first region has a first polymerizable component to second polymerizable component ratio (the first ratio) of 2:1. A second region that was not exposed to light has a first polymerizable component to second polymerizable component ratio (the second ratio) of 1:2. Accordingly, the first ratio (2:1) is greater than the resin ratio (1:1), and the resin ratio is greater than the second ratio (1:2).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the resin ratio is greater than either the first ratio or the second ratio. As a non-limiting example, a resin comprising a ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component of 1:1 can undergo photoinitiated polymerization in a first exposure region. A first polymer is formed using a third polymerizable component, which causes diffusion of the first polymerizable component out of the first region. The first region has a first polymerizable component to second polymerizable component ratio of 1:2. A second exposure of light to a second region can activate polymerization of the second polymerizable component into a second polymer, and can cause diffusion of the first polymerizable component out of the second polymer region. The second polymer region has a first polymerizable component to second polymerizable component ratio of 1:3. The first polymerizable component can optionally diffuse into a third polymer region, having an increased ratio of the first polymer component to the second polymer component. Accordingly, the resin ratio (1:1) is greater than the first ratio (1:2), and the first ratio is greater than the second ratio (1:3).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments the resin has a ratio of the first polymerizable component to the second polymerizable component of from 1:1 to 1:100,000, from 1:1 to 1:10,000, from 1:1 to 1:5,000, from 1:1 to 1:2,500, from 1:1 to 1:1,000, from 1:1 to 1:500, from 1:1 to 1:100, from 1:1 to 1:50, from 1:1 to 1:30, from 1:1 to 1:20, from 1:1.5 to 1:10,000, from 1:1.5 to 1:5,000, from 1:1.5 to 1:2,500, from 1:1.5 to 1:1,000, from 1:1.5 to 1:500, from 1:1.5 to 1:100, from 1:1.5 to 1:50, from 1:1.5 to 1:30, from 1:1.5 to 1:20, from 1:5 to 1:10,000, from 1:5 to 1:5,000, from 1:5 to 1:2,500, from 1:5 to 1:1,000, from 1:5 to 1:500, from 1:5 to 1:100, from 1:5 to 1:50, from 1:5 to 1:30, from 1:5 to 1:20, from 1:10 to 1:10,000, from 1:10 to 1:5,000, from 1:10 to 1:2,500, from 1:10 to 1:1,000, from 1:10 to 1:500, from 1:10 to 1:100, from 1:10 to 1:50, from 1:10 to 1:30, from 1:10 to 1:20, from 100,000:1 to 1:1, from 10,000:1 to 1:1, from 5,000:1 to 1:1, from 2,500:1 to 1:1, from 1,000:1 to 1:1, from 500:1 to 1:1, from 100:1 to 1:1.

In some embodiments, the reactive region (the first region) is characterized by being exposed to a source of radiation during an initial exposure. In certain embodiments, the unreactive region (the second region) is not exposed to the source of radiation during an initial exposure.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In certain embodiments, diffusion of resin components takes place. In some embodiments, the first monomer component and the second monomer component diffuse through the first polymer during the polymerization of the first polymer. In some embodiments, as the first monomer components are polymerized into the first polymer, diffusion of the first monomer component slows. In certain embodiments, only the second monomer component undergoes diffusion through the first polymer. In some embodiments, the diffusion creates regions having higher concentration of components. For example, a region-specific polymerization reaction that polymerizes a first monomer component but not a second monomer component would produce the first polymer in the specific regions, while the second monomer component diffused toward other regions. Accordingly, a region of the composite material may comprise greater than 0.1% of a first monomer component, greater than 5% of a first monomer component, greater than 10% of a first monomer component, greater than 20% of a first monomer component, greater than 30% of a first monomer component, greater than 40% of a first monomer component, greater than 50% of a first monomer component, greater than 60% of a first monomer component, greater than 70% of a first monomer component, greater than 80% of a first monomer component, greater than 90% of a first monomer component, or greater than 95% of a first monomer component by weight.

In certain embodiments, a composite material undergoes copolymerization based on exposure to a source of radiation. In certain embodiments, diffusion of resin components takes place wherein the first monomer component and the second monomer component diffuse through the resin during the polymerization to form a copolymer comprising the first monomer component and the second monomer component. Accordingly, selective polymerization can provide regions comprising a copolymer, while regions that are not exposed to the source of radiation comprise less to no copolymer. In some embodiments, the diffusion creates regions having higher concentration of components or copolymer. For example, a region-specific polymerization reaction that polymerizes a first monomer component and a second monomer component would produce the copolymer in the specific regions, while other resin components diffused toward other regions. The first monomer component and the second monomer component may partially or fully undergo polymerization, and therefore a region of the composite material may comprise greater than 50% of a first copolymer, greater than 60% of a first copolymer, greater than 70% of a first copolymer, greater than 80% of a first copolymer, greater than 90% of a first copolymer, or greater than 95% of a first copolymer by weight.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the irradiation of a region of the resin provides a change in the percentage of monomer presence, or a corresponding change in the presence of its corresponding polymer. In certain embodiments, this enrichment of monomer components or polymer uses a source of radiation. In some embodiments, a higher percentage of one monomer component is present in a region than what would be expected by bulk cure conditions. In preferred embodiments, the percentage change is greater than 10% (mole percentage) from initial resin values. In some embodiments, the percentage change is about 5% or greater than 5% from initial resin values. In certain embodiments, the percent change is greater than 20%, greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, greater than 90%, greater than 95%, or greater than 98% (mole percentage) from initial resin values. As a non-limiting example, a resin comprising an initial amount of 60% Monomer A and 40% Monomer B is polymerized to provide a bulk copolymerized material having an average of a 60% Monomer A and 40% Monomer B in the bulk cured copolymer. In comparison, using the methods disclosed herein, a region-specific preferential polymerization of the same resin may produce a copolymer having an average composition of 50% Monomer A and 50% Monomer B, which would be a 17% decrease in the concentration of Monomer A in the region, while monomer B would experience a 25% increase in average regional copolymer composition. The percentage can be based on an initial and final molar percentage for monomer concentration in the starting monomer mix and for the monomer concentration incorporated into a copolymer for a defined region of space.

In some aspects, successive layers of material are deposited and cured in place. In some embodiments, 3D printing can be used to fabricate appliances.

In some embodiments, the orthodontic appliances herein (or portions thereof) can be produced using direct fabrication, such as additive manufacturing techniques (also referred to herein as &#x201c;3D printing&#x201d;). Additive manufacturing techniques can be categorized as follows: (1) vat photopolymerization (e.g., stereolithography), in which an object is constructed layer by layer from a vat of liquid photopolymer resin; (2) material jetting, in which material is jetted onto a build platform using either a continuous or drop on demand (DOD) approach; (3) binder jetting, in which alternating layers of a build material (e.g., a powder-based material) and a binding material (e.g., a liquid binder) are deposited by a print head; (4) fused deposition modeling (FDM), in which material is drawn though a nozzle, heated, and deposited layer by layer; (5) powder bed fusion, including but not limited to direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), electron beam melting (EBM), selective heat sintering (SHS), selective laser melting (SLM), and selective laser sintering (SLS); (6) sheet lamination, including but not limited to laminated object manufacturing (LOM) and ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM); and (7) directed energy deposition, including but not limited to laser engineering net shaping, directed light fabrication, direct metal deposition, and 3D laser cladding. For example, stereolithography can be used to directly fabricate one or more of the appliances herein. In some embodiments, stereolithography involves selective polymerization of a photosensitive resin (e.g., a photopolymer) according to a desired cross-sectional shape using light (e.g., ultraviolet light). The object geometry can be built up in a layer-by-layer fashion by sequentially polymerizing a plurality of object cross-sections. As another example, the appliances herein can be directly fabricated using selective laser sintering. In some embodiments, selective laser sintering involves using a laser beam to selectively melt and fuse a layer of powdered material according to a desired cross-sectional shape in order to build up the object geometry. As yet another example, the appliances herein can be directly fabricated by fused deposition modeling. In some embodiments, fused deposition modeling involves melting and selectively depositing a thin filament of thermoplastic polymer in a layer-by-layer manner in order to form an object. In yet another example, material jetting can be used to directly fabricate the appliances herein. In some embodiments, material jetting involves jetting or extruding one or more materials onto a build surface in order to form successive layers of the object geometry. Any of these additive manufacturing methods can be used in conjunction with the present invention; for example, by applying light at some portion of the process to cure the material being deposited.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">Alternatively or in combination, the appliance can be fabricated with machining such as an appliance fabricated from a block of material with computer numeric control machining.

For example, in some embodiments, instructions can be configured to cause direct fabrication of both the shell and the integrally formed component using a resin comprising both the first monomer component and the second monomer component. Selective application of light to one of the shell or the integrally formed component, in accordance with techniques disclosed herein, can produce polymer compositions of the shell and integrally formed component that differ in their respective percentages of first and second monomer components. For example, the shell can have an increased (or alternatively decreased) percentage of the first monomer component relative to the one or both of the integrally formed component and the resin, and a decreased (or alternatively increased) percentage of the second monomer component relative to the one or both of the integrally formed component and the resin.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">In some embodiments, continuous direct fabrication methods for photopolymers are used herein.

Accordingly, continuous polymerization of material on the build surface can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">In some embodiments, a continuous direct fabrication method utilizes a heliolithography approach in which the liquid photopolymer is cured with focused radiation while the build platform is continuously rotated and raised. Accordingly, the object geometry can be continuously built up along a spiral build path. Such methods are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0265034, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">In certain embodiments, continuous liquid interface production of 3D objects is used herein. Such methods have been reported in J. Tumbleston et al. (Science, 2015, 347 (6228), pp 1349-1352), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for description of the process. In some embodiments, continuous direct fabrication methods involve extruding a composite material composed of a curable liquid material surrounding a solid strand. The composite material can be extruded along a continuous three-dimensional path in order to form the object.

Alternatively or in combination, direct fabrication methods that allow for continuous build-up of composite material geometry can be used, referred to herein as &#x201c;continuous direct fabrication.&#x201d; Various types of continuous direct fabrication methods can be used. As an example, in some embodiments, the appliances herein are fabricated using &#x201c;continuous liquid interphase printing,&#x201d; in which an object is continuously built up from a reservoir of photopolymerizable resin by forming a gradient of partially cured resin between the building surface of the object and a polymerization-inhibited &#x201c;dead zone.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a semi-permeable membrane is used to control transport of a photopolymerization inhibitor (e.g., oxygen) into the dead zone in order to form the polymerization gradient. Continuous liquid interphase printing can achieve fabrication speeds about 25 times to about 100 times faster than other direct fabrication methods, and speeds about 1000 times faster can be achieved with the incorporation of cooling systems. Continuous liquid interphase printing is described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2015/0097315, 2015/0097316, and 2015/0102532, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">In another example, a continuous direct fabrication method can involve extruding a composite material composed of a curable liquid material surrounding a solid strand.

In certain embodiments, the appliance is an orthodontic appliance. The properties of the material before curing may differ from the properties of the material after curing. Once cured, the materials herein can exhibit sufficient strength, stiffness, durability, biocompatibility, etc. for use in an orthodontic appliance.

For printing systems, curing parameters can include material drop size, viscosity, and/or curing power. These machine parameters can be monitored and adjusted on a regular basis (e.g., some parameters at every 1-x layers and some parameters after each build) as part of the process control on the fabrication machine. Process control can be achieved by including a sensor on the machine that measures power and other beam parameters every layer or every few seconds and automatically adjusts them with a feedback loop.

For instance, a multi-tip extrusion apparatus can be used to selectively dispense multiple types of materials from distinct material supply sources in order to fabricate an object from a plurality of different materials. Such methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,749,414, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively or in combination, a multi-material direct fabrication method can involve forming an object from multiple materials in a plurality of sequential manufacturing steps. For instance, a first portion of the object can be formed from a first material in accordance with any of the direct fabrication methods herein, then a second portion of the object can be formed from a second material in accordance with methods herein, and so on, until the entirety of the object has been formed. In some embodiments, a multi-material direct fabrication method can involve forming an object from multiple monomer components in a single resin using sequential manufacturing steps.

For instance, in contrast to indirect fabrication, direct fabrication permits production of an appliance without utilizing any molds or templates for shaping the appliance, thus reducing the number of manufacturing steps involved and improving the resolution and accuracy of the final appliance geometry. Additionally, direct fabrication permits precise control over the three-dimensional geometry of the appliance, such as the appliance thickness. Complex structures and/or auxiliary components can be formed integrally as a single piece with the appliance shell in a single manufacturing step, rather than being added to the shell in a separate manufacturing step. In some embodiments, direct fabrication is used to produce appliance geometries that would be difficult to create using alternative manufacturing techniques, such as appliances with very small or fine features, complex geometric shapes, undercuts, interproximal structures, shells with variable thicknesses, and/or internal structures (e.g., for improving strength with reduced weight and material usage). For example, in some embodiments, the direct fabrication approaches herein permit fabrication of an appliance with feature sizes of less than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m, or within a range from about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m, or within a range from about 20 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">Machine parameters can include curing parameters.

Optionally, machine parameters can be adjusted to compensate for environmental variables. Increased temperature during the light exposure stage can aid in the use of higher viscosity materials than one would normally be able to use in a vat-style process. For example, temperatures greater than 50&#xb0; C. can be useful. In some instances temperatures can range from 50&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the vat temperature can be greater than 100&#xb0; C., for resins with sufficient stability.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">In many embodiments, post-processing of appliances includes cleaning, post-curing, and/or support removal processes.

The layer or coating can be formed from one or more materials configured to provide additional functionality to the appliance. For example, the layer or coating can be formed from a moisture resistant material, e.g., in order to act as a sealant to reduce stress relaxation of the appliance associated with water absorption. As another example, the layer or coating can be formed from a material that resists or reduces staining. In another example, the layer or coating can be used to reduce friction between the appliance, the patient's teeth and/or another device. In some embodiments, a protective layer or coating is integrally formed into the occlusal surfaces of an appliance to protect the appliance, the patient's teeth, and/or another device, e.g., from grinding, pressure, and interference. In yet another example, the layer or coating can incorporate therapeutic agents or functional agents for drug delivery, flavoring, etc. The direct fabrication methods herein allow such layers or coatings to be formed with the shell in a single processing step.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Composite Materials</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0117">In some embodiments, polymer composites have enhanced physical properties when compared with homopolymers of similar monomer species.

In alternative embodiments, any of the above relationships can be reversed, that is, the second polymer can have a greater Tg than the first polymer characterized by any of the ranges disclosed above. More generally, each of the above ranges can characterize a difference between the values if Tg of the first and second polymer. Thus, the two polymers' glass transition temperatures can differ by at least 5&#xb0; C., at least 10&#xb0; C., at least 20&#xb0; C., at least 30&#xb0; C., at least 50&#xb0; C., at least 75&#xb0; C., or at least 100&#xb0; C.; or they can differ by an amount from 1&#xb0; C. to 5&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 10&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 20&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., 5&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., 10&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C., 20&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., 75&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C., or 100&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">In some embodiments, the first polymer is characterized by a storage modulus that is at least 10 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 20 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 50 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 100 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 200 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 300 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 400 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 500 MPa greater than the second polymer, at least 10 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 20 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 50 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 100 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 200 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 300 MPa less than the second polymer, at least 400 MPa less than the second polymer, or at least 500 MPa less than the second polymer.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">In some embodiments, a fracture strain or an elongation to break is the ratio between the change in length and the initial length after breakage of a composition.

As a non-limiting example, a dental appliance can be created using the composite materials disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary orthodontic appliance <b>106</b> and jaw <b>104</b> including a patient's teeth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates orthodontic appliance cross-section <b>118</b> as taken along line <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The orthodontic appliance <b>106</b> may be designed to fit over a number of teeth present in an upper or lower jaw. An exemplary orthodontic device may be manufactured as disclosed by the methods discussed herein. As illustrated, the orthodontic appliance has a U-shaped cross-section to form one or more cavities for placement of a patient's teeth therein. The methods provided herein may be used to print the dental appliance, thus affording it high modulus strength and low elasticity. For example, techniques disclosed herein may be used to manufacture orthodontic appliances similar to those presented in US Patent Application Publication 2015/0004553, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">A composite material having a high modulus and low elasticity can generate the force needed to move teeth, while a composite material having a low modulus and high elasticity material to give the composite material both good mouth feel and low breakage. Finding a single material that has both of these properties is very difficult, and using a 3D printable resin with these two contrasting capabilities has not been possible to date. In certain embodiments, a stereolithographic 3D printer is used to obtain a material that behaves like a composite material by using reactivity differences of two or more different monomers, which then leads to 3D-spatially controlled compositional differences.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">Mechanical properties of a material or structure of the appliance (e.g., stiffness, elongation, tensile strength, compressive strength, bending properties, viscoelastic properties, etc.) may be anisotropic, such that the properties are different when measured along x, y, and z directions. By changing the directionality of the structures, materials of an appliance, and/or source of radiation, varying properties can be developed along different directions (e.g., mesial-distal direction, occlusal-gingival direction, buccal-lingual direction, anterior-posterior direction, interior-exterior direction). Such variations in directionality can be achieved using the direct fabrication methods described herein, such as 3D printing.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">In some embodiments, appliances with variable localized properties are presented herein and are produced by direct fabrication. The direct fabrication techniques presented herein may be particularly suited for manufacturing of appliances with different localized properties that would otherwise be difficult to achieve with other fabrication methods (e.g., indirect fabrication methods such as thermoforming a material sheet over a mold). For instance, in some embodiments, the direct fabrication techniques herein are used to fabricate appliances exhibiting variable thicknesses, variable stiffnesses, and/or variable material compositions at different portions of the appliance. For example, variable material compositions can be varied monomer component concentration present in printed appliance, wherein the composite is formed from a single resin. Additional description of direct fabrication methods suitable for producing the appliances of the present disclosure are provided further herein.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">In some embodiments, the manufacture of a composite material derived from a single resin comprises single Vat, digital light processing (DLP), stereolithographic 3D printing, photocured material jetting, photocured fused deposition modeling (FDM), a hybrid thereof, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the process uses light intensity to direct where one material of the composite forms relative to a second material in the composite. In some embodiments, the process of using light intensity to direct the formation of material in the composition also allows for the creation of different patterns of tensile strength and modulus within the material, such as an orthodontic appliance. In some embodiments, the process directs compositional differences in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. In certain embodiments, the composite material disclosed herein could be made from a standard thermoplastic composite. The process may direct phase separation in both vertical and horizontal dimensions.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">Common current orthodontic appliance materials include composites that use a high modulus (low elongation) material sandwiched between two high elongation (low modulus) materials. This configuration allows the overall material to provide enough force (from the high modulus material) to move teeth, but does not break when inserting or removing (from the high elongation material).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">Attempts to create a material with these characteristics (high modulus and high elongation) in a homogenous material have been less than ideal in at least some aspects. Creating homogenous materials is difficult due to stress relaxation in high humidity environments. The traditional approach is to use hydrogen bonding to obtain a tough material (high modulus and high elongation), however, in moist environments, hydrogen bonded materials lose their toughness and will show increased stress relaxation. Attempts to create a 3D printable resin that is tough have also used hydrogen bonding; and consequently have provided similar high stress relaxation.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">Thus, it is desirable to create a composite structure on a 3D printer to obtain a tough material that does not require hydrogen bonding. The material may include hydrogen bonding if desired. In some embodiments, the composite material is obtained by first choosing at least two different types of monomers components that have different reactivities. In a non-limiting example, Monomer 1 prefers to react with itself more than with Monomer 2, but Monomer 2 also reacts preferentially with Monomer 1. Additionally, Monomer 1 and Monomer 2 are able to polymerize with a reasonable rate to make them applicable for 3D printing. The resulting mixture is more likely to polymerize Monomer 1 when exposed to conditions which promote polymerization, such as exposure to light and a photoinitiator.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0141">In some embodiments, Monomer 1 and Monomer 2 comprise more than one type of monomer. As a non-limiting example, monomer 1 can be a methacrylate and monomer 2 can be a mixture of thiol and allyl ether components. In this example, the methacrylate tends to react first, then the thiol-ene (the allyl ether and thiol) will copolymerize. Photoinitiators and thermal initiators, or other forms of catalysts or reactive species may be used separately or combined to initiate polymerization of monomer 1 and/or monomer 2.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">In some embodiments, the monomers are monofunctional. In certain embodiments, the monomers have a plurality of functionalities. In certain embodiments, the monomers are difunctional. In some embodiments, the monomers are trifunctional.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">In another embodiment, monomer 1 is an acrylate and monomer 2 is a methacrylate. The two monomers are mixed and a photoinitiator is added. The resin is then placed in a vat of a top down 3D printer. The choice for any given layer is a single exposure to create a homogenous material or multiple exposures per layer to create a composite material in that layer.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">In some embodiments, the photoinitiation of the polymerization reaction uses a mask or other mechanism for forming a patterned light shield for a portion of the polymerizable resin comprising monomer 1 and monomer 2. While the mask is present, an exposure of light will cause the monomer 1 to preferentially polymerize in the exposed areas. During and after the exposure, monomer 1 from areas directly adjacent to the exposed area will diffuse into the exposed area and react as long as radicals or other reactive species or catalysts are still present or are being generated. Monomer 2 will be diluted by this process and in some cases even diffuse counter to monomer 1. The result is that the first exposure generates a polymer that is has a higher incorporation of monomer 1 than of monomer 2. A second exposure can then be applied. The second exposure may be to the entire polymerizable solution, to a different masked area (with or without overlap of the first masked area) or may use a different condition to induce polymerization, such as using heat to induce thermal polymerization. In the second exposure, some regions will have a higher concentration of monomer 2 than the starting resin due to the diffusion caused by the first exposure, and the polymer that forms in those regions will have a greater incorporation of monomer 2. Accordingly, a single layer may have regions of polymer composed mostly of monomer 1, and regions of polymer composed mostly of monomer 2. In some embodiments, the resulting polymer composition comprises an even mix of monomer 1 and monomer 2, which may occur if the regions are too distant form the first exposed region for diffusion to affect the monomer concentrations. For example, resins using more than two monomers can allow for creation of regions in the layer that differ in concentration for all monomers added to the resin formulation and polymerized into a composite material.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Manufacturing Techniques and Applications</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0145">In certain embodiments, a composite may be created having a plurality of layers, wherein different layers within the plurality have different properties (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In an exemplary embodiment, a build platform is obtained having a print area as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. A homogenous resin comprising equal parts of monomer 1 and monomer 2 is positioned on the build platform, and is then exposed to an unmasked source of radiation, thus initiating polymerization to form a copolymer without diffusion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, central panel). This first layer polymer is composed equally of monomer 1 and monomer 2. A second layer of the resin is positioned on top of the first layer, and monomer 1 is preferentially polymerized by the source of radiation in a plurality of regions, with the aid of a masking pattern (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, right panel). The resulting composite material 1 has a polymer composed of a majority of monomer 1. Due to diffusion, the regions not exposed to the source of radiation are comprised mostly of monomer 2. A second exposure of the second layer uses a masking pattern that is the opposite of the first pattern used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, left panel), and is exposed to the source of radiation to form a second polymer incorporating mostly monomer 2. Accordingly, the second layer contains a composite material comprising a polymer mostly composed of monomer 1 and a second polymer mostly composed of monomer 2. A third layer is positioned on top of the second layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, central panel), and monomer 1 is preferentially polymerized by the source of radiation in a plurality of regions, with the aid of a masking pattern. Due to diffusion, the majority of monomer 2 moves to regions that have not yet been exposed to the source of radiation. Following removal of the masking device, the entire platform is exposed to the source of radiation, resulting in the polymerization of monomer 2 into a polymer comprising of mostly monomer 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, right panel). The following exposure is a blanket exposure and cures all the areas previously exposed in addition to areas not exposed. The areas next to the previously exposed regions will contain a higher concentration of monomer 2 and will thus form a polymer preferentially incorporating monomer 2. Accordingly, the third layer contains a composite material comprising a polymer mostly composed of monomer 1 and a second polymer mostly composed of monomer 2. A fourth layer is positioned on top of the third layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, left panel), and monomer 1 is preferentially polymerized by the source of radiation in a plurality of regions, with the aid of a masking pattern. The unpolymerized monomer can either be drained, polymerized by other means such as thermal treatment, or left inside the layer as liquid pockets. Later treatments can infuse a new material if desired. A fifth layer of resin is positioned on top of the fourth layer (FIG. <b>6</b>, center panel), and the entire platform is exposed, thus forming a polymer comprising nearly equal portions of monomer 1 and monomer 2. Finally, a sixth layer of resin is positioned on top of the fifth layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, right panel). A low intensity radiation is used to preferentially polymerize monomer 1 near the top of the layer. Diffusion of monomers 1 and 2 results in a gradient formation. Accordingly, layer 6 comprises polymers having a majority of monomer 1 near the top of the Z-axis, and polymers having a majority of monomer 2 near the bottom of the Z-axis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, right panel, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The exposure is dimmed in comparison to the exposures used for the other layers causing preferential polymerization to occur at the surface (in the direction of the light) and diffusion to occur away from the surface.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">For any given layer, one or a plurality of exposures can be used. Each exposure can be slow or fast, and can be of variable intensities for each exposure. In certain embodiments, top down or bottom up 3D printers that use light to polymerize resin can be used. In certain embodiments, the methods herein use printers, such as the AutoDesk Ember, the Gizmo 3D printer, Octave printers, Full Spectrum Laser 3D printers, Inkjet 3D printers, stereolithographic 3D printers, and the like. Inkjet 3D printers are capable of creating composite materials but are generally limited on the resolution that is obtained compared to stereolithographic type of 3D printers.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0147">In certain embodiments, monomer 1 and monomer 2 are partially miscible with each other. In preferred embodiments, monomer 1 and monomer 2 are fully miscible with each other. In some embodiments, monomer 2 is partially or fully immiscible in polymer 1, wherein polymer 1 is a polymer formed from a majority of monomer 1. Counter diffusion of monomer 2 is enhanced if monomer 2 is partially or fully immiscible in Polymer 1. In some embodiments, it is desirable to have a first exposure for a layer to form a polymer primarily composed of monomer 1 and then move to the next layer, thus leaving only a structure composed primarily of polymer of monomer 1. In some embodiments, it is desirable to vary the composition of formed polymer in the z dimension in addition to or independent of the x and y dimensions by using the methods taught in U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments the first region is influenced by both the wavelength of light and by the diffusion rates of the monomers. In certain embodiments, the lower bound for the smallest dimension of the composite structures is governed by the light source. As a non-limiting example, when using a laser, the width of a laser beam at its focus can achieve dimension sizes of 10s of nanometers to microns. Smaller dimension sizes are achievable in some embodiments wherein two photon techniques or holography is used. In some embodiments digital light processing (DLP) projectors are used, and they can be limited by the inherent resolution of the projectors, which typically give X-Y resolutions of greater than 20 microns. In more typical embodiments, DLP projectors give X-Y resolutions of greater than 50 microns. In some embodiments, the diffusion rate of either monomer 1, monomer 2, the light intensity, the temperature, or a combination thereof govern the upper bound in the smallest obtainable dimensional size of the composite structures. Factors that influence the diffusion rate include temperature, size of the monomers, viscosity, shape of the monomers, and other molecular factors. Fast diffusion corresponds with the ability to create larger structures in a reasonable amount of time. In preferred embodiments, structure sizes range from 10's of nanometers to 500 microns in the X-Y dimensions. In certain embodiments, the Z dimension is governed by the motor and drive mechanism used to move the build platform and typically is larger than 1 micron.

In preferred embodiments, a holographic projector is utilized to activate holograms for 3D printing. With advanced calculations, an object can be printed using a holographic image of the object in a volume of liquid without the need for printing layers. In addition, since holographic images are interference patterns, they are already composed of light and dark regions on a nanometer scale. Since diffusion is faster on small spatial scales, the intensity of the light can be higher and the layer is created faster than if larger light and dark regions are used.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0150">In some embodiments, the processes disclosed herein create a material with a planar composite structure with alternating layers of high modulus and high elongation materials, including composite structures useful in orthodontic appliances.
