Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a high-frequency apparatus, and more particularly relates to a technology to mount an acoustic wave device in a high-frequency apparatus in which a plurality of acoustic wave devices is mounted.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In electronic apparatuses such as a mobile phone, a smartphone, or the like, an acoustic wave device using a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator or a bulk wave (BAW: Bulk Acoustic Wave) resonator has been used. In recent years, reduction of electronic apparatuses in size and thickness has been advanced, and there is a demand for reducing the acoustic wave device itself in size and height in accordance therewith.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to meet such a demand, a WLP (Wafer Level Package) structure in which a chip itself of the acoustic wave device is used as a package has been proposed. An acoustic wave device having a typical WLP structure has a configuration in which, in a hollow space formed by a piezoelectric substrate, a support layer arranged in the periphery of the surface of the piezoelectric substrate, and a cover portion provided on the support layer, a plurality of functional elements are arranged on the piezoelectric substrate. In a case of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device, a comb tooth-shaped electrode (IDT: Inter Digital Transducer) is arranged as a functional element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, forming as a high-frequency module in which a plurality of acoustic wave devices is mounted on one substrate has also been proposed. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-51733 discloses a high-frequency module in which at least two surface acoustic wave devices are flip-chip mounted on a mounting substrate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When mounting an acoustic wave device having such a WLP structure on a mounting substrate, there is a case where a method (reflow) for electrically connecting the acoustic wave device and the mounting substrate by using solder is employed. In this case, by heating the acoustic wave device and the mounting substrate at high temperature to a temperature at which the solder is melted (being in a non-stress state), and then cooling them to normal temperature, the conductors of the acoustic wave device and the mounting substrate are electrically connected to each other with a solder bump.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The piezoelectric substrate of the acoustic wave device is formed of, for example, a piezoelectric single crystal material such as lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>), lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), alumina, silicon (Si), and sapphire, or a piezoelectric laminated material made of LiTaO<sub>3 </sub>or LiNbO<sub>3</sub>. On the other hand, the mounting substrate is formed of a resin such as phenol, epoxy, or the like. Therefore, in many cases, the piezoelectric substrate of the acoustic wave device and the mounting substrate have different coefficients of linear expansion. As a result, when cooling in the reflow process, mechanical distortion occurs in the acoustic wave device itself due to a difference in the coefficient of linear expansion between the piezoelectric substrate and the mounting substrate, and characteristics of the acoustic wave device may vary.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, when the acoustic wave device and another device are mounted on one substrate, the distortion may further increase depending on the coefficients of linear expansion of the piezoelectric substrate of the acoustic wave device and the substrate included in the other device, and influence on the characteristics of the acoustic wave device may increase.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide high-frequency apparatuses in each of which an acoustic wave device and another device are mounted on a mounting substrate, and significantly reduce or prevent deterioration in characteristics of the acoustic wave device due to distortion in the mounting process.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A high-frequency apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a resin substrate, a first device including a substrate and provided on the resin substrate, and a second device provided adjacent to the first device on the resin substrate.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the high-frequency apparatus <b>1</b> includes a device <b>10</b> (device A), a device <b>20</b> (device B), and a mounting substrate <b>30</b>. The two devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are electrically connected onto the mounting substrate <b>30</b> with solder bumps <b>40</b> provided therebetween. At least one of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is an acoustic wave device including a piezoelectric substrate and a plurality of functional elements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Here, a coefficient of linear expansion of a substrate included in the device <b>10</b> is taken as &#x3b1;1, a coefficient of linear expansion of a substrate of the device <b>20</b> is taken as &#x3b1;2, and a coefficient of linear expansion of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> is taken as &#x3b1;3.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In general, when a device, for example, the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, is mounted on the mounting substrate <b>30</b>, mounting is performed through a reflow process in many cases. In the reflow process, the solder <b>40</b> is applied onto the mounting substrate <b>30</b> by printing or the like in advance, and the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are provided thereon. After that, by heating to high temperature in this state, melting the solder, and then cooling, the mounting substrate <b>30</b> and the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are coupled to each other. At this time, distortion may occur in the mounting substrate <b>30</b> due to a difference between the coefficient of linear expansion of the substrate included in each of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and the coefficient of linear expansion of the mounting substrate <b>30</b>. This distortion may cause mechanical deformation of the functional elements of the acoustic wave device of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, and characteristics of the acoustic wave device are changed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are diagrams showing distortion of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> caused by the difference in the coefficient of linear expansion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example in a case where the coefficient &#x3b1;1 of linear expansion of the substrate of the device <b>10</b> and the coefficient &#x3b1;2 of linear expansion of the substrate of the device <b>20</b> are both higher than the coefficient &#x3b1;3 of linear expansion of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> (&#x3b1;1&#x3e;&#x3b1;3, &#x3b1;2&#x3e;&#x3b1;3).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the heating process in the reflow, since the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> each have a higher coefficient of linear expansion than that of the mounting substrate <b>30</b>, the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> extend more than the mounting substrate <b>30</b> in the heating state. The solder <b>40</b> solidifies in the middle of the cooling step and the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is fixed to the mounting substrate <b>30</b>, but when the temperature is further decreased to normal temperature, the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> contract more than the mounting substrate <b>30</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be deformed in a convex shape toward the mounting substrate <b>30</b> side. This causes distortion in portions of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> facing end portions of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> in a direction from the mounting substrate <b>30</b> toward the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, which may cause a decrease in the characteristics of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In contrast, when the coefficient of linear expansion of the substrate of each of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is lower than the coefficient of linear expansion of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> (&#x3b1;1&#x3c;&#x3b1;3, &#x3b1;2&#x3c;&#x3b1;3), since a contraction amount of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> after the solidification of the solder in the cooling step becomes larger than a contraction amount of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, distortion occurs in the mounting substrate <b>30</b> in a direction from the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> toward the mounting substrate <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Accordingly, the first preferred embodiment includes a substrate having a lower coefficient of linear expansion than that of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> as a substrate of one device, and a substrate having a higher coefficient of linear expansion than that of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> as a substrate of the other device (for example, &#x3b1;1&#x3c;&#x3b1;3&#x3c;&#x3b1;2). Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the mounting substrate <b>30</b>, the distortion caused by the difference in the coefficient of linear expansion from the substrate of the device <b>10</b> and the distortion caused by the difference in the coefficient of linear expansion from the substrate of the device <b>20</b> are generated in reverse directions to each other. Accordingly, at a portion where the device <b>10</b> and the device <b>20</b> are adjacent to or in a vicinity of each other, at least a portion of the distortions is canceled out, and the deformation of the mounting substrate <b>30</b> is reduced or prevented. As a result, the deformation of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is significantly reduced or prevented, and thus a decrease in the characteristics of the acoustic wave device included in the devices <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is able to significantly reduced or prevented.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hereinafter, the features of the first preferred embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> are examples of cross-sectional views in states in which acoustic wave devices <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>C included in the first preferred embodiment are mounted on a mounting substrate <b>200</b>.

In addition, when a shift amount between the resonant frequencies of the parallel arm resonators or between the anti-resonant frequencies of the serial arm resonators increases, the attenuation steepness in a vicinity of the upper or lower limit of the pass band width deteriorates, and there is a risk that defective characteristics in a vicinity of the upper or lower limit occur (the broken line L<b>56</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Accordingly, in a case where the acoustic wave device has a ladder filter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, at least one of a resonator having the lowest resonant frequency among the parallel arm resonators and a resonator having the highest anti-resonant frequency among the serial arm resonators is located in the improvement region shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>.

Therefore, the transmission signal is a high-frequency signal having relatively large power (amplitude) through the serial arm resonator as compared to the reception signal. Furthermore, the transmission signal has a pass band frequency of the transmission filter, and is thus transmitted to the antenna with almost no attenuation.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the multiplexer, noise received through the antenna (a frequency other than those of the transmission and reception pass band) is transmitted not only to the reception filter, but also to the transmission filter. The signal transmitted to the transmission filter has a frequency other than those of the pass band, and is gradually attenuated every time the signal passes through the serial arm resonators. Therefore, since the two signals of the transmission signal and the noise are simultaneously input to a serial arm resonator closest to the antenna side among the serial arm resonators, a larger stress is applied thereto than to the other serial arm resonators.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The acoustic wave resonator converts electrical vibration into mechanical vibration and transmits the resulting vibration, and converts the transmitted mechanical vibration into electrical vibration again.
