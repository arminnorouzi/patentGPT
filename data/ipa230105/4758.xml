Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosed subject matter relates generally to methods, systems, and products for detecting fraudulent interactions and, in some particular embodiments, to a method, system, and computer program product for detecting fraudulent interactions using multiple neural networks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Technical Considerations</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain institutions (e.g., transaction service providers, issuers, acquirers, merchants, and/or the like) may process a high volume of transactions (e.g., authorization requests and/or authorization responses) every day. For example, a transaction service provider system in an electronic payment processing network may process thousands of transactions per second. Some transactions may be fraudulent, but it may be difficult to determine which transactions are potentially and/or actually fraudulent. For example, certain institutions may rely on manual review of transactions to identify fraud. Additionally or alternatively, certain institutions (e.g., computer systems thereof) may employ various predefined rules or score functions for assessing the likelihood that a transaction is fraudulent. For example, a transaction flagged based on the predefined rules/scoring may be forwarded to an individual for manual review. Additionally or alternatively, after manual review of the transactions, labels (e.g., fraud, not fraud, and/or the like) may be assigned to the reviewed transactions, and a classifier (e.g., neural network and/or the like) may be trained to detect fraud in other transactions after being trained with the labeled transactions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, manual review may be burdensome, time consuming, and/or expensive in terms of manual efforts. As such, only a small portion of all transactions may be manually reviewed. Moreover, as only a small portion of all transactions are reviewed and labeled, a large portion of all transactions may remain unlabeled. Such unlabeled transactions may be unsuitable (e.g., not useful and/or the like) for machine learning (e.g., supervised learning in classifiers such as neural networks and/or the like). Further, predefined rules may be designed to detect fraudulent transactions under certain known circumstances (e.g., known patterns of fraudsters and/or the like), but such rules may be unsuitable for detecting or adjusting to new patterns employed by fraudsters to overcome such rules (e.g., it may be difficult to adjust such rules, designers of such rules may remain unaware of such new patterns, and/or the like). In addition, such classifiers (e.g., neural networks, machine learning models, and/or the like) trained on the small portion of transactions for which labels are provided may lack sufficient data for training, and therefore, such classifiers may be unsuitable for (e.g., unable to, inadequate for, and/or the like) detecting complex patterns, new patterns, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A generative adversarial network (GAN) may be used to create high quality fake data meant to resemble real data. Certain GANs may employ two machine learning models (e.g., neural networks and/or the like), which may be referred to a generator and a discriminator. For example, the generator may be a neural network that transforms an input (e.g., a vector of random values (e.g., a random noise vector) and/or the like) into fake data. Additionally, the discriminator may be a neural network that receives the fake data from the generator (and/or some real data) as an input and classifies the input as real or fake (e.g., determines a probability that the input is real or fake). The discriminator's classification may be correct or incorrect (e.g., an error and/or the like). Information regarding errors (e.g., error for each input, error rate over multiple inputs, and/or the like) may be used for training of the generator and/or the discriminator. For example, the generator may be trained to attempt to increase the errors (e.g., increase the likelihood for an error for each input, increase the error rate, and/or the like) and/or the discriminator may be trained to decrease the errors (e.g., decrease the likelihood for an error for each input, decrease the error rate, and/or the like). Over time (e.g., after a number of training iterations and/or the like), the generator may improve at generating fake data and/or the discriminator may improve at classifying inputs as real or fake.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, GANs may be insufficient (e.g., unable, inadequate, and/or the like) to classify what type of data the real data is (e.g., to provide labels for the real data). If the real data includes images, each image may be converted into a vector representation for inputting into the discriminator, and the discriminator may be able to classify that vector representation as real or fake. Yet, the discriminator may be insufficient (e.g., unable, inadequate, and/or the like) to classify what is depicted in the image (or even that the vector representation is an image as opposed to some other type of data). Similarly, if the real data is transaction data, a fraudulent transaction may be a real transaction, and the discriminator may be able to classify the transaction data thereof as real or fake. Yet, the discriminator may be insufficient (e.g., unable, inadequate, and/or the like) to classify whether the transaction is fraudulent.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is an object of the presently disclosed subject matter to provide methods, systems, and computer program products for detecting fraudulent interactions, e.g., using multiple neural networks.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to non-limiting embodiments, provided is a method for detecting fraudulent interactions.

For example, an issuer institution may provide an account identifier, such as a primary account number (PAN), to a customer that uniquely identifies one or more accounts associated with that customer. The account identifier may be embodied on a portable financial device, such as a physical financial instrument, e.g., a payment card, and/or may be electronic and used for electronic payments. The terms &#x201c;issuer institution&#x201d; and &#x201c;issuer institution system&#x201d; may also refer to one or more computer systems operated by or on behalf of an issuer institution, such as a server computer executing one or more software applications. For example, an issuer institution system may include one or more authorization servers for authorizing a transaction.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As used herein, the term &#x201c;account identifier&#x201d; may include one or more types of identifiers associated with a user account (e.g., a PAN, a card number, a payment card number, a token, and/or the like). In some non-limiting embodiments, an issuer institution may provide an account identifier (e.g., a PAN, a token, and/or the like) to a user that uniquely identifies one or more accounts associated with that user. The account identifier may be embodied on a physical financial instrument (e.g., a portable financial instrument, a payment card, a credit card, a debit card, and/or the like) and/or may be electronic information communicated to the user that the user may use for electronic payments. In some non-limiting embodiments, the account identifier may be an original account identifier, where the original account identifier was provided to a user at the creation of the account associated with the account identifier. In some non-limiting embodiments, the account identifier may be an account identifier (e.g., a supplemental account identifier) that is provided to a user after the original account identifier was provided to the user. For example, if the original account identifier is forgotten, stolen, and/or the like, a supplemental account identifier may be provided to the user. In some non-limiting embodiments, an account identifier may be directly or indirectly associated with an issuer institution such that an account identifier may be a token that maps to a PAN or other type of identifier. Account identifiers may be alphanumeric, any combination of characters and/or symbols, and/or the like. An issuer institution may be associated with a bank identification number (BIN) that uniquely identifies the issuer institution.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;payment token&#x201d; or &#x201c;token&#x201d; may refer to an identifier that is used as a substitute or replacement identifier for an account identifier, such as a PAN. Tokens may be associated with a PAN or other account identifiers in one or more data structures (e.g., one or more databases and/or the like) such that they can be used to conduct a transaction (e.g., a payment transaction) without directly using the account identifier, such as a PAN. In some examples, an account identifier, such as a PAN, may be associated with a plurality of tokens for different individuals, different uses, and/or different purposes. For example, a payment token may include a series of numeric and/or alphanumeric characters that may be used as a substitute for an original account identifier. For example, a payment token &#x201c;4900 0000 0000 0001&#x201d; may be used in place of a PAN &#x201c;4147 0900 0000 1234.&#x201d; In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token may be &#x201c;format preserving&#x201d; and may have a numeric format that conforms to the account identifiers used in existing payment processing networks (e.g., ISO 8583 financial transaction message format). In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token may be used in place of a PAN to initiate, authorize, settle, or resolve a payment transaction or represent the original credential in other systems where the original credential would typically be provided. In some non-limiting embodiments, a token value may be generated such that the recovery of the original PAN or other account identifier from the token value may not be computationally derived (e.g., with a one-way hash or other cryptographic function). Further, in some non-limiting embodiments, the token format may be configured to allow the entity receiving the payment token to identify it as a payment token and recognize the entity that issued the token.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As used herein, the term &#x201c;provisioning&#x201d; may refer to a process of enabling a device to use a resource or service. For example, provisioning may involve enabling a device to perform transactions using an account. Additionally or alternatively, provisioning may include adding provisioning data associated with account data (e.g., a payment token representing an account number) to a device.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As used herein, the term &#x201c;token requestor&#x201d; may refer to an entity that is seeking to implement tokenization according to embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. For example, the token requestor may initiate a request that a PAN be tokenized by submitting a token request message to a token service provider. Additionally or alternatively, a token requestor may no longer need to store a PAN associated with a token once the requestor has received the payment token in response to a token request message. In some non-limiting embodiments, the requestor may be an application, a device, a process, or a system that is configured to perform actions associated with tokens. For example, a requestor may request registration with a network token system, request token generation, token activation, token de-activation, token exchange, other token lifecycle management related processes, and/or any other token related processes. In some non-limiting embodiments, a requestor may interface with a network token system through any suitable communication network and/or protocol (e.g., using HTTPS, SOAP, and/or an XML interface among others). For example, a token requestor may include card-on-file merchants, acquirers, acquirer processors, payment gateways acting on behalf of merchants, payment enablers (e.g., original equipment manufacturers, mobile network operators, and/or the like), digital wallet providers, issuers, third-party wallet providers, payment processing networks, and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, a token requestor may request tokens for multiple domains and/or channels. Additionally or alternatively, a token requestor may be registered and identified uniquely by the token service provider within the tokenization ecosystem. For example, during token requestor registration, the token service provider may formally process a token requestor's application to participate in the token service system. In some non-limiting embodiments, the token service provider may collect information pertaining to the nature of the requestor and relevant use of tokens to validate and formally approve the token requestor and establish appropriate domain restriction controls. Additionally or alternatively, successfully registered token requestors may be assigned a token requestor identifier that may also be entered and maintained within the token vault. In some non-limiting embodiments, token requestor identifiers may be revoked and/or token requestors may be assigned new token requestor identifiers. In some non-limiting embodiments, this information may be subject to reporting and audit by the token service provider.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, the term a &#x201c;token service provider&#x201d; may refer to an entity including one or more server computers in a token service system that generates, processes, and maintains payment tokens. For example, the token service provider may include or be in communication with a token vault where the generated tokens are stored. Additionally or alternatively, the token vault may maintain one-to-one mapping between a token and a PAN represented by the token. In some non-limiting embodiments, the token service provider may have the ability to set aside licensed BINs as token BINs to issue tokens for the PANs that may be submitted to the token service provider. In some non-limiting embodiments, various entities of a tokenization ecosystem may assume the roles of the token service provider. For example, payment networks and issuers or their agents may become the token service provider by implementing the token services according to non-limiting embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. Additionally or alternatively, a token service provider may provide reports or data output to reporting tools regarding approved, pending, or declined token requests, including any assigned token requestor ID. The token service provider may provide data output related to token-based transactions to reporting tools and applications and present the token and/or PAN as appropriate in the reporting output. In some non-limiting embodiments, the EMVCo standards organization may publish specifications defining how tokenized systems may operate. For example, such specifications may be informative, but they are not intended to be limiting upon any of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As used herein, the term &#x201c;token vault&#x201d; may refer to a repository that maintains established token-to-PAN mappings. For example, the token vault may also maintain other attributes of the token requestor that may be determined at the time of registration and/or that may be used by the token service provider to apply domain restrictions or other controls during transaction processing. In some non-limiting embodiments, the token vault may be a part of a token service system. For example, the token vault may be provided as a part of the token service provider. Additionally or alternatively, the token vault may be a remote repository accessible by the token service provider. In some non-limiting embodiments, token vaults, due to the sensitive nature of the data mappings that are stored and managed therein, may be protected by strong underlying physical and logical security. Additionally or alternatively, a token vault may be operated by any suitable entity, including a payment network, an issuer, clearing houses, other financial institutions, transaction service providers, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, the term &#x201c;merchant&#x201d; may refer to one or more entities (e.g., operators of retail businesses that provide goods and/or services, and/or access to goods and/or services, to a user (e.g., a customer, a consumer, a customer of the merchant, and/or the like) based on a transaction (e.g., a payment transaction)).

For example, non-limiting embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide detecting fraudulent interactions using three neural networks (e.g., a classifier, a generator, a discriminator, and/or the like) to generate labels for unlabeled interaction data (e.g., by the classifier), generate generated (e.g., fake) interaction data (e.g., by the generator), generate discrimination data for the unlabeled interactions and generated interactions (e.g., be the discriminator), and generate error data based on the discrimination data to use for training at least one of the neural networks. Such embodiments provide techniques and systems that reduce (e.g., eliminate, decrease, and/or the like) manual efforts and reduce time spent manually reviewing transactions (e.g., to provide labels to historical transaction data, to identify incoming transactions as fraudulent, and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, such embodiments provide techniques and systems that accurately provide labels for unlabeled data (e.g., historical data, incoming data, and/or the like). As such, the previously unlabeled data may be used for machine learning (e.g., supervised learning and/or the like) for which it was previously unsuitable (e.g., unusable, usable only after labels were manually assigned, and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, such embodiments provide techniques and systems that enable detection of new patterns, complex patterns, and/or the like that may not have been previously detectable (e.g., because the small portion of data that was labeled was insufficiently small to train a machine learning model, because predetermined rules are difficult to (manually) adjust in real time and/or when patterns are unknown to the designer, and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, such embodiments provide techniques and systems that enable training a classifier to accurately label real data based in part on feedback from a discriminator that is discriminating between real and fake (e.g., generated) data. For example, the output and/or error data from the discriminator may be indirectly indicative of the accuracy of such labels provided by the classifier for (real) previously unlabeled data.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For the purpose of illustration, in the following description, while the presently disclosed subject matter is described with respect to methods, systems, and computer program products for detecting fraudulent interactions, e.g., fraudulent payment transactions, one skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosed subject matter is not limited to the illustrative embodiments.

Additionally or alternatively, the termination condition may include a marginal difference in at least one of the first error data or the second error data between successive iterations being below a threshold (e.g., error rate did not significantly change between successive iterations or between a selected number of successive iterations).

Additionally or alternatively, such transaction may be flagged (e.g., marked, posted/added to a list, sorted, and/or the like) for review by the central system (e.g., transaction service provider system <b>102</b>).

For example, where the interaction is a communication (e.g., public and/or private message, email, text message, telephone call, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) call, social media post, website, and/or the like), such communication may be declined, rejected, and/or deleted by the central system (e.g., spam filter and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, such communication and/or an account associated with such communication may be flagged (e.g., marked, posted/added to a list, sorted, and/or the like) for review by the central system.
