However, a user may have to use his hands or voice commands to provide the inputs. For instance, to provide a textual input to a computing device, the user may have to type on a keyboard or select keys on a virtual keyboard using a mouse. Such input methods may not be usable in some cases. For example, people with physical disabilities may not be able to provide inputs to computing devices using hand or voice commands.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present subject matter relates to providing inputs to computing devices. In accordance with the present subject matter, an input may be received by a computing device based on a brain wave signal, such as a Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signal, which may be generated in the brain of a user in response to the user gazing at a flickering visual stimulus. For instance, when a user gazes at a flickering visual stimulus, a voltage may be generated in the occipital lobe of the brain of the user. This voltage may be sensed and used to determine an input being provided to the computing device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an example implementation, a computing device may identify a request of a user to display an input interface based on receipt of a first signal. The first signal may be received in response to a gaze of the user at a predetermined region of the computing device. The input interface may be utilized to provide an input to the computing device. The predetermined region may comprise, for example, a light emitting Diode (LED) flickering at a predetermined frequency (hereinafter referred to as the first frequency) and the user may gaze at the LED if he intends to provide input to the computing device using the input interface. The input to be provided may be, for example, a textual input.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the user gazes at the LED, a brain wave signal (hereinafter referred to as the first brain wave signal) having a dominant frequency may be sensed by set of electrodes. The set of electrodes may be, for example, Electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, placed on the head of the user. The set of electrodes may be connected to a sensing device to transmit the sensed first brain wave signal to the sensing device. The sensing device may receive the first brain wave signal from the set of electrodes and may generate a corresponding signal (hereinafter referred to as first signal), for example, by amplifying, filtering, and digitizing the first brain wave signal. The computing device may receive the first signal. To identify that the user has requested to display the input interface based on the first signal, the processing unit may obtain the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal from the first signal and compare the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal and the first frequency.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Based on the identification, the input interface may be generated for display by a display device of the computing device. The input interface may comprise a plurality of images, which may be images of keys of a virtual keypad, interchangeably referred to as the keypad. The virtual keypad may be, for example, a virtual alphanumeric keyboard, interchangeably referred to as the keyboard. Each key may flicker at a flickering frequency different from flickering frequencies of other keys. For instance, while an &#x201c;A&#x201d; key may flicker at 25 Hz, a &#x201c;B&#x201d; key may flicker at 26 Hz.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To provide an input to the computing device using the keypad (i.e., to select a key on the keypad), the user may gaze at a key. For instance, to type the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the user may gaze at the &#x201c;A&#x201d; key. When the user gazes at a key, a corresponding brain wave signal (hereinafter referred to as the second brain wave signal) may be generated by the brain of the user. The computing device may receive a second signal corresponding to the second brain wave signal from the sensing device and determine the key that the user has gazed at based on the second signal. For the determination, the processing unit may obtain a dominant frequency of the second brain wave signal from the second signal. The dominant frequency of the second brain wave signal may then be compared with flickering frequencies of the keys of the keypad and a key having a flickering frequency matching the dominant frequency of the second brain wave signal is identified. The identified key may be determined as the key at which the user gazed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Subsequently, an action corresponding to the selection of the determined key may be performed. For instance, if it is determined that the user has gazed at the &#x201c;A&#x201d; key, the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; may be displayed on the display device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present subject matter provides an efficient and reliable technique to provide inputs to computing devices. For instance, since the present subject matter allows receiving inputs by computing devices based on brain wave signals of a user, the present subject matter eliminates the usage of input devices, such as a keyboard. Further, the usage of hands for providing inputs to computing devices can be obviated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present subject matter is further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. It should be noted that the description and figures merely illustrate principles of the present subject matter.

For instance, the predetermined region may comprise a light emitting diode (LED) (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) flickering at a predetermined frequency (hereinafter referred to as the first frequency). The processing unit <b>102</b> may identify the request of the user based on the gaze of the user at the LED, as will be explained below:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The gazing at the LED may induce a brain wave signal in the brain of the user (hereinafter referred to as the first brain wave signal).

Further, the processing unit <b>102</b> may process the first signal to obtain a dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal. The processing unit <b>102</b> may then compare the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal and the first frequency to identify the request of the user. For instance, if the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal equals the first frequency, the user request to provide input to the computing device <b>100</b> may be identified.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In response to the identification of the request of the user, the processing unit <b>102</b> may generate the input interface, which may comprise a plurality of images for display. The display device <b>104</b> may be part of the computing device <b>100</b>, which can display the generated plurality of images. The display device <b>104</b> may be, for example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) display, an LED display, an organic-LED (OLED) display, or an electronic ink display. In an example, the images may be images of keys of a virtual keypad, such as a virtual alphanumeric keyboard. Each image may flicker at a flickering frequency different from flickering frequencies of other keys. In an example, each image may flicker at a flickering frequency equal to or greater than 25 Hz, thereby preventing the user from perceiving the flicker. Accordingly, a discomfort caused to the user by perception of flicker is prevented.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To provide input to the computing device <b>100</b> using the input interface, the user may gaze at an image of the input interface. For instance, to type the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the user may gaze at the image of a key &#x201c;A&#x201d; on the keypad. When the user gazes at an image, a corresponding brain wave signal may be generated by the brain of the user. A brain wave signal generated based on gazing at an image of the keypad may be referred to as the second brain wave signal. The second brain wave signal may be sensed by the set of electrodes and the sensing device may receive the second brain wave signal from the set of electrodes. Then, the sensing device may generate a signal (hereinafter referred to as the second signal) corresponding to the second brain wave signal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The processing unit <b>102</b> may receive the second signal from the sensing device and based on the second signal, the processing unit <b>102</b> may determine the image that the user has gazed at for selecting the image.

To allow identification of the request of the user <b>202</b>, the LED <b>207</b> may flicker at a frequency (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;first frequency&#x201d;). Due to the flickering of the LED <b>207</b>, when the user <b>202</b> gazes at the LED <b>207</b>, a first brain wave signal <b>208</b> may be generated by the brain of the user <b>202</b>.

Further, in response to the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal equaling the first frequency for a predetermined time period, it may be determined that the user has gazed at the LED for the predetermined time period. For instance, if the dominant frequency of the first brain wave signal is obtained as 50 Hz for the predetermined time period (e.g., 4 sec), which may be equal to a flickering frequency of the LED i.e., the first frequency, then it may be determined that the user has gazed at the LED for the predetermined time period of 4 sec.

The key having a flickering frequency equaling the dominant frequency of the second brain wave signal may be identified and the identified key may be determined as the key that the user has gazed at. For instance, if a dominant frequency of the second brain wave signal is obtained as 25 Hz, the key &#x201c;A&#x201d; flickers at a flickering frequency of 25 Hz, then it may be identified that the dominant frequency equals the flickering frequency of the key &#x201c;A&#x201d; and it may be determined that the user has gazed at the key &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The non-transitory computer-readable medium <b>502</b> further includes instructions <b>522</b> that cause the processing resource <b>504</b> to perform an action corresponding to the key that is gazed at in response to the determination.
