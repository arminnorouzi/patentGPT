A coupling frequency range is generally defined as a frequency range across which the thin film coupler provides relatively even coupling performance. Narrow coupling frequency ranges can limit the usefulness of such thin film couplers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A trend towards miniaturization has increased the desirability of small, passive couplers.

Couplers generally provide coupling between two signal lines without direct electrical contact. The coupler may generally include a monolithic base substrate. At least one port (e.g., an input port, output port, coupling port, and/or ground port) may be exposed along an exterior of the coupler for surface mounting the coupler, for example using grid array-type mounting (e.g., land grid array (LGA) type mounting, ball grid array (BGA) type, etc.). The coupler may include at least one thin film component configured to produce a coupled signal in the coupling port (e.g., with respect to the ground port) in response to an input signal received by the input port. For example, in some embodiments, the coupler may include a first thin film inductor and a second thin film inductor that is inductively coupled with the first thin film inductor. The second thin film inductor may be inductively coupled with the first thin film inductor and electrically connected between the input and the output ports. A thin film circuit may electrically connect the first thin film inductor with the coupling port and/or ground port.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the thin film coupler may be compact. For example, the coupler may have a small footprint and thus require less space for mounting on a printed circuit board. The coupler may have a footprint of less than about 3 mm<sup>2</sup>, in some embodiments less than about 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, in some embodiments less than about 2.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, in some embodiments less than about 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, in some embodiments less than about 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, in some embodiments less than about 0.8 mm<sup>2</sup>, and in some embodiments less than about 0.6 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coupler may have a length that is less than about 2.0 mm, in some embodiments less than about 1.8 mm, in some embodiments less than about 1.5 mm, and in some embodiments less than about 1.1 mm. A width of the coupler may be less than about 1.2 mm, in some embodiments less than about 1 mm, in some embodiments less than about 0.8 mm, in some embodiments less than about 0.7 mm, and in some embodiments less than about 0.6 mm. In some embodiments, the thin film coupler may have an EIA case size of 1206, 805, 0504, 0402, 0303, 0202, or smaller.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The thin film coupler may exhibit an even coupling factor across a coupling frequency range. For example, the coupling factor may vary less than about 4 dB across the coupling frequency range, in some embodiments less than about 3.8 dB, in some embodiments less than about 3.6 dB, in some embodiments less than about 3.4 dB, in some embodiments less than about 3.2 dB, and in some embodiments less than about 3.1 dB.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The coupling frequency range may have a lower limit (e.g., about 2 GHz) and an upper limit that is at least 2 GHz greater than the lower limit, in some embodiments at least about 4.5 GHz, in some embodiments at least about 5 GHz, in some embodiments at least about 5.5 GHz, in some embodiments at least about 6 GHz, in some embodiments at least about 8 GHz, in some embodiments at least about 10 GHz, and in some embodiments at least about 12 GHz. The lower limit may range from about 250 MHz to about 6 GHz, in some embodiments, in some embodiments from about 500 MHz to about 5 GHz, in some embodiments from about 750 MHz to about 2 GHz, and in some embodiments from about 1 GHz to about 3 GHz.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As indicated above, a thin film circuit may electrically connect the first thin film inductor with the coupling port. The thin film circuit may include one or more thin film resistors, one or more thin film inductors, and/or one or more thin film capacitors. For example, the thin film circuit may include a third thin film inductor and a thin film capacitor that are electrically connected in parallel with each other. The third thin film inductor and the thin film capacitor may be electrically connected in series between the first thin film inductor and the coupling port.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, at least a portion of one or more of the thin film elements may be formed over a dielectric layer that may be formed over a surface of the monolithic base substrate. The dielectric layer may have a first surface and a second surface. The second surface of the dielectric layer may face the first surface of the monolithic base substrate. However, it should be understood that one or intermediate layers may be between the dielectric layer and the monolithic base substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, &#x201c;formed over,&#x201d; may refer to a layer that is directly in contact with another layer. However, intermediate layers may also be formed therebetween. Additionally, when used in reference to a bottom surface, &#x201c;formed over&#x201d; may be used relative to an exterior surface of the component. Thus, a layer that is &#x201c;formed over&#x201d; a bottom surface may be closer to the exterior of the component than the layer over which it is formed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The thin film inductor may include a first conductive layer formed over the first surface of the monolithic base substrate. A second conductive layer of the thin film inductor may be formed over the first surface of the dielectric layer. A via may connect the first conductive layer with the second conductive layer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As another example, a thin film capacitor may include electrodes that are spaced apart by at least the thickness of the dielectric layer. The thin film capacitor may include a first electrode formed over the first surface of the monolithic base substrate and a second electrode formed over a first surface of the dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At least portions of the first and second inductors may be elongated and parallel with each other to facilitate induction of signals in the second thin film inductor by the first thin film inductor. More specifically, the first inductor may include a first conductive layer that is elongated in a first direction in the X-Y plane. The second inductor may include a second conductive layer that is parallel with the first conductive layer and spaced apart from the first conductive layer in a second direction in the X-Y plane that is perpendicular to the first direction by an approximately even spacing distance along at least a portion of the first conductive layer. The spacing distance may range from about 1 micron to about 100 microns, in some embodiments from about 5 microns to about 80 microns, in some embodiments from about 10 microns to about 30 microns.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a cover layer may be formed over the second surface of the dielectric layer. For example, the cover layer may be formed directly on the second surface of the dielectric layer, or one or more intermediate layers may be between the cover layer and dielectric layer. For instance, a metallic intermediate layer may be between the cover layer and dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cover layer may include a suitable ceramic dielectric material, for example as described below. The cover layer may have a thickness that ranges from about 100 microns to about 600 microns, in some embodiments from about 125 microns to about 500 microns, in some embodiments from about 150 microns to about 400 microns, and in some embodiments from about 175 microns to about 300 microns.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The base substrate, dielectric layer, and/or cover layer may comprise one or more suitable ceramic materials. Suitable materials are generally electrically insulating and thermally conductive. Example materials include silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, silicon oxide, barium titanate, strontium titanate, strontium barium titanate, bismuth strontium tantalate, tantalum, niobium, oxides or nitrides or such materials, NPO (COG), X7R, X7S, Z5U, Y5V formulations, lead-based materials such as doped or non-doped PZT dielectrics, and others. Additional examples include alumina, aluminum nitride, beryllium oxide, aluminum oxide, boron nitride, silicon, silicon carbide, silica, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, zirconium dioxide, mixtures thereof, oxides and/or nitrides of such materials, or any other suitable ceramic material. Additional ceramic materials include calcium titanate (CaTiO<sub>3</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), ceramics containing low-fire glass, and other glass-bonded materials.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, one or more of the base substrate, dielectric layer, and/or cover layer may comprise sapphire or ruby. Sapphire and ruby are types of corundum, which is a crystalline form of aluminum oxide (a ceramic material) containing additional trace materials. A substrate comprising sapphire may provide several benefits including excellent electrical insulation, heat dissipation, and high temperature stability. Additionally, because sapphire is generally transparent, internal features of the coupler may be visually inspected, reducing the time and difficulty associated with checking completed components for quality.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The base substrate, dielectric layer, and/or cover layer may include a material having a dielectric constant that is less than about 30 as determined in accordance with ASTM D2149-13 at an operating temperature of 25&#xb0; C. and frequency of 1 kHz, in some embodiments less than about 25, in some embodiments less than about 20, and in some embodiments less than about 15. However, in other embodiments, a material having a dielectric constant higher than may be used to achieve higher frequencies and/or smaller components. For example, in such embodiments, the dielectric constant may range from about 30 to about 120, or greater, as determined in accordance with ASTM D2149-13 at an operating temperature of 25&#xb0; C. and frequency of 1 kHz, in some embodiments from about 50 to about 100, and in some embodiments from about 70 to about 90.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The thin film components may be formed of a variety of suitable materials. For example, the thin film resistor may include a resistive layer, which may be formed from a variety of suitable resistive materials.

For instance, the adhesive layer may be or include tantalum (Ta) (e.g., tantalum or an oxide or nitride thereof) and may be formed between the microstrips and the base substrate to improve adhesion therebetween. Without being bound by theory, the material of the adhesion layer may be selected to overcome phenomena such as lattice mismatch and residual stresses.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The adhesion layer(s) may have a variety of suitable thicknesses.
