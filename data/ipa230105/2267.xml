A VR experience can be generated in <b>3</b>D and viewed with a head-mounted display (HMD), such as glasses or other wearable display devices that have near-eye display panels as lenses to display a VR environment that replaces an actual environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Augmented reality (AR), however, enables an experience in which a user can still see through the display lenses of the glasses or other HMD device to view the surrounding environment, yet also see images of virtual objects that are generated for display and appear as part of the environment. AR can include any type of input, such as audio and haptic inputs, as well as virtual images, graphics, and video that enhance or augment the environment that the user experiences. In order to achieve an AR experience, a virtual image is overlaid on an ambient environment, with the overlaying performed by optical devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multiple optical devices are fabricated on a substrate and then diced prior to use on VR and AR devices. Conventional methods of dicing optically transparent materials, such as glass and silicon carbide (SiC) substrates, include laser ablation cutting or filamentation. During the methods for dicing one or more optical devices from a substrate, it is critical to accurately dice the optical devices from the substrate to retain the quality of the optical devices. The optical devices, generally including high bandgap materials, are brittle, and are sensitive to thermal or mechanical stresses. Current methods of dicing the optical devices from the substrate create separation boundaries and sidewalls with poor surface roughness along the edge of each of the AR/VR devices. Surface roughness of the sidewalls may be greater than about 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Thermal stress within the substrate along the dicing path also contributes to higher sidewall surface roughness and cracking within the device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods for dicing one or more optical devices from a substrate with a laser machining system.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure generally relates to methods of dicing a substrate.

Specifically, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods for dicing one or more optical devices from a substrate with a laser machining system. Substrate materials such as silica glass and other types of glass materials have high bandgaps. In some embodiments, glass substrates formed from silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) have a bandgap of about 9.2 eV and therefore are optically transparent over a broad wavelength spectrum. However, when a laser is tightly focused to less than 5 &#x3bc;m and has a desired pulse intensity, a phase transformation is generated within the substrate due to nonlinear optical absorption. The phase transformation generates voids or cracking in the glass substrate. The voids or cracks are propagated along a line to form a void array. The void array is referred to as a dicing path. The dicing path is formed by moving a laser after each burst of laser pulses and forms a perforated barrier. Different portions of the substrate are then separated along the dicing path.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the voids/cracks is formed discreetly. Therefore, during separation of the substrate along the dicing path the separated wall of the substrate has a side wall surface roughness. The side wall surface roughness has a negative effect on the performance of AR/VR devices. Therefore, embodiments described herein are directed towards apparatus and methods for reducing the side wall surface roughness. The side wall surface roughness is reduced to less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m using the methods described herein. The surface roughness is reduced by reducing the void diameter and the void pitch of each of the voids formed within the substrate. Smaller void diameters and void pitches lead to lower surface roughness. Lowering pulse energy applied to the substrate and the pulse width also reduces the thermal stress and the void diameter within the substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic, top-view of a substrate <b>100</b>.

In other embodiments where a Bessel beam or multi-focus beam are utilized, the location of the focal point of the laser is changed only periodically, such as only 1-2 times per burst to generate cracking or phase modification along different layers depth-wise within the material. The location of the focal point is changed to be at a different position within the thickness of the substrate, such that the first laser burst creates a first column of voids through the substrate as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. Each of the voids may be formed by one or more of the laser pulses within the first laser burst. A controller may control the process parameters and location of the laser pulses as they are delivered to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The combination of the above process conditions, such as a pulse width of less than about 15 ps and a pulse repetition frequency of greater than about 25 MHz have been shown to reduce void diameters and reduce the amount of pulse energy applied to each location on the substrate. The increased pulse repetition frequency and reduced pulse width enable providing an equivalent or higher peak power while reducing or maintaining the same void diameter. In some embodiments, the laser pulse width is less than about 10 ps, such as less than 500 femtoseconds (fs) and the pulse repetition frequency is greater than about 50 MHz. In another embodiment, the pulse repetition frequency is greater than about 1 GHz and the pulse width is less than about 10 ps, such as less than 500 fs. The pulse width may cause reductions in achievable pulse energy, as a ratio of pulse energy to pulse width is limited. Longer pulse widths therefore enable higher pulse energy application. Higher pulse energy application increases the average power application. In some embodiments, increased power application reduced reliability of void formation. However, higher power may also lead to increased processing throughput, such that 10 ps laser pulses at a repetition frequency of 1 GHz with an 80 W laser have been found to have higher processing speeds than 500 fs laser pulses at a repetition frequency of 1 GHz with a 20 W laser with little change in dicing quality. Increasing the pulse repetition frequency enables bursts of 10 or more pulses per burst. The reduced void diameters enables a smaller pitch between each void and lower surface roughness along the dicing path. The reduced pulse energy and pulse width further has been shown to reduce thermal stress around each of the voids within the substrate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A laser wavelength of about 1.3 &#x3bc;m to about 4 &#x3bc;m is more optically transparent in glass. Improved optical transparency of the laser within the substrate enables smaller energy absorption cross sections and reduced damage spot size. Reduced damage spot size enables smaller voids and a reduced pitch between each of the voids. Reduced void diameter and pitch further reduce the surface roughness after separating the substrate along the dicing path.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pulse widths and pulse repetition frequencies described herein have further been shown to reduce the energy input to the substrate.

Exposing the second location of the substrate to the second laser burst may be similar to exposing the first location of the substrate to the first laser burst, but the laser pulses are delivered to a different location along the dicing path. The second laser burst forms a second column of voids within the substrate. The second location is a location different from the first location, but along the desired dicing path of the substrate. The desired dicing path may be determined by the controller before delivery of the first and second laser bursts to the substrate to form at least a portion of the dicing path.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The method <b>600</b> described herein may further include additional iterations of laser burst exposure at different locations along the dicing path, such as a third laser burst exposure at a third location along the dicing path and a fourth laser burst exposure at a fourth location along the dicing path. The number of laser burst exposures may be dependent upon the length of the dicing path, the void diameters, and the pitch between the voids.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The burst-to-burst frequency determines the rate at which the dicing path is formed along the substrate. The burst-to-burst frequency may be determined as the frequency at which the second laser burst exposure occurs after the first laser burst exposure. The decrease in pitch between each void increases the number of voids which should be formed for a similar length dicing path. Therefore, the burst-to-burst frequency may be increased when the pitch is decreased to maintain or enhance the rate of formation of the dicing path. As described herein, the burst-to-burst frequency is greater than about 65 kHz, such as greater than about 200 kHz, such as greater than about 400 kHz.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Methods and apparatus described herein enable lower surface roughness along an edge of a device after being diced from a substrate. The lower surface roughness is caused by reduced void diameter, reduced pitch between each void, and reduced thermal stress along the edge of the device. The reduced void diameter, reduced pitch, and reduced thermal stress are caused by a decrease in pulse width, an increase in pulse repetition rate, and the use of laser wavelengths which are more optically transparent within the substrate.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present disclosure, other and further embodiments of the disclosure may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
