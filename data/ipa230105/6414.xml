The term &#x201c;polygon&#x201d; also encompasses those in which an intermediate portion of a side (as opposed to a corner, i.e., the end of the side), is processed. That is, any shape that is obtained by partially processing a polygon falls within the meaning of a &#x201c;polygon&#x201d; as defined in the present specification and the claims.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">This applies not only to &#x201c;polygon&#x201d; but also to any term representing a particular shape such as a trapezoid, a circle or a convex/concave shape. This also applies when referring to a side of a shape. That is, even a corner or an intermediate portion of a side is processed, the &#x201c;side&#x201d; is defined to include the processed portion. Note that the term &#x201c;in the strict sense&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a rectangle in the strict sense&#x201d;) may be used to refer to a &#x201c;polygon&#x201d; or a &#x201c;side&#x201d; without under partial process, as opposed to a &#x201c;polygon&#x201d; or a &#x201c;side&#x201d; that is partially processed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Where there is more than one of the same component, they may be prefixed with &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc., in order to distinguish them from one another in the present specification or the claims. Where how the distinction is made in the present specification is different from that in the claims, the same prefix may not refer to the same member in the present specification and in the claims.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, if members of the same component are prefixed with &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and &#x201c;third&#x201d; in the specification, and if a claim only recites the &#x201c;first&#x201d; member and the &#x201c;third&#x201d; member as defined in the specification, the claim may instead use &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; to refer to the &#x201c;first&#x201d; member and the &#x201c;third&#x201d; member.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, this extent is represented by the portion that overlaps with the overlap between two hatched regions. The adhesives <b>80</b> also transmit light to some degree. For example, the first adhesives <b>81</b> have a transmittance of more than 0% and 10% or less at the time when the light-emitting device <b>1</b> is manufactured.

The temperature was adjusted while taking into consideration the actual circumstances where the light-emitting device <b>1</b> is operated. As a result of the measurement, at one point, the temperature of the thermocouple started increasing rapidly from a stable state, exhibiting a temperature increase of 2 to 3 degrees or more. Then, the bonding portion was observed to find that the adhesive had turned black.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Now, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> show the measurement result at plot P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Before the start of this measurement, the temperature around the bonding portion was adjusted to 75 degrees. The measurement was started and it was confirmed that the temperature of the thermocouple became stable at around 75 degrees, after which a laser beam was emitted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the emission of a laser beam was started after 30 to 40 seconds from the start of the measurement, thereby increasing the temperature of the thermocouple to around 82 degrees.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The temperature increase due to the laser beam irradiation became mild, and the temperature became stable, at around 82 degrees. Note that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the temperature increases slightly over the course of a long period of time. Then, after around 40,000 seconds, the stable state changed and the temperature started increasing rapidly. The measurement was ended at 42,000 seconds, at which it was confirmed that the adhesive had turned black.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">It was assumed from this result that the temperature of the adhesive increased by being irradiated with light, and the adhesive was charred. It was assumed that the point in time when the temperature of the thermocouple started increasing rapidly from a stable state was the point in time when the burning of the adhesive started, and therefore the irradiation time up to this point is represented as the amount of time taken until the adhesive is burned in the experiment results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">As can be seen from the results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first adhesive is burned within 100 hours by being irradiated with light having an energy density of 1.0 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>]. Depending on the product incorporating the light-emitting device, the light-emitting device may be required to have a better resistance to light than this.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">It can be seen that the second adhesive has a better resistance to light than the first adhesive does. Therefore, even when the first adhesive <b>81</b> is charred and loses its adhesive force, the optical member <b>70</b> remains fixed in the light-emitting device <b>1</b>. Thus, it is possible to realize a light-emitting device <b>1</b> that has stable adhesion even after being used over a long time.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Note that the first adhesive <b>81</b> and the second adhesive <b>82</b> are not limited to those used in the experiment but can each be any adhesive appropriately selected. Based on the experiment results, example combinations of the first adhesive <b>81</b> and the second adhesive <b>82</b> to be employed for the light-emitting device <b>1</b> include the following.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">For example, a possible combination is a first adhesive <b>81</b> that is charred within 10 hours by being irradiated with light of a predetermined energy density and a second adhesive <b>82</b> that is not charred after 100 hours. Note that in the experiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a first adhesive was charred in 3 hours by being irradiated with light having an energy density of 2.7 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>], whereas a second adhesive was not charred even after 250 hours.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">For example, another possible combination is a first adhesive <b>81</b> that is charred within 1 hour by being irradiated with light of a predetermined energy density and a second adhesive <b>82</b> that is not charred in 10 hours. In the experiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a first adhesive was charred in 50 minutes by being irradiated with light having an energy density of 3.6 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>], whereas a second adhesive was not charred even after 11 hours.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">For example, yet another possible combination is a first adhesive <b>81</b> that is charred within 30 minutes by being irradiated with light of a predetermined energy density and a second adhesive <b>82</b> that is not charred in 5 hours. In the experiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a first adhesive was charred in 15 minutes by being irradiated with light having an energy density of 4.5 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>], whereas a second adhesive was not charred even after 5 hours.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The second adhesive <b>82</b> has a better resistance to light than the first adhesive <b>81</b> at least for irradiation with light in the energy density range of 5.0 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>] or less. Note that depending on the environment in which the light-emitting device <b>1</b> is installed, the second adhesive <b>82</b> can have a better resistance to light than the first adhesive <b>81</b> does at least for irradiation with light in the energy density range of 1.0 [W/mm<sup>2</sup>] or less.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Note that with the light-emitting device <b>1</b>, the first adhesive <b>81</b> is more advantageous over the second adhesive <b>82</b> for some point, e.g., having an advantageous effect that cannot be achieved, or cannot be easily achieved, by the second adhesive <b>82</b>, or having an advantageous effect such that attempting to achieve the same advantageous effect with the second adhesive <b>82</b> would lower the efficiency. For example, with the light-emitting device <b>1</b>, the first adhesive <b>81</b> is used in order to efficiently bond the optical member <b>70</b> that has been positioned.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">While embodiment of the present invention have been described above, the light-emitting device of the present invention is not strictly limited to the embodiments above.
