For example, a Janus nanoparticle may have one-half of its surface composed of hydrophilic groups and the other half hydrophobic groups. This may impart properties related to the asymmetric structure or functionalization of the Janus nanoparticle. The synthesis of Janus nanoparticles may rely on selectively forming each side of a nanometer-sized particle with different chemical properties.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">This disclosure relates to the high-throughput bulk synthesis (for example, greater than 1 kilogram per hour) of Janus nanosheets. Some aspects are directed to the high-throughput bulk synthesis of Janus graphene nanosheets or graphene oxide nanosheets. The &#x201c;high-throughput&#x201d; can mean a million Janus nanosheets produced in a batch time of one or two hours in a single vessel. Janus nanomaterials have beneficial properties but the production of Janus nanomaterials in large quantities (for example, at least one kilogram per hour) has proven difficult in the past. The availability of Janus nanomaterials at commercial-scale quantities could give applications of Janus nanomaterials in several industries. Therefore, present embodiments provide for the mass production of Janus nanomaterials.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments address application of Janus nanomaterials to extract residual oil after primary recovery and secondary recovery. Nanofluid flooding is an alternative tertiary oil-recovery technique to chemical flooding. Nanoparticle fluid flooding to enhance oil recovery in reservoirs is a substitute or compliment to chemical flooding. Nanoparticle solution flooding with low concentration, for example, 0.01 weight percent (wt %) or less, of nanoparticles is applicable from environmental and economic perspectives. However, the oil recovery factor (obtained by core flooding measurement) for flooding with solutions of homogeneous nanoparticles may be below 5% with 0.01 wt % nanoparticle loading in about 2 wt % saline environment. In contrast, a nanofluid of graphene-based Janus amphiphilic nanosheets could achieve efficiency in oil recovery factor (for example, oil recovery factor of approximately 15%) with an ultralow concentration of loading (for example, less than 0.01 wt % nanoparticle loading).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Present embodiments include Janus graphene nanosheets as a material for nanofluid enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR). To synthesize Janus nanosheets in nanometer size and micrometer size ranges, a selective mono-facial modification process may be implemented, as discussed later. Previous syntheses of Janus amphiphilic nanomaterials have been based on two-dimensional interfacial reactions and which have generally produced relatively small quantities of materials, typically at milligram scale in lab bench experiments. These past techniques have been unable to produce Janus graphene-nanosheets material economically for industrial application.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In response, embodiments of the present techniques employ a lyotropic liquid-crystal phase as a template to produce Janus graphene nanosheets. The liquid-crystal phase medium may include surfactant, water, and oil to generate layered oil-water interfaces with intervals in nanometers (nm) such as approximately 10 nm, which can amplify the interfacial area significantly by at least about a million times (for example, at about 10<sup>6 </sup>order), in comparison to conventional bi-phase solution methods. Homogeneous graphene nanosheets can be incorporated into either the water layers or the oil layers in a controlled manner in the lamellar phase, and each single layer of the layered lamellar phase can serve as a nanoreactor for controllable chemical reactions at the interface. These embodiments can perform interfacial reactions and facilitate production of the Janus nanosheets in quantities more economical for industrial application. Embodiments give a first instance of producing Janus graphene nanosheets at gram levels and which are scaled to produce product at kilogram levels such as in room-temperature reactions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Lamellar phase may refer generally to packing of polar-headed long chain nonpolar-tail molecules as sheets of bilayers separated by bulk polar liquid. A particular microstructure of interest for certain embodiments is the organic lyotropic liquid-crystal with periodically structural order. This microstructure may be the so-called lamellar (La) phase or smectic A mesophase, formed in solvents with a solvent or mixtures of surfactant and cosurfactant. The surfactant may be nonionic, anionic, or cationic. The lamellar phase may consist of stacks of periodic molecular bilayer-sheets separated by layers of solvents. By adding a solvent, such as either water or oil, the bilayer separation (for example, d-spacing or d, lamellar periodicity) in the lyotropic lamellar phases can be swollen from a nanometer to tens of nanometer. A graphic illustration of the lamellar phase is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A liquid crystalline mesophase may be called lyotropic if formed by dissolving an amphiphilic mesogen in a solvent under specified conditions of concentration, temperature, and pressure. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, lyotropics liquid crystals have an additional degree of freedom in the concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases. As the concentration of amphiphilic molecules is increased, several different type of lyotropic liquid crystal structures occur in solution, and the lamellar phase may be formed. This lamellar phase is denoted by the symbol La and can be considered the lyotropic equivalent of a smectic A mesophase. The lamellar phase may consist of amphiphilic molecules arranged in bilayer sheers separated by layers of water. A mesophase may be a state of matter intermediate between liquid and solid. Gelatin is a common example of a partially-ordered structure in a mesophase.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> gives diagrams <b>100</b> of a bi-phase system <b>102</b> and a liquid-crystal system <b>108</b> having a lamellar phase <b>110</b>. The depicted bi-phase system <b>102</b> has a single oil-phase layer <b>104</b> and a single water-phase layer <b>106</b>. In contrast, the liquid crystal system <b>108</b> has a lamellar phase <b>110</b>. This liquid crystal system <b>108</b> (lamellar phase) may be the liquid crystal phase medium such as the lyotropic liquid-crystal phase. In some implementations, the lamellar phase <b>110</b> may be generally prepared by dissolving a surfactant (with or without a cosurfactant) into water and then adding an organic solvent (for example, oil or diesel) under agitation. The surfactant can be a nonionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, or an anionic surfactant. The surfactant can be a mixture of a surfactant and a cosurfactant.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In general, surfactants may be compounds that reduce the surface tension or interfacial tension between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid. With respect to the surfactants, the term &#x201c;nonionic&#x201d; may mean not ionic, not anionic, or not cationic. For a detergent, nonionic may mean that the detergent does not dissociate into ions in aqueous solution. A nonionic surfactant may have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups may be the result of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding generally decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of nonionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A representative section <b>112</b> of the lamellar phase <b>110</b> is given enlarged for clarity, and which shows the lamellar phase <b>110</b> including alternating oil layers <b>116</b> and water layers <b>118</b>. The oil layers <b>116</b> may be characterized as oil phase layers <b>116</b>. The water layers <b>118</b> may be characterized as water phase layers <b>118</b>. Further, the multiple lyotropic liquid crystals are the surfactant molecules with the hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. The surfactant molecules in the exploded view of the representative portion <b>112</b> are depicted each with a head and a tail. In implementations, the lamellar phase <b>110</b> is generally not a micelle or emulsion. The lamellar phase <b>110</b> may typically be a planar structure with surfactant hydrophilic heads contacting water <b>118</b> and surfactant hydrophobic tails contacting the organic phase (for example, oil <b>116</b>) in the illustrated implementation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The layers <b>116</b> may be an oil layer or an organic layer. The oil layers <b>116</b> may be more generally an organic layer having organic compounds (for example, chloroform) that are not oil but are hydrophobic. The oil layers <b>116</b> may include mineral oil, refined oil, crude oil, fractions of crude oil, diesel, synthetic oil, or vegetable oil. The fractions of crude oil can include organic compounds such as decane or dodecane. The water layers <b>118</b> may be more generally an aqueous layer or hydrophilic layer. The water layers <b>118</b> may include ground water, treated water (for example, demineralized water), or formation water. The water layers <b>118</b> may include components other than water such as dissolved solids. The water layers <b>118</b> as an aqueous layer may include chemical components soluble in water.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, the oil layer <b>116</b> and water layer <b>118</b> may each be labeled as a lamellar layer. While the combination of the oil layer <b>116</b> and the water layer <b>118</b> (and with their interface) may instead be labeled as the lamellar layer, this combination is typically instead labeled as a lamellar unit <b>114</b> as depicted. The lamellar unit <b>114</b> may include the oil layer <b>116</b>, the water layer <b>118</b>, the oil-water interface, and the surfactant. While the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts the layer <b>116</b> as an oil layer, the layer <b>116</b> may be an organic layer generally. Again, the surfactant is the hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. The repeating lamellar unit <b>114</b> may have a thickness, for example, in a range of 5 nanometers (nm) to 100 nm. In certain embodiments, each lamellar unit <b>114</b> may be a nanoreactor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments innovatively employ the lamellae as template media to produce Janus nanosheets. The lamellar phase <b>110</b> can generate alternating interfaces of water and oil on the nanoscale range and, therefore, the many lamellar units <b>114</b> may each be utilized respectively as a nanoreactor for chemical reactions at the water-oil interfaces. The chemical reaction can be controllably-run occurring either at the water phase side or the oil phase side of the interface.

Nanosheets can include silicon nanosheets and carbon nanosheets. A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, for example, having a thickness of about 0.34 nm. The graphene nanosheet may be an allotrope (form) of carbon consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Synthesis of the nanosheet may be a bottomup technique such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and also may be from chemical exfoliation of graphite powder. Graphene may be a structural element of other allotropes of carbon, such as graphite, diamond, charcoal, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes. Graphene is a crystalline allotrope of carbon with two-dimensional (2D) properties. The carbon atoms may be packed densely in the atomic-scale hexagonal pattern. Thus, graphene is generally a material made of carbon atoms that are bonded together in a repeating pattern of hexagons or a honeycomb pattern. Graphene can be very thin (for example, about 0.34 nm) and thus graphene can be considered pseudo 2D. The single layers of carbon atoms provide the basis for other materials. For instance, graphite is formed by stacked graphene. Carbon nanotubes are made of rolled graphene.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Graphite oxide is a compound of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in variable ratios, obtained by treating graphite with oxidizers.

Graphene oxide (GO) may be a single-atomic layered material made by oxidation of graphite. Graphene oxide may be an oxidized form of graphene, laced with oxygen-containing groups. Graphene oxide may be synthesized by different techniques. The effectiveness of an oxidation to form GO may be evaluated by the carbon/oxygen ratios of the GO in certain instances.

Therefore, the Janus nanomaterial synthesized in the lamellar phase in method <b>1100</b> generally need not be separated from the lamellar phase for application in EOR such as nanoflooding. In other words, the lamellar phase having the formed Janus nanoparticles (nanosheets) after synthesis may be collected and utilized in nanoflooding EOR. In some examples, the collection may involve discharging of the lamellar phase with the Janus nanoparticles from the vessel to a storage vessel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">As discussed earlier, a lamellar unit (nanoreactor) of the lamellar phase may include a water layer and an organic layer. Lamellar units (for example, at least 100,000 in the lamellar phase) may each include a respective water layer and respective oil layer, and where each lamellar unit may be a nanoreactor.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">At block <b>1104</b>, the method include adding or incorporating nanosheets into the lamellar phase. The nanosheets may be hydrophilic nanosheets such as GO nanosheets, and where the nanosheets are incorporated into the water layers. In examples, the nanosheets are placed into the lamellar layer, and the hydrophilic nanosheets position, migrate, or flow into the water layers because of the affinity of the hydrophilic nanosheets for the water layers. The nanosheets may be hydrophobic nanosheets such as graphene nanosheets, and where the nanosheets are incorporated into the organic layers.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">In some implementations, the forming (block <b>1102</b>) of the lamellar phase is contemporaneous with incorporating the nanosheets into the lamellar phase. For example, the forming of the lamellar phase and the incorporating of the nanosheets (for example, hydrophilic) includes forming a water suspension of the nanosheets in water and building the lamellar phase with the water suspension. Thus, as the lamellar phase forms, the nanosheets are simultaneously incorporated into the water layers in the lamellar phase.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0081">At block <b>1106</b>, the method includes adding a functional agent to the lamellar phase. For example, the method may include placing the functional agent into the organic layers or oil layers. The functional agents may be placed into the lamellar phase, and the functional agents migrate into the organic layers because of the affinity of the hydrophobic functional agents for the organic layers. In particular implementations, the functional agent is a silane coupling agent having a functional group. The functional agent may be silane-based chemical reagents. The functional agent may include silane compounds having one or more functional groups.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0082">At block <b>1108</b>, the method includes forming the Janus nanosheets. In particular, the method includes attaching the functional agent to the nanosheets in the lamellar phase to form the Janus nanosheets. The method may include allowing the functional agent to attach to the nanosheets in the lamellar phase to form Janus nanosheets as Janus nanoparticles. In one implementation, the nanosheets are hydrophilic GO nanosheets and the Janus nanoparticles formed are Janus GO nanosheets.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">The method may include attaching the functional agent to the nanosheets at interfaces of the water layers and the organic layers to form the Janus nanosheets. The Janus nanosheets may be Janus graphene nanosheets or Janus GO nanosheets that may be characterized as Janus nanomaterial or Janus nanoparticles. In certain embodiments, the functional agent is hydrophobic molecules, and where allowing the functional agent to attach to the nanosheets as hydrophilic nanosheets involves the functional agent attaching onto a surface of a hydrophilic nanosheet converting that surface to hydrophobic.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">In general, nanoreactors may be a form of chemical reactor that are particular in disciplines of nanotechnology. Nanoreactors may maintain a working nanofoundry that manufacture products on a nanoscale. A nanoreactor may carry out chemical reactions in a limited space whose size does not exceed 100 nm in at least one dimension and is physically limited by the dimensions of ordered structure elements.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">In the lamellar phase, a nanoreactor that forms Janus nanosheets may include the interface between a water layer of a lamellar phase and an organic layer (for example, oil layer) of the lamellar phase. The lamellar phase may include a surfactant such as a nonionic surfactant, anionic surfactant, or cationic surfactant. The lamellar phase may have at least 100,000 lamellar units. Thus, the lamellar phase may have at least 100,000 nanoreactors. In operation, GO nanosheets may be received into the water layer of the nanoreactor for migration to the interface. A functional agent may be received into the organic layer of the nanoreactor for migration to the interface and to be attached to one side of the GO nanosheets to form the Janus GO nanosheets. The functional agent may be a silane-based chemical reagent. In some implementations, the formed Janus GO nanosheets are not separated from the lamellar phase or nanoreactor. The lamellar phase having the Janus GO nanosheets may be applied as an EOR agent for chemical injection or flooding of a geological formation in tertiary recovery.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">Oil production may be separated into at least three phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Tertiary recovery may also be known as EOR. Primary oil recovery is generally limited to hydrocarbons that naturally rise to the surface or recovered via artificial lift devices such as pumps. Secondary recovery employs water and gas injection, displacing the oil to the surface. Primary and secondary recovery of production can leave, for example, up to 75% of the oil in the well. A way to further increase oil production is through tertiary recovery or EOR. Although typically more expensive to employ on a field, EOR can increase production from a well, for example, up to 75% recovery. Again, EOR may be labeled as tertiary recovery and can be the extraction of crude oil from an oil field that generally cannot be extracted otherwise. For example, EOR may extract 30% to 60% or more of reservoir oil compared to 20% to 40% recovery of reservoir oil employing primary and secondary recovery. The EOR may involve thermal recovery (for example, steam flooding or fire flooding), gas injection (for example, carbon dioxide), or chemical injection (for example, polymers or surfactants). More advanced speculative EOR techniques are sometimes called quaternary recovery. In EOR, physical and chemical properties of the rock may be changed to enhance the recovery of hydrocarbon. The properties of the reservoir fluid system which are affected by EOR may be chemical, biochemical, density, miscibility, interfacial tension (IFT), surface tension (ST), viscosity and thermal. Secondary recovery may involve water injection or waterflooding and in which EOR may be performed thereafter. EOR or tertiary recovery may involve flooding or waterflooding which may include chemical flooding, polymer flooding, surfactant flooding, nanoflooding such as nanofluid flooding or nano material (nanoparticle) flooding, or any combinations thereof. Embodiments herein are Janus graphene nanosheets as a material for EOR involving nanoflooding such as nanofluid (nanoparticle) flooding.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a method <b>1200</b> of using a Janus nanoparticle such as a Janus nanosheet which may be Janus GO nanosheet.

The lamellar phase may include a surfactant that is an EOR agent employed in surfactant flooding and compatible with nanofluid flooding. The Janus nanosheets (and lamellar phase) may be received into a surface vessel at the well site or received via a vessel on a vehicle to the well site.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0089">At block <b>1204</b>, the method includes introducing the Janus nanoparticles into the geological formation. The method may include applying the Janus nanosheets through the wellbore into the geological formation. The wellbore may be of a producing well or an injection well. The Janus nanosheets (or lamellar phase having the Janus nanosheets) may be injected in a fluid (for example, water) through the wellbore into the geological formation to contact hydrocarbon or hydrocabon-bearing fluid in the geological formation. The Janus nanosheets in the fluid may be pumped through the wellbore into the geological formation.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0090">At block <b>1206</b>, the method includes performing EOR through the geological formation with the Janus nanosheets.
