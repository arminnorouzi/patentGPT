The sample hold circuit <b>30</b>X outputs the received voltage TiX in a time period other than the above time period (the time period during which no pulse is being generated).

In this process, noise is generated in a time period from time T<b>5</b> to T<b>6</b> in the voltage TiY of the diode <b>6</b>Y as well as the voltage TiX of the diode <b>6</b>X (and the voltage TiZ of the diode <b>6</b>Z). In this case, the same processing as that in the time period from time T<b>2</b> to T<b>3</b> is performed with the pulse of the signal Hold in the time period from the time T<b>5</b> to T<b>6</b>. Thus, the noise is not reflected on the outputs (the voltages ToX, ToY, and ToZ) of the sample hold circuits <b>30</b>X, <b>30</b>Y, and <b>30</b>Z.
