end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the present disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the disclosure are shown. Indeed, embodiments of the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein, rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Conventional imaging apparatuses include various separated components for performing various functions. Such components include one or more illuminator sources for projecting an illumination pattern, each illuminator source coupled with separate optics (e.g., one or more lenses) for projecting the corresponding illumination pattern. Often, each separate component is fit within the apparatus utilizing one or more dedicated structural supports. Additionally, in conventional apparatuses, each separate component is fit with one or more adjustment components to enable realignment of the component. In this regard, in conventional apparatuses, as the number of components increases so too does the number of structural supports and/or adjustment components, for example often involving an increased wall thickness accumulation of the housing or chassis for the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">By including various separated components, such conventional apparatuses require sufficient space for each component, as well as corresponding structural components, adjustment components and/or alignment components. This required space not only forces an increase in apparatus size in some example conventional apparatuses, but increases material cost in manufacturing a larger unit. Furthermore, in conventional apparatuses, the structural supports for each separated component results in an irreparable offset between the various components based on the separation. For example, a conventional apparatus may include a dual-projection lenses for illumination and aimer optics, each component separate from the others. As the required spacing between the components increases, for example to allow for sufficient support structures for each component, the irreparable offset increases as well. The irreparable offset may cause any of a myriad of issues in accurately illuminating a field, capturing an image of the field, and/or accurately parsing the captured image.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally or alternatively, each separate component may be manipulated independently. In this regard, the separated components may become further misaligned. To adjust each component, conventional apparatuses may include multiple adjustment components and/or each component may require adjustment for re-alignment with respect to the other components. Requiring adjustment components for each individual component further increases the unit size of the apparatus, further increases material costs, and increases the complexity of properly aligning the components of the apparatus. When components are particularly small, such adjustments may be made even more complex, if not impossible, due to the nature of facilitating small adjustments in component positioning and/or alignment.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Example embodiments of the present disclosure address the aforementioned problems utilizing an improved layout and various improved components. For example, embodiments herein include an integrated illumination-aimer optics. The integrated illumination-aimer optics may include a plurality of sub-assemblies integrated into a limited number of pieces and, in some example embodiments, a single piece. For example, the integrated illumination-aimer optics may include one or more illumination lens and/or one or more aimer projecting optics, for example one or more aimer pattern projection optics. The integrated illumination-aimer optics may be positioned together with one or more corresponding light generators (e.g., one or more illuminator sources and/or aimer sources), for example such that the lenses of the integrated illumination-aimer optics are properly aligned with their corresponding illuminator sources.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Due to the integrated nature of the integrated illumination-aimer optics, embodiments herein may provide structural support for the integrated illumination-aimer optics without separate structural elements for each sub-assembly thereof. By reducing the individual component separation between each optical component, embodiments of the present disclosure may be manufactured in a smaller form factor as compared to conventional apparatuses. Additionally or alternatively, by integrating several components into the integrated illumination-aimer optics, embodiments herein reduce the required structural support components and alignment components to further reduce the form factor of such embodiments as compared to conventional apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The example integrated illumination-aimer optics minimizes the footprint overlap between components and sub-assemblies. In this regard, the decreased footprint enables further minimization of the required apparatus volume and front window area size to fit all components. In some embodiments, to further minimize apparatus size, the apparatus includes imaging lenses (e.g., a far-field imaging lens and/or near-field imaging lens) with a minimized front end to, in some examples, substantially increase the free front space between the imaging lenses. Further, in some examples, the increased free front space enables the apparatus to house the integrated illumination-aimer optics, for example, in the resulting free front space. In this regard, the area dedicated to the integrated illumination-aimer optics is overlapped with the image sensor areas and rear portion of the imaging lenses.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, the integrated nature of the integrated illumination-aimer optics may be adjusted and/or aligned without requiring separate alignment components. For example, in some embodiments, the alignment components of the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus enable no-adjusting alignment between an aimer source, or other aimer light generation source, and aimer pattern projection optics through press-fitting the component. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the apparatus chassis is configured to enable slide-fitting of the far-field imaging lens to ensure alignment between the aimer pattern projection optics and far-field imager. The integrated illumination-aimer optics reduces, in some examples, the space associated with each integrated component, reducing the irreparable offset between such components (for example, between one or more illumination projection lenses and aimer projection optics).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the integrated illumination-aimer optics includes specifically positioned sub-assemblies to minimize the irreparable offset introduced between components based on a prioritized alignment tolerance. For example, in some embodiments, an aimer optical sub-assembly is positioned close and/or adjacent to a far-field illumination projection lens, to utilize available space of the integrated illumination-aimer optics and to minimize the offset introduced due to the narrow field of view of the far-field imaging lens. In some such embodiments, the next alignment priority is minimizing the near-field illuminator source with closely matching the field of view for the near-field imaging lens, and the lowest alignment priority is the far-field illuminator source that projects an oversized illumination field relative to the field of view for the far-field imaging lens. In this regard, the cascaded level of alignment tolerances with over-sized matching field of view allows the near-field and far-field illuminator sources and aimer optics to be combined into the single-piece, integrated illumination-aimer optics for alignment together in the assembly by aligning the aimer optics and light generation (e.g., an aimer source).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">By eliminating or substantially reducing the space between the separate optical components integrated into the integrated illumination-aimer optics, the integrated illumination-aimer optics fully utilizes a limited surface area. The single piece design of the integrated illumination-aimer optics produces further structural advantages. For example, by combining the multiple sub-assemblies into the integrated illumination-aimer optics, the integrated illumination-aimer optics may be manufactured as a single, injection molded part. In this regard, the integrated illumination-aimer optics reduces the component count of the apparatus, and may share mounting and/or alignment features within the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Embodiments further provide specific advantages in positioning of the sub-assemblies and/or components therein. For example, in some embodiments, a multi-element near-field imaging lens and a far-field imaging lens have different focal lengths and lens assembly dimensions. Some such embodiments of the present disclosure include corresponding split-multilevel sensor boards arranged at different mounting planes. In this regard, the mounting planes for the near-field sensor and the far-field sensor are positioned to allow the lens front of each corresponding lens to be closely aligned with the front edge of the embodiment assembly (e.g., closer to a projection window). Additionally or alternatively, embodiments of the present disclosure position the integrated illumination-aimer optics within the apparatus to minimize unwanted light interference due to reflection (for example protective window reflection) and light leakage (for example through gaps between the lenses and the apparatus chassis).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example Apparatus Assemblies</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate exploded views depicting components of an example integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure.

The apparatus chassis <b>106</b> may be specifically designed to house, position, and/or otherwise align the various components as described herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the circuit board <b>114</b> embodies a printed circuit board configured for mounting a plurality of components. For example, in at least one example embodiment, the circuit board <b>114</b> embodies a rigid flex circuit board (e.g., a rigid flex PCB) to minimize connector space and thus reduce the overall profile associated with the components thereof. In at least some example embodiments, the circuit board <b>114</b> is configured for mounting a plurality of imaging sensors, such as the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A and the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B, and one or more light generation components, such as the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A, near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B, and aimer source <b>110</b>. As illustrated, the circuit board <b>114</b> is configured to secure each of the components at a particular position within a multi-layered structure. Specifically, as illustrated, the circuit board <b>114</b> comprises a first, back layer for securing the position of the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B, another layer for securing the position of the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A and also for securing the position of the aimer source <b>110</b>, and a front layer for securing the position of the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A and near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B. In this regard, utilizing the various layers, the circuit board <b>114</b> is designed to enable specific positions of each component within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the circuit board <b>114</b> superficially positions each component at a particular distance from the front of the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> to enable subsequent components to fit in proper alignment with each component positioned via the circuit board <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the various components are fixedly attached to the printed circuit board, for example the circuit board <b>114</b>, to secure an electrical connection between the various components and the printed circuit board through one or more known means (e.g., soldered connections).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally or alternatively, as illustrated, the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes a near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A.

The near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A embodies an imaging lens configured to allow light from a specific near-field field of view to pass through to a corresponding imaging sensor, thus enabling capture of the near-field field of view by the corresponding sensor. For example as illustrated, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A is to be aligned with the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A, such that the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A receives light via the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A. In this regard, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A may be specifically positioned within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> via one or more structural support components as described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Similarly, the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes a far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B. An example embodiment of far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B is discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. The far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B embodies an imaging lens configured to allow light from a specific far-field field of view to pass through to a corresponding imaging sensor, thus enabling capture of the far-field field of view by the corresponding sensor. For example as illustrated, the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B is to be aligned with the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B, such that the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B receives light via the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B. In this regard, the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B may be specifically positioned within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> via one or more structural support components as described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B are each constructed with different focal lengths, field of views, and/or the like. In this regard, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B may be utilized to capture different images based on the focal lengths, field of views, or other optical configurations of the lenses. In other embodiments, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and far-field imaging lens are each associated with a shared focal length and/or shared field of view. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments, one or more additional lenses may be included, for example having a third focal length and/or third field of view, or a shared focal length and/or field of view.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally, as illustrated, the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes an integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>. An example embodiment of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. The integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> comprises a number of sub-assemblies for projecting corresponding illumination patterns and an aimer pattern based on light produced by one or more associated light generation components. In this regard, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may be configured for specific positioning within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>, for example to enable alignment with one or more corresponding light generation components (e.g., illuminator sources and/or aimer source). In some embodiments, the integrated illumination-aimer optics comprise a single piece, for example an injection molded component such that no, or substantially no, excess space remains between the various sub-assemblies therein. It should be appreciated that the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may be formed of any of a number of known lens materials, for example injection-molded plastic.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A may be embodied by any of a number of light generation components. In some embodiments, the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A is embodied by one or more light emitting diodes (&#x201c;LED&#x201d;), for example where the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A is embodied by a first light emitting diode. The near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B similarly may be embodied by any of a number of light generation components. In some embodiments, the near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B is embodied by one or more LEDs, for example where the near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B is embodied by a second LED. In some embodiments, the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A and near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B produce light at different intensity levels and/or patterns. In other embodiments, the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A and near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B produce light at the same intensity level.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The aimer source <b>110</b> may be embodied by any of a number of light generation components. In some embodiments, the aimer source <b>110</b> is embodied by any of a number of high-intensity LEDs that produce a high-intensity coherent and/or monochromatic light source. The aimer source <b>110</b> is aligned for projecting light through a particular component of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>, for example for projection via a sub-assembly of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>. It should be appreciated that the aimer source <b>110</b> may be embodied by any of a number of known LEDs, laser diodes or other components, and/or devices. In at least one example embodiment, the aimer source <b>110</b> comprises a laser diode configured to produce a narrow laser beam of light with high intensity and concentration, such that the produced aimer laser beam may be utilized to produce a high-visibility aimer pattern, even at far distances (e.g., when projected to a far-field).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a front-angled view of the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> with all components positioned within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>.

For example, the circuit board <b>114</b> is specifically positioned with respect to the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. In this regard, the various components of the circuit board <b>114</b> are configured for positioning and alignment at predefined positions within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. The near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A and far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B are split apart (e.g., located at opposite ends of the length of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>), reducing, in some examples, the likelihood of unwanted light pollution resulting from sensors being too closely related. Additionally, the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A and far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B are positioned at different distances from the front of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. In this regard, the sensors are positioned to enable the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> to fit corresponding imaging lenses, and align the lenses towards the front of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> rather than having the</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A is specifically positioned in front of, and aligned with, the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A. Similarly, the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B is specifically positioned in front of, and aligned with, the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B. The apparatus chassis <b>106</b> is configured to provide support structures for positioning the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B in their corresponding specific and aligned positions. Specifically, as illustrated, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B are positioned for front-end alignment within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> despite their size difference. Similarly, the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A is positioned at a distance from the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A different from the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B distance from the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B. In this regard, the lenses <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>B are positioned specifically to maintain the front alignment without affecting the effectiveness of sensors <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A is embodied by an imaging sensor for capturing and/or capturing and processing light received through the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A. Similarly, the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B is embodied by a second imaging sensor for capturing and/or capturing and processing light received through the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B. In some embodiments, the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A is configured as a different pixel resolution as compared to the far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B. It should be appreciated that the near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A and/or far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B may be embodied by any of a number of known imaging sensors. A non-limiting example of a near-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>A includes the AR0234 global shutter monochrome sensor (1920&#xd7;1200 resolution, 3 um pixel), and a non-limiting example of a far-field imaging sensor <b>112</b>B includes the AR0144 global shutter monochrome sensor (1280&#xd7;800 resolution, 3 um pixel), each manufactured by ON Semiconductor&#xae; headquartered in Phoenix, Ariz.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>. The integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is positioned, for example using support structures of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> as described below, between the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B. Additionally, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is aligned, for example using support structures of the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> as described below, in with the near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B (not depicted), far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A (not depicted), and aimer source <b>110</b>. In this regard, the near-field illuminator source <b>108</b>B produces light that, through a sub-assembly of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, produces a particular near-field light pattern onto a particular field. Similarly, the far-field illuminator source <b>108</b>A produces light that, through a second sub-assembly of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, produces a second particular far-field light pattern onto the field. Additionally, the aimer source <b>110</b> produces light that, through a third-subassembly of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, produces an aimer pattern that is projected onto the field.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is positioned between the near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A and the far-field imaging lens <b>104</b>B. Specifically, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> fits between the reduced lens fronts of the two lenses <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>B. Such positioning enables a decrease in the overall required volume for the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b>. Additionally, as illustrated, the various sub-assemblies and components are positioned to overlap, such that the volume of the integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is maximized (e.g., little or no excess volume for various components or excess support and/or alignment structures).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other embodiments, it should be appreciated that any number of lenses, illuminator sources, and/or corresponding sensors may be provided. For example, in some embodiments, an embodiment apparatus includes at least one additional lens each with a corresponding additional illuminator source and additional imaging sensor. In this regard, in such embodiments, it should be appreciated that the integrated illumination-aimer optics may be expanded to include additional sub-assemblies embodying illumination optics corresponding to each additional illuminator source. Similarly, the arrangement of such sub-assemblies may be altered as the number of sub-assemblies increases (e.g., to match the shape arrangement of the corresponding illuminator sources).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the arrangement of illuminator sources and corresponding imaging lenses may be limited based on one or more volumetric restriction requirements. For example, in some conventional mobile apparatus chasses, a height restriction of 6.8 mm is imposed to fit the mobile apparatus chassis. As such, linear arrangements may be required to ensure that a plurality of components fits within the mobile apparatus chassis. Further, the components may be arranged to maximize the distance between each illuminator source and corresponding imaging lens. As such, integrated illumination-aimer optics may include a plurality of sub-assemblies corresponding to each illuminator source arranged in a particular manner to maximize such distances within a corresponding apparatus. For example, in an apparatus with three illuminator sources having three projection pattern optics (S1, S2, S3) and three corresponding imaging lenses (L1, L2, L3), the components may be arranged linearly as L1-53-52-S1-L3-L2, with S1-S2-S3 arranged as subassemblies of an integrated illumination-aimer optical component. In this manner, the linear arrangement may enable the components to fit within a low-height apparatus chassis, while the arrangement between such components minimizes the likelihood of errors due to reflected light from each corresponding illuminator source. It should be appreciated that similar arrangements may be designed as the number of components increases, and alternative arrangements may be designed for the same number of components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this regard, in at least some embodiments, embodiments are arranged including the integrated illumination-aimer optics such that each illumination projection lens of the integrated illumination-aimer optics is positioned at a set threshold distance from its corresponding imaging lens (e.g., a set lateral distance). In some embodiments, such arrangements are achieved by positioning the integrated illuminator-aimer optics between one or more imaging lenses, for example as described above, such that each illumination projection lens of an integrated illumination-aimer optics is at the same threshold distance from its corresponding imaging lens regardless of the direction for the distance between the illumination projection lens and corresponding imaging lens (e.g., one or more illumination projection lens may be separated by the threshold distance to corresponding imaging lenses to the right of the illumination projection lens, and one or more illumination projection lens may be separated by the threshold distance to corresponding imaging lenses to the left of the illumination projection lens). In other embodiments, such arrangements are achieved by positioning the integrated illuminator-aimer optics in an alternative position with respect to one or more imaging lenses. For example, in some embodiments, the integrated illuminator-aimer optics is positioned such that the imaging lenses are arranged together where each imaging lens is the same threshold distance from a corresponding illumination projection lens of the integrated illumination-aimer optics in a single direction. In one non-limiting example for three illumination projection optics (S1, S2, S3) of an integrated illumination-aimer optics and three imaging lenses (L1, L2, L3), where each lens is associated with the corresponding, similarly numbered illumination projection optics (e.g., S1 and L1 are associated for purposes of projecting and processing, S2 and L2, and so on), example apparatuses may arrange the components in the arrangement of L1-L2-L3-S1-S2-S3 or similarly S1-S2-S3-L1-L2-L3. For example and explanatory purposes, if each component is associated with a unit size of 1 unit, then the threshold distance for each component is 3 units (e.g., S1 and L1 are separated by 3 units, S2 and L2 by 3 units, and S3 and L3 by 3 units). It should be appreciated that other embodiments may similarly include each imaging lens and corresponding illumination projection optics subassembly of an integrated illumination-aimer optics are separated (e.g., according to a vertical and/or horizontal position) by the same threshold distance. In this regard, embodiments may include any number of additional imaging lens corresponding to any number of additional image sensors, and any number of additional illuminator source corresponding to any number of additional illumination projection lens of the integrated illumination-aimer optics.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated, the sub-assemblies and/or components of integrated illumination-aimer imaging apparatus <b>100</b> are positioned and/or aligned utilizing various structural supports.

Further, by integrating the various imaging lenses and aimer optics into a single piece, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may be positioned, secured, and/or aligned without requiring individual adjustments of each small component.

In this regard, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> reduces the form factor typically associated with these components, decreasing the overall required volume for fitting the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> within an apparatus and allowing for utilization of a smaller apparatus chassis. Further, by reducing the distance between the aimer pattern projection optics <b>306</b> and the near-field illumination projection lens <b>302</b>, and similarly reducing the distance between the aimer pattern projection optics <b>306</b> and the far-field illumination projection lens <b>304</b>, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> reduces inherent, irreparable offset between the resulting projections from such components, for example described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>.

In addition to being configured for aligning the near-field imaging lens and the far-field imaging lens within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>, the near-field lens fitting <b>610</b> and far-field lens fitting <b>612</b> are designed to support lens focusing adjustment by rotating the lens against the ramp fitting features. Matching field aperture baffle rims are also included behind each of the near-field lens fitting <b>610</b> and far-field lens fitting <b>612</b> to reduce and/or otherwise eliminate undesired light from reaching one or more imaging sensors also housed within the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>, for example as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. In this regard, the near-field lens fitting <b>610</b> is followed with near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b>, which functions as a baffle to minimize or prevent light leak between the near-field imaging lens and apparatus chassis. Near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b> is positioned near the back end of the housing for the near-field imaging lens, for example to prevent light leakage that occurs between the near-field imaging lens and the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. Similarly, far-field lens securing rim <b>604</b> is positioned near the back end of the housing for the far-field imaging lens, for example to prevent light leakage that occurs between the far-field imaging lens and the apparatus chassis <b>106</b>. In this regard, the near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b> may be configured to closely match the lens light path size and the shape at the location of the near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b>, and/or far-field lens securing rim <b>604</b> may be configured to closely match the lens light path size and the shape at the location of the far-field lens securing rim <b>604</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some such embodiments, the near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b> is configured to engage the near-field imaging lens, for example near-field imaging lens <b>104</b>A, to minimize or eliminate any spacing between the apparatus chassis <b>106</b> and the near-field imaging lens.

For example, further discussion on preventing negative effects caused by undesired light (e.g., through light leak) are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example depiction of light leak that is addressed by some embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, the illustrated apparatus includes an integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> positioned between a near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and a far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B within an apparatus chassis <b>702</b>. As depicted and described above, the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B each comprise a reduced radius front end to provide additional volume and to enable positioning of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> within the apparatus chassis <b>702</b>. It should be appreciated that the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is positioned and/or aligned with one or more illuminator sources, for example a near-field illuminator source (not depicted) and a far-field illuminator source (not depicted), each configured for projecting one or more illumination patterns.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this regard, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is positioned closely to the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B and the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A (e.g., with no extra space, or substantially no excess space, between the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> and the surrounding lenses). The cylindrical shape of the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and of the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B, and/or the reduced space front end, the gap between the lenses and the apparatus chassis may introduce light leaking, whereas conventional apparatuses utilizing conventional lens fitting methodologies may not be susceptible to such light leaking. Due to the minimal space between the lenses and the apparatus chassis, attempts to fill the gap (e.g., using an opaque adhesive for example) may not be sufficient as the gap area is often too small to effectively access for such purposes. Accordingly, in some such embodiments where light leak affects the functioning of one or more imaging sensors, embodiments must address light leak using alternative methods not applicable to conventional apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The close positioning of the various components increases the likelihood that light produced through the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> interferes with proper light flow via the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and/or far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B. For example, regardless of the minimal space between the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, at least some light may still stream between such minimal space. In this regard, light may be reflected and leak between the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, as indicated via the light leak indicator <b>706</b>. Similarly, light may be reflected and leak between the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> (not depicted). Similarly, in some embodiments, the intensity of the light projections from the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may reflect such that light is reflected towards the front end of the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and/or far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates one such example of how light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> reflects within example embodiments of the present disclosure, for example to cause the light leak described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. As described, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is configured to produce one or more projected patterns, including (for example) a near-field illumination pattern and a far-field illumination pattern. The light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may flow through the apparatus for projecting onto a field, for example to enable 2D barcode scanning within the field. In this regard, in some embodiments, the light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> interacts with a protective window <b>802</b> and is subsequently projected unto a projection field. The protective window <b>802</b> may be embodied by glass and/or plastic to enable the light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> to pass through unto the projection field. The protective window <b>802</b> may be fixedly secured to a unit housing, for example where the unit housing includes the apparatus depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As a non-limiting example, the unit housing may comprise a mobile device chassis, or other handheld apparatus chassis (e.g., a conventional scanner housing).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">However, it should be appreciated that some of the light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may reflect off the protective window <b>802</b>, as it is nearly impossible to prevent any light from reflecting off the protective window <b>802</b>. For example, the light produced via the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> may reflect as indicated by the light reflection indicators <b>804</b>. In this regard, the produced light may reflect multiple times between the protective window and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>. Based on the curvature of the sub-assemblies of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, it should be appreciated that the various reflections of the produced light may differ, and the light reflection indicators <b>804</b> are simplified depictions for purposes of explanation only and not to limit the scope and spirit of the disclosure herein.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As illustrated, the produced light may reflect between the protective window <b>802</b> and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> until the light interacts with one or more other components of the illustrated apparatus. For example, as illustrated, at least some of the reflected light may be reflected between the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A and the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>, as well as the apparatus chassis <b>702</b>, leading the light leak described above with respect to light leak indicator <b>704</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Additionally or alternatively, at least some of the reflected light may be reflected into the front end of the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A, for example by reflecting off the protective window <b>802</b>. Preventing such light from entering the lenses and/or light leak between the components of the apparatus is desirable to ensure that imaging sensors associated with each of the lenses <b>704</b>A and <b>704</b>B are not improperly and/or negatively affected by such light. In some embodiments, any number of components are positioned and/or configured to minimize light reflection and/or corresponding light leak to an acceptable level. For example, in some embodiments, the apparatus is positioned within an acceptable distance threshold from the protective window <b>802</b>, the protective window <b>802</b> comprises a thickness within an acceptable reflective thickness threshold, one or more additional lens baffles are included in the apparatus chassis to minimize the effects of reflected light, and/or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Embodiments of the present disclosure implement various example features to minimize and/or prevent such negative effects. For example, by decreasing the front end radius of the near-field imaging lens and far-field imaging lens as compared to the corresponding back end radius of the lenses, embodiments decrease the likelihood that reflected light will enter the lenses and affect the corresponding imaging sensors. Such advantages are provided in addition to enabling sufficient volume for including the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> within the apparatus. Further, in embodiments that utilize a cylindrical lens shape, the circular front end prevents an uneven distribution of light from entering at corners and/or junctions in the lens construction.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> comprises sub-assemblies specifically positioned to reduce the effects of reflected light. For example, as illustrated, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> comprises a near-field illumination projection lens <b>302</b> and a far-field illumination projection lens <b>304</b>. The near-field illumination projection lens <b>302</b> is positioned adjacent to the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B and further from the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A (e.g., separated by at least the width of the far-field illumination projection lens <b>304</b>). In this regard, the number of reflections required for the light produced via the near-field illumination projection lens to affect the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A (either through light leak or by entering the lens) increases, decreasing the severity and/or likelihood of negative effects due to such light with each reflection as indicated by the light reflection indicators <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Additionally or alternatively, to minimize the effects of such reflected light in causing light leak, the apparatus may include one or more lens securing rims. For example, apparatus chassis <b>702</b> may be designed to include a far-field lens securing rim, for example as illustrated and described above with respect to far-field lens securing rim <b>604</b>, for minimizing and/or otherwise preventing light leak with respect to the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B. Similarly, the apparatus chassis <b>702</b> may be designed to include a near-field lens securing rim, for example illustrated and described above with respect to near-field lens securing rim <b>602</b>, for minimizing and/or otherwise preventing light leak with respect to the near-field imaging lens <b>704</b>A. In some embodiments, for example where light leak between the far-field imaging lens <b>704</b>B and the apparatus chassis <b>702</b> is minimal or determined not to cause negative effects, the apparatus chassis <b>702</b> may only comprise a near-field lens securing rim.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the protective window <b>802</b> is coated with an anti-reflective coating to minimize the light that is reflected off the protective front window <b>802</b>. Such an anti-reflective coating may be utilized to minimize the intensity of light that is reflected off the protective window <b>802</b>. Additionally or alternatively yet, in some embodiments, the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> and/or one or more sub-assemblies thereof, are coated with an anti-reflective coating to minimize the intensity of light that is reflected off the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the entirety of the integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> is coated in an anti-reflective coating. In other embodiments, at least the far-field illumination projection lens, for example the far-field illumination projection lens <b>304</b>, is coated in an anti-reflective coating. In some embodiments, the protective window <b>802</b> and/or integrated illumination-aimer optics <b>102</b> are coated with an anti-reflective coating to control the effects of reflected light to within an acceptable level (e.g., below a threshold intensity of undesired light that impacts a corresponding imaging sensor). In some embodiments, the acceptable level is determined based on the relative ratio of the working signal level produced by the apparatus as compared to the unwanted reflection contribution, for example where the relative ratio must be equal to or greater than a desired threshold (e.g., the working signal level is 10 times higher).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Visualizations for Alignment Improvement Provided by Embodiments of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrate example visualizations of alignment improvement provided by embodiments of the present disclosure.

Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> includes an aimer pattern <b>902</b>A, an image area <b>904</b>A, and an illumination pattern <b>906</b>A. In this regard, the aimer pattern <b>902</b>A may be projected via one or more components of a prior art apparatus, for example a laser and associated separate aimer pattern projecting optics for projecting the aimer pattern <b>902</b>A. Similarly, the illumination pattern <b>906</b>A may be projected via one or more other components of the prior art apparatus, for example a light generation component (e.g., a LED) and associated independent illumination pattern projecting optics, for projecting the illumination pattern <b>906</b>A. The image area <b>904</b>A may represent the visible area associated with particular imaging optics, for example a near-field imaging lens and/or far-field imaging lens, of the prior art apparatus.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">To minimize errors in capturing and/or analyzing images of the projection field, it is desirable for the aimer pattern <b>902</b>A, image area <b>904</b>A, and illumination pattern <b>906</b>A to be as aligned as possible. In this regard, the aimer pattern <b>902</b>A, image area <b>904</b>A, and illumination pattern <b>906</b>A should be centered at the same point, or as closely as possible. As illustrated, the aimer pattern <b>902</b>A, image area <b>904</b>A and illumination pattern <b>906</b>A are grossly misaligned. The depicted alignment is due to irreparable offset between the various components of the prior art apparatus. In such prior art apparatuses, the projections are offset dependent on the physical spacing between the various components of the apparatus. Such spacing is fixed, and thus the corresponding misalignment results even when each component properly positioned and aligned. In this regard, it should be appreciated that the irreparable offset caused by such misalignment cannot be calibrated at all distances (e.g., for a far-field and a near-field). In this regard, even when an apparatus is calibrated for a particular intended distance, such calibration does not control for other distances (e.g., the irreparable offset between components will result in a projection mismatch that is more noticeable at certain distances).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates example projected pattern alignment in embodiment imaging apparatuses utilizing an integrated illumination-aimer optics.
