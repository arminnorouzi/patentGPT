The explainable sales outcomes that are obtained from the first explainable AI model <b>112</b>A are also provided as an input to train the second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B. The persona attributes <b>302</b> may be, for example, data associated with hiring, diversity, competencies, attrition, learning and enablement, mentorship, level of experience, etc. The activities executed by the personas <b>304</b> may be, for example, scheduling meetings with customers, internal meetings with the team to complete objectives, completing training sessions, follow-up communication with customers, etc. The second trained explainable AI model generates one or more personalized recommendations <b>310</b>. The one or more personalized recommendations <b>310</b> may include an automated reminder for the persona <b>306</b> and an activity execution for the persona <b>308</b>. The automated reminder fir the persona <b>306</b> may include a specific action item for the persona to improve in a specific area and steps to implement the specified action item by executing the activity <b>308</b> when the automated reminder <b>306</b> is received. The automated reminder fir the persona <b>306</b> may be periodic, like weekly, monthly, or daily. The second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B generates the enhanced sales outcomes for the persona once the persona completes the suggested activity. The enhanced sales outcomes for the persona are fed back to the first explainable AI model <b>112</b>A and the second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B in real-time. Hence, the training of the first explainable AI model <b>112</b>A and the second explainable. AI model <b>112</b>B may be improved further.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the multi variate AI data model <b>204</b> establishes the derived key drivers (learning, assessment score on product knowledge) that impact sales outcomes. That means the derived key drivers (learning, assessment score on product knowledge) are key to improving selected sales outcomes. These derived key drivers (learning, assessment score on product knowledge) are coupled with the current assessment scores, sales activities for the persona, and are fed to the first explainable AI model <b>112</b>A to determine that learning, assessment score impacts the win rate, a specific sales outcome that is particularly important for this persona and their business objectives.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">This explainability of sales outcomes is then fed to the second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B together with attributes of the personas (current learning, assessment score on product knowledge) and activities of the persona (learning records and participation in product training), to generate a personalized recommendation to the persona to improve their win rate by participating in product trainings improving their learning, assessment score for the selected product.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B generates a personalized recommendation to the persona, including an automated reminder to take the product training and the steps to participate in the training and improve the learning, assessment score on product knowledge, leading to an enhanced win rate over time for this persona.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, using the first explainable AI model <b>112</b>A and the second explainable AI model <b>112</b>B, present performance attributes and activities of the first persona <b>104</b>A are compared with at least one of (i) past performance attributes of the first persona <b>104</b>A, (ii) attributes of a second persona <b>104</b>B, (iii) an average performance of a team, (iv) an average performance of an organization, and (v) an average performance of personas across organizations within an industry. The average performance of personas (sales reps) within the industry may be obtained by aggregating the performances of the personas (sales reps) who work for customers of the sales intelligence server <b>110</b>, who are from the same industry, after de-identification of the customers and the persona's personal information.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Sales-behavior insights of one or more personas predict and enhance sales outcomes and sales productivity by up to 20%. In some embodiments, the sales ramp period of the first persona is accelerated by 20-50% using the predictable and enhanced sales outcome. The sales ramp-up period may be defined as the amount of time taken for a new sales hire to reach full productivity and begin providing value to the sales team. In some embodiments, the go-to-market (GTM) efficiency is improved by enhancing the return on investment (ROI) of learning and hiring initiatives and reducing the attrition of the first persona based on the predictable and enhanced sales outcome. In some embodiments, the revenue operations effectiveness is also accelerated due to the improvement of the sales performance of the first persona from grade B to grade A.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram <b>400</b> that illustrates a method for generating at least one recommendation that is personalized to achieve enhanced sales outcomes for a persona based on a multivariate artificial intelligence (AI) data model from an integrated dataset and explainable AI models according to some embodiments herein.
