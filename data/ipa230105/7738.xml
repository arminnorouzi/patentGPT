For example, a bathroom mirror may become foggy as the room fills with steam caused by the shower. The mirror may remain fogged for an extended period after the condensation first forms, preventing it from being used for its intended purpose. Previous attempts to address this problem have been met with limited success. Although ceiling fans and exhaust fans may clear steam, they are generally not automated. Further, existing automated solutions do not adequately anticipate when condensation will form, and thus are not triggered in sufficient time to prevent condensation. It is therefore desired for a method, system, or device for preventing condensation on a mirror, glass, or other object in an automatic fashion.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure may be directed, in one aspect, to an assembly comprising a condensation mitigation device positioned on or near an object; a processor operably coupled to the condensation mitigation device; an ambient temperature sensor configured to sense an ambient temperature; and a humidity sensor configured to sense a humidity; wherein the processor is operably coupled to the ambient temperature sensor and the humidity sensor; and wherein the processor is configured to determine a dewpoint temperature based on the ambient temperature and the humidity; repeat the determination of the dewpoint temperature for different times; determine a regression for the determined dewpoint temperatures; and transmit a control signal to begin activating the condensation mitigation device; wherein the transmission of the control signal is based on the regression for the determined dewpoint temperatures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another aspect, the present disclosure may be directed to a method for preventing condensation on a surface of an object.
