A current trend is to use adhesive tapes or adhesive films instead of bolts. At the same time, such products are also subjected to relatively high requirements for controlling odors coming from raw materials. Moreover, a current trend in the development of electronic products such as notebooks and hand-held mobile terminals is to design them to be smaller, lighter, thinner and, likewise, to having higher production efficiency. Given these trends, more and more polymer materials, e.g., plastic and rubber, are required in the design and manufacturing of such products. Therefore, adhesive products with high bonding strength in these materials need to be used so as to achieve firm bonding with a small bonding area and to also achieve the effect of having low odors.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes are a type of widely-used adhesive products. Bonding thereof can be achieved by applying small amounts of pressure for a short duration and without high-temperature curing at a temperature higher than 160&#xb0; C. The pressure sensitive adhesive tapes can be used for bonding directly after die-cutting, and continuous production thereof can be achieved. However, one critical disadvantage of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes is the weak bonding strength thereof, which generally does not exceed 1 MPa, thus making such adhesive tapes unsuitable for small area bonding.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another widely used adhesive product is the foam tape. Similar to the pressure sensitive adhesives, bonding can be achieved by foam adhesive tapes as long as a small pressure is applied for a short duration and without a need for high-temperature curing at a temperature higher than 160&#xb0; C. Foam tapes can also be used for bonding directly after die-cutting, can achieve continuous production, and also have a higher bonding strength than pressure sensitive adhesives. However, the foam adhesive tape has a critical disadvantage of producing strong odors. Thus it is not suitable for use in interiors of household appliances or automobiles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Patent application US2002/182955A1 (Weglewski) reveals an adhesive tape with a fiber-reinforced single-layer structure. However, this structural adhesive tape requires adhesive film to be reinforced by a specific fiber to achieve desirable shape retention and bonding strength, thereby making the manufacturing process significantly more complex and causing significant increases in costs. In addition, the production process of this structural adhesive tape also requires vacuum hot pressing to achieve a desirable attaching effect, thereby causing significant increases in cost, causing harsh and undesirable conditions in the production process, and making this process difficult to industrialize.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in this field adhesive films or adhesive tapes in the art that can exhibit desirable initial adhesivity is an expected development. It is hoped that such adhesive films or adhesive tapes will have high structural strength after curing, odorlessness or low odors, and cohesive failure after curing, so as to improve the stability of the bonding, and to also solve the problem of common overflow.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, the present invention aims to provide a novel ultraviolet (UV) curable composition, adhesive film or tape, which can achieve a good balance among the initial adhesivity, structural strength after curing, odorlessness or low odors, cohesive failure mode, and other aspects.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a UV curable composition comprising, based on the total weight thereof as 100 wt %:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">25 to 60 wt % of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">20 to 60 wt % of an epoxy resin;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">5 to 20 wt % of glass bubbles;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">0.3 to 8 wt % of a hydroxy-containing compound; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">0.5 to 5 wt % of a photoinitiator, wherein</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0014">the glass bubbles meet at least one of the following conditions A and B:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0015">A. the average true density of the glass bubbles ranges from 0.35 g/cc to 0.6 g/cc; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0016">B. the hydrostatic pressure at which 10 vol % of the glass bubbles collapse is at least 20 MPa.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a UV curable adhesive film, where the UV curable adhesive film is prepared by the UV curable composition as described above.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0018">According to a further aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a UV curable adhesive tape, where the UV curable adhesive tape comprises the UV curable adhesive film as described above.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0019">Advantages of the present invention include, but are not limited to the following aspects:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0020">The present invention provides a UV curable composition with specific components. In the composition, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with elastomeric performance of rubber is employed as the basic material, an epoxy resin is employed as the curable material, and glass bubbles are employed as the filler. Glass bubbles can function for filling in the adhesive film system and can also appropriately reduce the strength of the cured structural adhesive film so that the failure mode of cured adhesive film is cohesive failure of cured adhesive itself when it is damaged, thereby improving bonding reliability.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0021">In addition, a high molecular weight ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer is employed in the UV curable composition for forming the UV curable adhesive film structure of the present invention, and the use of an organic solvent is avoided in the process of preparing the adhesive film, allowing the UV curable adhesive film obtained by the present invention to have a property of a low odor or odorlessness.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0022">In addition, the adhesive film according to the present invention can be formed by, for example, a hot-melt extrusion method, thereby easily and conveniently preparing the desired adhesive film. Preferably, the adhesive film prepared by the hot-melt extrusion method has a wider thickness range.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0023">Moreover, the UV curable adhesive film provided by the present invention exhibits properties of ordinary pressure sensitive adhesive tapes at the initial stage of bonding, i.e., it has initial adhesivity, and it can bond to the adherend through the application of a small amount of pressure and can be subjected to die-cutting. The adhesive film can be cured to an adhesive tape with semi-structural strength to structural strength at room temperature after UV initiation, so it can bond to some plastics that are not resistant to high temperature, e.g., polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS). Furthermore, the adhesive film of the present invention has no odor or has a low odor, being particularly suitable for bonding between plastic parts, or between plastic parts and metal parts in internal members of household appliances and automobiles, as well as in hand-held mobile terminals of electronic products.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0024">After intensive research, the inventors of the present invention have unexpectedly found that the UV curable composition formed by adding appropriate glass bubbles can achieve a relatively good cohesive failure mode after curing, so as to provide a UV curable adhesive film with excellent performance balance.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0025">In the present invention, a UV curable adhesive film is formed through the use of a UV curable composition of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer/epoxy resin hybrid system with a specific composition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0026">As used in the description of an adhesive film herein, the term &#x201c;curable&#x201d; means that the adhesive film or composition mentioned can be cured through chemical reaction of the epoxy resin component in the adhesive film or composition initiated by the photoinitiator therein under UV-light induction. In the present invention, after UV-light irradiation or induction, even after removal of the UV source, the epoxy group can be further initiated to react at room temperature, thus completing the curing process (so-called active polymerization process). In addition, the adhesive films of the present invention are all produced by the hot-melt method to avoid the use of solvents so as to achieve the effect of a low odor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">The low-odor UV curable adhesive film provided by the present invention exhibits the property (i.e., initial adhesivity) of ordinary pressure sensitive adhesive tapes at the initial stage of bonding, and it can bond to the adherend by applying a small amount of pressure and can be subjected to die-cutting; and after UV induction, the adhesive film can be cured to an adhesive tape with semi-structural strength to structural strength at room temperature after UV initiation, so it can bond to some plastics that are not resistant to high temperature, e.g., PC, PMMA, ABS, etc. Also, the UV curable composition of the present invention contains no solvent and the adhesive film is produced by the solvent-free hot-melt extrusion method so that the requirement of a low odor or odorlessness can be met, which is particularly suitable for bonding between plastic parts, or between plastic parts and metal parts in internal members of household appliances and automobiles, as well as in hand-held mobile terminals of electronic products.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;structural adhesive&#x201d; refers to an adhesive with a shear strength greater than 1000 psi between the adhesive tape and the bonding part (where 1 MPa is about 145 psi); the term &#x201c;structural strength&#x201d; refers to the shear strength equal to or greater than 1000 psi of the bonding component formed by the adhesive tape and the bonding part; and the term &#x201c;semi-structural strength&#x201d; refers to the shear strength greater than 100 psi but less than 1000 psi of the bonding component formed by the adhesive tape and the bonding part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0029">All figures for denoting characteristic dimensions, quantities and physicochemical properties used in this specification and claims are to be understood as modified by a term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in all situations, unless indicated otherwise. Therefore, unless stated conversely, parameters in numerical values listed in the above specification and the claims are all approximate values, and those skilled in the art are capable of seeking to obtain desired properties by taking advantage of contents of the teachings disclosed herein, and changing these approximate values appropriately. The use of numerical ranges represented by end points includes all figures within that range as well as any range within that range. For example, the range &#x201c;1 to 5&#x201d;, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0030">In embodiments of the present invention, the present invention provides a UV curable composition. The UV curable composition comprises, based on the total weight thereof as 100 wt %: 25 to 60 wt % of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; 20 to 60 wt % of an epoxy resin; 5 to 20 wt % of glass bubbles; 0.3 to 8 wt % of a hydroxy-containing compound; and 0.5 to 5 wt % of a photoinitiator, where the glass bubbles meet at least one of the following conditions A and B: A. the average true density of the glass bubbles ranges from 0.35 g/cc to 0.6 g/cc; and B. the hydrostatic pressure at which 10 vol % of the glass bubbles collapse is at least 20 MPa.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0031">Each component will be described below in detail.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0032">a) Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate Copolymer</p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">In the UV curable composition of the present invention, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with the elastomeric performance of rubber is used as a basic material. The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) used in the invention may be an un-crosslinked or non-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate linear copolymer, or may be a pre-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with a certain degree of crosslinking. According to the present invention, the term &#x201c;pre-crosslinked&#x201d; means that the crosslinking degree of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer obtained by the ionizing radiation crosslinking method is in the range of 50% to 70%, characterized by the gel content.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">In some preferred embodiments, the content of the vinyl acetate repeating unit in the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is between 60-90 wt %, and preferably between 70-80 wt %. This is because the higher the content of vinyl acetate is, the higher the Tg of the copolymer is, and the higher the modulus of the cured adhesive film is, thereby making the obtained adhesive film or adhesive tape have higher shear strength.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer used in the present invention is preferably an un-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate linear copolymer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">According to the technical solution of the invention, the UV curable composition comprises 25-60 wt %, preferably 30-55 wt % and more preferably 40-45 wt % of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, based on the total weight thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer useful for the present invention is commercially available, and examples thereof include for example LEVAPREN 600, LEVAPREN 700, LEVAPREN 800, LEVAPREN 900, LEVAPREN 800 XL, and the like, available from Lanxess Corporation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">b) Epoxy Resin</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">In the UV curable composition of the present invention, in addition to the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer as a basic material, epoxy resin is further used as a basic material and a curing component.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">The epoxy resin useful for the present invention may be an epoxy resin known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the epoxy resin used may contain one or a plurality of epoxy groups in the molecule, and preferably has an epoxy equivalent ranging from 150 to 600. Preferably, aromatic epoxy resins such as glycidyl ethers or esters obtained by reaction of polyphenols such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, hexahydrobisphenol A, tetramethylbisphenol A, diarylbisphenol A, tetramethylbisphenol F, with epichlorohydrin, for example, can be used in the present invention. Moreover, epoxidized polyolefins and the like are also usable epoxy resins.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">Epoxy resins useful for the present invention are commercially available, and examples thereof include YD 128 (with an epoxy equivalent of about 187) and KD212 (with an epoxy equivalent of 535) available from Kunshan (Kudko) Chemical (South Korea).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">The content of epoxy resin in the UV curable composition containing glass bubbles according to the present invention is generally at least 20 wt %, or 25 wt %, or 40 wt %; and the content of the epoxy resin is generally at most 60 wt %, or 58 wt %, or 55 wt %, or 50 wt %, or 45 wt %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">c) Glass Bubble</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">The UV curable composition for forming the UV curable adhesive film of the present invention comprises glass bubbles, which has the function of physical filling in the adhesive film and reducing the cohesion of the cured adhesive film, so as to achieve cohesive failure for the failure of the cured adhesive film and to improve the bonding stability.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">The &#x201c;average true density&#x201d; of the glass bubbles is the quotient of the mass of the glass bubble sample divided by the true volume measured by passing the glass bubbles of this mass through a gas pycnometer. The &#x201c;true volume&#x201d; is the overall aggregate volume rather than the loose volume of the glass bubbles. The average true density of the glass bubbles useful for implementing the present disclosure is generally at least 0.30 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cc), 0.35 g/cc, or 0.38 g/cc. In some embodiments, the average true density of glass bubbles useful for implementing the present disclosure is at most about 0.6 g/cc. &#x201c;About 0.6 g/cc&#x201d; means 0.57 g/cc to 0.63 g/cc (i.e., 0.6 g/cc&#xb1;5%&#xd7;0.6 g/cc).

Although the amount of the photoinitiator in the UV curable composition is low, the photoinitiator has a great influence on the curing speed and storage stability of the UV curable composition.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">The photoinitiator useful for the present invention may be at least one selected from the group consisting of cationic photoinitiators. The cationic photoinitiators that can be used include, but are not limited to, one or more photoinitiators from the following group consisting of diazonium salt photoinitiators, iodonium salt photoinitiators, sulfonium salt photoinitiators, antimonate salt photoinitiators, and iron arene salt photoinitiators, and specific examples thereof include diaryl iodonium salts, diaryl sulfonium salts, alkyl sulfonium salts, iron arene salts, sulfonyloxyketone, and diaryl siloxyether.

Generally, with the increase in the content of the photoinitiator such as a cationic photoinitiator, the curing speed of the UV curable composition is increased, but if the content is too high, then a curing speed that is too high will be caused, such that curing can occur even in sunlight (including a small amount of UV), thereby causing damage to the performance of the curable adhesive film or adhesive tape, for example poor storage stability at room temperature. If the amount of the cationic photoinitiator is too low, then requirement for the UV radiation energy is high during the curing, and the curing speed is low, thereby causing damage to performance of the curable adhesive film or adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">f) Antioxidant</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">The UV curable composition for forming the UV curable adhesive film of the present invention preferably comprises an optional antioxidant.

More specifically, the UV curable composition can be first extruded into a flexible or non-flexible substrate (including a release film or release paper) by hot extrusion or melt extrusion to form an adhesive film. The adhesive tape structure provided by the invention can provide a substrate on one surface adhesive film layer, or alternatively provide a release paper or release film only on one surface adhesive film layer of the adhesive film. Functioning as the release film or release paper, release films or release papers known in the prior art can be used, e.g., PET release films, glass papers, laminated papers, and polypropylene films.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0069">Moreover, in addition to the above double-sided adhesive tape, the present invention can also provide a single-sided adhesive tape by replacing the above release paper or release film on one side of the adhesive film with the bonding substrate.

The adhesive film can be cured to an adhesive tape with semi-structural strength to structural strength at room temperature after UV initiation, so it can bond to some plastics that are not resistant to high temperature, e.g., PC, PMMA and ABS. Further, the adhesive film of the present invention has no odor or has a low odor, being particularly suitable for bonding between plastic parts, or between plastic parts and metal parts in internal members of household appliances and automobiles, as well as in hand-held mobile terminals of electronic products.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">List of Particular Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0071">1.

A UV-LED ultraviolet lamp (Model KT403) from AVENTK Company was used, with the UV irradiation amount controlled at 3 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>(8 min). The standard test steel plate was compounded with another standard test steel plate in 5 min, which was rolled back and forth once by using a 2 Kg roller (machine: Rolldown, purchased from Cheminstruments, U.S.) and stored for 48 h at a constant temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and a constant humidity of 50% before testing. The specific procedure was performed in accordance with ASTM D3330.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0125">(2) Dynamic Shear Strength Test</p><p id="p-0104" num="0126">According to the method described in FINAT FTM 2 (FINAT Technical Manual Test Method, 8th Edition) (FTM 2 is equivalent to the second test method), the above stored samples were tested and the shear strength was obtained. The used instrument was Instron 3300 from Instron Company, U.S.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0127">The measurements of 5 shear strength tests were recorded and the average value was taken as dynamic shear strength (unit: MPa). When the measured dynamic shear strength is greater than or equal to 4.5 MPa, the sample is considered to have a qualified post-cure structural strength; when the measured dynamic shear strength is greater than or equal to 5.0 MPa, the sample is considered to have desirable post-cure structural strength; and when the measured dynamic shear strength is greater than or equal to 7.0 MPa, the sample is considered to have excellent post-cure structural strength.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0128">Failure Mode</p><p id="p-0107" num="0129">The failure mode of the adhesive film includes interface failure and cohesive failure. Interface Failure (IF) is defined as, after the aforementioned dynamic shear test, the adhesive film completely sheds from the bonding surface. Cohesive Failure (CF) is defined as, after the aforementioned dynamic shear test, the adhesive film itself ruptures. The cohesive failure indicates that the bonding is more stable and the bonding effect is better relative to the interface failure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0130">Adhesive Tape Preparation</p><p id="p-0109" num="0131">The adhesive tapes were prepared by the hot-melt extrusion method. According to the formula shown in Table 2 and table 3 below, various components such as the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, the epoxy resin, the hydroxy compound, the photoinitiator, and the antioxidant were intensively mixed in a CPM-40 twin-screw extruder produced by CPM Company at 155&#xb0; C. and extruded to a 5B2D release film produced by Baoyan Company in the form of composition, to form an adhesive film with a thickness of 200 &#x3bc;m, so as to prepare the adhesive tapes according to Embodiments 1 to 18 (E1-E18) and Comparative examples 1 to 9 (C1-C9), respectively.</p><p

comparative example were detected for the odor, and they were all odorless or low-odor products and could be applied to the bonding between plastic parts, or between plastic parts and metal parts in internal members of household appliances and automobiles, as well as in hand-held mobile terminals of electronic products.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0133">Secondly, it can be seen from Table 2 that, the UV curable compositions in Embodiments 1 to 18 had the specific components and specific contents thereof as required by the invention, and the corresponding adhesive films/adhesive tapes had desirable initial adhesivity, peeling force after curing and failure mode.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0134">The adhesive films/adhesive tapes provided in Comparative examples 1 to 9 did not have desirable initial adhesivity, peeling force after curing and failure mode due to the absence of specific components and specific contents thereof required by the invention.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0135">In Embodiments 1 to 4, the UV curable compositions contained different ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, and the contents of vinyl acetate repeating units in the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers were 60 to 90 wt %. With the increase of the content of vinyl acetate repeating units in the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer used (i.e., relatively high), the corresponding glass transition temperature also gradually increased, and thus the 180&#xb0; peeling force (initial adhesivity) of the uncured adhesive film gradually decreased. The modulus of the adhesive film after curing also increased gradually, the dynamic shear strength reached the maximum value with Levapren 800, and the failure mode was cohesive failure. According to Embodiments 2 and 3, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, where the content of vinyl acetate repeating units was 70 to 80 wt %, was used, and the corresponding tapes exhibited excellent initial adhesivity (180&#xb0; peeling force before curing), dynamic shear strength and failure mode.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0136">In Embodiment 5, a pre-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used. Due to the high modulus of the pre-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, the 180&#xb0; peeling force (initial adhesivity) of the uncured adhesive film was reduced, as compared with Embodiments 1 to 4.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0137">In Embodiments 3, 10 and 11, and Comparative examples 2 and 3, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used respectively at different contents. When the content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was within the range of the present invention, the prepared adhesive films all had good initial adhesivity, dynamic shear strength, and failure mode. The adhesive film corresponding to Embodiment 3 had excellent initial adhesivity, dynamic shear strength, and failure mode. The formula of Comparative example 2 had a low content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin, and because the resin content was too low, it was very difficult for the extruded composite to form an adhesive film, and the cured adhesive film suffered from interface failure. The formula of Comparative example 3 had a higher content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin, and because the resin content was too high and the melt viscosity was too high, the mixed system could not be coated by hot-melt extrusion.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0138">In Embodiments 5, 6 and 7, three types of glass bubbles conforming to the requirements of the invention were used, and the corresponding adhesive films all had the failure mode of cohesive failure, qualified shear strength, and initial adhesivity. In Comparative example 1, a type of glass bubble having a density less than 0.35 g/cc and providing a hydrostatic pressure of 3.45 MPa at which 10 vol % of the glass bubbles collapse was used. The adhesive film after curing could achieve a high shear strength, but the failure mode of the adhesive film was still interface failure as the glass bubbles were damaged in the shear process and thus collapsed.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0139">In Embodiments 5, 8, 9, 16 and 17, the adhesive films prepared with different contents of iM30K glass bubbles all had a high shear strength and a cohesive failure mode. The content of glass bubbles in Comparative example 4 was too low, and the content of glass bubbles in Comparative example 5 was too high. Specifically, the glass bubbles at a low content used in Comparative example 4 could not function well in filling, and the failure mode of the cured adhesive film was still interface failure. A higher content of glass bubble was used in Comparative example 5. The higher content of glass bubble made the melt viscosity of the system too high, and the mixed system could not be coated by hot-melt extrusion.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0140">In Embodiments 3, 12 and 13, and Comparative examples 8 and 9, different contents of polyol were used. It can be seen that when the polyol content was within the range of the present invention, the corresponding adhesive films all had a failure mode of cohesive failure, qualified shear strength, and initial adhesivity. When the polyol content was controlled within the preferred range, the adhesive films as prepared in Embodiments 3 and 13 all had high shear strength, initial adhesivity, and a cohesive failure mode. In Comparative examples 8 and 9, when the hydroxy-containing compound was used at a content that was too low or too high, the overly low content of the hydroxy compound made the curing speed low and desirable shear strength could not be achieved within a certain period of time. The overly high content of the hydroxy compound decreased the overall modulus of the adhesive film and also decreased the shear modulus of the adhesive film.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0141">In Embodiments 3, 14 and 15, the 3 adhesive films prepared with different contents of the photoinitiator all could have a high shear strength and a cohesive failure mode. In Comparative example 6, the photoinitiator content was too low, leading to difficult curing of the adhesive film, poor dynamic shear strength of the adhesive film prepared, and degraded comprehensive performance. In Comparative example 7, the photoinitiator content was too high, and curing was too fast in the UV irradiation process, leading to a poor acting force between the adhesive film and the substrate, interface failure with regards to the failure mode after curing, and low shear strength.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0142">The embodiments and examples of the present invention described above are just exemplary descriptions of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the concept and scope of the present invention.
