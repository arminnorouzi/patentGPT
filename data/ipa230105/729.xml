end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Gripping is a natural part of human interaction with solid surfaces. In some instances, humans must grip an object. In other instances, humans must temporarily grip against a surface. Gripping is often impeded by perspiration, natural oil secretion, smoothness of skin, and/or the surface to be gripped or gripped against and moisture/oil from the environment. Improving the friction between human skin and solid surfaces is thus desirable for improving grip. The present disclosure provides methods and materials useful for improving human grip. In some embodiments, particulate aerogel material is applied to human skin resulting in improved grip with solid surfaces. In other instances, particulate aerogel material is applied to a solid surface to be gripped resulting in improved grip. In some embodiments, particulate aerogel material is applied to an exterior surface of a glove, footwear, or other apparel to improve grip. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material provides improved tribological, absorptive, antiperspirant, textural or surface area properties.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inventors have observed the unexpected result that applying particulate aerogel material to human skin results in improved grip between said human skin and a solid surface. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material forms an interface between the human skin and the solid surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments the particulate aerogel material increases the coefficient of friction between the human skin and the solid surface and/or between a surface of a material with which the human skin is in contact (either directly or via indirect solid contact) and the solid surface. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material increases the coefficient of friction between the human skin and the solid surface by at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% relative to the coefficient of friction in the absence of the particulate aerogel material. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material increases the coefficient of friction between a surface that is in contact with (either directly or via indirect solid contact) human skin (e.g., the exterior surface of a glove being worn on a hand) and a solid surface by at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% relative to the coefficient of friction in the absence of the particulate aerogel material. In some embodiments the particulate aerogel material provides an antiperspirant function. In some embodiments the particulate aerogel material provides an antiperspirant function by blocking pores in the human skin and/or absorbing excreted perspiration from human skin. In some embodiments, natural oils found on human skin are at least partially absorbed by the particulate aerogel material resulting in adhesion of the particulate aerogel material to the skin. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material repels water, serving as a water-repellant or water-proof layer on human skin and/or between a surface of a material with which the human skin is in contact (either directly or via indirect solid contact) and the solid surface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments the particulate aerogel material exhibits a high surface area. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a surface area of at least 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 400 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 600 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 700 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 900 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 1100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or at least 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g. In some embodiments, the presence of the particulate aerogel material in contact with human skin increases the surface area available for gripping. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material has a high surface roughness resulting in increased texture over the human skin. In some embodiments, these functions and/or a combination of these functions results in improved grip between the human skin and the solid surface and/or improved grip between a surface of a material with which the human skin is in contact and the solid surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a highly porous structure. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a BJH pore volume of greater than or equal to 0.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, greater than or equal to 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, greater than or equal to 2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, greater than or equal to 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, greater than or equal to 4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, or less than or equal to 5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a small pore size. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a BJH average pore width of less than 10 nm, less than 20 nm, less than 30 nm, less than 40 nm, less than 50 nm, less than 60 nm, less than 70 nm, less than 80 nm, less than 90 nm, less than 100 nm, less than 500 nm, less than 1 &#x3bc;m, less than 10 &#x3bc;m, less than 100 &#x3bc;m, or less than 1 mm. In some embodiments, the high pore volume of the particulate aerogel material results in good sorption. In some embodiments, the small pore size of the particulate aerogel material results in efficient capillarity driven wetting of natural oils found on human skin, and/or perspiration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Solutions that currently exist to improve grip include chalk, antiperspirant, and gloves. Chalk will provide transient grip enhancement; however, it does not prevent sweating, is messy, marks surfaces, is not highly porous, and is easily washed off due to its hydrophilic nature. Antiperspirant will help to reduce sweating from human skin, but it does not improve the surface area of the skin or remove moisture that is already present. Gloves and other types of apparel can help to improve grip; however, they are not always suitable or permitted in every application. Gloves can also impede the desired action by reducing dexterity or increasing the diameter of the object being gripped. Even in circumstances where gloves are permitted, they can be impeded by the presence of moisture and/or be ineffective in gripping against smooth surfaces.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, establishing direct contact and/or indirect solid contact between human skin, a particulate aerogel material, and a solid surface, wherein the particulate aerogel material is between the human skin and the solid surface, will increase the friction between the human skin and the solid surface. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the particulate aerogel material increases friction between human skin and a solid surface by both increasing the surface area between the solid surface and the human skin as well as absorbing oil or sweat that might be present on the human skin. In some embodiments, the human skin is on a foot (e.g., on the bottom of a foot). In some embodiments, the human skin is on a hand (e.g., on the inside of the hand, such as on the palm of a hand and/or interior surfaces of digits of the hand). In some embodiments, the human skin is on an arm. In some embodiments, the human skin is on a leg. In some embodiments, the human skin is on a torso. In some embodiments, the human skin is on a face.

Aerogels typically exhibit a wide array of desirable materials properties including high specific surface area, low bulk density, low thermal conductivity, and/or low dielectric constant, among others. Aerogels are typically produced through the sol-gel process. Briefly, in such processes, monomers are reacted in a solution to form a dispersion of nanoparticles in liquid called a sol. Alternatively, nanoparticles can be dispersed in a solution to make a sol and in a second step or concurrently with the first step, the particles form a gel. The pore fluid of that gel is then extracted in such a way as to prevent substantial densification leaving behind a highly porous solid (an aerogel). Inorganic oxide aerogels are, generally, natively hydrophilic and express hydroxylated surface functionality that absorbs moisture. Alternatively, inorganic oxide aerogel materials can be made hydrophobic by reacting either the gel in its gel phase, or the dry aerogel, with a reactive hydrophobe. A hydrophobe is generally a reactive chemical agent used to impart hydrophobicity unto a gel or aerogel by changing the composition of surface functional groups that line the backbone of said gel or aerogel. The gel can be reacted with a hydrophobe by soaking in a solution comprising the hydrophobe. The aerogel can be reacted with a hydrophobe by flowing a vapor containing the hydrophobe through the pores of the aerogel. In some embodiments, the hydrophobe may comprise an organosilane. In some preferred embodiments, the hydrophobe comprises hexamethyldisiloxane. In some preferred embodiments, the hydrophobe comprises hexamethyldisilane.

Log P may be determined at about 25&#xb0; C. and about 1 atm. A higher Log P value may suggest a higher hydrophobicity. In some embodiments, a hydrophobe may have a Log P of greater than or equal to 1, greater than or equal to 1.5, greater than or equal to 2, greater than or equal to 2.5, greater than or equal to 3, greater than or equal to 3.5, or greater than or equal to 4.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, after reacting an inorganic oxide aerogel with a suitable hydrophobe, the Log P of the aerogel is increased.

The term hydrophobicity refers to the absence and/or partial absence of attractive force between a material and a mass of water. In some embodiments, the hydrophobicity of a bulk material refers to this behavior as it applies to a surface. In certain embodiments, the apparent hydrophobicity of a textured surface can be higher than the chemical hydrophobicity of the bulk material.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Hydrophobicity of the particulate aerogel material can be expressed in terms of the liquid water uptake. The term liquid water uptake refers to the ability of a material or composition to absorb, adsorb, or otherwise retain water due to contact with water in the liquid state. Liquid water uptake can be expressed one of several ways, for example, as a fraction or percent of the open pore volume or envelope volume of the particulate aerogel material, or as a fraction or percent relative to the mass of the unwetted particulate aerogel material. The liquid water uptake reported is understood to be a measurement undertaken under specific conditions. A particulate aerogel material that has superior or improved liquid water uptake relative to a different particulate aerogel material is understood to have a lower uptake of liquid water.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material has a liquid water uptake of less than 100 wt %, less than 80 wt %, less than 70 wt %, less than 60 wt %, less than 50 wt %, less than 40 wt %, less than 30 wt %, less than 20 wt %, less than 10 wt %, less than 5 wt %, less than 4 wt %, less than 3 wt %, less than 2 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or less than 0.1 wt % relative to the weight of the particulate aerogel material before contact with liquid water when measured according to standard ASTM C1763.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material has a liquid water uptake of less than 100 wt %, less than 80 wt %, less than 70 wt %, less than 60 wt %, less than 50 wt %, less than 40 wt %, less than 30 wt %, less than 20 wt %, less than 10 wt %, less than 5 wt %, less than 4 wt %, less than 3 wt %, less than 2 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or less than 0.1 wt % relative to the weight of the particulate aerogel material before contact with liquid water when measured according to standard EN 1609.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, when the particulate aerogel material is submerged under water at 25&#xb0; C. for 24 h, the particulate aerogel material uptakes a mass of water within its outer boundaries of less than 30% of the dry mass of the particulate aerogel material prior to submerging in the water.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Hydrophobicity of the particulate aerogel material can be expressed in terms of the water contact angle. The term water contact angle refers to the equilibrium contact angle of a drop of water in contact with a surface made of the particulate aerogel material. The contact angle can be determined as follows: A polycarbonate annulus with a 2 cm outer diameter and a 1 cm inner diameter, that is 2 cm tall and sealed on one end by a flat piece of polycarbonate forming a 2 cm deep well is prepared. Particulate aerogel material is added to the top of the well. The polycarbonate cylinder is then tapped 10 times to allow the particulate aerogel material to settle. More particulate aerogel material is added, and this process is repeated until the level of particulate in the polycarbonate cylinder is level with or above the top of the well. A metal laboratory spatula is then dragged across the top of the well to scrape away excess material and help ensure the flatness of the testing area. A droplet of deionized water is them deposited via Pasteur pipette atop the center of the particulate aerogel material. A photo of the droplet of water is then captured from the side of the droplet. The image of the droplet is then processed using an image processing software to measure the contact angle between the droplet and the top surface of the particulate in the well, where the contact angle is measured through the bulk of the droplet. In some embodiments, the particles are milled or crushed prior to testing such that the average maximum cross-sectional dimension of the aerogel particles is greater than or equal to 2 micrometers and less than or equal to 40 micrometers. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that, in some embodiments, a smaller particle size allows for tighter packing of the particulate aerogel material to reduce textural surface effects on the contact angle measurement. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that a particulate aerogel that exhibits a higher water contact angle relative to a second particulate aerogel material may have a superior or improved hydrophobicity relative to that second particulate aerogel material. In some embodiments, when the particulate aerogel material is tested according to this method, the water contact angle may be greater than 90&#xb0;, greater than 100&#xb0;, greater than 110&#xb0;, greater than 120&#xb0;, greater than 130&#xb0;, greater than 140&#xb0;, greater than 150&#xb0;, greater than 160&#xb0;, greater than 170&#xb0;, or between 170&#xb0; and 180&#xb0; in ambient air at least one temperature and pressure. In some embodiments, when the particulate aerogel material is tested according to this method, the water contact angle may be greater than 90&#xb0;, greater than 100&#xb0;, greater than 110&#xb0;, greater than 120&#xb0;, greater than 130&#xb0;, greater than 140&#xb0;, greater than 150&#xb0;, greater than 160&#xb0;, greater than 170&#xb0;, or between 170&#xb0; and 180&#xb0; in ambient air at 1 atm pressure and 25&#xb0; C. In some preferred embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a contact angle with water, in an ambient air environment at 1 atm and 25&#xb0; C., of greater than 90&#xb0; when measured according to the test described herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hydrophobicity of the particulate aerogel material can be expressed in terms of the water vapor uptake. The term water vapor uptake refers to the ability for a material or composition to absorb, adsorb, or otherwise retain water due to contact with water in the vapor state. Water vapor uptake can be expressed as a fraction or percent of water retained relative to the mass of the particulate aerogel material before exposure to water vapor. The water vapor uptake reported is understood to be a measurement undertaken under specific conditions. A particulate aerogel material which has superior or improved water vapor uptake relative to a different particulate aerogel material is understood to have a lower sorption or retention of water vapor. In some embodiments, the water uptake may be less than 100 wt %, less than 80 wt %, less than 70 wt %, less than 60 wt %, less than 50 wt %, less than 40 wt %, less than 30 wt %, less than 20 wt %, less than 10 wt %, less than 5 wt %, less than 4 wt %, less than 3 wt %, less than 2 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or less than 0.1 wt % relative to the weight of the particulate aerogel material before exposure to water vapor, when measured according to standard ASTM C1104.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Hydrophobicity of the particulate aerogel material can be expressed in terms of retained internal surface area after submersion in water. After submersion in deionized water, the particulate aerogel material is allowed to dry out completely, and then nitrogen sorption porosimetry is performed as outlined herein to measure the remaining internal surface area of the material. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material retains greater than 5%, greater than 10%, greater than 15%, greater than 20%, greater than 25%, greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, greater than 90%, or greater than 95% of the internal surface area of the same particulate aerogel material prior to submersion in water.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments the particulate aerogel material exhibits an optical transmission of greater than or equal to 5% at 635 nm.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material may exhibit a relatively high light transmission. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a light transmission of greater than or equal to 5%, greater than or equal to 10%, greater than or equal to 20%, greater than or equal to 30%, greater than or equal to 40%, greater than or equal to 50%, greater than or equal to 60%, greater than or equal to 70%, greater than or equal to 80%, greater than or equal to 90%, or greater than or equal to 95% when tested according to ASTM E424. In some preferred embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a light transmission of greater than or equal to 89% per cm when tested according to ASTM E424.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material readily absorbs natural oils from human skin. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material exhibits a mineral oil uptake that can serve as a proxy test for gauging the particulate aerogel material's ability to absorb natural oil excreted from human skin. The term mineral oil uptake refers to the ability of a material or composition to absorb, adsorb, or otherwise retain mineral oil due to contact with mineral oil. Mineral oil uptake can be expressed as a fraction or percent relative to the mass of the unwetted particulate aerogel material. The mineral oil uptake described herein is measured using CAS number 8012-95-1 mineral oil from Sigma Aldrich. A particulate aerogel material that has superior or improved mineral oil uptake relative to a different particulate aerogel material is understood to have a higher uptake of mineral oil. In some embodiments, the mineral oil uptake may be greater than or equal to 0.1 wt %, greater than or equal to 1 wt %, greater than or equal to 2 wt %, greater than or equal to 3 wt %, greater than or equal to 4 wt %, greater than or equal to 5 wt %, greater than or equal to 10 wt %, greater than or equal to 20 wt %, greater than or equal to 30 wt %, greater than or equal to 40 wt %, greater than or equal to 50 wt %, greater than or equal to 60 wt %, greater than or equal to 70 wt %, greater than or equal to 80 wt %, greater than or equal to 100 wt %, greater than or equal to 200 wt %, greater than or equal to <b>300</b> wt %, greater than or equal to 500 wt %, or greater than or equal to 1000 wt % relative to the weight of the particulate aerogel material before submersion in mineral oil.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material is submerged under mineral oil for 24 hours at 25 C, the particulate aerogel material uptakes a mass of mineral oil within the outer boundaries of the particulate of greater than or equal to 20% of the dry mass of the particulate aerogel material just prior to submerging in mineral oil.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material will fracture when subjected to a pressure of less than 1 N/cm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material will fracture when subjected to a pressure of less than or equal to 10 kPa, less than or equal to 20 kPa, less than or equal to 50 kPa, less than or equal to 100 kPa, or less than or equal to 200 kPa. The pressure at which the particulate aerogel material will fracture can be measured according to the following. An optically transparent polycarbonate annulus with a 2 cm outer diameter and a 1 cm inner diameter, that is 2 cm tall and sealed on one end by a flat piece of polycarbonate forming a 2 cm deep well, said well having a level marking on the side of its outer surface corresponding to a well depth of 1 cm, is prepared. Particulate aerogel material is added to the level line within the well. The polycarbonate well is then tapped 10 times to allow the particulate aerogel material to settle. More particulate aerogel material is added, and this process is repeated until the level of particulate in the polycarbonate well is exactly at the 1 cm depth level mark. The polycarbonate annulus is then centered between the compressive platens on a universal testing machine (e.g., an Instron 3366). A 0.9 cm diameter polycarbonate rod that is 2 cm tall is gently placed on top of the aerogel in the well of the polycarbonate annulus. The compressive platens are then compressed at a rate of 1 mm/s and the force is recorded as a function of displacement, until a force of 0.64 N is reached, corresponding to a pressure exerted by the cylinder of 200 kPa, or the 2 cm rod can no longer be depressed. The compressive platens are then returned to their starting positions, to remove the external load on the volume of aerogel. The material is stated to be crushable if a stress of less than or equal to 200 kPa results in the breaking of at least one particle in the well into two or more pieces as determined through visual observation before and after the test. In some embodiments, permanent compaction of the volume of the particulate aerogel material in the well results from the test described herein, such that there is a permanent compressive axial deflection of the volume of particles in an amount greater than 5% after a stress of 200 kPa has been applied. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material will fracture when subjected to a pressure of less than 1 N/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, in some embodiments a crushable particulate aerogel material may be advantageous for enhancing grip (e.g., increasing friction between human skin and a solid surface) as the aerogel particulate may be more easily distributed and/or retained on the human skin and/or solid surface. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material is able to be fractured with minimal effort by a human woman with average strength. In some embodiments, the particulate aerogel material is able to be fractured by a human woman with less than average strength.
