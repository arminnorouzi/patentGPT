The fusion spliced cable assemblies of the present invention may be used to house, organize and secure fusion spliced optical fibers. The fusion spliced cable assemblies of the present invention may reduce the space between optical fibers that have been spliced together while maintaining the minimum bend radius of the spliced fibers, and protect the splice area from being damaged (e.g., bending and breaking). Embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Fusion splicing is the process of fusing or welding two fibers together usually by an electric arc. The goal of fusion splicing is to fuse the two fibers end-to-end in such a way that light passing through the fibers is not scattered or reflected back by the splice, and so that the splice and region surrounding the splice are almost as strong as the intact fibers. Before two fibers can be fusion spliced together, the fibers must be prepared.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Methods of preparing optical fibers for fusion splicing are well-known and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to a specific method of preparation. Typically, preparation of the fibers may include the fibers being (1) stripped, (2) cleaned, and (3) cleaved. First, an adequate amount of the protective coating, jacket, or cladding is removed or stripped away from the ends of each optical fiber that will be spliced together. Fiber optical stripping is usually carried out by using a mechanical stripping device similar to a wire-stripper. Other special stripping methods that utilize hot sulfuric acid or a controlled flow of hot air may be used to remove the coating. Next, the bare fibers should be cleaned. The customary means to clean the fibers is with alcohol (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) and wipes. However, given the hydroscopic nature of isopropyl alcohol, its use is less desirable than other known chemicals. Finally, each fiber is cleaved using the score-and-break method so that the end-face of each fiber is perfectly flat and perpendicular to the axis of the fiber. In fusion splicing, splice loss is a direct function of the angles and quality of the two fiber-end faces, i.e., the closer to 90 degrees the cleave angle, the lower the optical loss the splice will yield. As used herein, the section of each optical fiber that has been prepared in this manner or in a similar manner will be referred to as &#x201c;the prepared fibers.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, a fusion spliced cable assembly <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present invention is illustrated.
