Thus, a can and a lid conveyed at a high speed can be continuously seamed while being transferred.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the chuck unit, a spindle having a chuck that positions a lid attached at a lower end thereof is rotatably provided via a bearing. Further, in recent years, along with the speeding-up of a seaming device, a chunk is rotated at a higher speed, and a rotation operating part such as a bearing for supporting a spindle is lubricated by a lubricating oil so as to be able to withstand the high-speed rotation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, in a known seaming device, a can, a lid, or a content is contaminated when a lubricating oil supplied to a rotation operating part enters a seaming operation space where a container such as a can or a lid is handled as shown in Patent Literature 2 and 3. In order to prevent the lubricating oil from entering the seaming operation space, the rotation operating part is surrounded with an in-machine housing and the used lubricating oil is accumulated in the bottom part of the in-machine. A fitting gap inevitably exists between the in-machine housing and the rotation operating part so as to enable the rotation of the rotation operating part. Therefore, in order to prevent the lubricating oil from leaking from the fitting gap, a contact type oil seal made of V-shaped rubber or the like is provided between the in-machine housing and the rotation operating part.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, due to the characteristics of the contact type oil seal that slidingly contacts a rotating shaft, it is extremely difficult to perform complete sealing between the rotation operating part and the in-machine housing. If operation continues for a long period of time, a problem arises in that the fitting gap turns into a flow path to cause the leakage of the lubricating oil due to aged degradation or the like. When the leakage of the lubricating oil into the seaming operation space occurs, the lubricating oil scattered by a centrifugal force resulting from the rotation of a spindle contaminates a can and causes a large amount of defective products. Therefore, the accumulation, collection, and discharge of the oozed and leaked lubricating oil have been proposed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, heat elongation occurs in components constituting the chuck unit due to the heat generation of the oil seal that slidingly contacts the rotating shaft, which may cause an adverse effect that a seaming dimension changes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S62-244537</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-137392</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">[Patent Literature 3] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-200910</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The present invention has been made in order to solve the above problems and has an object of providing a seaming device that can prevent the leakage of a lubricating oil from the in-machine housing of a chuck unit into a seaming operation space, prevent the occurrence of a defective product contaminated by the lubricating oil, and eliminate heat elongation due to heat generation to accurately maintain a seaming dimension.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0015">In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides a seaming device including:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">a chuck unit that positions a lid mounted on a can; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">a seaming unit that seams the lid to the can, wherein</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">the chuck unit has a spindle having a chuck for positioning the lid attached at a lower end thereof, a bearing that rotatably supports the spindle inside an in-machine housing and is lubricated by a lubricating oil, and a non-contact type oil seal mechanism for sealing between the spindle and the in-machine housing at a position below the bearing.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0019">The seaming device of the present invention has the non-contact type oil seal mechanism for sealing between the spindle and the in-machine housing at the position below the bearing. Thus, the seaming device does not have a seal member that slidingly contacts a rotating shaft. Therefore, the seaming device is free from the characteristics of a contact type oil seal and does not suffer from the influence of aged degradation even when performing seaming at a high speed. The seaming device can prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil from the in-machine housing of the chuck unit into a seaming operation space, prevent the occurrence of a defective product contaminated by the lubricating oil, and obtain high productivity. Further, the occurrence of heat elongation in components constituting the chuck unit is avoided. Therefore, the seaming device can accurately maintain a seaming dimension.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to a configuration in which the oil seal mechanism of the present invention has an umbrella-like slinger, the seaming device can cause the lubricating oil that has lubricated the bearing and flowed down toward a lower part to easily flow to a return flow path that is in communication with the inside of the in-machine housing by a centrifugal force. Therefore, the seaming device can reliably prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil into the seaming operation space.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">According to a configuration in which a groove extending in a linear radial shape or a curved radial shape is formed on the lower surface of the slinger of the present invention, the seaming device can easily guide the lubricating oil that has flowed to the lower surface side of the slinger to a distant outer side and suppress the leakage of the lubricating oil from a fitting groove. Therefore, the seaming device can reliably prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil into the seaming operation space.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to a configuration in which a return flow path that causes the lubricating oil to circulate toward the in-machine housing from the upper surface of the slinger of the present invention by a centrifugal force is provided, the seaming device can easily return the lubricating oil to the inside of the in-machine housing by a centrifugal force. Therefore, the seaming device can reliably prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil into the seaming operation space.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">According to a configuration in which a drain structure that causes the lubricating oil to flow toward a lower part inside the in-machine housing when the seaming device stops, the seaming device can cause the lubricating oil that remains on the bearing at the stop of the seaming device and flows down to easily return to the inside of the in-machine housing. Therefore, the seaming device can reliably prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil into the seaming operation space.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to a configuration in which a liquid intrusion preventing member is provided below the slinger of the present invention, the seaming device can prevent the leakage of the lubricating oil that has lubricated the bearing and flowed downward into the seaming operating space, while preventing the intrusion of a washing liquid from the seaming operation space, the vapor or the like of a content filled in a can, or the like into the in-machine housing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view showing an example of the configuration of a seaming device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an example of the configuration of the seaming device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an example of the configuration of the chuck unit of the seaming device according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0028">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a seaming device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: a seaming turret <b>101</b> that performs the seaming process of a can C and a lid F;
