For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,535,100 describes fastening a circuit board to a housing underside with a spacer by inserting spacing elements and fastening elements made of plastic with snap-fits into a housing wall and fastening them. The circuit board is placed on and locked in position. As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,928,441 describes a fastening for a circuit board using screws in which the board is mounted in a floating manner by setting a vertical position via several nuts along the screws.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Such techniques present various technical shortcomings. For example, one disadvantage of these prior techniques is that they require many fastening components and a high manufacturing outlay. Furthermore, these techniques require a large surface area on the circuit board to be used for the fastening such that these sections of the board can no longer be utilized in a functional manner for electrical or data-carrying processes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various disclosed embodiments provide techniques that improve the fastening of circuit boards within a housing by avoiding the above-mentioned technical problems. For example, in some embodiments the disclosed techniques use a locking pin for connecting components of an electronics module, where the locking pin provides for the friction-locking (also referred to as &#x201c;positive-locking&#x201d;) introduction into an at least partially surrounding receiving element. In some embodiments, the locking pin includes at least one contact section and a first pin section with a head end and a connecting neck section, where at least one single-part or multi-part cutting or friction collar is arranged in the area of the head end or of the neck section. Further, in various embodiments, the disclosed locking pin further includes a second pin section is arranged on the other side of the contact section, where the second pin section likewise has a head end and a connecting neck section, and where at least one single-part or multi-part cutting or friction collar is arranged in the area of the head end or of the neck section. Note that, as used herein, the term &#x201c;cutting or friction collar&#x201d; (also referred to as a &#x201c;cutting and/or friction collar&#x201d;) is used broadly to refer to any suitable surface geometries or finishes of the locking pin, or sections thereof, which lead to the locking pin cutting into or pushing into an opposite or encompassing surface of a receiving element. Various non-limiting examples of surface geometries or surface finishes of the locking pin that may be used in a cutting or friction collar are described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The disclosed embodiments may provide various technical advantages. For example, in some embodiments, through a simple plugging or pressing into one another, the circuit board may be centered on the receiving elements of the housing lower part and permanently pressed onto the receiving elements by the protruding contact section of the locking pin. Further, in various embodiments, the housing upper part may likewise be simply &#x201c;pressed-on.&#x201d; For example, in some non-limiting embodiments the housing upper part may be pressed onto all locking pins at the same time (e.g., in a single step).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In various embodiments, the locking pin may be formed symmetrical with respect to the two pin sections, where the second pin section is advantageously designed to be shorter than the first pin section. For example, depending on the thickness of the circuit board, the length of the second pin section (e.g., an upper pin section) may be 0.25 times to 0.75 times that of the first pin section (e.g., a lower pin section).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, at least one of the head ends is designed as a mushroom head-like or cap-like widening, where the circumferential lower rim is designed as a cutting collar. Alternatively (or additionally) the outer surface of the mushroom head-like or cap-like head end may have knurled surfaces or surfaces formed with barbed hooks, in particular in the edge area, according to some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments a pin section (e.g., an upper or lower pin section) may have a head end formed as a cap-like widening with a circumferential lower rim that acts as a cutting collar. In some such embodiments, the cap-like widening may also include a frictional surface finish (such as a knurled surface, for example). In other embodiments, instead of a cap-like widening, a pin section (e.g., an upper or lower pin section) may include one or more cutting or friction collars, some, all, or none of which may also include a frictional surface finish. Additional non-limiting embodiments are depicted in, and described with reference to, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The surfaces of a cutting or friction collar may have many various forms. Non-limiting examples of such surfaces for the cutting or friction collar include barbed hooks, or knurling or sharp grooves over the whole circumference or in sections of the collar. Note that, regardless of the particular frictional surface finish utilized by a cutting or friction collar, in various embodiments a common attribute of the cutting or friction collars is that they can be easily introduced in the mounting direction and, due to the ridging grip firmly on the wall or in wall sections of a receiving element, they cannot be pulled out or unscrewed in a non-destructive manner (e.g., without at least partially destroying or damaging either the cutting or friction collar or the receiving element).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, in some embodiments, a single- or multi-part cutting or friction collar is arranged on at least one neck section. In some such embodiments, for example, several cutting or friction collars may be arranged on a neck section. Similarly, in various embodiments a first or section pin section (or both) may have frictional surface geometries (such as knurling) applied to an entirety of the circumference of the neck section or may have multiple portions of the frictional surface geometry applied to different sections of the circumference of the neck section.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The locking pin may be constructed from various materials. In some embodiments, for example, the locking pin is made of a metal, such as a non-rusting metal. In other embodiments, the locking pin is made of a plastic, such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride), PP (polypropylene), POM (polyoxymethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or any other suitable plastic material.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As noted above, in various embodiments the disclosed locking pin is configured to secure a circuit board within a housing to form an electronics module. In some such embodiments, for example, the electronics module includes a housing lower part, a circuit board (or simply &#x201c;board&#x201d;), and a housing upper part. In some embodiments, the circuit board has at least one lead-through opening for fastening with a fastening means (e.g., a locking pin) which is introduced, with a first end, in a friction-locking manner through the lead-through opening into a receiving element (arranged aligned) of the housing lower part and fastened.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments of the disclosed electronics module, the housing lower part and the housing upper part are configured such that a lower receiving element in the housing lower part is arranged aligned with an upper receiving element in the housing upper part. In various embodiments, the other end of the fastening means (e.g., the locking pin) is introduced in a friction-locking manner into the upper receiving element of the housing upper part and fastened, for example pressed in a positive-locking manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the lead-through openings of the circuit board are circumferential slots or openings. In other embodiments, however, one or more of the lead-through openings may be slots in the edge or rim area that are open towards the outside and, therefore, not circumferentially closed. The geometry of the lead-through openings in the circuit board may vary. In some embodiments, the lead-through openings may be oval or circular cutouts, for example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the housing upper part and the housing lower part may have edges that are sealed together by a sealing overlay, or adhesive bonded to one another by an adhesive applied to at least one section of one or more edges during production of the electronics module. In some embodiments, for example, these edges may be sealed together or adhesively bonded to one another over an entire length of the corresponding edges.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, in some embodiments, at least one of the upper or lower receiving elements is attached such that a bar-like bearing element is arranged between a housing wall and the receiving element(s). Alternatively, in some embodiments, at least one receiving element is attached on or to a housing wall, like a column or sleeve perpendicular to the circuit board, or is monolithically molded out of the housing wall.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the housing lower part is the housing part to which the circuit board is fastened (e.g., as a first work step). In some such embodiments, the housing upper part may analogously be defined by the fact that it is the &#x201c;other&#x201d; housing part that does not represent the housing lower part. Note, however, that the terms &#x201c;housing lower part&#x201d; and &#x201c;housing upper part&#x201d; are not intended to limit the orientation of the installed position of the electronics module. For example, in some embodiments, in a final installed position, the housing lower part may be arranged such that it is above the housing upper part with respect to gravity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Various disclosed embodiments include methods for producing an electronics module. For example, in some embodiments, a disclosed method includes attaching a circuit board, which has at least one lead-through opening, to a lower receiving element in a housing lower part using a fastening means (e.g., a locking pin) and then fastening a housing upper part using the fastening means. In some embodiments, the method includes performing the following steps: a) providing the housing lower part, b) placing the circuit board on one or more receiving elements of the housing lower part, c) guiding one or more fastening means through the lead-through openings and pressing them into the at least one receiving element, where the fastening means is a locking pin as described herein, and d) pressing the head end of the second pin section into at least one receiving element of the housing upper part. In some embodiments, at least one cutting or friction collar is pressed into each receiving element of the housing upper and lower parts in a friction-locking manner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, this method of producing an electronics module may include applying a sealing or adhesive material to a housing edge at least in sections (for example before the pressing in of the housing upper part). Note that, in some instances, an advantage of such an embodiment is that a direct friction-locking connection is affected between the housing upper part and the housing lower part, including when a glue or adhesive is applied. As such, in some embodiments, no further fastening means may be required, including no holding and fastening means to temporarily ensure the necessary contact pressure for the period of the curing and drying of an adhesive. Accordingly, in some such embodiments the electronics module may be immediately transported or moved, including while the adhesive dries and cures.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further details of various non-limiting embodiments are now described in more detail with reference to example embodiments depicted in the Drawings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, a side view of a locking pin <b>1</b> is shown, according to some embodiments. In the depicted embodiment, the locking pin <b>1</b> has a lower pin section <b>2</b> (sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;first&#x201d; pin section), an upper pin section <b>3</b> (sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;second&#x201d; pin section), and a contact section <b>4</b> arranged in between. In the depicted embodiment, the contact section <b>4</b> has a larger diameter than the two pin sections <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.

For example, in the depicted embodiment, lower pin section <b>2</b> has a head end <b>6</b>, and upper pin section <b>3</b> has a head end <b>5</b>. In some embodiments, both head ends <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are molded as mushroom head-like or cap-like widenings of the respective neck sections <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>. Further, in some embodiments, both head ends <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> have, at their inner end that is closer to the contact section <b>4</b>, a cutting rim <b>5</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>6</b>.<b>1</b>.

Accordingly, in some such embodiments, the cutting rim <b>6</b>.<b>1</b> of the head end <b>6</b> and the cutting rim <b>9</b>.<b>1</b> of the cutting or friction collar <b>9</b> are thus frictionally and positively fixed and may only be released again destructively. In the depicted embodiment, the upper head end <b>5</b> of the upper pin section <b>3</b> is still free, with the result that a housing upper part <b>22</b>, or the receiving elements <b>24</b> thereof, may be attached and fastened to it, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additional non-limiting embodiments of the locking pin <b>1</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>. Note that, in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the locking pin <b>1</b> does not include a mushroom-like or cap-like head, but rather a plurality of cutting or friction collars <b>9</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are provided.

Not all implementations of these embodiments will necessarily manifest any or all of the potential advantages. Whether an advantage is realized for a particular implementation depends on many factors, some of which are outside the scope of this disclosure. In fact, there are a number of reasons why an implementation that falls within the scope of the claims might not exhibit some or all of any disclosed advantages. For example, a particular implementation might include other circuitry outside the scope of the disclosure that, in conjunction with one of the disclosed embodiments, negates or diminishes one or more the disclosed advantages. Furthermore, suboptimal design execution of a particular implementation (e.g., implementation techniques or tools) could also negate or diminish disclosed advantages. Even assuming a skilled implementation, realization of advantages may still depend upon other factors such as the environmental circumstances in which the implementation is deployed. For example, inputs supplied to a particular implementation may prevent one or more problems addressed in this disclosure from arising on a particular occasion, with the result that the benefit of its solution may not be realized. Given the existence of possible factors external to this disclosure, it is expressly intended that any potential advantages described herein are not to be construed as claim limitations that must be met to demonstrate infringement. Rather, identification of such potential advantages is intended to illustrate the type(s) of improvement available to designers having the benefit of this disclosure. That such advantages are described permissively (e.g., stating that a particular advantage &#x201c;may arise&#x201d;) is not intended to convey doubt about whether such advantages can in fact be realized, but rather to recognize the technical reality that realization of such advantages often depends on additional factors.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">Unless stated otherwise, embodiments are non-limiting.
