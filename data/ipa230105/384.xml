The size requirements (such as overall device diameter) generally constrain a developer of such a device when certain device functionality is desired.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over several decades medical diagnostic and therapeutic interventional procedures have become less invasive due in part to the use of more percutaneous surgical approaches, which access the intravascular system and organs through the skin with a needle. Typically the first medical device through these needles is a guidewire. The guidewire is navigated to the location of interest by use of fluoroscopic imaging, MRI, or other imaging modalities. The guidewire, once navigated to the site of interest, becomes the access pathway for a variety of catheters needed to complete the percutaneous interventional procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There exists a significant need to reduce the total cost of care for these percutaneous procedures and the diseases they are treating. Recent solutions to this need include, among other things, an increase in smart devices to quickly, accurately and intelligently diagnose and inform the interventional procedure. This solution includes adding sensors to guidewires. A clinical application such as angioplasty/stenting to open a vessel stenosis may ideally use intravascular pressure sensing to determine pressure changes in a vessel of interest and the applicability of therapy. Once a pressure gradient or fraction flow reserve is determined to be significant, a clinician may want to use intravascular sensors to more accurately size the vessel, determine location of lipid pools, determine thickness of lipid pool caps, determine force being applied to tissues, or even assess post therapy information. Ideally all of this sensor information will be derived from the guidewire as the common tool which initially accesses and remains across the site of interest.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another solution to this reduced cost clinical need is the creation of smaller interventional devices. This includes devices for radial access, reducing hospital stays. It also includes treating problems earlier in more vascular distal locations. The need for smaller percutaneous devices includes guidewires. This is not easily done however; because often the entire guidewire cross section needs to consist of a high modulus material such as stainless steel in order to provide sufficient support for diagnostic and/or therapy delivery catheters. Coronary guidewires for instance are 0.014&#x2033; in diameter and most of the guidewire length is constructed of a core which is close to 0.014&#x2033; in diameter, and often these are not stiff enough in lateral bending. Also, this same maximizing of Young's modulus and diameter translates into improved torque and steerability performance, which is critically important in guidewires since it is this device that the clinician uses to guide access to the site of interest.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Adding the needed sensor conductors over the length of the guidewire can take cross-sectional area and thus reduce the lateral stiffness, torsional stiffness and torsional control of the guidewire, and therefore increase guidewire delivery time, catheter delivery time, device cost and possibly total cost of care. An example of this is the marketed pressure sensing guidewire made of hypo tubes. The hypo tube is used instead of a guidewire core with a full cross section of metal so sensor conductor wires can be run down the inside of the hypo tube core, from the proximal end of the guidewire to the distal tip of the guidewire enabling the pressure sensor. Unfortunately the use of a hypo tube for the guidewire core gives this device undesirable lateral stiffness and clinical device delivery characteristics.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, currently contemplated guidewires using pressure sensors are generally limited to enabling the dual combination of the necessary mechanical characteristics and pressure sensing. But vessel sizing, imaging, temperature, or other sensing modalities, which may further minimize procedure cost and improve therapeutic outcomes, are not enabled, either alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There remains a need for a higher performance guidewire that is capable of quickly and accurately measuring multiple biological metrics while maximizing high performance mechanical characteristics. In view of the same, impedance devices, and systems incorporating the same, having desired functionality with fewer parts than would normally be required and/or having components/componentry small enough to permit desired device operation, would be well received in the marketplace and solve a number of problems facing impedance device developers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an exemplary embodiment of an impedance device of the present disclosure, the device comprises an elongated body configured for at least partial insertion into a mammalian luminal organ of a patient, the elongated body having a first conductor extending therethrough, a proximal electrical unit operably connected to the elongated body and configured to deliver power along the first conductor, and a sensor substrate located at or near a distal end of the elongated body, the sensor substrate comprising a circuit module operably coupled to a sizing portion and a pressure sensor that are powered directly or indirectly from the power delivered through the first conductor, the circuit module operable and/or configured to a) direct the sizing portion to obtain sizing data, b) direct the pressure sensor to obtain pressure data, and c) facilitate transmission of the sizing data and/or the pressure data to the proximal electrical unit.

Briefly, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, event generation <b>1300</b> is started at start step <b>1302</b>, and sensor substrate <b>760</b> is initially effectively connected to guide wire <b>740</b> and tissue <b>130</b>, by being in the ISOLATE OFF state (at isolate off state <b>1304</b>), which is achieved by the closure of the switches S<b>1</b> (first switch <b>930</b>) and S<b>2</b> (second switch <b>932</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. At that time, the capacitors <b>762</b> referenced herein are charged to provide the power that will be necessary to operate the distal circuitry (within sensor substrate <b>760</b>) when the carrier wave <b>1000</b> will be interrupted. Distal unit (sensor substrate <b>760</b>) continues to monitor the power (via is power on step <b>1306</b>), and when the power is off, that is when the carrier wave <b>1000</b> is interrupted by proximal electrical unit <b>700</b>, sensor substrate <b>760</b> enters into the measurement mode (measurement step <b>1310</b>). First the distal tip electronics (components within sensor substrate <b>760</b>) are isolated from the tissue <b>130</b>, as indicated by the ISOLATE ON state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (isolate on state <b>1308</b>), which is achieved by the opening of the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> (first switch <b>930</b> and second switch <b>932</b>, respectively), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Subsequently, impedance, pressure and/or temperature measurements can be made, and the electrical isolation of the distal tip electronics is terminated (via isolate off state <b>1312</b>). At this point, the distal tip circuitry (of sensor substrate <b>760</b>) waits for the restoration of the carrier wave by the proximal circuitry (of proximal electrical unit <b>700</b>) before attempting to send the resulting measurements (data signals <b>765</b>) back to proximal electrical unit <b>700</b> (via data transmission step <b>1318</b>), which is done by the modulation of the carrier wave <b>1000</b>. Once the power is back on (via is power on step <b>1314</b>), a brief delay (delay state <b>1316</b>) can precede data transmission step <b>1318</b>. Modulation scheme can be chosen among many that are available, such as amplitude modulation, pulse position modulation, pulse width modulation, and so on. Similarly, coding of the data (data signal <b>765</b>) can be done by choosing from a large selection of techniques that are available. For example, Amplitude modulation and Manchester Coding may be preferred as they do generate signals with zero offset, which is important for data signals <b>765</b> sent over tissue <b>130</b> to prevent adverse effects and unintentional stimulation.

Such a threshold temperature can trigger operation of one or more of sizing portion <b>120</b> and/or sensors <b>130</b> to obtain measurements, such as by way of direction of circuit module <b>104</b> after receiving the temperature data. The operation trigger can also be made after the circuit module <b>104</b> delivers a signal via carrier wave <b>1000</b> over the power signal to direct the proximal electrical unit <b>700</b> to temporarily stop delivering power to the sensor substrate <b>760</b> via conductor <b>106</b>.

In such an embodiment, the carrier wave <b>1000</b> is not modulated by the distal end componentry of device <b>100</b>. However, it is periodically interrupted to indicate to the distal circuitry that it is safe to make measurements from the sensors (such as sizing portion <b>120</b> and/or one or more sensors <b>130</b>) without having interference from the carrier wave <b>1000</b>. The resulting data is sent back to the proximal electrical unit (<b>700</b>) using radio frequency electromagnetic waves <b>3350</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> as being transmitted from a distal portion antenna <b>3300</b> of or coupled to wired or wireless communication module <b>600</b> to a proximal portion antenna <b>3302</b> of a receiver <b>3304</b> of, within, or coupled to proximal electrical unit <b>700</b>. Transmission can be done at any frequency that is suitable and permitted by regulatory agencies, but frequencies where the absorption is high due to tissue <b>730</b> should be avoided. Furthermore, higher frequencies require shorter wavelengths, hence shorter antenna <b>3300</b>, <b>3302</b> lengths are preferred in various embodiments, However, at high frequencies, the absorbance of tissue <b>730</b> may increase. Although, frequencies in the range of 10 KHz to 100 MHz can be used, frequencies around 64 MHz may be preferred depending on the embodiment used.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0198">Data transmission can be accomplished by any of the known modulation schematics referenced herein, including amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and pulse position modulation, which are examples of the modulation schematics that can be used for the transmission of the sensory data in analog format using time division multiplexing, for example. Similarly, amplitude shift keying, frequency shift keying and phase shift keying can be used for the transmission of the digital data. Other data techniques that can be used for transmission of information, such frequency division multiplexing are all within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0199">This schematic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> also allows additional data to be sent to the distal unit from the proximal unit using the same RF channel.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0200">In an additional embodiment of the present disclosure, the distal tip is powered via RF power delivered through the tissue <b>730</b> and the data is also transmitted back electromagnetically, as it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>. In this case, there is no need for the electrical loop formed by the guide wire <b>740</b> and the tissue <b>730</b>, and the isolation switches (switches <b>930</b>, <b>932</b>) are eliminated from the distal circuitry. Furthermore, since no carrier wave <b>1000</b> is sent from the proximal circuitry, there is neither a modulator on the distal circuitry nor a demodulator on the proximal circuitry. Instead, two RF units, one located in the proximal circuitry and labeled as receiver <b>3304</b> and the other in the distal circuitry and labeled as wired or wireless communication module <b>600</b> are used to transmit the power <b>710</b> from the proximal unit to the distal unit and to return data signals <b>765</b> from the distal circuit to the proximal circuitry.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0201">Although it is possible to build custom circuits for RF based power and data transmission, it is also possible to use RFID chips that operate at different frequencies ranging from 13 MHz to 900 MHz. In such an embodiment, the RFID device located on the distal portion of the guide wire (namely wired or wireless communication module <b>600</b> having an antenna <b>3302</b>) would recover the power from the incoming RF signal, and provide that the circuit module <b>104</b> to power it. An RFID chip would also then return the data back to the proximal unit.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0202">In order to transmit the power efficiently and to receive the data reliably, the proximal circuitry or at least the antenna <b>3302</b> of receiver <b>3304</b> may need to be positioned near the distal tip of the guide wire.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0203">Circuitry that is located in the distal tip (of, within, or coupled to sensor substrate <b>760</b>) scans the sensors (such as sizing portion <b>120</b> and/or other sensors <b>130</b>) that are present on the medical device <b>100</b>, and samples them one by one at the appropriate time. The time to activate the sensors to produce the transducer data is determined by the operation of the proximal circuitry (of, within, or coupled to proximal electrical unit <b>700</b>). The proximal circuitry periodically interrupts the overall transmission of the power, as generally referenced herein, to the distal circuitry by suspending the generation of the carrier wave <b>1000</b>. The distal circuitry continuously monitors the availability of the carrier wave <b>1000</b> and interprets the absence of the carrier wave <b>1000</b> as an indication that it is time to activate the next sensor in line and to make a measurement. The absence of the carrier wave <b>1000</b> serves not only serves as a trigger for the distal circuitry to switch into the measurement mode (whereby sizing portion <b>120</b> and/or sensor(s) <b>130</b> operate to obtain sizing, pressure, and/or temperature data), but also allows for the creation of an environment that is void of electrical interference that is induced in the tissue <b>730</b> by the carrier wave <b>1000</b>. The distal circuitry possesses a counter (such as within or controlled by circuit module <b>104</b>) that allows it to cycle through the sensors on board to make measurements. The measurement period that is produced by the suspension of the carrier wave <b>1000</b> proximal is sufficiently long for the distal circuitry to activate the sensors and the associated electronic amplifiers <b>914</b>, wait for them to stabilize, obtain a reliable measurement, and convert the resulting data into a digital format using the on board analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>922</b>. Finally, the resulting data is transmitted back to the proximal circuitry by the modulation of the carrier wave <b>1000</b> once the carrier wave <b>1000</b> is restored by the proximal circuitry.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0204">Various devices <b>100</b> and/or systems <b>300</b> of the present disclosure may use various formulas and/or algorithms, such as Ohm's Law and/or a distance between two electrodes (such as a distance between two detection electrodes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>) used to detect within an electric field, one or more saline injections, etc., as described in one or more of the following references, wherein said devices <b>100</b> and/or systems <b>300</b> are configured to perform one or more of the following procedures/tasks:</p><p id="p-0190" num="0205">(a) determining the size (cross-sectional area or diameter, for example) of a mammalian luminal organ, parallel tissue conductance within a mammalian luminal organ, and/or navigation of a device within a luminal organ, such as described within U.S. Pat.
