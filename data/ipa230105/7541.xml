id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates generally to a wireless communication network, and more particularly to conditional configuration in such a network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Robustness of mobility procedures to failure proves challenging particularly in New Radio (NR) systems whose radio links are more prone to fast fading due to their higher operating frequencies. Conditional mobility is one approach to improve mobility robustness in this regard. Under this approach, a wireless device may be commanded to perform a mobility procedure (e.g., handover or resume) earlier than traditionally commanded, before the source radio link quality deteriorates below a certain threshold. But the wireless device is commanded to wait to perform that mobility procedure until the wireless device detects that a certain condition is fulfilled, e.g., the source radio link quality deteriorates even further below a different threshold. Once the device detects that condition, the device may autonomously perform the mobility procedure without receiving any other signaling on the source radio link, so that the procedure proves robust to source link deterioration.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In practice, there may be multiple links that are candidates for a mobility procedure, or multiple possible ways to configure the same link for a mobility procedure. Known approaches to conditional mobility, however, fail to adequately support multiple conditional handover configurations, especially for the same link.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although conditional mobility can improve mobility robustness in a wireless communication network, distributing more control over a mobility procedure to a wireless device threatens to waste resources if the wireless device is configured with multiple conditional mobility configurations as alternatives. If the wireless device only applies one of those mobility configurations, resources reserved for the other mobility configurations may go wasted if they are not released. Especially if the wireless device is configured with multiple mobility configurations for the same link (e.g., cell or network node), though, the network may be unable to identify which mobility configuration the wireless device applied and therefore unable to release the appropriate resources. A similar problem may arise in other contexts besides mobility which exploit conditional configurations that the wireless device is to apply upon the occurrence of a condition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some embodiments herein, different conditional configurations that are configurable for the same link (e.g., a cell or radio network node) are distinguishable on the basis of configuration-specific information. The configuration-specific information may for instance be conditional configuration identifiers, such that different conditional configurations for the same link have unique conditional configuration identifiers. Alternatively or additionally, the configuration-specific information may for instance be radio network temporary identifiers, such that different conditional configurations for the same link are associated with respective radio network temporary identifiers. Alternatively or additionally, the configuration-specific information may for instance be random access preambles and/or random access resources, such that different conditional configurations for the same link are associated with respective random access preambles and/or random access resources.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With different conditional configurations (e.g., for a link) distinguishable in these or other ways, any of those conditional configurations may be added, released, or modified as needed. For example, the wireless device may transmit a control message that unambiguously identifies which of the conditional configurations the wireless device applied for the link, so that the network can release any other conditional configurations for the same link that were not applied. As another example, if network conditions and/or traffic conditions for the wireless device change after the wireless device has already been configured with one or more conditional configurations for a link, the network may add, release, or modify a conditional configuration for that link to dynamically account for such a change. In these and other embodiments, then, the distinguishability of different conditional configurations for the same link advantageously avoids resource waste.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More particularly, embodiments herein include a method performed by a wireless device. The method comprises receiving a control message indicating a conditional configuration that the wireless device is to add, modify, or release for a link. The control message includes configuration-specific information that distinguishes the conditional configuration from one or more other conditional configurations that are configurable for the link.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the configuration-specific information includes a conditional configuration identifier that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the link. Alternatively or additionally, the configuration-specific information includes a Radio Resource Control, RRC, transaction identifier, or a radio network temporary identifier, that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the link.

<b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless communication network <b>10</b> according to one or more embodiments. As shown, the network <b>10</b>, e.g., a 5G network or New Radio, NR, network, may include an access network (AN) <b>12</b> and a core network (CN) <b>14</b>. The AN <b>12</b> wirelessly connects a wireless communication device <b>16</b> (or simply &#x201c;wireless device <b>16</b>&#x201d;) to the CN <b>14</b>. The CN <b>14</b> in turn connects the wireless device <b>16</b> to one or more external networks (not shown), such as a public switched telephone network and/or a packet data network, e.g., the Internet.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The AN <b>12</b> provides links via which the wireless device <b>16</b> may wirelessly access the system <b>10</b>, e.g., using uplink and/or downlink communications. The AN <b>12</b> may for example provide links <b>20</b>-<b>0</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>20</b>-N (generally links <b>20</b>) in the form of access nodes (e.g., base stations), cells, sectors, beams, carriers, or the like. Some links <b>20</b> may provide wireless coverage over different geographical areas.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The network <b>10</b>, e.g., via one or more network nodes <b>18</b> in the AN <b>12</b> and/or CN <b>14</b>, may control configuration of the wireless device <b>16</b> in a number of respects. That is, the network <b>10</b> may control application by the wireless device <b>16</b> of different possible types of configurations. For example, the network <b>10</b> may control the device's configuration in terms of which link <b>20</b> the device <b>16</b> uses to access the network <b>10</b>, e.g., in or for a so-called connected mode, which may for instance be a mode in which the device <b>16</b> has established a radio resource control, RRC, connection with the network <b>10</b>, in contrast with an RRC idle mode in which no RRC connection is established. The network <b>10</b> in this regard may transmit to the wireless device <b>16</b> a type of configuration (e.g., a mobility configuration such as a handover configuration) that, when applied by the wireless device <b>16</b>, configures the device <b>16</b> to use certain link(s) <b>20</b> to access the network <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, a mobility configuration may for example configure the device <b>16</b> to perform a mobility procedure that causes the device <b>16</b> to switch <b>24</b> from accessing the network <b>10</b> via one link to accessing the system via another link, e.g., in connected mode. In some embodiments, this link switch <b>24</b> may be a handover. In another respect, the network <b>10</b> may control the device's configuration in terms of how many links the device <b>16</b> uses to access the network <b>10</b>, e.g., in the context of dual connectivity, carrier aggregation, or the like. For example, the network <b>10</b> may signal a different type of configuration to the device <b>16</b> for adding a secondary cell group (SCG) or a secondary cell. In still other embodiments, the network <b>10</b> may signal another type of configuration to the device <b>16</b> for resuming a connection, e.g., an RRC connection resume, for a reconfiguration with sync, for a reconfiguration, for a reestablishment, or the like. In yet other respects, the network <b>10</b> may signal a different type of configuration that configures the wireless device <b>16</b> to perform a measurement, or still another type of configuration that configures the wireless device <b>16</b> to record/log certain information.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to embodiments herein, the network <b>10</b> may transmit a configuration to the wireless device <b>16</b> but indicate that the wireless device <b>16</b> is to only conditionally apply that configuration. In particular, the wireless device <b>16</b> is to apply the configuration if/when the wireless device <b>16</b> detects fulfillment of one or more trigger conditions e.g., the source radio link quality deteriorates even further below a different threshold. Once the device detects the condition, the device <b>16</b> may autonomously apply the configuration without receiving any other signaling. Such a configuration is referred to as a conditional configuration because it its application is conditional on fulfillment of trigger condition(s).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this context, the network node <b>18</b> in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may transmit to the wireless device <b>16</b> a control message <b>26</b>, e.g., in the form of an RRC message such as an RRC reconfiguration message or an RRC conditional reconfiguration message. The control message <b>26</b> may indicate a conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., a conditional handover configuration) that the wireless device <b>16</b> is to add, modify, or release for a link <b>20</b>. If the wireless device <b>16</b> is to add the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, the control message <b>26</b> may include the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>. If the wireless device <b>16</b> is to modify the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, the control message <b>26</b> may indicate how the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> is to be modified, e.g., by including the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> in its absolute modified form or by including a delta configuration that includes only the relative modifications of the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>. Or, if the wireless device <b>16</b> is to release the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, the control message <b>26</b> may simply identify the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> that is to be released.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this regard, the control message <b>26</b> according to some embodiments includes configuration-specific information <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> that is specific to the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>. The configuration-specific information <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> distinguishes the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> from one or more other conditional configurations that are configurable for the same link <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the configuration-specific information <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> includes a conditional configuration identifier, e.g., that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the same link <b>20</b>. Where the link <b>20</b> is a cell, then, the conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> may be uniquely identified by a combination of the cell's identity and the conditional configuration identity.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other embodiments, the configuration-specific information <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> includes a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the link <b>20</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the configuration-specific information <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> includes a random access channel configuration that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the link <b>20</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the configuration-specific information includes a preamble and/or a radio resource allocation for random access that is unique at least among any conditional configurations configured for the link <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">No matter the particular nature of the configuration-specific information, some embodiments exploit such information so that the control message <b>26</b> may indicate multiple conditional configurations that the wireless device is to add, modify, or release for the link <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for instance, the control message <b>26</b> indicates multiple conditional configurations <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>28</b>-N that the wireless device <b>16</b> is to add, modify, or release for the same link <b>20</b>. In this case, the control message <b>26</b> also includes configuration-specific information <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <b>30</b>-N for each of the multiple conditional configurations <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>28</b>-N that distinguishes the multiple conditional configurations <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>28</b>-N from one another. For example, different ones of the conditional configurations <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>28</b>-N may have unique conditional configuration identifiers.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Note that in some embodiments, the configuration-specific information for a conditional configuration may be included in the conditional configuration itself, or may be indicated separate and apart from that configuration.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Regardless, the wireless device <b>16</b> may correspondingly add, modify, or release one or more conditional configurations <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <b>28</b>-N for the link <b>20</b> in accordance with the control message <b>26</b>. Then, for each conditional configuration that is configured for the link <b>20</b>, the wireless device <b>16</b> may monitor for whether one or more trigger conditions associated with the conditional configuration are fulfilled. The wireless device <b>16</b> may apply a conditional configuration whose one or more trigger conditions are fulfilled.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the wireless device <b>16</b> transmits a control message <b>32</b> indicating a conditional configuration that the wireless device <b>16</b> has applied for the link <b>20</b>. Notably, the control message <b>32</b> may include or otherwise be transmitted using configuration-specific information <b>34</b> that distinguishes the applied conditional configuration from one or more other conditional configurations that are configurable for the link <b>20</b>. The configuration-specific information <b>34</b> may for instance be the same configuration-specific information that was indicated for the applied conditional configuration in the control message <b>26</b> received from the network node <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, for instance, the control message <b>32</b> may be an RRC Configuration Complete message and the configuration-specific information <b>34</b> may be a conditional configuration identity. In other embodiments, the control message <b>32</b> is a message (e.g., msg1) of a random access procedure and the configuration-specific information <b>34</b> is a random access preamble. In still other embodiments, the control message <b>32</b> is a message (e.g., msg1) of a random access procedure and the control message <b>32</b> is transmitted using (e.g., on) radio resources associated with the applied conditional configuration. The control message's transmission on such radio resources in this case implicitly indicates the applied conditional configuration.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Regardless, based on the configuration-specific information <b>34</b> in or indicated by the control message <b>32</b>, the network node <b>18</b> may trigger the release of any other conditional configurations that were prepared for the same link <b>20</b> but were not applied. This advantageously avoids wasting resources that were reserved for application of the other conditional configurations.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, some embodiments exploit configuration-specific information for distinguishing different conditional configurations that are configurable for the same link (e.g., a cell or radio network node). Some embodiments exploit this information to avoid resource wastage.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In view of the above modifications and variations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a method performed by a wireless device <b>16</b> according to some embodiments. The method in one or more embodiments includes receiving a control message <b>26</b> indicating a conditional configuration <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> that the wireless device <b>16</b> is to add, modify, or release for a link <b>20</b> (Block <b>200</b>).

The main objectives are to improve the robustness at handover and to decrease the interruption time at handover.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">One problem related to robustness at handover is that the HO Command (RRCConnectionReconfiguration with mobilityControlInfo and RRCReconfiguration with a reconfigurationWithSync field) is normally sent when the radio conditions for the UE are already quite bad. That may lead to that the HO Command may not reach the UE in time if the message is segmented or there are retransmissions.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">One solution to increase mobility robustness in NR is called &#x201c;conditional handover&#x201d; or &#x201c;early handover command&#x201d;. To avoid the undesired dependence on the serving radio link upon the time (and radio conditions) where the UE should execute the handover radio resource control (RRC) signaling for the handover may be provided to the UE earlier. To achieve this, the HO command may be associated with a condition e.g. based on radio conditions possibly similar to the ones associated to an A3 event, where a given neighbour cell becomes X dB better than a primary cell (Pcell). As soon as the condition is fulfilled, the UE executes the handover in accordance with the provided handover command.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Such a condition could e.g. be that the quality of the target cell or beam becomes X dB stronger than the serving cell (similar to an A3-like event may be configured to trigger measurement reports). The threshold Y used in a preceding measurement reporting event may then be chosen lower than the one in the handover execution condition. This allows the serving cell to prepare the handover upon reception of an early measurement report and to provide the RRCConnectionReconfiguration with mobilityControlInfo (LTE) or RRCReconfiguration with a reconfigurationWithSync (NR) at a time when the radio link between the source cell and the UE is still stable. The execution of the handover is done at a later point in time (and threshold) which is considered optimal for the handover execution.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments, a cell-level quality or beam quality is used as a baseline for a CHO execution condition. A reference signal type Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) can be used for one or more such embodiments. Alternatively or additionally, Ax events (i.e. entry conditions) are used for CHO execution condition and events A3/5 as a baseline. The trigger quantity for CHO execution condition (reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) or reference signal-signal to interference plus noise ratio (RS-SINR)) may be configured by the network.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In any event, while the UE evaluates the condition, it should continue operating per its current RRC configuration, i.e. without applying the conditional HO command. When the UE determines that the condition is fulfilled, it disconnects from the serving cell, applies the conditional HO command and connects to the target cell.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">A conditional handover (CHO) in some sense may therefore be defined as a UE having a network configuration for initiating access to a target cell based on configured condition(s). Usage of a conditional handover may be decided by the network, and the UE evaluates when the condition is valid. In some embodiments, the baseline operation for the conditional HO procedure assumes a HO command type of message contains HO triggering condition(s) and dedicated RRC configuration(s). The UE may then access the prepared target when the relevant condition is met. The baseline operation for conditional HO may also assume the source RAN remains responsible for RRC until the UE successfully sends an RRC Reconfiguration Complete message to the target RAN.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an example with a single serving and target cell. More particularly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the serving gNB may exchange user plane (UP) data with the UE. In step 1, the UE sends a measurement report with a &#x201c;low&#x201d; threshold to the serving gNB. The serving gNB makes a handover (HO) decision based on this early report. In step 2, the serving gNB sends an early HO request to a target gNB. The target gNB accepts the HO request and builds an RRC configuration. The target gNB returns a HO acknowledgement, including the RRC configuration, to the serving gNB in step 3. In step 4, a conditional HO command with a &#x201c;high&#x201d; threshold is sent to the UE. Subsequently, measurements by the UE may fulfil the HO condition of the conditional HO command. The UE thus triggers the pending conditional handover. The UE performs synchronization and random access with the target gNB in step 5, and HO confirm is exchanged in step 6. In step 7, the target gNB informs the serving gNB that HO is completed. The target gNB may then exchange user plane (UP) data with the UE.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">A user equipment (UE) may be configured with multiple conditional handover configurations towards the same node or cell, e.g. where each configuration may be associated to different target cell candidates from that node, comprising different sets of secondary cells, specific beams, number of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) layers, etc. In this case, the UE would trigger only one of these conditional configurations and send a RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the target node. However, the target node would heretofore not be able to distinguish which of the conditional handover configurations was triggered. Similarly, if the UE is signaled to add, modify, or release a conditional handover configuration towards a node or cell, but there are multiple such configurations towards that node or cell, the UE heretofore would not be able to distinguish which of the conditional handover configurations is supposed to be added, modified, or released.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Some embodiments accordingly include methods for how to manage CHOs in case there are multiple CHOs for a UE for a cell or node.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic combined signaling scheme and flowchart depicting some embodiments herein.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Action <b>301</b>. A source network node such as the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may configure the UE <b>16</b> with one or more (conditional) handover configuration(s), e.g., in the form of one or more RRC Reconfigurations. The first radio network node <b>18</b>A may request and receive handover configurations from a candidate target radio network node such as the second radio network node <b>18</b>B. The handover configuration(s) from e.g. the second radio network node <b>18</b>B, may comprise identifier(s) for each handover configuration. Alternatively or additionally, the handover configurations from the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may comprise suggested one or more conditions for each of the handover configuration(s), e.g. relative or absolute conditions. In this case, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may take these suggestions into account. Alternatively or additionally, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may associate an identifier to each received handover configuration. The identifiers of the handover configurations may be determined implicitly (e.g. first configuration gets identity=1, second one gets identity=2, etc.). Or, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may decide unique identities and indicate to the second radio network node <b>18</b>B the assigned identifier for a corresponding handover configuration. The first radio network node <b>18</b>A may transmit a message to the UE comprising the one or more handover configurations and the associated identifiers.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Action <b>302</b>. The UE <b>16</b> may receive and store the one or more handover configurations, such as conditional handover configuration(s), with associated one or more conditions, from the first radio network node <b>18</b>A, i.e. the serving radio network node. The one or more handover configurations may for instance be or correspond to one or more RRC Reconfigurations. In some embodiments, each of these configurations is associated with the same candidate target cell, e.g. the second cell <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, at least one candidate target cell has more than one handover configuration associated with it, but the UE can be configured with additional handover configurations associated to other cells with one or more handover configurations associated to each cell.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Regardless, in some embodiments, each handover configuration has an identifier, also referred to as an optional conditional configuration identifier. This identifier may be unique among all handover configurations, unique among all handover configuration(s) toward a specific cell, or unique among all handover configuration(s) toward a specific network node. If there is only a single handover configuration associated with the candidate target cell or radio network node, though, the identifier of the handover configuration may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one alternative solution, each handover configuration is distinguished by different random access channel (RACH) configurations, such as different sets of preambles, preamble to synchronization signal blocks (SSB) and/or channel state information-reference signals (CSI-RS) mapping, or time/frequency resource allocations, for each CHO configuration for the same cell. With that, the radio network node has means to distinguish which handover configuration the UE has executed. For example, if preamble X is associated to CHO configuration 1 for cell-A, e.g. with a secondary cell (SCell) configuration, and if preamble Y is associated to CHO configuration 2 for the same cell-A, e.g. without an SCell configuration, by preamble detection the target node candidate can distinguish which handover configuration the UE has executed. Alternatively or additionally to different RACH configurations, each handover configuration may be distinguished by different cell-radio network temporary identifiers (C-RNTIs) for each CHO configuration for the same cell. With that, the radio network node <b>12</b> has means to distinguish which configuration the UE has executed upon the reception of msg3. For example, if C-RNTI X is associated to CHO configuration 1 for cell-A, e.g. with an SCell configuration, and if C-RNTI Y is associated to CHO configuration 2 for the same cell-A, e.g. without an SCell configuration, by msg3 detection the target node candidate can distinguish which configuration the UE has executed. Generally, though, the RRCConnectionReconfiguration (or RRCReconfiguration, in NR) for each candidate may differ e.g. in terms of the HO execution condition (reference signal (RS) to measure and threshold to exceed), in terms of the random access (RA) preamble to be sent when a condition is met or the configuration itself to be used in a specific target candidate.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Action <b>303</b>. The UE <b>16</b> may evaluate whether one or more conditions, such as trigger conditions for conditional handovers, are fulfilled. Thus, the UE <b>16</b> in this example determines that a condition related to mobility of the UE is fulfilled, wherein the condition is part of a first handover configuration out of one or more handover configurations.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Action <b>304</b>. The UE <b>16</b>, upon triggering the condition, may execute a conditional handover according to the first handover configuration. Execution of the conditional handover according to the first handover configuration may for instance mean that the UE <b>16</b> applies the first handover configuration and executes the conditional handover upon that configuration. Thus, the UE <b>16</b> transmits an indication that the condition is fulfilled and also indicates that the condition is part of the first handover configuration. The indication thereby indicates which one of the one or more handover configurations the UE <b>16</b> executed. For example, the UE may transmit a message such as an RRCReconfigurationComplete message (or similar, e.g. ConditionalReconfigurationComplete message) toward the target node/cell, e.g. the first or the second radio network node, which fulfilled the trigger condition. The message may comprise the identifier associated with the executed (conditional) handover configuration. In some embodiments, though, if the handover configuration is the only handover configuration associated with the target cell and the identifier was omitted in the previous step, the UE <b>16</b> may omit the identifier from the complete message; alternatively, the UE uses a default value, e.g. <b>0</b>, for the identifier.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Each of these handover configurations may be associated with different target cell candidates associated to the same target network node. In that case, the distinction of which configuration the UE executes is done via network implementation, as described further.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Action <b>305</b>. Meanwhile, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B, also referred to as a candidate target node, may have received a request from the first radio network node <b>18</b>A to configure CHO for the UE <b>16</b> e.g. receiving a CHO or HO REQUEST message over X2, Xn or any other inter-node interface. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may in response provide (transmit) one or multiple CHO configurations for the same target cell candidate for the UE <b>16</b>. For example, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may do so by transmitting a CHO or HO REQUEST ACK message over X2, Xn or any other inter-node interface, which comprises for each CHO configuration an RRCReconfiguration-like message with reconfiguration with synchronization (or at least the content of the message) for the same target cell candidate. The response may comprise recommended conditions of the CHO configuration associated to different configurations, e.g. relative or absolute conditions. The response may comprise an identifier associated to each CHO configuration. In an alternative solution, the response may comprise, for each CHO configuration, some distinguishing parameter configurations, such as different RACH configurations and/or different C-RNTIs for each CHO configuration for the same cell, as described above.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Action <b>306</b>. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may reserve radio resources for CHO for that UE <b>16</b>, e.g. C-RNTI, contention-free RACH resources, etc. Herein, one advantage of the case of using different identifiers associated to different CHO configurations, instead of different distinguishing parameter configurations, is that some of these resources may be reused in different handover configurations for the same cell, which has a lower cost in terms of resources allocated for conditional HO.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Action <b>307</b>. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may receive the indication from the UE <b>16</b>, which the UE <b>16</b> transmitted in Action <b>304</b>.

The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may then execute the handover configuration associated with the identifier indicated by the UE <b>16</b> in the RRC Reconfiguration complete (including e.g. performing a path switch request to the core network which will instruct the first radio network node <b>18</b>A to release the UE context/resources).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In an alternative solution where the UE was configured with handover configurations for the same cell but with distinguished parameter configurations, the second radio network node may use at least one of these to distinguish which configuration the UE <b>16</b> has executed: a RACH preamble, preamble to SSBs/CSI-RSs mapping, or time/frequency resource allocations, as described above. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may then execute handover configurations associated to the used parameter (e.g. preamble, time/frequency resource, C-RNTI, etc.).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Action <b>308</b>. Upon receiving a HO indication that the UE has executed the handover in a candidate target network node (e.g. via X2/Xn signaling or from the CN via S1/NG signalling), the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may prompt the release of UE context and/or radio resources associated with CHO configurations that were not executed. For example, in some embodiments, for each candidate target network node except the one in which the UE <b>16</b> executed the CHO, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may transmit a single message to release UE context and/or radio resources associated to all CHO configurations for that UE. In other embodiments, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may transmit one message per CHO configuration, comprising the conditional configuration identifier, to each candidate target network node to release the UE context and/or radio resources.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Action <b>309</b>. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may receive the HO indication and may release the radio resources associated with other handover configurations associated to the second radio network node <b>18</b>B executing the HO for the UE <b>16</b>. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may receive a message from the second radio network node <b>18</b>B to release all handover configurations; and/or release of all CHO configurations associated to the UE. Thus, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B, or another radio network node, may receive one or more messages from the first radio network node <b>11</b> comprising the identifier, indicating to release a handover configuration, and may release the handover configurations associated to the UE <b>16</b> as indicated by the conditional configuration identifier.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Embodiments herein thereby allow multiple (conditional) handover configurations applicable to a same target candidate cell and allow the UE <b>16</b> to indicate which of the configurations it has executed. Doing so allows the second radio network node <b>18</b>B to configure the UE with different HO configurations for a given target such as different carrier aggregation (CA) configurations with the same target PCell. Some embodiments also allow release of a specific CHO configuration in a candidate target cell.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Consider now other embodiments where the handover configurations are related to different target cells of e.g. the second radio network node <b>18</b>B, e.g. CHO1 that has a PCell=cell1, CHO2 that has a PCell=cell2, etc. . . . where cell1, cell2, . . . are different cells of the same target node or a different node. In this case, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may receive a request from the first radio network node <b>18</b>A to configure handover, also known as conditional handover, for a given UE e.g. receiving a CHO or HO REQUEST message over X2, Xn or any other inter-node interface.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may provide in response, one or multiple handover configurations for different target cells for the UE <b>16</b>. The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may do so by transmitting a CHO or HO REQUEST ACK message over X2, Xn or any other inter-node interface, where the message comprises for each handover configuration an RRCReconfiguration-like message with reconfiguration with synchronization, or at least the content of the message, for these different target cells. The response may comprise recommended conditions associated to different HO configurations (e.g. relative or absolute conditions). The response may comprise an identifier associated to each HO configuration. Accordingly, for the case the second radio network node <b>18</b>B is configuring CHO for different cells, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may reuse parameters that could be otherwise used to distinguish which cell the UE <b>16</b> is accessing. In other words, embodiments herein enable or allow the second radio network node <b>18</b>B to allocate for these different candidate cells the same C-RNTI or the same RACH configuration(s), or even allow a CHO without security keys refresh (since these are different cells, the network could have chosen to perform CHO with key refresh for the sake of distinguishing for which cell the UE has executed the handover i.e. which CHO configuration was triggered). In one embodiment, for this case, the UE uses a cell identifier to distinguish the different configurations i.e. that is what is reported in the RRC Reconfiguration Complete like message in the target node.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The second radio network node may further reserve radio resources for CHO for the UE <b>16</b> e.g. C-RNTI, contention-free RACH resources, etc. At that step, the second radio network node may use the resource reservations as a way to distinguish the target cell for which the UE has executed the conditional handover when the UE access the target node. For example, there could be different ways to distinguish the different target cell candidates: A RACH preamble, preamble to SSBs/CSI-RSs mapping, or time/frequency resource allocations. For example, if preamble X is associated to CHO configuration 1 for cell-A and if preamble Y is associated to CHO configuration 2 for a different cell-B, by preamble detection the target node candidate can distinguish which configuration the UE has executed, and which cell the UE is connected to. That could allow the target to possibly configure the same C-RNTI for multiple target cell candidates for the same target candidate node (since distinction could be done via RACH distinction). The different target cell candidates could also be distinguished via C-RNTIs for each CHO configuration for the different cells. For example, if C-RNTI X is associated to CHO configuration 1 for cell-A and if C-RNTI Y is associated to CHO configuration 2 for a different cell-B, by msg3 detection the target node candidate can distinguish which configuration the UE has executed. That would allow the target node to distinguish the target cell for which the UE has executed CHO, and at the same time allow the target to allocate the same set of RACH resource for the same UE, on a per-node basis, rather than a per-cell basis e.g. contention free RACH resources. The different target cell candidates may alternatively or additionally be distinguished via security configuration. For example, if handover is configured with key refresh, a target cell identifier is used as input. Hence, upon receiving an encrypted and integrity protected Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) Packet Data Unit (PDU) (with the RRC</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Reconfiguration Complete like message), the network can test different hypothesis for different target cell ID candidates, as a way to figure out which target cell the UE is triggering CHO. Using the previous methods (C-RNTI and RACH) allows on the other hand the usage of CHO without security key refresh.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In any event, the second radio network node <b>12</b> may, upon the UE triggering a HO configuration associated to the second radio network node <b>18</b>B, receive an RRC message, e.g. RRCReconfigurationComplete, comprising the identifier. The identifier may be the cell identifier that is used as a way to indicate which cell the UE is accessing, in case common parameters for the different target cell candidates have been provided e.g. RACH, C-RNTI, etc. That allows the usage of CHO without security key refresh.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The second radio network node <b>18</b>B may then execute the HO configurations associated to the identifier indicated by the UE <b>16</b> in the RRC Reconfiguration complete, including performing a path switch request to the core network which will instruct the source network node to release the UE context/resources. In an alternative embodiment where the UE <b>16</b> was configured with HO configurations for different cells and with distinguished parameter configurations, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may execute HO configurations associated to the used parameter, e.g. preamble, timer/frequency resource, C-RNTI, etc.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In view of the above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a method at a UE for handling (conditional) handover configurations when triggering a conditional handover according to some embodiments.

The UE <b>16</b> may evaluate according to normal CHO procedures, i.e. check if trigger conditions are fulfilled, and apply the one that fulfills the condition. However, in some cases, multiple configurations can fulfill the trigger condition at the same time. The UE <b>16</b> may then select a conditional configuration among multiple candidates of conditional configurations fulfilling their one or more conditions. For example, in case there are multiple HO configurations which are fulfilled at the same time, the UE <b>16</b> may select one among those candidate HO configurations to apply. The UE <b>16</b> may select which of the HO configurations to apply based on an indication from the first radio network node <b>18</b>A. This indication may for example be a prioritization indication received from the network. This has the benefit that the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may determine that a particular HO configuration is preferred. For example, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may have provided to the UE <b>16</b> one HO configuration which configures the UE <b>16</b> to use multiple carriers, while another configuration which only configures one carrier for the UE <b>16</b>. If the first radio network node <b>18</b>A wants to maximize the amount of bandwidth the UE <b>16</b> uses, the first radio network node <b>18</b>A may give higher priority to the HO configuration with multiple carriers. Such a prioritization-indication may be provided to the first radio network node <b>18</b>A and/or the UE <b>16</b> together with the HO configurations. There could be a prioritization among different target cells as well.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">An enhancement of the example conditional handover structure discussed earlier is shown below, where the candidatePriority IE specifies the priority among the candidates, and configurationPriority specifies the priority among the HO configurations within a given candidate.

When evaluating performance, the UE <b>16</b> may consider different metrics such as throughput, power consumption, etc. For example, the UE <b>16</b> may select the HO configuration which the UE expects would provide highest throughput, which may for example be determined based on the number of carriers the configuration comprises, or the number of MIMO-layers the configuration comprises, etc. Or if coverage is a metric which should be optimized for the UE <b>16</b>, the UE <b>16</b> may select the HO configuration which would be expected to give best power consumption performance, e.g. by having a carrier on lower frequency, etc.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">During this calculation of expected performance, the UE <b>16</b> may consider other aspects as well such as the current UE battery or expected traffic. For example, if the UE <b>16</b> has an active video streaming session that requires very high throughput it may be optimal to select a HO configuration that includes carrier aggregation while if it is has only low throughput bearers, it my select a configuration that doesn't include carrier aggregation.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">Alternatively or additionally, the UE may select the HO configuration based on how stringent the conditions for the HO configurations are. For example, if the UE <b>16</b> has two HO configurations and one HO configuration has an RSRP threshold of &#x2212;100 dBm while the other HO configuration has &#x2212;90 dBm, the UE <b>16</b> may select the latter one since that has a more stringent condition. Note that it is here assumed that both are fulfilled as otherwise not both would be considered candidates. This embodiment may also be extended to more than two separate thresholds for the same metric, associated to different configurations.

In other embodiments, the second radio network node <b>18</b>B may receive one or more messages from the source radio network node <b>12</b> comprising an identifier, indicating to release a specific CHO configuration, and then may release the HO configurations associated to the UE as indicated by the conditional configuration identifier.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0174">Generally, when a candidate target network node receives a conditional handover request from a neighboring network node which is connected to the UE <b>16</b>, the candidate target radio network node <b>13</b> may decide to configure multiple conditional configurations associated to one or more of the configured cells. These alternative configurations may comprise e.g., different set of secondary cells (SCells), different MIMO configurations, different beam configurations, etc.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0175">For each of these sets of HO configurations for a particular cell, the candidate target radio network node may create a CHO configuration and may assign the identifier. The identifier may be placed in the same message carrying the configurations. This may for example be an XnAP-message where a field is of the type of a list where each entry in the list is carrying a CHO configuration and a configuration identity. With this approach, the source radio network node may be aware of the identifier and must send the identifier alongside with the HO configuration.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0176">In an alternative approach, the identifier may be placed within the CHO configuration itself, i.e. within the message which terminates in the UE. With this approach, the source node is not necessarily aware of the configuration identifier and since it is placed within a message which terminates in the UE, the source node does not need to take any action with respect to handling of the configuration identifier.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0177">The candidate target network node <b>13</b> may also provide different trigger conditions for each of these subsets of configurations (e.g. a relative condition where a better signal strength/quality would correspond to a higher number of MIMO layers, etc.).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0178">The candidate target network node then responds to the source network node with the conditional handover request acknowledgment comprising the set of CHO configurations.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0179">When the UE <b>16</b> triggers a conditional handover to a candidate target network node and selects one out of several CHO configuration associated to one cell, the UE performs a random access towards that cell and transmits an RRCReconfigurationComplete message. The RRCReconfigurationComplete message comprises a conditional configuration identifier and the candidate target network node uses this identifier to determine which of the CHO configurations the UE has executed.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0180">When the target node prepared the multiple CHO configurations it may have allocated resources for the UE. For example, the target may have prepared two CHOs for the UE; CHO1 which comprises a configuration without carrier aggregation (i.e. only a PCell) and CHO2 which comprises a configuration with carrier aggregation (i.e. both PCell and one or more SCells). And for CHO2 the target may have assigned sounding reference signal (SRS) resources for the UE on the SCells. In this case, the target node may upon reception of an RRCReconfigurationComplete message with configuration identifier for CHO1 determine that the UE no longer considers CHO2 valid, e.g. the UE may have discarded it or for other reason will not execute CHO2. In this case the target node may consider the resources associated with CHO2 to no longer be reserved for that UE. E.g. in the example with the SRS-resources above, the target may consider the SRS-resource on the SCells to be free.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows on how different threshold could be associated for different conditional configurations. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the target node has cells at three different frequencies, fa, fb, and fc, where fa is the highest frequency and hence the smallest coverage, and fc the lowest frequency and the biggest coverage. The target can send three conditional configurations, say CHO1, CHO2 and CHO3, where CHO1 is the case without CA (i.e. only PCell at fc), CHO2 is the case with CA with fb and fc (i.e. PCell at fc, SCell at fb) and CHO3 is the case with CA with all cells (i.e. PCell at fc, SCells at fb and fc). The target node may also associate the preferred signal levels of the PCell to associate with the three different CHOs. For example, if the PCell quality is above w but below x RSRP, configure CHO1, if between x and y, use CHO2, if greater than y, use CHO3. These thresholds can be sent to the source in absolute values, or relative to each other. The source, upon getting these three CHO configurations, each with associate relative or absolute targets, can take them into account on top of the source's preferred trigger condition to trigger a HO to the target and configures the UE with a final trigger condition/thresholds for each CHO configuration.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0182">Embodiments herein further include a method for adding, modifying, or releasing conditional handover configurations when the UE is configured with multiple CHO configurations associated to the same target cell. The action may be triggered by the target node. For example, the triggering for a release/modification could be due to several reasons such as the target node experiencing resource limitation in some of the cells that are part of the conditional HO configuration, expiry of timer since the conditional HO was configured, etc. Alternatively or additionally, the triggering for an addition/modification could be due to several reasons such as the freeing of resources at the target node (e.g. certain cell of a target is not overloaded anymore). Or, the action may be triggered by the source node. In this case, the triggering of a release/modification could be due to several reasons such as the change of the UE traffic conditions (e.g. a UE's bearer that was generating heavy traffic is released and configuring CA for the UE may not be beneficial anymore), the UE executing a CHO configuration that is associated with another target, etc. Alternatively or additionally, the triggering of an addition/modification could be due to other reasons related to the change of the UE traffic conditions (e.g. a new UE bearer with a heavy guaranteed bit rate requirement has just been setup and UE could benefit from CA).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0183">In case the triggering to add/modify/release the CHO(s) was triggered by the target node, a method may be performed at the target node indicating the add/modify/release request to the source node. The add/modify/release request could also be transparently passed to the UE (e.g. in case there are multiple CHOs that are related to the same target cell of the target node)</p><p id="p-0188" num="0184">In case the triggering to add/modify/release the CHO(s) was triggered by the source node, a method may be performed at the source node indicating the add/modify/release request to the target node.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0185">Embodiments also include a method by each of the source and target node to communicate the addition/modification/release of the CHO configuration(s) to the UE.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0186">Embodiments further include a method at the UE to apply the addition/modification/release of CHO configurations.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0187">As some embodiments herein are applicable for the UEs being configured with multiple CHO configurations associated to the same target cell candidate, some embodiments exploit some identification mechanism other than based on cell identifier (e.g. the identification mechanisms may include a configuration identifier) so that an exact configuration may be modified or released.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0188">Certain embodiments may provide one or more of the following technical advantage(s).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0189">Some embodiments allow multiple conditional handover configurations applicable to the same target candidate cell.

This may be useful for several cases such as when the source and target may not fully comprehend each other's RRC messages, for example, when they employ different radio access technologies (e.g. source is LTE and target is NR, or vice versa) or different versions of the same radio access technologies (e.g. source is NR rel-16, target is NR rel-17).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0192">Consider now additional details of some embodiments concerning target trigger/initiated CHO addition/modification/release.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0193">In one embodiment, the target network node which has configured multiple CHO configurations associated to a given UE, triggers the addition/modification/release of CHO configurations upon determining a change in network conditions. For example, triggering conditional HO release or modification may be performed when other UEs have been handed over or need to be handed over to the target node cells and the resources that were reserved for the CHOs are no longer available. Or when a resource has been freed at the target (e.g. UEs have been handed over to neighboring cells) that makes it possible to configure more resources to the UE (e.g. a configuration with many carriers).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0194">The target network node could, when it wants to add/modify/release CHOs, send a message to the source node indicating which CHO(s) to release, which CHO(s) to add and which CHO(s) to modify.

The source node may do so by indicating conditional configuration identifiers (CCIs) which shall be released, e.g., in a control message <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. One way of implementing this may be to provide a list to the UE where each entry in the list indicates an identifier of a CHO and the cell for which a CHO shall be released. An example:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0202">CHO release list: {CCI 1, cell X}; {CCI 2, cell X}; {CCI 1, cell Y}; {CCI 3, cell Z}.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0207" num="0203">Another possible way to signal this is that there is a list of CCIs per cell:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0204">CHO release list: {Cell X: {CCI 1, CCI 2}}; {Cell Y: {CCI 1}}; {Cell Z: {CCI 3}}.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0208" num="0205">An illustration of the scenario is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.

For example, the release of CHOs can be indicated in another message, such as the HANDOVER CANCEL REQUIRED message shown below (which is an enhanced version of the HANDOVER CANCEL message that is currently available in X2/Xn for the source to indicate to the target to cancel an ongoing handover).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">9.1.1.6 Handover Cancel Required</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0208">This message is sent by the target NG-RAN node to the source NG-RAN node to release a conditional handover.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0000">Direction: target NG-RAN node&#x2192;source NG-RAN node.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">(Implicit) Transparent Container Approach</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0209">In another so-called implicit approach, the target node can modify the CHO configurations by transmitting a transparent container to the source network node comprising an updated CHO configuration. The source network node would then forward this container to the UE. The source node does not necessarily have to inspect or understand the content of the container. This could be useful for several cases such as when the source and target may not fully comprehend each other's RRC messages, for example, when they employ different radio access technologies (e.g. source is LTE and target is NR, or vice versa) or different versions of the same radio access technologies (e.g. source is NR rel-16, target is NR rel-17).</p><p id="p-0214" num="0210">Message structures similar to that shown above could be employed, where the main difference in this case is the information in the CHOs to be added/modified/released is contained in transparent container and the source is not expected to understand it and simply forwards it to the UE. There can be one container that contains all the CHOs to be added/modified/release, or there can be separate containers for each part. The control message <b>26</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in this case may have the structure illustrated above for HANDOVER MODIFICATION REQUIRED.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0211">The UE may, upon reception of receiving indications to release CHOs, release the indicated CHOs and send an acknowledgement message to the source node, e.g. using an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

The source <b>30</b> forwards the content of the container to the UE A transparently (Step 2). In response to this, the UE A may acknowledge to the source <b>30</b> that it has applied the content of the container (Step 3) and the source <b>30</b> may in its turn acknowledge to the candidate target <b>32</b> that the UE A has applied the content of the container (Step 4). Alternatively, the UE A may send an Acknowledgement, e.g. RRCReconfigurationComplete, in a container towards the source <b>30</b>, which then transparently forwards it to the target <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0213">In one embodiment the target network node indicates to the source node that a (set of) CHO(s) shall be modified. This may be by providing a new (set of) CHO configuration(s) and that new CHO configuration may be given the same conditional configuration identifier as the CHO which shall be updated.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0214">The source node would in response to receiving an indication from the target node execute the CHO update towards the UE. One way in which the source node may do this is to indicate to the UE that a CHO shall be modified. This may be done by sending the new CHO to the UE and the new CHO is given the same index as the CHO which shall be updated.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0215">Another approach is that the source node releases the CHO which shall be updated and the new (i.e. the updated) CHO is provided to the UE).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0216">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, another approach in which a CHO can be modified is that the target node indicates that a CHO shall be released and that a new (i.e. updated) CHO shall be added. These two indications (release and addition) may be signaled in the same or different messages.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0217">Consider now yet other embodiments for source triggered/initiated CHO addition/modification/release.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0218">In another embodiment, the addition/modification/release of CHO configurations is triggered/requested by the source node. For example, in one embodiment, the UE has been handed over to a certain target and the CHO configurations for other targets are no longer relevant/needed. In this case, the source may then trigger the release of the CHO configuration to the other targets.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0219">As another example, the traffic conditions at the UE have changed, requiring more resources (e.g. new bearer with heavy data rate requirement has been added). In this case, the source node may trigger CHO addition request to target node(s).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">As yet another example, the traffic conditions at the UE have changed, requiring less resources (e.g. a bearer with heavy data rate requirement has been released).

The UE is configured with CHO configurations for candidate target node B and node C, and the UE executes a CHO to Cell1 in node B (Steps 1 and 2). Upon the candidate target node B informing the source node A that CHO has been executed (Step 3), the source network node A indicates to node C that the CHOs for the UE shall no longer be applicable (Step 4). Alternatively, if based on a measurement report from the UE, the UE is no longer close to a certain candidate target cell, it may no longer be meaningful for the UE to have a CHO towards that target cell.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">The source node can indicate to a candidate target node in a single message to release all CHOs for the UE. &#x201c;All&#x201d; CHOs for a UE may comprise all CHOs for a UE for a particular cell. Another approach is that, if the UE has been handed over to a certain node, then a single message can be sent to the other nodes (one per node) to release all the CHOs for that UE where the target primary cell is any cell that is served by the target node.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0223">Below is an example implementation of this embodiment showing an enhancement of the Handover Cancel X2/Xn message.
