For example, in some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods to detect and/or quantify rare and/or unintended variations during a genomic editing event (e.g., at an intended locus for genomic editing or at an off-target, unintended locus) and associated reagents for use in such methods. In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods to detect and/or quantify clonal expansion and associated reagents for use in such methods.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present disclosure encompasses a recognition that high fidelity sequencing techniques, such as Duplex Sequencing, can be used to detect and/or quantify low frequency genetic variants. In some embodiments, the present disclosure describes using Duplex Sequencing for assessing a clonal selection in mixed cell populations (either in vitro or in vivo) and/or cell populations following a genomic editing event (e.g., an engineered genome editing event or a natural genomic editing event). For example, various embodiments of the present technology include performing Duplex Sequencing methods for identifying one or more genetic variants among target double-stranded nucleic acid molecules and determining a variant frequency of the one or more variants. Further examples of the present technology are directed to methods for detecting and assessing clonal expansion of cells following an event. For example, some embodiments include performing Duplex Sequencing methods for assessing clonal expansion of cells harboring mutations in cancer driving genes and/or that are under selective pressure. Other embodiments include performing Duplex Sequencing methods for assessing clonal expansion of cells based on the use of genetic markers of cell lineage that are not under selective pressure. In still further embodiments, the present technology provides methods of generating high accuracy sequencing reads of a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules extracted from a genome-edited cell population.

Diethylstilbestrol [DES]), among many others. In some embodiments, variants detected, analyzed and/or quantified in the context of the present disclosure are associated with cancer (e.g., neoplastic variants).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cancer driver or Cancer driver gene: As used herein, &#x201c;cancer driver&#x201d; or &#x201c;cancer driver gene&#x201d; refers to a genetic lesion that has the potential to allow a cell, in the right context, to undergo, or begin to undergo, a malignant transformation. Such genes include tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53, BRCA1) that normally suppress malignancy transformation and when mutated in certain ways, no longer do. Other driver genes can be oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, EGFR) that when mutated in certain ways become constitutively active or gain new properties that facilitate a cell to become malignant. Other mutations found in non-coding regions of the genome can be cancer drivers. For example, a mutation of the promoter region of the telomerase gene (TERT) can result in overexpression of the gene and thus become a cancer driver. Other mutations in non-coding regions can facilitate aberrant splicing or modulate transcription factor binding or other regulatory changes that can, in certain cases, lead to neoplastic growth. Certain rearrangements (e.g., BCR-ABL fusion) can juxtapose one genetic region with that of another to drive tumorigenesis through mechanisms related to overexpression, loss of repression or chimeric fusion genes. Broadly speaking, genetic mutations (or epimutations) that confer a phenotype to a cell that facilitates its proliferation, survival, or competitive advantage over other cells or that renders its ability to evolve more robust, can be considered a driver mutation. This is to be contrasted with mutations that lack such features, even if they may happen to be in the same gene (i.e. a synonymous mutation). When such mutations are identified in tumors, they are commonly referred to as passenger mutations because they &#x201c;hitchhiked&#x201d; along with the clonal expansion without meaningfully contributing to the expansion. As recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, the distinction of driver and passenger is not absolute and should not be construed as such. Some drivers only function in certain situations (e.g., certain tissues) and others may not operate in the absence of other mutations or epimutations or other factors.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Clonal expansion. As used herein, &#x201c;clonal expansion&#x201d; refers to the clonal outgrowth of a population of cells derived from a common founder cell. The derivative population of cells (i.e. daughter cells), may be referred to as simply a clone. Clonal expansions can occur through artificial means (i.e. a single isolated cell in culture is allowed to grow and iteratively divide into a population of cells). as a result of normal healthy biological processes (i.e. a fertilized egg is founding cell of a human, all the cells of which comprise a clone). Clonal expansions may also occur as a result of pathogenic processes, such as when a cell in the body gains the ability to progressively grow and divide when it should not and forms a tumor comprising its daughter cells. Clones, by their very nature contain subclones&#x2014;that is, smaller populations of cells that are clonally derived from a daughter cell of the original clonal founder. These subclones are, themselves, simply clones when viewed in reference to their specific founder cell, but are referred to as subclones when viewed relative to an even earlier founding cell.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;clone&#x201d; or &#x201c;clonal expansion&#x201d; does not, itself, necessarily indicate which of the above, or other processes may have led to the clonal outgrowth. A clonal expansion may occur within a population of related cells (i.e. one cell in a human that forms a tumor within healthy tissue) or unrelated cells (i.e. a population of cells in culture that was established from the cells of many different people). In general, to recognize a cell that is undergoing clonal expansion within a larger cell population, there usually needs to be at least one unique lineage marker of some form to differentiate that cell and its daughter cells from other cells in the population. That lineage marker may be a genetic variant that is substantially unique to the founder cell and is propagated to the daughter cells. Such a genetic variant may be a mutation in the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome, epi-mutations other heritable changes or changes to other molecules in the cell (i.e. proteins) that result from the above and can be detected. The specific lineage marker of a clonal expansion/clone may itself be responsible or contributory to the expansion (i.e. a &#x201c;driver&#x201d;) or may simply mark the clone and serve no specific function (i.e. a &#x201c;passenger&#x201d; or &#x201c;hitchhiker&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Clonal expansion of a cell in a heterogeneous cell population may arise for a variety of reasons, including stochastic clonal expansion, increased rate of growth, reduced senescence, reduced contact inhibition. In these latter cases the clonal expansions occur as a result of a positive growth bias (e.g., a relative growth advantage) compared to other cells in a population of cells. This increased or preferential reproduction of a single cell produces a greater number of daughter/derivative cells than other cells in a heterogeneous cell population, such that daughter or derivative cells from that cell disproportionately expand in the cell population to form a clone. For example, in some embodiments, a cell that undergoes clonal expansion is neoplastic. In some embodiments, a cell that undergoes clonal expansion is healthier than other cells in a heterogeneous cell population (e.g., other cells in the population have a negative growth bias).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Clonal selection; As used herein, &#x201c;clonal selection&#x201d; refers to a selection or positive bias for a particular cell in a population. Generally, clonal selection is an event and/or signal that results in an increased or preferential reproduction of a single cell to produce a greater number of daughter/derivative cells than other cells in a heterogeneous cell population, such that daughter or derivative cells from that cell are disproportionately expanding or surviving in the cell population.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Determine: Many methodologies described herein include a step of &#x201c;determining&#x201d;.

In some embodiments, determining involves manipulation of a physical sample. In some embodiments, determining involves consideration and/or manipulation of data or information (for example, utilizing a computer or other processing unit adapted to perform a relevant analysis). In some embodiments, determining involves receiving relevant information and/or materials from a source. In some embodiments, determining involves comparing one or more features of a sample or entity to a comparable reference.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Duplex Sequencing (DS): As used herein, &#x201c;Duplex Sequencing (DS)&#x201d; is, in its broadest sense, refers to an error-correction method that achieves exceptional accuracy by comparing the sequence from both strands of individual DNA molecules.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Engineered: Those of ordinary skill in the art, reading the present disclosure, will appreciate that the term &#x201c;engineered&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an aspect of having been manipulated and altered by the hand of man. In particular, the term &#x201c;engineered cell&#x201d; refers to a cell that has been subjected to a manipulation, so that its genetic, epigenetic, and/or phenotypic identity is altered relative to an appropriate reference cell such as otherwise identical cell that has not been so manipulated. In some embodiments, the manipulation is or comprises a genetic manipulation, such as gene editing, base editing and gene therapy. In some embodiments, an engineered cell is one that has been manipulated so that it contains and/or expresses a particular agent of interest (e.g., a protein, a nucleic acid, and/or a particular form thereof) in an altered amount and/or according to altered timing relative to such an appropriate reference cell.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Expression: As used herein, &#x201c;expression&#x201d; of a nucleic acid sequence refers to one or more of the following events: (1) production of an RNA template from a DNA sequence (e.g., by transcription); (2) processing of an RNA transcript (e.g., by splicing, editing, 5&#x2032; cap formation, and/or 3&#x2032; end formation); (3) translation of an RNA into a polypeptide or protein; and/or (4) post-translational modification of a polypeptide or protein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Gene. As used herein, the term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; refers to a DNA sequence in a chromosome that codes for a product (e.g., an RNA product and/or a polypeptide product). In some embodiments, a gene includes coding sequence (i.e., sequence that encodes a particular product); in some embodiments, a gene includes non-coding sequence. In some particular embodiments, a gene may include both coding (e.g., exonic) and non-coding (e.g., intronic) sequences. In some embodiments, a gene may include one or more regulatory elements that, for example, may control or impact one or more aspects of gene expression (e.g., cell-type-specific expression, inducible expression, etc.).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Genome editing: As used herein, &#x201c;genome editing&#x201d;, &#x201c;genomic editing&#x201d; or &#x201c;genome engineering&#x201d; refers to processes for altering or engineering changes to nucleic acid (e.g., genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA or other DNA) in a living organism (e.g., a cell or multiple cells). Genome editing can include providing systems for inserting, deleting, modifying, replacing, correcting, interrupting, damaging, rendering non-functional, or mutating nucleic acid sequence(s) in the genome of the living organism. Targeted genome editing comprises methods in which specific sequences can be changed (e.g., &#x201c;edited&#x201d;), for example, at an intended genomic locus. Genetic tools, such as, for example, programmable site-specific nucleases, can be used to direct desired alterations to a genome in vivo. Genome editing can be achieved by genetic manipulation of a DNA sequence in vitro or in another living organism followed by insertion of this sequence into a genome of interest.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">gRNA: As used herein, &#x201c;gRNA&#x201d; or &#x201c;guide RNA&#x201d;, refers to short RNA molecules which include a scaffold sequence suitable for a targeted endonuclease (e.g., a Cas enzyme such as Cas9 or Cpfl or another ribonucleoprotein with similar properties, etc.) binding to a substantially target-specific sequence which facilitates cutting of a specific region of DNA or RNA.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Homology: As used herein, the term &#x201c;homology&#x201d; refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g., between nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules). In some embodiments, polymeric molecules are considered to be &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; to one another if their sequences are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical. In other embodiments the degree of similarity may be less than 30%, at least 30% 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or more than 70%. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a variety of algorithms are available that permit comparison of sequences in order to determine their degree of homology, including by permitting gaps of designated length in one sequence relative to another when considering which residues &#x201c;correspond&#x201d; to one another in different sequences. Calculation of the percent homology between two nucleic acid sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second nucleic acid sequences for optimal alignment and non-corresponding sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or substantially 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position; when a position in the first sequence is occupied by a similar nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are similar at that position. The percent homology between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical and similar positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Algorithms and computer programs useful in determining the percent homology between two nucleotide sequences are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Mutation: As used herein, the term &#x201c;mutation&#x201d; refers to alterations to nucleic acid sequence or structure relative to a reference sequence. Mutations to a polynucleotide sequence can include point mutations (e.g., single base mutations), multinucleotide mutations, nucleotide deletions, sequence rearrangements, nucleotide insertions, and duplications of the DNA sequence in the sample, among complex multinucelotide changes. Mutations can occur on both strands of a duplex DNA molecule as complementary base changes (i.e. true mutations), or as a mutation on one strand but not the other strand (i.e. heteroduplex), that has the potential to be either repaired, destroyed or be mis-repaired/converted into a true double stranded mutation. Reference sequences may be present in databases (i.e. HG38 human reference genome) or the sequence of another sample to which a sequence is being compared. Mutations are also known as genetic variant.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Mutant frequency: As used herein, the term &#x201c;mutant frequency&#x201d;, also sometimes referred to as &#x201c;mutational frequency&#x201d;, refers to the number of unique mutations detected per the total number of base-pairs sequenced. In some embodiments the unique mutations are defined as Duplex Sequencing verified mutations and the total number of base-pairs sequenced is defined as those verified by Duplex Sequencing. In some embodiments, the mutant frequency is the frequency of mutations within only a specific gene, a set of genes, or a set of genomic targets. In some embodiments mutant frequency may refer to only certain types of mutations (for example the frequency of A&#x3e;T mutations, which is calculated as the number of A&#x3e;T mutations per the total number of A bases). The frequency at which mutations arise into a population of cells or molecules can vary by age of a subject, over time, by tissue or organization type, by region of a genome, by type of mutation, by trinucleotide context, inherited genetic background, by exposure to mutagenic chemicals, by exposure to radiation, and by exposure to an environment comprising any of the above, among other things.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Mutation signature: As used herein, the term &#x201c;mutation signature&#x201d;, &#x201c;mutation spectrum&#x201d; or mutation spectra&#x201d; refers to characteristic combinations of mutation types arising from mutagenesis processes such as genomic editing (e.g., natural genomic editing or engineered genomic editing), DNA replication infidelity, exogenous and endogenous genotoxin exposures, defective DNA repair pathways and DNA enzymatic editing. Mutational spectra may comprise trinucleotide mutation spectra which entails the pattern of relative abundance of possible types of mutations among three base-pair nucleotide sequence contexts. Such spectra may be normalized by the relative abundance of a sequence context in a reference genome. Mutational spectra may entail mutations of any type in any sequence context. In an embodiment, the mutation spectrum is may be compared to the mutation spectrum of other samples or data sets by computational pattern matching (e.g., unsupervised hierarchical mutation spectrum clustering, non-negative matrix factorization etc.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Nucleic acid. As used herein, in its broadest sense, refers to any compound and/or substance that is or can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide chain. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is a compound and/or substance that is or can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide chain via a phosphodiester linkage. As will be clear from context, in some embodiments, &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; refers to an individual nucleic acid residue (e.g., a nucleotide and/or nucleoside); in some embodiments, &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; refers to an oligonucleotide chain comprising individual nucleic acid residues.

No. 9,752,188, and WO 2017/100441, in Schmitt et. al, PNAS, 2012 [1]; in Kennedy et. al, PLOS Genetics, 2013 [2]; in Kennedy et. al., Nature Protocols, 2014 [3]; and in Schmitt et. al., Nature Methods, 2015 [4]. Each of the above-mentioned patents, patent applications and publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, and in certain aspects of the technology, Duplex Sequencing can be used to independently sequence both strands of individual DNA molecules in such a way that the derivative sequence reads can be recognized as having originated from the same double-stranded nucleic acid parent molecule during massively parallel sequencing (MPS), also commonly known as next generation sequencing (NGS), but also differentiated from each other as distinguishable entities following sequencing. The resulting sequence reads from each strand are then compared for the purpose of obtaining an error-corrected sequence of the original double-stranded nucleic acid molecule known as a Duplex Consensus Sequence (DCS). The process of Duplex Sequencing makes it possible to explicitly confirm that both strands of an original double stranded nucleic acid molecule are represented in the generated sequencing data used to form a DCS.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In certain embodiments, methods incorporating DS may include ligation of one or more sequencing adapters to a target double-stranded nucleic acid molecule, comprising a first strand target nucleic acid sequence and a second strand target nucleic sequence, to produce a double-stranded target nucleic acid complex (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments, a resulting target nucleic acid complex can include at least one SMI sequence, which may entail an exogenously applied degenerate or semi-degenerate sequence (e.g., randomized duplex tag shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, sequences identified as a and &#x3b2; in FIG. <b>1</b>A), endogenous information related to the specific shear-points of the target double-stranded nucleic acid molecule, or a combination thereof. The SMI can render the target-nucleic acid molecule substantially distinguishable from the plurality of other molecules in a population being sequenced either alone or in combination with distinguishing elements of the nucleic acid fragments to which they were ligated. The SMI element's substantially distinguishable feature can be independently carried by each of the single strands that form the double-stranded nucleic acid molecule such that the derivative amplification products of each strand can be recognized as having come from the same original substantially unique double-stranded nucleic acid molecule after sequencing. In other embodiments, the SMI may include additional information and/or may be used in other methods for which such molecule distinguishing functionality is useful, such as those described in the above-referenced publications. In another embodiment, the SMI element may be incorporated after adapter ligation. In some embodiments, the SMI is double-stranded in nature. In other embodiments it is single-stranded in nature (e.g., the SMI can be on the single-stranded portion(s) of the adapters). In other embodiments, it is a combination of single-stranded and double-stranded in nature.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, each double-stranded target nucleic acid sequence complex can further include an element (e.g., an SDE) that renders the amplification products of the two single-stranded nucleic acids that form the target double-stranded nucleic acid molecule substantially distinguishable from each other after sequencing. In one embodiment, an SDE may comprise asymmetric primer sites comprised within the sequencing adapters, or, in other arrangements, sequence asymmetries may be introduced into the adapter molecules not within the primer sequences, such that at least one position in the nucleotide sequences of the first strand target nucleic acid sequence complex and the second stand of the target nucleic acid sequence complex are different from each other following amplification and sequencing. In other embodiments, the SMI may comprise another biochemical asymmetry between the two strands that differs from the canonical nucleotide sequences A, T, C, G or U, but is converted into at least one canonical nucleotide sequence difference in the two amplified and sequenced molecules. In yet another embodiment, the SDE may be a means of physically separating the two strands before amplification, such that the derivative amplification products from the first strand target nucleic acid sequence and the second strand target nucleic acid sequence are maintained in substantial physical isolation from one another for the purposes of maintaining a distinction between the two. Other such arrangements or methodologies for providing an SDE function that allows for distinguishing the first and second strands may be utilized, such as those described in the above-referenced publications, or other methods that serves the functional purpose described.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After generating the double-stranded target nucleic acid complex comprising at least one SMI and at least one SDE, or where one or both of these elements will be subsequently introduced, the complex can be subjected to DNA amplification, such as with PCR, or any other biochemical method of DNA amplification (e.g., rolling circle amplification, multiple displacement amplification, isothermal amplification, bridge amplification or surface-bound amplification, such that one or more copies of the first strand target nucleic acid sequence and one or more copies of the second strand target nucleic acid sequence are produced (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>)). The one or more amplification copies of the first strand target nucleic acid molecule and the one or more amplification copies of the second target nucleic acid molecule can then be subjected to DNA sequencing, preferably using a &#x201c;Next-Generation&#x201d; massively parallel DNA sequencing platform (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sequence reads produced from either the first strand target nucleic acid molecule and the second strand target nucleic acid molecule, derived from the original double-stranded target nucleic acid molecule, can be identified based on sharing a related substantially unique SMI and distinguished from the opposite strand target nucleic acid molecule by virtue of an SDE. In some embodiments, the SMI may be a sequence based on a mathematically-based error correction code (for example, a Hamming code), whereby certain amplification errors, sequencing errors or SMI synthesis errors can be tolerated for the purpose of relating the sequences of the SMI sequences on complementary strands of an original Duplex (e.g., a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule). For example, with a double stranded exogenous SMI where the SMI comprises 15 base pairs of fully degenerate sequence of canonical DNA bases, an estimated 4{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}15=1,073,741,824 SMI variants will exist in a population of the fully degenerate SMIs. If two SMIs are recovered from reads of sequencing data that differ by only one nucleotide within the SMI sequence out of a population of 10,000 sampled SMIs, one can mathematically calculate the probability of this occurring by random chance, a decision can be made whether it is more probable that the single base pair difference reflects one of the aforementioned types of errors, and the SMI sequences could be determined to have in fact derived from the same original duplex molecule. In some embodiments where the SMI is, at least in part, an exogenously applied sequence where the sequence variants are not fully degenerate to each other and are, at least in part, known sequences, the identity of the known sequences can in some embodiments be designed in such a way that one or more errors of the aforementioned types will not convert the identity of one known SMI sequence to that of another SMI sequence, such that the probability of one SMI being misinterpreted as that of another SMI is reduced. In some embodiments this SMI design strategy comprises a Hamming Code approach or derivative thereof. Once identified, one or more sequence reads produced from the first strand target nucleic acid molecule are compared with one or more sequence reads produced from the second strand target nucleic acid molecule to produce an error-corrected target nucleic acid molecule sequence (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). For example, nucleotide positions where the bases from both the first and second strand target nucleic acid sequences agree are deemed to be true sequences, whereas nucleotide positions that disagree between the two strands are recognized as potential sites of technical errors that may be discounted, eliminated, corrected or otherwise identified. An error-corrected sequence of the original double-stranded target nucleic acid molecule can thus be produced (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). In some embodiments, and following separately grouping of each of the sequencing reads produced from the first strand target nucleic acid molecule and the second strand target nucleic acid molecule, a single-strand consensus sequence can be generated for each of the first and second strands. The single-stranded consensus sequences from the first strand target nucleic acid molecule and the second strand target nucleic acid molecule can then be compared to produce an error-corrected target nucleic acid molecule sequence (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, in some embodiments, sites of sequence disagreement between the two strands can be recognized as potential sites of biologically-derived mismatches in the original double stranded target nucleic acid molecule. Alternatively, in some embodiments, sites of sequence disagreement between the two strands can be recognized as potential sites of DNA synthesis-derived mismatches in the original double stranded target nucleic acid molecule. Alternatively, in some embodiments, sites of sequence disagreement between the two strands can be recognized as potential sites where a damaged or modified nucleotide base was present on one or both strands and was converted to a mismatch by an enzymatic process (for example a DNA polymerase, a DNA glycosylase or another nucleic acid modifying enzyme or chemical process). In some embodiments, this latter finding can be used to infer the presence of nucleic acid damage or nucleotide modification prior to the enzymatic process or chemical treatment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, and in accordance with aspects of the present technology, sequencing reads generated from the Duplex Sequencing steps discussed herein can be further filtered to eliminate sequencing reads from DNA-damaged molecules (e.g., damaged during storage, shipping, during or following tissue or blood extraction, during or following library preparation, etc.). For example, DNA repair enzymes, such as Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG), and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), can be utilized to eliminate or correct DNA damage (e.g., in vitro DNA damage or in vivo damage). These DNA repair enzymes, for example, are glycoslyases that remove damaged bases from DNA. For example, UDG removes uracil that results from cytosine deamination (caused by spontaneous hydrolysis of cytosine) and FPG removes 8-oxo-guanine (e.g., a common DNA lesion that results from reactive oxygen species). FPG also has lyase activity that can generate a 1 base gap at abasic sites. Such abasic sites will generally subsequently fail to amplify by PCR, for example, because the polymerase fails to copy the template. Accordingly, the use of such DNA damage repair/elimination enzymes can effectively remove damaged DNA that doesn't have a true mutation but might otherwise be undetected as an error following sequencing and duplex sequence analysis. Although an error due to a damaged base can often be corrected by Duplex Sequencing, in rare cases a complementary error could theoretically occur at the same position on both strands; thus, reducing error-increasing damage can reduce the probability of artifacts. Furthermore, during library preparation, certain fragments of DNA to be sequenced may be single-stranded from their source or from processing steps (for example, mechanical DNA shearing). These regions are typically converted to double stranded DNA during an &#x201c;end repair&#x201d; step known in the art, whereby a DNA polymerase and nucleoside substrates are added to a DNA sample to extend <b>5</b>&#x2032; recessed ends. A mutagenic site of DNA damage in the single-stranded portion of the DNA being copied (i.e. single-stranded <b>5</b>&#x2032; overhang at one or both ends of the DNA duplex or internal single-stranded nicks or gaps) can cause an error during the fill-in reaction that could render a single-stranded mutation, synthesis error, or site of nucleic acid damage into a double-stranded form that could be misinterpreted in the final duplex consensus sequence as a true mutation whereby the true mutation was present in the original double stranded nucleic acid molecule, when, in fact, it was not. This scenario, termed &#x201c;pseudo-duplex&#x201d;, can be reduced or prevented by use of such damage destroying/repair enzymes. In other embodiments, this occurrence can be reduced or eliminated through use of strategies to destroy or prevent single-stranded portions of the original duplex molecule to form (e.g. use of certain enzymes being used to fragment the original double stranded nucleic acid material rather than mechanical shearing or certain other enzymes that may leave nicks or gaps). In other embodiments, use of processes to eliminate single-stranded portions of original double-stranded nucleic acids (e.g. single-stand specific nucleases such as S1 nuclease or mung bean nuclease) can be utilized for a similar purpose.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In further embodiments, sequencing reads generated from the Duplex Sequencing steps discussed herein can be further filtered to eliminate false mutations by trimming ends of the reads most prone to pseudoduplex artifacts. For example, DNA fragmentation can generate single strand portions at the terminal ends of double-stranded molecule. These single-stranded portions can be filled in (e.g., by Klenow or T4 polymerase) during end repair. In some instances, polymerases make copy mistakes in these end repaired regions leading to the generation of &#x201c;pseudoduplex molecules.&#x201d; These artifacts of library preparation can incorrectly appear to be true mutations once sequenced. These errors, as a result of end repair mechanisms, can be eliminated or reduced from analysis post-sequencing by trimming the ends of the sequencing reads to exclude any mutations that may have occurred in higher risk regions, thereby reducing the number of false mutations. In one embodiment, such trimming of sequencing reads can be accomplished automatically (e.g., a normal process step). In another embodiment, a mutant frequency can be assessed for fragment end regions, and if a threshold level of mutations is observed in the fragment end regions, sequencing read trimming can be performed before generating a double-strand consensus sequence read of the DNA fragments.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">By way of specific example, in some embodiments, provided herein are methods of generating an error-corrected sequence read of a double-stranded target nucleic acid material, including the step of ligating a double-stranded target nucleic acid material to at least one adapter sequence, to form an adapter-target nucleic acid material complex, wherein the at least one adapter sequence comprises (a) a degenerate or semi-degenerate single molecule identifier (SMI) sequence that uniquely labels each molecule of the double-stranded target nucleic acid material, and (b) a first nucleotide adapter sequence that tags a first strand of the adapter-target nucleic acid material complex, and a second nucleotide adapter sequence that is at least partially non-complimentary to the first nucleotide sequence that tags a second strand of the adapter-target nucleic acid material complex such that each strand of the adapter-target nucleic acid material complex has a distinctly identifiable nucleotide sequence relative to its complementary strand. The method can next include the steps of amplifying each strand of the adapter-target nucleic acid material complex to produce a plurality of first strand adapter-target nucleic acid complex amplicons and a plurality of second strand adapter-target nucleic acid complex amplicons.

In another embodiment, the SMI sequence is single-stranded before or after ligation to a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule and a complimentary SMI sequence can be generated by extending the opposite strand with a DNA polymerase to yield a complementary double-stranded SMI sequence. In other embodiments, an SMI sequence is in a single-stranded portion of the adapter (e.g., an arm of an adapter having a Y-shape). In such embodiments, the SMI can facilitate grouping of families of sequence reads derived from an original strand of a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule, and in some instances can confer relationship between original first and second strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule (e.g., all or part of the SMIs maybe relatable via look up table).

Similarly, asymmetric chemical labelling of the adapter strands in a way that they can be physically separated can serve an SDE role. A recently described variation of Duplex Sequencing uses bisulfite conversion to transform naturally occurring strand asymmetries in the form of cytosine methylation into sequence differences that distinguish the two strands. Although this implementation limits the types of mutations that can be detected, the concept of capitalizing on native asymmetry is noteworthy in the context of emerging sequencing technologies that can directly detect modified nucleotides.

A number of prior studies and commercial products have designed primer mixtures satisfying a certain number of these criteria for conventional PCR-CE. However, it has been noted that these primer mixtures are not always optimal for use with MPS. Indeed, developing highly multiplexed primer mixtures can be a challenging and time-consuming process. Conveniently, both Illumina and Promega have recently developed multiplex compatible primer mixtures for the Illumina platform that show robust and efficient amplification of a variety of standard and non-standard STR and SNP loci. Because these kits use PCR to amplify their target regions prior to sequencing, the 5&#x2032;-end of each read in paired-end sequencing data corresponds to the 5&#x2032;-end of the PCR primers used to amplify the DNA. In some embodiments, provided methods and compositions include primers designed to ensure uniform amplification, which may entail varying reaction concentrations, melting temperatures, and minimizing secondary structure and intra/inter-primer interactions.

In some embodiments, amplifying a nucleic acid material includes use of at least one single-stranded oligonucleotide at least partially complementary to a target region or a target sequence of interest (e.g., a genomic sequence, a mitochondrial sequence, a plasmid sequence, a synthetically produced target nucleic acid, etc.) and a single-stranded oligonucleotide at least partially complementary to a region of the adapter sequence (e.g., a primer site).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In general, robust amplification (for example PCR amplification), can be highly dependent on the reaction conditions. Multiplex PCR, for example, can be sensitive to buffer composition, monovalent or divalent cation concentration, detergent concentration, crowding agent (i.e. PEG, glycerol, etc.) concentration, primer concentrations, primer Tms, primer designs, primer GC content, primer modified nucleotide properties, and cycling conditions {i.e. temperature and extension times and rate of temperature changes). Optimization of buffer conditions can be a difficult and time-consuming process. In some embodiments, an amplification reaction may use at least one of a buffer, primer pool concentration, and PCR conditions in accordance with a previously known amplification protocol. In some embodiments, a new amplification protocol may be created, and/or an amplification reaction optimization may be used. By way of specific example, in some embodiments, a PCR optimization kit may be used, such as a PCR Optimization Kit from Promega&#xae;, which contains a number of pre-formulated buffers that are partially optimized for a variety of PCR applications, such as multiplex, real-time, GC-rich, and inhibitor-resistant amplifications. These pre-formulated buffers can be rapidly supplemented with different Mg<sup>2+</sup> and primer concentrations, as well as primer pool ratios. In addition, in some embodiments, a variety of cycling conditions (e.g., thermal cycling) may be assessed and/or used. In assessing whether or not a particular embodiment is appropriate for a particular desired application, one or more of specificity, allele coverage ratio for heterozygous loci, interlocus balance, and depth, among other aspects, may be assessed. Measurements of amplification success may include DNA sequencing of the products, evaluation of products by gel or capillary electrophoresis or HPLC or other size separation methods followed by fragment visualization, melt curve analysis using double-stranded nucleic acid binding dyes or fluorescent probes, mass spectrometry or other methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In accordance with various embodiments, any of a variety of factors may influence the length of a particular amplification step (e.g., the number of cycles in a PCR reaction, etc.). For example, in some embodiments, a provided nucleic acid material may be compromised or otherwise suboptimal (e.g. degraded and/or contaminated). In such case, a longer amplification step may be helpful in ensuring a desired product is amplified to an acceptable degree. In some embodiments, an amplification step may provide an average of 3 to 10 sequenced PCR copies from each starting DNA molecule, though in other embodiments, only a single copy of each of a first strand and second strand are required. Without wishing to be held to a particular theory, it is possible that too many or too few PCR copies could result in reduced assay efficiency and, ultimately, reduced depth. Generally, the number of nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) fragments used in an amplification (e.g., PCR) reaction is a primary adjustable variable that can dictate the number of reads that share the same SMI/barcode sequence.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Nucleic Acid Material</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Types</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In accordance with various embodiments, any of a variety of nucleic acid material may be used. In some embodiments, nucleic acid material may comprise at least one modification to a polynucleotide within the canonical sugar-phosphate backbone.

For example, by way of non-limiting example, in some embodiments, the nucleic acid material is or comprises at least one of double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Modifications</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In accordance with various embodiments, nucleic acid material may receive one or more modifications prior to, substantially simultaneously, or subsequent to, any particular step, depending upon the application for which a particular provided method or composition is used.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, a modification may be or comprise repair of at least a portion of the nucleic acid material. While any application-appropriate manner of nucleic acid repair is contemplated as compatible with some embodiments, certain exemplary methods and compositions therefore are described below and in the Examples.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">By way of non-limiting example, in some embodiments, DNA repair enzymes, such as Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG), and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), can be utilized to correct DNA damage (e.g., in vitro DNA damage). As discussed above, these DNA repair enzymes, for example, are glycoslyases that remove damaged bases from DNA. For example, UDG removes uracil that results from cytosine deamination (caused by spontaneous hydrolysis of cytosine) and FPG removes 8-oxo-guanine (e.g., most common DNA lesion that results from reactive oxygen species). FPG also has lyase activity that can generate 1 base gap at abasic sites. Such abasic sites will subsequently fail to amplify by PCR, for example, because the polymerase fails copy the template. Accordingly, the use of such DNA damage repair enzymes can effectively remove damaged DNA that doesn't have a true mutation but might otherwise be undetected as an error following sequencing and duplex sequence analysis.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As discussed above, in further embodiments, sequencing reads generated from the processing steps discussed herein can be further filtered to eliminate false mutations by trimming ends of the reads most prone to artifacts. For example, DNA fragmentation can generate single-strand portions at the terminal ends of double-stranded molecules. These single-stranded portions can be filled in (e.g., by Klenow) during end repair. In some instances, polymerases make copy mistakes in these end-repaired regions leading to the generation of &#x201c;pseudoduplex molecules.&#x201d; These artifacts can appear to be true mutations once sequenced. These errors, as a result of end repair mechanisms, can be eliminated from analysis post-sequencing by trimming the ends of the sequencing reads to exclude any mutations that may have occurred, thereby reducing the number of false mutations. In some embodiments, such trimming of sequencing reads can be accomplished automatically (e.g., a normal process step). In some embodiments, a mutant frequency can be assessed for fragment end regions and if a threshold level of mutations is observed in the fragment end regions, sequencing read trimming can be performed before generating a double-strand consensus sequence read of the DNA fragments.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The high degree of error correction provided by the strand-comparison technology of Duplex Sequencing reduces sequencing errors of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules by multiple orders of magnitude as compared with standard next-generation sequencing methods. This reduction in errors improves the accuracy of sequencing in nearly all types of sequences but can be particularly well suited to biochemically challenging sequences that are well known in the art to be particularly error prone. One non-limiting example of such type of sequence is homopolymers or other microsatellites/short-tandem repeats. Another non-limiting example of error prone sequences that benefit from Duplex Sequencing error correction are molecules that have been damaged, for example, by heating, radiation, mechanical stress, or a variety of chemical exposures which creates chemical adducts that are error prone during copying by one or more nucleotide polymerases and also those that create single-stranded DNA at ends of molecules or as nicks and gaps. In further embodiments, Duplex Sequencing can also be used for the accurate detection of minority sequence variants among a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules. One non-limiting example of this application is detection of a small number of variant DNA molecules (e.g., with variants that were induced, acquired, and/or selected for during a genome editing event), among a larger number of DNA molecules. Another non-limiting application for rare variant detection by Duplex Sequencing is early detection of DNA damage resulting from a genomic editing event. A further non-limiting application of Duplex Sequencing is for detection and quantification of clonal expansion of cells (e.g., cells with a positive growth bias, e.g., cells containing mutations under selective pressure, e.g., neoplastic mutations). Another non-limiting application of Duplex Sequencing is for assessing success of target genome editing activities or detection of aberrant genome editing events.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Selected Embodiments for Assessment of Genomic Editing</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Genome editing, also known as gene editing and engineered genome editing, among other names, is widely used in applications such as gene silencing or transcriptional repression, transient activation of endogenous genes, genetic modification of embryonic stem cells, production of cell therapies to treat disease, generation of transgenic organisms, genetic engineering of plants for crop improvement among other agriculture applications, and in vivo gene knockout screening, destruction of dominant-negative genetic loci, among other uses. Depending on the intended applications, genome editing techniques can be effective for inserting, deleting, modifying, replacing, correcting, or mutating nucleic acid sequence(s) in the genome of the living organism. In particular applications, precise modifications to a genomic sequence (either intended or not intended, desired or not desired) can be ascertained using genome editing.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Characterization of the genome following a genome editing process can be important to determine if a desired change at a targeted (e.g., an intended genomic site) region or locus of the DNA was achieved, to determine the efficiency of the process (e.g., to determine the proportion of cells that were accurately altered at the intended genomic site), and to assess if any changes were made to the genome of cells at one or more unintended or &#x201c;off-target&#x201d; loci of the genome. Genome sequencing methods (e.g., NGS) provide a tool for determining the nucleotide sequence at one or more sites of the genome; however, the level of sensitivity of accuracy of DNA sequencing needed to identify and quantify gene editing events in a cell population on a molecule-by-molecule basis is not achievable with conventional NGS methods.

Many tools lack the sensitivity to detect early stage neoplastic expansion of a clone selected under pressure.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Many events can result in alterations in the cellular genome such as insertions, deletions, breaks and/or rearrangements, that can lead to cancer if the damage does not immediately lead to cell death. In certain cell populations, cells harboring mutations in cancer driver genes (e.g., tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes) may be masked by the context of the cell population and clonal growth of neighboring cells. However, an event that may disrupt clonal growth of some cells (e.g., deleterious DNA damage that causes cell cycle arrest, cell death, etc.), provides opportunity for selective growth of cells with growth advantages and such clones may disproportionately populate through cell expansion following the event. Events causing selective pressure can be any event, change, treatment, process or other exposure (chemical, biological, physical) that provides evolutionary pressure on cells that can adapt and/or outcompete neighbors. Such selective pressure can be present in vivo or in vitro settings. For example, a xenograft in a human or animal subject may demonstrate selective expansion of some cells over others. In another example, following targeted genomic editing, some cells harboring evolutionary advantages may outcompete other neighboring cells in cell culture. In such cases, the variant allele frequency of the cell clones as they expand can represent the respective rates of growth and provide insight into the selective advantage or disadvantage of the different variants represented. Accordingly, variant allele frequency of representative molecules as detected by Duplex Sequencing can be used to uncover cell clones carrying mutations that outperform other cells under selective pressures. Certain of these mutations would be problematic in clinical settings and therapies where cells would be introduced into a patient.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some embodiments, provided methods are performed at multiple time points to assess changes in the frequency and/or abundance of one or more variants.

Patent No. 9,752,188, International Patent Publication No. WO2017/100441, and International Patent Application No. PCT/US 18/59908 (filed Nov. 8, 2018), all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">Additionally, a kit may further include DNA quantification materials such as, for example, DNA binding dye such as SYBR&#x2122; green or SYBR&#x2122; gold (available from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) or the alike for use with a Qubit fluorometer (e.g., available from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), or PicoGreen&#x2122; dye (e.g., available from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) for use on a suitable fluorescence spectrometer or a real-time PCR machine or digital-droplet PCR machine. Other reagents suitable for DNA quantification on other platforms are also contemplated. Further embodiments include kits comprising one or more of nucleic acid size selection reagents (e.g., Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) magnetic beads, gels, columns), columns for target DNA capture using bait/pray hybridization, qPCR reagents (e.g., for copy number determination) and/or digital droplet PCR reagents. In some embodiments, a kit may optionally include one or more of library preparation enzymes (ligase, polymerase(s), endonuclease(s), reverse transcriptase for e.g., RNA interrogations), dNTPs, buffers, capture reagents (e.g., beads, surfaces, coated tubes, columns, etc.), indexing primers, amplification primers (PCR primers) and sequencing primers. In some embodiments, a kit may include reagents for assessing types of DNA damage such as an error-prone DNA polymerase and/or a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Additional additives and reagents are contemplated for PCR or ligation reactions in specific conditions (e.g., high GC rich genome/target).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0174">In an embodiment, the kits further comprise reagents, such as DNA error correcting enzymes that repair DNA sequence errors that interfere with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) processes (versus repairing mutations leading to disease). By way of non-limiting example, the enzymes comprise one or more of the following: monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (hSMUGl), Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), N-glycosylase/AP-lyase NEIL 1 protein (hNEIL1), Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG), 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG 1), human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE 1), endonuclease III (Endo III), endonuclease IV (Endo IV), endonuclease V (Endo V), endonuclease VIII (Endo VIII), T7 endonuclease I (T7 Endo I), T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (T4 PDG), human single-strand-selective human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (hAAG), etc., among other glycosylases, lyases, endonucleases and exonucleases etc.; and can be utilized to correct DNA damage (e.g., in vitro or in vivo DNA damage). Some of such DNA repair enzymes, for example, are glycoslyases that remove damaged bases from DNA. For example, UDG removes uracil that results from cytosine deamination (caused by spontaneous hydrolysis of cytosine) and FPG removes 8-oxo-guanine (e.g., most common DNA lesion that results from reactive oxygen species). FPG also has lyase activity that can generate 1 base gap at abasic sites. Such abasic sites will subsequently fail to amplify by PCR, for example, because the polymerase fails copy the template. Accordingly, the use of such DNA damage repair enzymes, and/or others listed here and as known in the art, can effectively remove damaged DNA that does not have a true mutation but might otherwise be undetected as an error.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">The kits may further comprise appropriate controls, such as DNA amplification controls, nucleic acid (template) quantification controls, sequencing controls, nucleic acid molecules derived from a biological source that has undergone a genome editing event or clonal expansion following a genome editing event.

In some embodiments, the server can store the sample-specific data set in a database for later processing. Next, the D S module receives a request for generating Duplex Consensus Sequencing data from the raw sequence data in the sample-specific data set (block <b>308</b>). The DS module groups sequence reads from families representing an original double-stranded nucleic acid molecule (e.g., based on SMI sequences) and compares representative sequences from individual strands to each other (block <b>310</b>). In one embodiment, the representative sequences can be one or more than one sequence read from each original nucleic acid molecule.

For example, an unintended loci can comprise one or more of a mutation-prone site, a microsatellite locus, a sequence with sequence homology to an intended genomic locus, and/or a cancer driver, and the comparison step can identify if the subject sequence comprises an alteration or variant of the reference sequence (e.g., an unedited genomic sequence).</p><p id="p-0225" num="0223">At decision block <b>508</b>, the routine <b>500</b> determines whether the subject sequence comprises a variant at an unintended locus following the genomic editing event.

If the unintended genomic locus does not comprise a variant, the genome editing module can evaluate additional unintended genomic loci (decision block <b>508</b> repeats until all unintended genomic loci are evaluated). If any variants are identified at any unintended genomic loci, the genome editing module determines the respective variant frequency (block <b>510</b>) and determines a number of independent variants within the sample (block <b>512</b>).

The routine <b>600</b> begins at block <b>602</b> and the genome editing module receives Duplex Sequencing Data (block <b>604</b>) from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (e.g., following block <b>316</b>) and, optionally, genome editing data (block <b>606</b>) from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> (e.g., following blocks <b>414</b> and <b>518</b>, respectively) and confirms that the cell population was genome edited (block <b>608</b>). Next, the genome editing module identifies variants in the sequence of a target genomic region (e.g., gene or another genomic region) (block <b>610</b>). For example, the genome editing module can analyze Duplex Sequencing Data and, optionally, genome editing data at specific genetic loci (e.g., cancer driver genes, oncogenes, proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor gene, other cancer driver genomic loci, etc.). Then, the genome editing module calculates a variant allele frequency (VAF) (block <b>612</b>).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">At decision block <b>614</b>, the routine <b>600</b> determines whether the VAF is higher in a test group than in a control group. A control group can be, in some embodiments, Duplex Sequencing data derived from a cell population (e.g., a comparable cell population) that has not undergone a genomic editing event. In another embodiment, a control group can be an expected background VAF of a reference population. In another embodiment, the control group can be a calculated VAF of a particular variant present in a cell population at a first time point, and the test group can be the calculated VAF of the particular variant present in the same cell population at a later, second time point. In one example, the first time point can be before a time prior to the genomic editing event and the second time point can be a time after the genomic editing event (e.g., days, week, months following the genomic editing event, between 1 and about 30 days following the genomic editing event, greater than 30 days following the genomic editing event, etc.). In another example, the first time and the second time can be a time after the genomic editing event. If the VAF of the test group is not higher than a control group, the gene editing module labels the edited cell population as having a decreased suspicion of undergoing clonal expansion (block <b>616</b>). The routine <b>600</b> may then continue at block <b>618</b>, where it ends. If the VAF is higher in the test group than in the control group, the routine <b>600</b> continues at decision block <b>620</b>, where the routine <b>600</b> determines if a variant is a non-singlet.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">If the variant is a singlet, then the gene editing module characterizes the edited cell population with a medium level of suspicion of undergoing a clonal expansion (block <b>622</b>). If the mutation is determined to be a non-singlet (i.e., a multiplet), the routine <b>600</b> characterizes the edited cell population with a high suspicion of undergoing a clonal expansion (block <b>624</b>). Optionally, the genome editing module determines if the variant detected at the target genomic region is consistent with a driver mutation (e.g., a mutation known to drive cancer growth/transformation) or is consistent with a possible passenger mutation (block <b>626</b>).</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">Optionally, for cell populations (e.g., cell populations to be used as a cell therapy, cell populations obtained from a patient, etc.) that have been characterized with either a medium level of suspicion (at block <b>622</b>) or a high level of suspicion (at block <b>624</b>), the genome editing module can assess a safety threshold for the cell population and/or determine a risk associated with developing a neoplastic condition or cancer disease (block <b>628</b>). The routine <b>600</b> may then continue at block <b>618</b>, where it ends.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">Other steps and routines are also contemplated by the present technology. For example, the system (e.g., the genome editing module or other module) can be configured to analyze the genome editing data to determine if a cell population was genome edited, if a genome editing process was efficient and/or successful, to determine under what characteristics a genomic editing event is mutagenic or carcinogenic and the like. Other steps may include determining if a subject should be prophylactically or therapeutically treated using a cell therapy derived from a cell population following a genomic editing event and based on the genome editing data derived from a particular cell population's sample. Further steps may include determining if a subject should be therapeutically treated for cancer based on the genome editing data derived from a particular subject's biological sample. For example, once a clonal expansion or neoplastic potential of genome edited cell population is identified using the system, the server can then determine if the subject has been exposed to more than a safe threshold level of neoplastic potential of a genome edited cell population. If so, then a prophylactic or inhibitor disease treatments may be initiated.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0232" num="0230">The following section provides some limiting examples of methods for detecting and assessing clonal expansion of cells following an event using duplex sequencing and associated reagents.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0233" num="0231">In one example, an initial cell population is subjected to targeted genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease system. Cas9 causes double-stranded breaks in genomic DNA which has been shown in some applications to induce cell cycle arrest via the TP53 pathway (i.e. PMID 29892062, PMID 29892067). Genome editing has been theorized to have low efficiency in some instances, such as in embryonic stem cells due to cell cycle arrest induced by double-stranded break response, which is mediated my TP53. Those cells that do not arrest following genome editing process may harbor inactivating mutations or deletions or loss of TP53 (or other cancer driver genes) that disrupt the respective function and cause less restricted cell growth. Clonal expansion of cells harboring this mutation would outcompete neighboring cells. In this example, Duplex Sequencing will be used to generate error-corrected consensus sequence reads of targeted double-stranded DNA molecules and determine a variant frequency (e.g., a mutation allele frequency) for samples taken from a cell population following Cas9-mediated genome editing. The targeted double-stranded DNA molecules can include regions of TP53 or other cancer driver genes or portions thereof. Selective pressure for clonal expansion will be assessed by determining if mutant allele frequencies for cancer driver mutations exceed a threshold level (e.g., a predetermined level, a background level, a relative variant allele frequency greater than a non-selectable reference portion of the genome etc.). In some embodiments, targeted double-stranded DNA molecules may also include non-cancer driver loci. One or more variants present in such non-cancer driver loci are detectable and quantifiable using Duplex Sequencing. An increase in a variant frequency (e.g., a passenger mutation) following a genome editing event (e.g., an increase over a first time point and a later, second time point, an increase in frequency above a background level, etc.), may indicate that a mutation in a cancer driver may be present, thereby providing clonal selection for cells harboring such variants. Passenger mutations may be selected from among any or all of the genome, but in some cases are preferably high frequency mutations sites such as homopolymeric regions. Different forms of genetic lineage markers that may be used for clone identification may be found in: Salk et al 2010PMID 20951806</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0234" num="0232">This example describes use of Duplex Sequencing to determine if early mutations in cancer driver genes reflect tumorigenic potential of test carcinogens.

The present example demonstrates that methods of the present disclosure provide the necessary sensitivity to detect such early stage neoplastic clonal selection of cells among a population of cells as well as subsequent clonal expansion of such cells.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0233">In this example, the impact of urethane is examined in different mouse tissue types (lung, spleen, blood) in an FDA-accepted cancer-predisposed mouse model: Tg.rasH2 (Saitoh et al. Oncogene 1990. PMID 2202951). This mouse contains &#x2dc;3 tandem copies of human HRAS with an activating enhancer mutation to boost expression on one hemizygous allele. These mice are predisposed to splenic angiosarcomas and lung adenocarcinomas, and are routinely used for 6 month carcinogenicity studies to substitute for 2 year wild-type animal studies. Tumors found in the mice have usually acquired activating mutations in one copy of the human HRAS protooncogene. Thus, the human HRAS transgene serves a model target cancer driver gene in these animals.

Four out of five urethane treated lung samples harbored this mutation at variant allele frequencies of 0.1%-1.8%. All four SNVs are &#x2032;Y&#x2192;A transversions in the context CTG. In addition, two treated spleen samples had mutations in this codon: one at this same position and one on an adjoining base pair. The fact that 4/5 treated lung samples had clonally expanded pathogenic mutations by only day 29, whereas very few mutations seen elsewhere on the panel were seen as &#x3e;1 member clones or were seen repeated in multiple samples demonstrates strong evidence of substantial positive selection soon after exposure. Furthermore, Duplex Sequencing methods, in accordance with embodiments of the present technology, provides the necessary sensitivity to detect such early stage neoplastic clonal selection.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutation</entry><entry>Number of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>count</entry><entry>families</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>829</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>8</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>1</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>17</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>Oncogenic AA 6 1 T &#x3e; A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>58</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>mutations in Human</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>181</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>HRAS gene in urethane</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>300</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>treated lung tissue</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0241" num="0238">Referring to Table 1, 97.5% of mutations were identified in a single molecule only, 1% were seen in two molecules and about 0.5% were seen in &#x3e;2 molecules.

As a result, by calculation, within the 29 days of the study, e.g., from the time of mutation exposure, and assuming no cell death, the doubling time of these cells was roughly every 1.8 days 2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}(29/1.8)&#x2212;90,000. Without being bound by theory, this calculated rate of cell doubling suggests the likely ability to detect these selected mutations in a short time frame (e.g., as few as two weeks).</p><p id="p-0245" num="0241">This results of the experimental analysis of this example demonstrates that Duplex Sequencing quantifies induction of mutations extremely robustly and with tight replicate confidence intervals. Further, Duplex Sequence was able to resolve tissue-specific variations in the extent of mutation induction, with lung being observed to be more mutation prone than spleen and blood. The simple mutational spectrum of urethane exposure is clean and unbiased clustering can discriminate between groups. The triplet mutation spectrum of urethane shows a strong propensity for T&#x2192;A and &#x2032;Y&#x2192;C mutations within the context of &#x201c;NTG&#x201d; and the mutation spectrum is distinguishable from the vehicle control.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0242">Additionally, mutation induction in peripheral blood closely mirrored that seen in the spleen and suggests that in-life sampling of peripheral blood could, for some mutagens, substitute for necropsy (or biopsy). Furthermore, this example provided clear evidence of selection for oncogenic mutations in the human HRAS transgene using Duplex Sequencing even at earlier time points (e.g., day 29) than what conventional studies would be able to detect (e.g., rodent tumor development). Thus, the present example demonstrates that analyzing the spectrum of mutation at target cancer driver genes (or other cancer driver loci) can accurately reflect the effects of a known model mutagen. Hence, Duplex Sequencing can provide early and accurate data with respect to evaluating early cancer driver mutations as biomarker of future cancer risk. Cross-species contamination persisted at extremely low levels but removal of foreign species contamination was performed automatically and confidently.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0243"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows single nucleotide variants (SNV) plotted over the genomic intervals for the exons captured from the Ras family of genes, including the human transgenic loci, in the Tg.RasH2 mouse model (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). Singlets are mutations found in a single molecule. Multiplets are an identical mutation identified within multiple molecules within the same sampler and may represent a clonal expansion event.

The location and relative frequency of Ras family human cancer mutational hotspots in COSMIC are indicated below each gene. A cluster of T&#x3e;A transversions were observed in 4/5 urethane-treated lung samples and 1/5 urethane-treated splenic samples at the human oncogenic HRAS codon 61 hotspot. The observation of an identical mutation in independent samples as high VAF multiplets in a well-established cancer driver is a strong indication of positive selection. Notably these clones are of the transversion T&#x3e;A in the context NTG, which is characteristic of urethane mutagenesis.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0244">The present example describes methods for quickly detecting and assessing clonal expansion of cells harboring a potential mutation that is under selective pressure while providing detailed information about variant allele frequency, spectrum of mutation type(s) and genomic context data. For example, in some embodiments, the present technology includes method steps including extracting DNA from a cell population following a genomic editing event. DNA can be extracted at various time points following the genomic editing event. For example, the DNA can be extracted a few days or a few weeks or a few months following the event. In some embodiments, the DNA can be extracted from a cell population within 30 days or less following an event. Following DNA extraction, a DNA library may be prepared. In one embodiment, the extracted genomic DNA can be fragmented into a plurality of double-stranded DNA fragments, and each double stranded DNA fragment can be ligated to one or more desired adapter molecules (e.g., adapter molecule shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0245">Following DNA library preparation, double-stranded adapter-DNA complexes can be amplified and sequenced with Duplex Sequencing method steps to result in direct high-accuracy DNA sequencing reads that provide detailed mutation location and frequency (e.g., resolving selection-mediating mutations below one-in-a-million).
