More specifically but not exclusively the present invention relates to storage systems for growing living organisms.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional systems and methods for growing certain crops are well known. Most require large areas of land and need to be positioned in appropriate locations for the conditions required for the crops to be grown.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More recently, advanced farming techniques such as hydroponics have led to the ability to grow high quality crops indoors with very high utilisation of lighting, water and fertiliser. However, these systems have been less efficient in terms of land use, capital and labour.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure describes systems and methods for improving the efficiency of these types of techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some commercial and industrial activities require systems that enable the storage and retrieval of a large number of different products. One known type of system for the storage and retrieval of items in multiple product lines involves arranging storage containers or containers in stacks on top of one another, the stacks being arranged in rows. The storage containers or containers are accessed from above, removing the need for aisles between the rows and allowing more containers to be stored in a given space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of handling containers stacked in rows have been well known for decades. In some such systems, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,701,065, to Bertel comprise free-standing stacks of containers arranged in rows in order to reduce the storage volume associated with storing such containers but yet still providing access to a specific container if required. Access to a given container is made possible by providing relatively complicated hoisting mechanisms which can be used to stack and remove given containers from stacks. The cost of such systems are, however, impractical in many situations and they have mainly been commercialised for the storage and handling of large shipping containers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The concept of using freestanding stacks of containers and providing a mechanism to retrieve and store specific containers has been developed further, for example as described in EP 0 767 113 B to Cimcorp. EP'113 discloses a mechanism for removing a plurality of stacked containers, using a robotic load handler in the form of a rectangular tube which is lowered around the stack of containers, and which is configured to be able to grip a container at any level in the stack. In this way, several containers can be lifted at once from a stack. The movable tube can be used to move several containers from the top of one stack to the top of another stack, or to move containers from a stack to an external location and vice versa. Such systems can be particularly useful where all of the containers in a single stack contain the same product (known as a single-product stack).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the system described in EP'113, the height of the tube has to be as least as high as the height of the largest stack of containers, so that that the highest stack of containers can be extracted in a single operation. Accordingly, when used in an enclosed space such as a warehouse, the maximum height of the stacks is restricted by the need to accommodate the tube of the load handler.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP 1037828 B1 (Autostore) the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describes a system in which stacks of containers are arranged within a frame structure. Robotic load handling devices can be controllably moved around the stack on a system of tracks on the upper most surface of the stack.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other forms of robotic load handling device are further described in, for example, Norwegian patent number 317366, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further development of load handling device is described in PCT publication WO 2015/019055 A1 (Ocado Innovation Limited) where each robotic load handler only covers one grid space, thus allowing higher density of load handlers and thus higher throughput of a given size system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such known storage systems a large number of containers are stacked densely. The containers are conventionally used to store goods to supply online grocery orders picked by robots.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Storage systems are known to be used for growing living organisms using hydroponic methods. As mentioned above, but now in more detail, hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil by instead using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Plants typically grown in soil or land may be grown with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid, or the roots may be physically supported by a medium such as perlite, Rockwool&#x2122;, vermiculite, coco fibre, sand or gravel. The nutrients used in hydroponic systems can come from an array of different sources. The delivery frequency of neutriants is governed by parameters such as plant size, plant growing stage, climate, substrate, and substrate conductivity, pH, and water content.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In connection with growing crops for consumptions, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of chemicals that can be naturally occurring in plants as a defence mechanism against insects, other pests or microbiological hazards. Some PAs exhibit hepatotoxicity that is damaging to the liver. Therefore PAs may be subject to regulation in food and particularly in herbs and medicines because a build-up of these chemicals in the body can represent a health risk. PAs can be particularly prevalent in crops such as medicinal herbs so there is a need to minimise the level of PAs found in crops.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In hydroponic growing systems the quantity of water required to grow a crop to harvest is greatly reduce compared with soil-based agriculture. In a run-to-waste system, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;The Bengal System&#x201d;, nutrient and water solution is periodically applied to the medium surface. Nutrient-rich waste may be collected and re-used in the system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A development of a growing system and method is described in PCT publication WO2016/166311A1 (Ocado Innovation Limited) where plants are grown in containers and the containers are stored in stacks. Within individual containers, services are provided for enabling plants to grow. Load handing devices are used to take containers from the stack and deposit them in alternative locations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">UK application GB1911505.4 (Ocado Innovation Limited) &#x201c;Hydroponics Growing System and Method&#x201d; disclose another hydroponic growing system. Seeds are pre-treated and germinated in a &#x2018;high-care&#x2019; portion to reduce contamination during germination. Seedlings are then moved to a growing room in support vehicles containing growing trays move along a frame or rack as the crop grows and until the crop is ready for harvesting. The system disclosed includes illumination apparatus above each growing station, and a recirculating irrigation system for providing nutrients to a growing crop. The irrigation system uses mains water blended with nutrients, which is pumped to the growing crop. Water which drains from the racks is reintroduced to the water blend to minimise waste water.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention aims to further develop the systems and methods of growing living organisms or crops. An aim of the present invention is to maximise the quality and yield of the crop. Further, an aim of the present invention is to improve efficiency in terms of use of assets, resources and services required by the crop.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the invention are set out in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A hydroponic system and pole system for racking, storing, propagating and growing living organisms on a growth tray are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pole system comprises: a substantially vertical support structure, the support structure including at least one utility system for supporting propagation or growth of a living organism; one or more vertically-spaced interface positions, each for interfacing with a growth tray; and one or more openings in the support structure, corresponding to one or more of the interface positions, for providing services to interfaced growth tray(s).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pole system replaces a traditional rack system. Thus, relatively little equipment and or framework is required to rack, store, propagate and grow living organisms. The interfaced positions may not include &#x201c;hard&#x201d; or physical connections or connectors. Thereby the pole system minimises the amount of equipment required to be clean in order to maintain a high-care environment, and reduces the associated costs of cleaning. Further, fewer assets are required to set-up a hydroponic system. By reducing the amount of cleaning it is easier to maintain a high-care clean facility. It follows that the crop is subjected to fewer attacks from insects, other pests and microbiological hazards. As a result a stronger crop with lower of negligent levels PAs may be produced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The at least one utility system may comprise one or more of: a fluid delivery system; a fluid drain system; a fluid recirculation system; an air control system; a temperature control system; a power system; and a control system. The at least one utility may be supported on, integrated with or at least partially encased by the support structure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, the pole system may provide one, some or all of the utilities required for propagating and growing living organisms in a controlled environment, ensuring uniformity of the crop and consistency of quality.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The control system may comprise one or more of: communication interface(s) for relaying data to and from the pole system; a central control system in communication with the pole system for managing conditions of a growth tray interfaced with the pole system; inductive coils corresponding to interface position(s) for relaying power and control signals to a growth tray interfaced with the pole system; and sensors corresponding to interface position(s) for sensing the presence of a growth tray interfaced with the pole system, and monitoring conditions of a growth tray interfaced with the pole system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The communication interface may comprise an optical wireless communication interface. For example, the optical wireless interface may be a Li-Fi (light fidelity) wireless interface. Li-Fi systems are capable of transmitting data at high speeds over visible light, ultraviolet and infrared spectrums. Typically, optical wireless interfaces use light from LEDs. It will be appreciated that Li-Fi does not require a physical connection. Using Li-Fi has the advantage of avoiding potential interference with or from other electromagnetic interfaces. The spectrum of light used for communication may be selected to be outside the spectrum required for growth of the living organisms.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, the communication interface may comprise a Wi-Fi interface. It will be appreciated that Wi-Fi does not require a physical connection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The communication interface may transmit data and between a growth tray and the pole system. Further, the communication interface may transmit data between the pole system and the central control system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, the central control system may monitor and control each tray. The monitoring and control decisions may be done remotely from the location of the pole system, thereby avoiding the need for a technician to be present in the volume. Data, including control instructions, may be transferred to and from the pole wirelessly. In this way, previously manual operations may become more automated and more efficient.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, the control system may control the at least one utility system. In this way, the control system may control the environmental conditions of each tray.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control system may be at least partially integrated into the pole system and or growth tray(s). For example, each growth tray may include a camera to monitor a growing crop. The camera information may then be relayed to the central control system to be used with machine learning or AI technology to determine and administer optimum growth conditions for the crop via feedback to the pole system and control of other utilities included in the pole system. As a result real-time data logging of the conditions of each growth tray, may provide a significant advantage of crop monitoring and production. Further, as each growth tray may be individually traced and tracked within a hydroponic facility, consistency between crops may be improved&#x2014;for example using identification means such as RFID tags. Still further, sensors may be embedded within the trays making a &#x2018;smart&#x2019; tray. For example, sensors may comprise one or more sensors for detecting the temperature of the air, the relative humidity, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, the pH, temperature, concentration and or electrical conductivity of the nutrient fluid, one or more cameras, the air flow rate, for the air pressure, fluid volume and flow rate through values etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The communication interface(s) may comprise: an end cap for inserting in the uppermost end of the support structure. This assists in having a clear line of sight to each of the poles in the system to a communication hub located near the ceiling, for example. In some arrangements, a communication interface panel may be located proximal to the base of the support structure. For example, this may be specifically for controlling fluid pumps or air-flow. Other communication interfaces may be arranged for specific trays and or for specific uses.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fluid delivery system may comprise: at least one fluid delivery pump for pumping fluid to each of the interface positions via a pipe extending substantially vertically up the support structure; and the one or more openings comprise a fluid outlet for delivering fluid to an interfaced tray. The fluid drain system may comprise: a pipe extending substantially vertically down the support structure for receiving fluid run-off from growth tray(s) interfaced with the pole system via an opening in the support structure comprising a fluid inlet; and at least one fluid drain pump for relaying fluid run-off to the fluid recirculating system.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, the fluid delivery, drain and recirculation systems are substantially closed or self-contained thereby minimising the risk of contamination or introduction of hazards. This contributes to the reduction of fluid required to produce the crop and as a result improved resource usage and efficiency. Further, the length of the drainage system may be minimised thereby reducing the amount of equipment that requires regular cleaning. Still further, nutrients which are not absorbed by the crop may be recycled into the fluid delivery system, thereby minimising use of resources.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At least one of the one or more openings in the support structure may comprise air vent(s) of the air control system for circulating humid and temperature controlled air to interfaced growth tray(s). These help to maintain an optimised growing environment for the crop at each stage of its life-cycle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The support structure may be inserted in a floor. For example, the pole drainage system may link directly to a main drain in the floor for recycling fluid, thereby maintaining a substantially closed system and again thereby minimising the length of additional piping and channels in the system.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pole system may further comprise: a base support comprising: a frame extending radially from the lower end of the support structure to provide stability to the support structure and having at least one drainage channel for conducting run-off from growth tray(s) interfaced with the pole system to the fluid drain or recirculation systems. The base support may further comprise a locating member, for locating an interfaced growth tray. The base support assists in the structural stability of the pole system.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The base support may further comprise fluid, drain or power connections. Aspects of the drainage system and recirculation system may be integrated in the base support. Again, minimising surfaces that may require cleaning and minimising the amount of equipment overall.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Growth tray(s) for use with the pole system may comprise: a fluid inlet for receiving fluid from the pole system and delivering fluid to a growing surface, and a fluid outlet for delivering fluid run-off to the pole drain system. A stack of growth trays may be interfaced with the pole system, and the trays may comprise support legs at least at each corner. The bottom-most support leg in the stack may locate in the locating member and the support leg may comprise a down-pipe for transmitting run-off from above-stacked growth trays. Growth tray(s) may receive power from the pole system for illuminating lights arranged on the lower face of the growth tray(s). Each growth tray may comprise identification means.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus, growth trays may be provided for use with the pole system that are adapted to interface with the pole system so that the system works efficiently. Identification of growth trays may assist in operating the control system to rack location of and services provided to the growth trays.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In use, the lower or bottom-most growth tray foot attaches to the drain point on the lowest fixed area &#x201c;stand&#x201d; of the smart pole. When in position further growth trays can be stacked on top of each adjacent-below growth tray ascending the smart pole. The growth tray(s) may not be &#x201c;locked&#x201d; or physically attached to the interface positions, rather the growth tray(s) may merely touch the support structure for receiving the utilities from the pole system, or even have no physical contact with the pole system, rather be positioned proximal to the pole system for receiving utilities. In other arrangements, the trays may be hooked on to the pole.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Utilities may be delivered directly to the growth tray(s). Within the facility or system, each tray is individually traced and monitored, regardless of whether a single growth tray is stacked adjacent to the pole system or whether there is a full stack of growth trays, occupying each of the interface positions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, up to four stacks of growth trays may be arranged around the pole system and interface with the pole system at each vertically-spaced level. Growth trays may be simply dropped down into position. The position of growth trays may be determined by the control system in order to ensure that the support poles remain balanced with an evenly distributed load where trays are physically attached to the support poles. Further, trays requiring similar environmental conditions may be located proximate to each other so that services may be delivered efficiently.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The hydroponic system may comprise support poles arranged in a high-care portion of the hydroponic system. The poles may be arranged in rows providing pathways therebetween allowing access to each of the poles and to each of the growth trays supported or interfaced thereon. The trays may be moved within the system manually or using one or more automated load handling device.

It will be appreciated that the larger system described herein is exemplary only, and other combinations and configurations of the apparatus and equipment described are anticipated by the inventors of the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the invention described herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The larger hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprises a system in which crucial parts of the system <b>100</b> comprise a &#x2018;high-care&#x2019; environment. A high-care environment is defined as an area requiring high levels of hygiene, careful and clean working practices, fabrication, and the design of facilities and equipment to minimise product contamination with regard to microbiological hazards. Generally speaking products produced in high-care areas will have undergone a process to reduce any microbiological contamination prior to entering the high-care area.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In hydroponic growing systems, the concept of high-care environments has not been fully utilised. Contamination in the absence of such a high-care environment can lead to reduction in yield of a given crop, infestation requiring sanitisation of a significant volume of the growing chamber or loss of a given crop entirely. Further, crops may have a higher level of PAs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in the schematic diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise a seed and equipment pre-treatment area <b>110</b>, a high-care portion <b>120</b> and a dispatch portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The seed and equipment pre-treatment area <b>110</b> may comprise hot water treatment means, UVC treatment means and in the case of the seeds, may comprise agitation means. The high-care portion <b>120</b> may comprise a seeding area <b>132</b>, a germination volume <b>134</b>, a growing volume <b>136</b>, and a harvesting area <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise equipment designed, treated and installed so as to assist in the maintenance of a high-care environment for seeding, germinating, growing and harvesting crops of any variety.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In order to assist with cleaning equipment located within the high-care portion <b>120</b>, the equipment is preferably raised off the floor enabling easier and more effective cleaning of the equipment and floor. Further, all uprights of apparatus and where possible as much of the equipment in the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> as possible is painted or treated with antimicrobial paint such as, for example, paint comprising silver. For instance, the walls, floor and ceiling of the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> are painted white to enable visual checks of the overall cleanliness of the growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">To assist with preventing contamination by water borne contaminants, preferably the amount and length of drainage system is reduced. Further this may assist with enabling regular deep cleaning of the whole system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be appreciated that ethylene may be produced in the germination and growing volumes <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> of the system <b>100</b> and this ethylene can stimulate decomposition in fresh or growing produce. Thus, it is vital that where unprocessed produce is held in storage, ethylene is controlled, to ensure that the freshness is preserved and that waste from the process is minimised. Preferably, the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise means for removing ethylene. For example, such ethylene removal means may comprise ethylene scrubbers that comprise dry chemical scrubbers. These machines generally have a pre-filter, a chemisorption bed and an after filter acting so as to remove ethylene from the environment. However, it will be appreciated that any other form of ethylene removal means may be used.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, it is important to maintain air-flow around the living organisms. For example, if the roots of a plant are properly oxygenated then the growing capabilities of the plant may be improved. It also helps to maintain a more stable or constant humidity around the root structure and plant thereby reducing the incidence of fungal or bacterial growth which may become prevalent where humidity is not controlled.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In use, a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprising a high-care portion <b>120</b> may be used to produce crops with little contamination. Seeds for planting and growing in a high-care environment are pre-treated in such a seed pre-treatment area <b>110</b>. Such pre-treatment may comprise hot water, and optionally UVC treatment. Additionally, the seeds may be agitated. Once treated, the seeds are bagged and sealed. The pre-treatment area <b>110</b> may be a substantially sterile environment.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, in the pre-treatment area <b>110</b>, all growing media is treated with UVC, and equipment for use in the high-care facility is treated with UVC to reduce as far as possible the chances of contamination within the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>. Seeds are also treated with hot water.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A plant room <b>140</b> provides plant services to each zone, portion and volume of the hydroponic growing facility. In some instances, it will be appreciated that duplicate service systems are used to separately serve low care and high-care portions <b>150</b>, <b>120</b> to avoid contamination of high-care portions <b>120</b> from low care portions <b>150</b>. Plant services may comprise, control boxes, air handling devices to maintain air humidity and temperature, air compression systems, water treatment and pump facilities, and UVC treatment machines, for example and amongst other things.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once the seeds, the growing media and trays are all pre-treated they are transferred to the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">These pre-treatment steps may be undertaken at a location remote from the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b>, however, it will be appreciated that such pre-treatment zones may be co-located with the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprises a seeding area <b>132</b>, a germination volume <b>134</b>, a growing volume <b>136</b>, and a harvesting area <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As required, the cleaned seeds are further treated by, for example, UVC radiation immediately prior to arrangement on growing medium in the seeding area <b>132</b>, the growing medium being located in the trays. The seeds may be continually vibrated by vibrating means comprising, for example, a vibrating plate whilst UVC treated and whist being arranged on the growing medium. The speed of vibration of the plate may be controllable and the speed used will depend on the particular seeds being processed, the size and variety of the seed and the effect of the vibration with the UVC on the seeds.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Once the equipment and seeds have been pre-treated as required, the seeds are arranged on the growing medium within the trays, and the trays may pass through a transfer hatch located between the seeding area <b>132</b> and the germination volume <b>134</b>. The transfer hatch may comprise means for transferring trays between areas and volumes of the system <b>100</b> bounded by walls, for example, in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the high-care environment. It will be understood that a number of transfer hatches may be present in the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The germination volume <b>134</b> may comprise racking on which the trays comprising the seeds are placed for a predetermined time. The predetermined time depends on the seed type, the growth cycle and the yield required for any given crop. It will be appreciated that control of the environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may enable the time taken to germinate seeds to be controlled to a certain extent.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may be controlled. For example, the temperature, humidity, air flow and lighting conditions may be controlled either manually or by a suitable control mechanism. The environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may be sensed by a series of sensors and detectors and the environment controlled according to the environment detected by the sensors or detectors. Such control may be carried out remotely by a suitable control utility.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once germinated, the seeds are moved to the growing volume <b>136</b>. For example, the growing trays may be placed on moveable racking or may be placed using a pick and place system either robotically or manually. Similarly to the environment of the germination volume <b>134</b>, the environment of the growing volume <b>136</b> may be controlled. The environment in the growing volume <b>136</b> may be sensed by a series of sensors and detectors and the environment controlled according to the environment detected by the sensors or detectors. Such control may be carried out remotely by a suitable control utility.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The germinated seeds remain in the growing volume <b>136</b> until the crop is deemed ready to harvest. This may be determined visually by operators or may be determined remotely using camera means to view the progress of growth of the crop.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Once deemed ready to harvest, the trays comprising the crops are removed from the growing volume <b>136</b> and transferred by any suitable means, robotic or manual, to a harvesting area <b>138</b> where the crop is picked, harvested or processed in the appropriate manner for the given crop. Once harvested, the crop may be bagged for onward delivery to direct customers or to commercial retail enterprises.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The dirty trays may be removed from the high-care portion <b>120</b> for washing and deep clean before returning to the seeing area <b>132</b> to be reseeded with a new crop.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Only once the crop is harvested and bagged will it leave the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> to the dispatch portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">It will be appreciated that high-care seeding, germinating, harvesting and growing environments reduce contamination during the production of crops in a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">It will be appreciated that the seeding area <b>132</b>, the germination volume <b>134</b>, the growing volume <b>136</b> and the harvesting area <b>138</b> may be collocated in a single building. However, it will also be appreciated that it is possible to locate the areas and volumes in different locations, however, the high-care environments would need to be controlled in a similar manner across all locations with high-care transfer means implemented between locations.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It will further be appreciated that the seeding area <b>132</b>, the germination volume, the growing volume and the harvesting area <b>138</b> may be located in adjacent rooms of a single building or may be located in a single volume with separately definable volumes as required. In this case, barriers and air locks between the various areas and volumes will be used.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> described above includes many known aspects of high-care treatment. However, it may become possible to apply other treatment regimens or to use other forms of equipment to achieve the result described herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, the system <b>100</b> described above may be used to grow a single crop or multiple crops in a single facility. Any crop suitable for growth in a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may be grown in a high-care portion <b>120</b> of such a growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further it will be appreciate that a nutrient rich fluid, provided to the crop(s) may be recycled for reuse. However, the fluid will require filtering and rebalancing to ensure that it is suitable for re-use. Captured drain fluid, through a drainage system is filtered to remove any larger particles, and passed through UV systems to maintain a given level of cleanliness to the fluid. The cleaned fluid is then dosed to optimum levels of nutrients which is required to be reused by the crop(s).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A larger hydroponic growing system, as described above, is disclosed in UK application GB2577973 (Ocado Innovation Limited), hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As mentioned hereinabove, growth trays may be placed on a rack. Alternatively growth trays may be placed in another form of stacking system, for example, on a frame or rack as previously disclosed in UK application GB1911505.4 &#x201c;Hydroponics Growing System and Method&#x201d;. Alternatively, trays may be of a type such as &#x201c;JFC service trays&#x201d; as disclosed in co-filed patent application no. GB1918020.7 filed on 9 Dec. 2019 titled STORAGE, GROWING SYSTEMS AND METHODS (Ocado Innovation Limited).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">When seeded growth trays or growth trays containing seedlings are placed on a rack lighting and other services or utilities as controlled by a central control means, for example, provision of a fluid nutrient mix, and environmental control for air flow, humidity, temperature and circulation to encourage propagation and or growth of the plants whilst on the rack. As the crop grows, the trays may be rearranged on the rack or the rack may be adapted in order to provide sufficient space for growing.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Thus, the system <b>100</b> is able to provide sufficient space and optimised growing conditions for the living organism to grow as it progresses from germination to a mature organism, ready for harvesting.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the living organisms have grown to maturity the growth tray(s) are transferred to a harvesting area <b>138</b>, and harvesting the crop. The growth trays may be transferred manually from the stack. Alternatively, a robotic or automated device such as a robotic load handling device suitable for operating with stacked storage systems may be employed to transfer the tray(s).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As noted above, in order to assist with cleaning equipment located within the high-care portion <b>120</b>, the equipment is preferably raised off the floor, and the amount of equipment and surfaces are minimised.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one arrangement, in order to assist with maintaining the high-care clean environment, equipment in the high-care portion <b>120</b> is reduced or minimised. As described herein, rows of racks and some other equipment are replaced with individual &#x201c;smart poles&#x201d; onto which growth trays are placed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show one embodiment of a smart pole <b>400</b>. The smart pole <b>400</b> comprises a substantially vertical pole around which a plurality of growth trays <b>410</b> may be arranged. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, smart poles <b>400</b> may be arranged in rows and up to four stacks of growth trays <b>410</b> may be arranged around each pole. Smart poles <b>400</b> in the centre of the germination volume <b>134</b> or growing volume <b>136</b> may have trays <b>410</b> arranged two trays <b>410</b> side-by-side on opposed sides of the smart poles <b>400</b>, and smart poles <b>400</b> at the edge of the volume may have trays <b>410</b> arranged only on one side of the smart poles <b>400</b>. In this way, rows of stacks of growth trays <b>410</b> are created having walk ways or path ways <b>411</b> between the rows of stacks of growth trays <b>410</b> and each of the trays <b>410</b> are accessible to be positioned and relocated as required. The trays <b>410</b> may be repositioned manually or by using an automated or semi-automated load handling device. The number of growth trays <b>410</b> in each stack may vary in number from a minimum of no growth trays <b>410</b> where the specific location is empty to where the smart pole <b>400</b> is at full capacity. Further, the number of smart poles <b>400</b> may be varied according to need.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Looking now in more detail at the smart poles <b>400</b> themselves, the smart poles <b>400</b> comprise similar opposed surfaces <b>412</b> which fit together to provide a substantially sealed cavity containing utility system or plant services. The opposed surfaces <b>412</b> have a number of openings through which utility services may pass. For example, holes or openings for fluid <b>413</b> are arranged centrally at regular intervals in the vertical direction, vertically spaced interface positions, along substantially the entire length of the smart pole <b>400</b>. Corresponding rectangular slots comprising air vents <b>414</b> and communication interfaces <b>450</b> are spaced apart from the fluid openings <b>413</b>. The vertical distance between the fluid openings <b>413</b>, air vents <b>414</b> and communication interfaces <b>450</b> correspond to the height of a growth tray <b>410</b>, thereby providing fluid, environmental air control and data transfer means at each level of the smart pole <b>400</b>. It will be appreciated, that an air vent <b>414</b> and a communication interface <b>450</b> may be positioned on each side of the fluid openings <b>413</b> such that each level has two air vents <b>414</b> and two communication interfaces <b>450</b>, one for each side of the pole <b>400</b>. In this way, the pole may independently service two growth trays positioned side-by-side at each level. Similarly, the fluid openings <b>413</b> may comprise a single opening <b>413</b> serving both growth trays, or two openings <b>413</b> capable of independently serving each growth tray.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At the upper end, the smart pole <b>400</b> is substantially sealed with a cap <b>415</b>. The cap <b>415</b> comprises an interface and communications unit. The cap <b>415</b> is in communication with the tray communication interfaces <b>450</b>, either wirelessly or with a physical connection. The communications unit or cap <b>415</b> is placed at the top of the smart pole <b>400</b> so that it may have a substantially unobstructed line of sight to a central control system which communicates with the smart pole <b>400</b> to control the services provided to each tray <b>410</b> placed on or interfaced with the smart pole <b>400</b>. In this way, the smart pole <b>400</b> can control the growing conditions or environment for each of the trays <b>410</b> in the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a deconstructed view of smart pole <b>400</b>. Front and back opposed surfaces <b>412</b> may be seen, and the cap <b>415</b> is removed. As may be seen on the back of the opposed surface <b>412</b>, inside the smart pole <b>400</b> there is a fluid pipe <b>416</b> extending along the centre of the surface <b>412</b> to serve each of the fluid holes <b>413</b>. Along the outer edge of the smart pole <b>400</b> are power rails <b>417</b> having inductive coils <b>418</b> spaced at regular intervals, corresponding to each level or interface position of the smart pole <b>418</b>. The smart pole <b>418</b> may include various sensors (not shown) in order to monitor the environment and whether a tray <b>410</b> is placed on the smart pole <b>400</b> at a particular level.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b></figref> (a) and (b) show more detail of the fluid system, particularly the lower end of a smart pole <b>400</b> showing the fluid source and drain connections. The fluid holes <b>413</b> comprise a fluid source outlet <b>419</b> and a fluid drain inlet <b>420</b>. The outlet <b>419</b> and inlet <b>420</b> are positioned side-by-side between the air vent <b>414</b>, and communication interface <b>450</b> at each level of the smart pole <b>400</b>. As noted above, two outlets <b>419</b> and two inlets <b>420</b> may be provided to independently serve each growth tray positioned side-by-side on one side of the pole <b>400</b>. Only one set of openings in the pole <b>400</b> is shown in the drawings for simplicity. Similarly, the fluid pipe <b>416</b> comprises a fluid source pipe <b>421</b> and a fluid drain pipe <b>422</b>. The fluid outlet <b>419</b> is in fluid communication with the fluid source pipe <b>421</b> and the fluid inlet <b>420</b> is in fluid communication with the fluid drain pipe <b>422</b>. At the bottom of each of the fluid channels <b>421</b>, <b>422</b> there are respective fluid pumps <b>423</b>, <b>424</b>. Each of the surfaces <b>412</b> may have a fluid source pipe <b>421</b> and a fluid drain pipe <b>422</b>. In other arrangements, the two surfaces <b>412</b> may share between them a common fluid source pipe <b>421</b> and a fluid drain pipe <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In use, the fluid source pump <b>423</b> supplies fluid from the fluid supply system on demand to each individual tray <b>410</b> on the smart pole <b>400</b> as required and determined by the central control system. The fluid drain pump <b>424</b> acts as a relay to transmit received fluid run-off to the drain system for recirculating to the fluid supply system once it has been treated and remixed for reuse. In some arrangements, a further interface panel for connecting to and communicating with the central control system may be positioned proximate to the bottom of the smart pole <b>400</b>, optionally specifically for controlling the pumps <b>423</b>, <b>424</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this way, rather than excess fluid being &#x201c;waste&#x201d; the fluid may be reused thereby minimising loss. Further, having an integrated fluid system for both delivery and run-off, the fluid has minimal exposure to contamination hazards whilst circulating in the system before being absorbed by the living organisms during growth.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As has been mentioned above, trays <b>410</b> for germinating or growing a crop may be arranged around or on the smart pole <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows one half of a smart pole <b>400</b> comprising a single surface <b>412</b> having a number of trays <b>410</b> placed thereon, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a section through the smart pole and tray <b>410</b>. As can be seen, each tray <b>410</b> corresponds to an interface level of the smart pole <b>400</b> and corner of the tray <b>410</b> aligns with a fluid inlet/outlet <b>413</b> and an induction coil <b>418</b>. At each level, two trays <b>410</b> are positioned side-by-side creating two stacks. The trays are separated by supportive legs located at each corner that is not otherwise supported by the smart pole <b>400</b>. The trays <b>410</b> may be provided with power through the inductive coil <b>418</b> and a corresponding inductive coil on the tray.
