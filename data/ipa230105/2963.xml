The Polyester substrate <b>11</b> may be a non-woven fabric formed by bonding 100% PET recycled cotton or a mixture of 60% PET recycled cotton and 40% PET cotton by needle punching; or a woven fabric formed by weaving 100% recycled PET fibers or common PET fibers. Therefore, the Polyester substrate <b>11</b> is completely made of the Polyester material. In an embodiment, the Polyester substrate <b>11</b> may be made of a TPEE (Thermoplastic Polyether Elastomer) material or a PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the Polyester adhering layer <b>12</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>111</b> of the Polyester substrate <b>11</b>.

Therefore, all materials of the leather <b>10</b> of the present disclosure are the same Polyester materials, thus the leather <b>10</b> of the present disclosure can be recycled and granulated after the leather of the present disclosure is used.
