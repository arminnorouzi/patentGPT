The stomach temporarily stores food from the esophagus and plays a role in the first step of digestion by secreting gastric juice. The stomach is divided into the cardial end located around the inlet leading to the esophagus, the pyloric end located around the outlet leading to the duodenum, and the other site called the gastric corpus (Non-Patent Literature 1). According to the statistics of the number of cancer type-specific incidences and deaths in Japan disclosed by the Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, estimated 125,730 individuals in total involving 86,728 males and 39,002 females were affected by stomach cancer in 2010. The number of stomach cancer deaths was a total of 49,129 people involving 32,206 males and 16,923 females in 2012. Thus, stomach cancer was the second leading cause of cancer death in Japan. Also, 22,220 Americans were affected by stomach cancer in 2014, among which 10,990 people would die of stomach cancer (Non-Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The stages of stomach cancer progression are defined in Non-Patent Literature 2 and classified into stages 0, IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IV according to tumor size, infiltration, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, etc. The 5-year relative survival rate of stomach cancer largely depends on the stages of cancer progression and is reportedly 57 to 71% for stage I, 33 to 46% for stage II, 9 to 20% for stage III, and 4% for stage IV (Non-Patent Literature 1). Thus, the early detection of stomach cancer leads to improvement in the survival rate. Therefore, an approach that enables early detection is strongly desired.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The treatment of stomach cancer is performed by the combined use of surgical therapy, drug therapy, and radiotherapy. Particularly, in very early stomach cancer under no suspicion of lymph node metastasis, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is often applicable and the cancer can thus be treated without any burden on patients.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the aim of detecting stomach cancer early, Japanese men and women aged 40 or older are recommended to take stomach cancer screening once a year. The efficacy of &#x201c;gastric X-ray examination&#x201d; as a method for stomach cancer screening has been shown. When detailed examination is required as a result of X-ray examination, gastroscopy is carried out. Alternatively, diagnostic imaging such as CT, PET, or MRI is also utilized for detecting stomach cancer (Non-Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, no blood marker has been established for the screening of stomach cancer. Although the association of protein tumor markers such as CEA and CA19-9 in serum with stomach cancer has been suggested (Non-Patent Literature 3), there is no enough evidence to recommend using these markers for the purpose of screening. Meanwhile, as shown in Patent Literatures 1 to 3, there are reports, albeit at a research stage, on the detection of stomach cancer using the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) or combinations of the expression levels of miRNAs and the expression levels of additional protein markers in biological samples including blood.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for detecting cancers including stomach cancer using hsa-miR-125a-3p in blood.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for detecting stomach cancer using hsa-miR-23a-3p, miR-92-1, and miR-92-2 (miR-92a-1-3p and miR-92a-2-3p) and also using miR-128b (miR-128-2-3p), miR-30c (miR-30c-5p), miR-135-1, miR-135-2 (miR-135a-5p), and miR-149 (miR-149-5p), and other miRNAs in blood or tissues.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">Patent Literature 3 discloses a method for detecting stomach cancer using hsa-miR-451 and 468 (hsa-miR-468-5p) in blood.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">Patent Literature 1: International Publication No. WO 2010/062706</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">Patent Literature 2: JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2014-060993 A (2014)</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">Patent Literature 3: JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2013-085542 A (2013).</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0015">Non-Patent Literature 1: American Cancer Society, &#x201c;Stomach Cancer&#x201d;, 2013, p. 3, 6, and 18 to 20, http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003141-pdf.pdf</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0016">Non-Patent Literature 2: Sobin, L. et al, &#x201c;TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, the 7th edition, Japanese version&#x201d;, 2010, p. 69 to 73</li>    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0017">Non-Patent Literature 3: Kim, H.

Primary tests of stomach cancer include imaging tests such as gastric X-ray examination, which is routinely used in Japan, as well as CT, PET, and MRI (Non-Patent Literature 1). In Japan, however, stomach cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death. Thus, the imaging tests cannot always work as a deterrent against stomach cancer death.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">For example, CEA and CA19-9 are known as tumor markers for the detection of stomach cancer. In general, as shown in Non-Patent Literature 3, 5 ng/mL for CEA and 37 U/mL for CA19-9 are used as reference values. Although these tumor markers may be helpful in confirming the recurrence of or therapeutic effects on stomach cancer, their expression very rarely elevates in early stomach cancer. Therefore, these markers may not be useful for the purpose of stomach cancer screening. The tumor markers such as CEA and CA19-9 may also elevate for reasons other than those due to stomach cancer. Therefore, these markers alone allegedly fail to determine the presence or absence of stomach cancer. The false diagnosis of other cancers as stomach cancer wastes appropriate therapeutic opportunity or places unnecessary economical and physical burdens on patients due to the application of wrong medicine.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">As described below, there are reports, albeit at a research stage, on the determination of stomach cancer using the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) in biological samples including blood, none of which, however, have yet been brought into practical use.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for detecting cancers including stomach cancer using hsa-miR-125a-3p and other miRNAs in blood. This detection method, however, does not describe specific detection performance such as accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity for determining stomach cancer and is thus industrially less practical.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for detecting stomach cancer using hsa-miR-23a-3p, miR-92-1, and miR-92-2 (miR-92a-1-3p and miR-92a-2-3p) and further using miR-128 (miR-128-2-5p), miR-30c (miR-30c-5p), miR-135-1, miR-135-2 (miR-135a-5p), miR-149 (miR-149-5p), and other miRNAs in blood or tissues.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">Among them, hsa-miR-23a-3p, miR-92-1, and miR-92-2 (miR-92a-1-3p and miR-92a-2-3p) are particularly described as miRNAs for detecting stomach cancer. According to the description therein, these markers in blood, however, were not validated, and specific detection examples were given for miRNAs in tissues. This is not an easy screening test. Therefore, this detection method is industrially less practical.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">As mentioned above, the existing tumor markers exhibit low performance in the detection of stomach cancer, or neither detection methods nor performance is specifically shown as to the markers at a research stage. Therefore, use of these markers might lead to carrying out needless extra examination due to the false detection of healthy subjects as being stomach cancer patients, or might waste therapeutic opportunity because of overlooking stomach cancer patients. In addition, the measurement of dozens to several hundreds of miRNAs increases examination cost and is therefore difficult to use in large-scale screening for medical checkup, etc. Furthermore, the collection of gastric tissues for measuring the tumor markers is highly invasive to patients and is not favorable. Hence, there is a demand for a highly accurate stomach cancer marker that is detectable from blood, which can be collected with limited invasiveness, and is capable of correctly discriminating a stomach cancer patient from a healthy subject. Particularly, screening based on an imaging test, such as gastric X-ray examination, which is currently carried out for the early detection of stomach cancer, presents problems associated with radiation exposure, high cost, etc. Therefore, the provision of a more convenient primary screening test of stomach cancer probably leads to benefits to subjects and the health service.</p><heading

For example, twice, preferably 3 times, more preferably 6 times the standard deviation of the measurement values of the blank spots are added to the average measurement value of the blank spots on the DNA chip, and probe spots having a signal value equal to or larger than the resulting value can be regarded as detection spots. Alternatively, the average measurement value of the blank spots is regarded as a background and can be subtracted from the measurement values of the probe spots to determine gene expression levels. A missing value for a gene expression level can be excluded from the analyte, preferably replaced with the smallest value of the gene expression level in each DNA chip, or more preferably replaced with a value obtained by subtracting 0.1 from a logarithmic value of the smallest value of the gene expression level.

Vapnik (The Nature of Statistical Leaning Theory, Springer, 1995). Particular data points of a data set having known classes are defined as explanatory variables, and classes are defined as objective variables. A boundary plane called hyperplane for correctly classifying the data set into the known classes is determined, and a discriminant for data classification is determined using the boundary plane. Then, the measurement values of a newly offered data set can be substituted as explanatory variables into the discriminant to determine classes. In this respect, the result of the discriminant analysis may be classes, may be a probability of data to be classified into correct classes, or may be the distance from the hyperplane. In SVM, a method of nonlinearly converting a feature vector to a high dimension and performing linear discriminant analysis in the space is known as a method for tackling nonlinear problems. An expression in which an inner product of two factors in a nonlinearly mapped space is expressed only by inputs in their original spaces is called kernel. Examples of the kernel can include a linear kernel, a RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel, and a Gaussian kernel. While highly dimensional mapping is performed according to the kernel, the optimum discriminant, i.e., a discriminant, can be actually constructed by mere calculation according to the kernel, which avoids calculating features in the mapped space (e.g., Hideki Aso et al., Frontier of Statistical Science 6 &#x201c;Statistics of pattern recognition and learning&#x2014;New concepts and approaches&#x201d;, Iwanami Shoten, Publishers (2004); Nello Cristianini et al., Introduction to SVM, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd.

In this context, in the discriminants of Formulas 1 to 3, 5, and 6, x represents an explanatory variable and includes a value obtained by measuring a polynucleotide(s) selected from the polynucleotides described in the Section 2 above, or any fragment thereof, etc. Specifically, the explanatory variable for discriminating a stomach cancer patient from a healthy subject according to the present invention is a gene expression level(s) selected from, for example, the following expression levels (1) to (3):</p><p id="p-0666" num="0649">(1) a gene expression level(s) in the serum of a stomach cancer patient or a healthy subject measured by any DNA comprising 15 or more consecutive nucleotides in a nucleotide sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 and 635 to 642 or a complementary sequence thereof,</p><p id="p-0667" num="0650">(2) a gene expression level(s) in the serum of a stomach cancer patient or a healthy subject measured by any DNA comprising 15 or more consecutive nucleotides in a nucleotide sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 166 to 169 or a complementary sequence thereof, and</p><p id="p-0668" num="0651">(3) a gene expression level(s) in the serum of a stomach cancer patient or a healthy subject measured by any DNA comprising 15 or more consecutive nucleotides in a nucleotide sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 170 to 199 or a complementary sequence thereof.</p><p id="p-0669" num="0652">As described above, for the method for determining or evaluating the presence and/or absence of a stomach cancer-derived gene(s) in a sample derived from a subject, the preparation of a discriminant requires a discriminant prepared in a training cohort. For enhancing the accuracy of the discriminant, it is necessary for the discriminant to use genes that show clear difference between two groups in the training cohort.</p><p id="p-0670" num="0653">Each gene that is used for an explanatory variable in a discriminant is preferably determined as follows. First, comprehensive gene expression levels of a stomach cancer patient group and comprehensive gene expression levels of a healthy subject group in a training cohort are used as a data set, the degree of difference in the expression level of each gene between the two groups is determined through the use of, for example, the P value of t test, which is parametric analysis, or the P value of Mann-Whitney's U test or Wilcoxon test, which is nonparametric analysis.</p><p id="p-0671" num="0654">The gene can be regarded as being statistically significant when the critical rate (significance level) as the P value obtained by the test is smaller than, for example, 5%, 1%, or 0.01%.</p><p id="p-0672" num="0655">In order to correct an increased probability of type I error attributed to the repetition of a test, a method known in the art, for example, Bonferroni or Holm method, can be used for the correction (e.g., Yasushi Nagata et al., &#x201c;Basics of statistical multiple comparison methods&#x201d;, Scientist Press Co., Ltd. (2007)). As an example of the Bonferroni correction, for example, the P value obtained by a test is multiplied by the number of repetitions of the test, i.e., the number of genes used in the analysis, and the obtained value can be compared with a desired significance level to suppress a probability of causing type I error in the whole test.</p><p id="p-0673" num="0656">Instead of the statistical test, the absolute value (fold change) of an expression ratio of a median value of each gene expression level between gene expression levels of a stomach cancer patient group and gene expression levels of a healthy subject group may be calculated to select a gene that is used for an explanatory variable in a discriminant. Alternatively, ROC curves may be prepared using gene expression levels of a stomach cancer patient group and a healthy subject group, and a gene that is used for an explanatory variable in a discriminant can be selected on the basis of an AUROC value.</p><p id="p-0674" num="0657">Next, a discriminant that can be calculated by various methods described above is prepared using any number of genes having large difference in their gene expression levels determined here. Examples of the method for constructing a discriminant that produces the largest discriminant accuracy include a method of constructing a discriminant in every combination of genes that satisfy the significance level of P value, and a method of repetitively evaluating a discriminant while increasing the number of genes for use one by one in a descending order of difference in gene expression level (Furey T S. et al., 2000, Bioinformatics., Vol. 16, p. 906-14). A gene expression level of another independent stomach cancer patient or healthy subject is substituted as an explanatory variable into this discriminant to calculate discriminant results of the group to which this independent stomach cancer patient or healthy subject associate. Specifically, the found gene set for diagnosis and the discriminant constructed using the gene set for diagnosis can be evaluated in an independent sample cohort to find a more universal gene set for diagnosis capable of detecting stomach cancer and a more universal method for discriminating stomach cancer.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0658">Split-sample method is preferably used for evaluating the discriminant performance (generality) of the discriminant. Specifically, a data set is divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort, and gene selection by a statistical test and discriminant preparation are performed in the training cohort. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are calculated using a result of discriminating a validation cohort according to the discriminant and a true group to which the validation cohort associate, to evaluate the performance of the discriminant. On the other hand, instead of dividing a data set, the gene selection by a statistical test and discriminant preparation may be performed using all of samples, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity can be calculated by the discriminant analysis of a newly prepared samples for evaluation of the performance of the discriminant.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0659">The present invention provides a polynucleotide(s) for detection or for disease diagnosis useful in the diagnosis and treatment of stomach cancer, a method for detecting stomach cancer using the polynucleotide(s), and a kit and a device for the detection of stomach cancer, comprising the polynucleotide(s). Particularly, in order to select a gene(s) for diagnosis and prepare a discriminant so as to exhibit accuracy beyond a stomach cancer diagnosis method using existing tumor markers CEA and CA19-9, a gene set for diagnosis and a discriminant for the method of the present invention, that exhibit accuracy beyond CEA and CA19-9, can be constructed, for example, by comparing expressed genes in serum derived from a patient confirmed to be negative using CEA and CA19-9 but finally found to have stomach cancer by detailed examination such as computed tomography using a contrast medium, with genes expressed in serum derived from a patient having no stomach cancer.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0660">For example, the gene set for diagnosis is set to any combination selected from one or two or more of the polynucleotides based on a nucleotide sequence(s) represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 and 635 to 642 or a complementary sequence(s) thereof as described above; and optionally one or two or more of the polynucleotides based on a nucleotide sequence(s) represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 166 to 169 or a complementary sequence(s) thereof; and optionally one or two or more of the polynucleotides based on a nucleotide sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 170 to 199 or a complementary sequence thereof. Further, a discriminant is constructed using expression levels of the gene set for diagnosis in samples derived from class I stomach cancer patients and samples derived from class II healthy subjects as a result of tissue diagnosis. As a result, the presence or absence of stomach cancer-derived genes in an unknown sample can be determined with 100% accuracy at the maximum by measuring expression levels of the gene set for diagnosis in an unknown sample.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0678" num="0661">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described further specifically with reference to Examples below.

Specifically, any newly found polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 in the training cohort was applied for Formula 2 to construct a discriminant. Calculated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are shown in Table 3. In this respect, a discriminant coefficient and a constant term are shown in Table 4. In this context, all of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 were selected as markers capable of determining all of papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoma (3 cases), low differentiated adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma, which are main types of stomach cancer.</p><p id="p-0694" num="0677">Next, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the validation cohort were calculated using the discriminant thus prepared, and the discriminant performance of the selected polynucleotides was validated using independent samples (Table 3). For example, the expression level measurement value of the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 was compared between the healthy subjects (100 persons) and the stomach cancer patients (34 persons) in the training cohort. As a result, the gene expression level measurement values were found to be significantly lower in the stomach cancer patient group than in the healthy subject group (see the left diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). These results were also reproducible in the healthy subjects (50 persons) and the stomach cancer patients (16 persons) in the validation cohort (see the right diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Likewise, the results obtained about the other polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 169 showed that the gene expression level measurement values were significantly lower (&#x2212;) or higher (+) in the stomach cancer patient group than in the healthy subject group (Table 2). These results were able to be validated in the validation cohort. For example, as for this nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, the number of correctly or incorrectly identified samples in the detection of stomach cancer was calculated using the threshold (6.29) that was set in the training cohort and discriminated between the groups. As a result, 14 true positives, 49 true negatives, 1 false positive, and 2 false negatives were obtained. From these values, 95.5% accuracy, 87.5% sensitivity, and 98% specificity were obtained as the detection performance. In this way, the detection performance was calculated as to all of the polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169, and described in Table 3. The polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 shown in Table 3, exhibited sensitivity of 87.5%, 93.8%, 93.8%, 81.2%, 93.8%, 87.5%, 87.5%, 81.2%, 68.8%, 87.5%, 75.0%, 81.2%, 87.5%, 75.0%, 81.2%, 93.8%, 68.8%, 81.2%, 56.2%, 68.8%, 87.5%, 56.2%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 75.0%, 56.2%, 87.5%, 93.8%, 62.5%, 87.5%, 62.5%, 68.8%, 81.2%, 81.2%, 62.5%, 81.2%, 81.2%, 62.5%, 87.5%, 62.5%, 75.0%, 56.2%, 75.0%, 62.5%, 56.2%, 68.8%, 62.5%, 56.2%, 93.8%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 56.2%, 81.2%, 68.8%, 56.2%, 43.8%, 75.0%, 75.0%, 68.8%, 81.2%, 75.0%, 68.8%, 68.8%, 43.8%, 62.5%, 50.0%, 50.0%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 50.0%, 68.8%, 37.5%, 50.0%, 37.5%, 68.8%, 68.8%, 56.2%, 12.5%, 75.0%, 50.0%, 50.0%, 37.5%, 68.8%, 25.0%, 81.2%, 43.8%, 56.2%, 62.5%, 37.5%, 43.8%, 43.8%, 37.5%, 43.8%, 31.2%, 43.8%, 50.0%, 25%, 43.8%, 37.5%, 37.5%, 31.2%, 25.0%, 25.0%, 56.2%, 31.2%, 43.8%, 56.2%, 50.0%, 37.5%, 31.2%, 31.2%, 37.5%, 50.0%, 12.5%, 31.2%, 56.2%, 18.8%, 43.8%, 18.8%, 37.5%, 31.2%, 37.5%, 50.0%, 50.0%, 12.5%, 31.2%, 31.2%, 31.2%, 31.2%, 50.0%, 37.5%, 18.8%, 37.5%, 50.0%, 43.8%, 18.8%, 43.8%, 31.2%, 18.8%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 31.2%, 31.2%, 18.8%, 43.8%, 6.2%, 25.0%, 12.5%, 31.2%, 12.5%, 18.8%, 37.5%, 6.2%, 31.2%, 6.2%, 18.8%, 6.2%, 18.8%, 6.2%, 12.5%, 18.8%, 6.2%, 12.5%, 6.2%, 50.0%, 68.8%, 31.2%, and 25.0%, respectively, in the validation cohort. As seen from Comparative Example mentioned later, the existing markers CEA and CA19-9 had sensitivity of 12.5% (when the abnormal value of CEA was defined as 5 ng/ml or higher) and 12.5% (when the abnormal value of CA19-9 was defined as 37 U/ml or higher), respectively, in the validation cohort, demonstrating that all of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 can discriminate, each alone, stomach cancer in the validation cohort with sensitivity beyond CEA and CA19-9.</p><p id="p-0695" num="0678">For example, 4 polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5, 21, and 28 were able to correctly determine stomach cancer as to 9 stage IA stomach cancer samples contained in the validation cohort.

Specifically, Fisher's discriminant analysis was conducted as to 14,190 combinations of two expression level measurement values comprising at least one or more of the expression level measurement values of the newly found polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 among any of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 selected in Example 1, to construct a discriminant for determining the presence or absence of stomach cancer. Next, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the validation cohort were calculated using the discriminant thus prepared, and the discriminant performance of the selected polynucleotides was validated using the independent samples.</p><p id="p-0698" num="0681">For example, the expression level measurement values of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2 were compared between the healthy subjects (100 persons) and the stomach cancer patients (34 persons) in the training cohort. As a result, a scatter diagram that significantly separated the expression level measurement values of the stomach cancer patient group from those of the healthy subject group was obtained (see the left diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). These results were also reproducible in the healthy subjects (50 persons) and the stomach cancer patients (16 persons) in the validation cohort (see the right diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Likewise, a scatter diagram that significantly separated the gene expression level measurement values of the stomach cancer patient group from those of the healthy subject group was also obtained as to the other combinations of two expression level measurement values comprising at least one or more of the expression level measurement values of the newly found polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 among the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169. These results were able to be validated in the validation cohort. For example, as for these nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2, the number of samples that were correctly or incorrectly identified in the detection of stomach cancer was calculated using the function (0=0.83x+y&#x2212;14.78) that was set in the training cohort and discriminated between the two groups. As a result, 15 true positives, 50 true negatives, 0 false positives, and 1 false negative were obtained. From these values, 98.5% accuracy, 93.8% sensitivity, and 100% specificity were obtained as the detection performance. In this way, the detection performance was calculated as to all of the combinations of two expression level measurement values comprising at least one or more of the expression level measurement values of any of the newly found polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 among the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169. Among them, 168 combinations comprising the expression level measurement value of the polynucleotide consisting of the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and the detection performance thereof were described in Table 6 as an example. For example, a combination of the expression level measurement values of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 14 exhibited sensitivity of 100% in the validation cohort. Also, all of combinations of two polynucleotides consisting of nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 14, 17, 22, 24, 27, 32, 39, 43, 46, 48, 53, 65, 66, 67, 78, 89, 91, 98, 99, 113, 116, 122, 129, 141, 144, 148, 150, 154, and 156 exhibited specificity of 100%. 14,159 combinations of the expression level measurement values of polynucleotides having sensitivity beyond the existing marker CEA or CA19-9 (both 12.5% in Table 5) were obtained in the validation cohort. All of the nucleotide sequences 1 to 165 described in Table 2 obtained in Example 1 were employed at least once in these combinations. These results demonstrated that the combined use of two of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 can also discriminate stomach cancer with excellent performance beyond the existing marker. Thus, the combinations of two expression level measurement values of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences also produced excellent stomach cancer detection sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0699" num="0682">Markers for the detection of stomach cancer with better sensitivity are obtained by further combining 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more of the expression level measurement values of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169. For example, the newly found polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165 among the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 selected in Example 1 were measured to obtain their expression levels between the healthy subject group and the stomach cancer group in the validation cohort. All of the polynucleotides were ranked in the descending order of their P values based on the Student's t-test which indicates statistical significance of difference between groups (i.e., one having the lowest P value was ranked in the first place), and stomach cancer detection sensitivity was evaluated using combinations of one or more polynucleotides to which the polynucleotides were added one by one from the top to the bottom according to the rank. In short, the order in which the polynucleotides were combined in this evaluation is in reverse in terms of SEQ ID NOs from SEQ ID NO: 165 to SEQ ID NOs: 164, 163, . . . shown in Table 2. As a result, the sensitivity in the validation cohort was 6.2% for 1 polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 165), 62.5% for 2 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 165 and 164), 68.8% for 4 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 162 to 165), 75.0% for 8 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 158 to 165), 87.5% for 13 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 153 to 165), 93.8% for 15 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 151 to 165), 100% for 23 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 143 to 165), 100% for 50 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 116 to 165), 100% for 80 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 86 to 165), 100% for 100 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 66 to 165), 100% for 150 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 165), and 100% for 165 polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 165).</p><p id="p-0700" num="0683">These results demonstrated that a combination of multiple polynucleotides can produce higher stomach cancer discriminant performance than that of each polynucleotide alone or a combination of a fewer number of polynucleotides.

Markers Using all Samples and Method for Evaluating Stomach Cancer Discriminant Performance of Acquired Gene Markers&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0709" num="0686">In this Example, the samples of the training cohort and the validation cohort used in Examples 1 and 2 described above were integrated, and selection of a gene marker and evaluation of its stomach cancer discriminant performance were conducted using all of the samples.</p><p id="p-0710" num="0687">Specifically, the expression levels in the sera of the 50 stomach cancer patients and the 150 healthy subject miRNA s obtained in the preceding Reference Examples were normalized by quantile normalization. In order to acquire diagnosis markers with higher reliability, only genes having a gene expression level of 2<sup>6 </sup>or higher in 50% or more of the samples in either of the stomach cancer patient group or the healthy subject group were selected in the gene marker selection. In order to further acquire statistical significance for discriminating a stomach cancer patient group from a healthy subject group, the P value obtained by two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance as to each gene expression level was corrected by the Bonferroni method, and genes that satisfied p&#x3c;0.01 were selected as gene markers for use in explanatory variables of a discriminant and described in Table 7. In this way, hsa-miR-3196, hsa-miR-211-3p, hsa-miR-4271, hsa-miR-6851-5p, hsa-miR-149-3p, hsa-miR-4667-5p, hsa-miR-135a-3p, hsa-miR-4486, hsa-miR-4697-5p, hsa-miR-4725-3p, hsa-miR-6510-5p, hsa-miR-5001-5p, hsa-miR-4673, hsa-miR-4466, hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-3656, hsa-miR-6782-5p, hsa-miR-4689, hsa-miR-451a, hsa-miR-4446-3p, hsa-miR-3180-3p, hsa-miR-642a-3p, hsa-miR-6889-5p, hsa-miR-3178, hsa-miR-4665-5p, hsa-miR-6722-3p, hsa-miR-30c-1-3p, hsa-miR-4507, hsa-miR-3141 and hsa-miR-1199-5p genes, and the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 170 to 199 related thereto were found in addition to the genes described in Table 2. As with the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169, the results obtained about the polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 170 to 199 also showed that the measurement values were significantly lower (&#x2212;) or higher (+) in the stomach cancer patient group than in the healthy subject group (Table 7). These results were able to be validated in the validation cohort. Thus, the presence or absence of stomach cancer in the newly obtained samples can be determined by the methods described in Examples 1 and 2 by using, alone or in combination, the gene expression level measurement values described in Table 7.</p><p id="p-0711" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

Cancer Discriminant Performance of Existing Tumor Markers in Blood&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0729" num="0700">The concentrations of the existing tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 in blood were measured in the training cohort and the validation cohort obtained in the preceding Reference Examples. When the concentrations of these tumor markers in blood are higher than the reference values described in Kim, H. J. et al., Acta Oncologica, 2009, No. 48, p. 385 to 390 (CEA: 5 ng/mL, CA19-9: 37 U/mL), subjects are usually suspected of having cancer. Thus, whether or not the concentrations of CEA and CA19-9 in blood exceeded their reference values was confirmed for each sample, and the results were assessed for the ability of these tumor markers to detect cancer in stomach cancer patients. The sensitivity of each existing marker in the training cohort and the validation cohort was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5. The sensitivity of CEA and CA19-9 was as low as 2.9% in the training cohort, and was as low as 12.5% and 12.5%, respectively, in the validation cohort, demonstrating that neither of the markers are useful in the detection of stomach cancer (Table 5).</p><p id="p-0730" num="0701">On the other hand, as shown above in Tables 3 and 6 of Examples 1 and 2, it can be concluded that in all of the polynucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 169 combinations of 1 or 2 polynucleotides exhibiting sensitivity beyond the existing stomach cancer markers are present, and thus such polynucleotides serve as excellent diagnosis markers.</p><p id="p-0731" num="0702">As shown in these Examples and Comparative Example, the kit, etc., and the method of the present invention can detect stomach cancer with higher sensitivity than the existing tumor markers and therefore permit early detection and treatment of stomach cancer. As a result, improvement in survival rate resulting from reduction in the risk of recurrence, and a therapeutic option of stomach-conserving therapy can also be provided.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0732" num="0703">According to the present invention, stomach cancer can be effectively detected by a simple and inexpensive method. This enables early detection, diagnosis and treatment of stomach cancer. The method of the present invention can detect stomach cancer with limited invasiveness using the blood of a patient and therefore allows stomach cancer to be detected conveniently and rapidly.</p><p id="p-0733" num="0704">All publications, patents, and patent applications cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="7.79mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002 MATH-US-00002-2" nb-file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="28.19mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="4.57mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004 MATH-US-00004-2" nb-file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="9.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="8.13mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002836A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
