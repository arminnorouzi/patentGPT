More particularly, this disclosure relates to piercing assemblies for use in shisha devices.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditional shisha devices are used to smoke tobacco and are configured such that vapor and smoke pass through a water basin before inhalation by a consumer. Shisha devices may include one outlet, or more than one outlet so that the device may be used by more than one consumer at a time. Use of shisha devices is considered by some to be a leisure activity and a social experience.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, traditional shishas are used in combination with a substrate, sometimes referred to in the art as hookah tobacco, tobacco molasses, or simply as molasses. Traditional shisha substrates are relatively high in sugar (in some cases, up to &#x2dc;50% vs. the &#x2dc;20% typically found in conventional tobacco substrates, such as in combustible cigarettes). The tobacco used in shisha devices may be mixed with other ingredients to, for example, increase the volume of the vapor and smoke produced, to alter flavor, or both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional shisha devices employ charcoal, such as charcoal pellets to heat and sometimes combust the tobacco substrate to generate an aerosol for inhalation by a user. Using charcoal to heat the tobacco may cause full or partial combustion of the tobacco or other ingredients. Additionally, charcoal may generate harmful or potentially harmful products, such as carbon monoxide, which may mix with the shisha vapor and pass through the water basin to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the production of carbon monoxide and combustion by-products is to employ e-liquids rather than tobacco. Shisha devices that employ e-liquids eliminate combustion by-products but deprive shisha consumers of the traditional tobacco-based experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other shisha devices have been proposed that employ electric heaters to heat, but not combust, tobacco. Such electrically heated heat-not-burn shisha devices heat the tobacco substrate to a temperature sufficient to produce an aerosol from the substrate without combusting the substrate, and therefore reduce or eliminate by-products associated with combustion of tobacco.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Shisha devices may employ a cartridge for housing an aerosol-forming substrate. The cartridge may be filled with such aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may comprise tobacco, preferably shisha substrate, such as molasses&#x2014;a mixture of tobacco, water, sugar, and other components, such as glycerine, flavors, etc. The heating system of the electrically heated shisha device heats the contents of the cartridge to generate aerosol, which is conveyed through an airflow path to a user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to facilitate airflow through the cartridge and the flow of the aerosol from the cartridge, a shisha cartridge may have one or more holes through one or more walls. The cartridge may include one or more holes at the top, one or more holes at the bottom, or both one or more holes at the top and one or more holes at the bottom. Alternatively, the top may be open, that is, the top wall may be partially or completely absent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Prior art cartridges typically have one or more openings on at least one of the walls of the cartridge, such as in one or both of the top and bottom walls. At least some of the holes or openings in the top and bottom walls may be closed by a removable (for example, peelable) sealing layer, such as a film, sticker, or liner, during storage. The removable layer may protect the contents (for example, the molasses) from exposure to air and oxygen. The removable layer may be removed (for example, pulled or peeled off) by a user prior to first use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The holes or openings in the cartridge, if left unsealed, may lead to loss of freshness (for example, moisture content) or contamination of the substrate, as well as issues with leakage. For one or more reasons, such as in order to maintain freshness, to prevent leakage of the substrate, or to preserve the quality and integrity of the substrate during storage, it is desirable to form the openings or holes of the cartridge only immediately prior to use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly for piercing cartridges used in aerosol-generating devices. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that can be incorporated as part of an aerosol-generating device. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that does not require additional equipment in addition to the aerosol-generating device. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that is convenient and easy to use. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that can be used with a cartridge that does not have pre-formed air inlets or outlets. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that does not require a user to directly handle a piercing element when piercing a cartridge.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, a piercing assembly is provided that can be used in aerosol-generating devices. For example, the piercing assembly may be used in shisha devices. The piercing assembly may be used to form one or more openings in a cartridge. For example, the piercing assembly may be used to form one or more openings in a shisha cartridge.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The piercing assembly may be a part of a cap used with an aerosol-generating device. The cap may be incorporated as part of a shisha device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The piercing assembly comprises a cap. The cap may be mountable on the aerosol-generating device. The cap comprises a body with a cavity. The cavity may be for receiving a cartridge and a piercing element. The piercing element may be constructed to pierce a wall of a cartridge received therein. The piercing element is configured for piercing (for example, creating one or more holes in) a cartridge.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The piercing assembly may be operated by inserting a cartridge into the aerosol-generating device. The cap may be placed onto the device (for example onto the receptacle of the aerosol-generating element). The cap may be pressed down such that the piercing element engages the cartridge. The piercing element of the piercing assembly may pierce (for example, create one or more holes in) the cartridge. The aerosol-generating device may be a shisha device and the cartridge may be a shisha cartridge.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The piercing system of the present disclosure may provide various advantages to both the manufacturer and the user. Some of the advantages include that the piercing system is convenient, easy, and safe to use. The user of the shisha device does not need additional equipment to pierce a cartridge. Further, the user can pierce the cartridge without having to directly handle a piercing element. The piercing assembly may also allow the cartridge to be pierced without removing a sticker or film from the cartridge. The piercing assembly may also enable use of the shisha device with cartridges that do not necessarily have pre-formed holes or openings. This means that cartridges may be provided completely sealed without holes, reducing the chance of leakage and removing any need for such stickers. The cartridge may be placed into the shisha device or into the cap prior to opening of the cartridge. The piercing assembly thus reduces the chance of leaks and other messes. The piercing element enables the use of a cartridge without pre-formed perforations. This allows for one or more of cheaper, faster, and easier manufacturing of cartridges.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the piercing system may comprise a cap.

In some embodiments, the outer frame is formed by a cylindrical outer wall extending between a first end wall and an open second end. The first end wall may be a top wall. The outer frame may be open at the bottom. The outer frame may define a cavity for housing the piercing assembly. The cap and piercing assembly may define a longitudinal axis. The longitudinal axis may be a center axis. The longitudinal axis may be coaxial with the hollow tube of the stem pipe. The shape and size of the outer frame may be configured to suitably limit the maximum movement path of the piercing assembly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first end wall of the cap may have a protrusion extending into the cavity. The protrusion may be configured for pressing on the piercing assembly (for example, an outer shroud), while leaving a gap between the cap outer frame and the piercing assembly. The protrusion may be disposed along the center axis. This provides even distribution of force. The outer frame may be configured to form a part of the airflow path through the device. The air gap may also serve to provide thermal insulation between the heating element and the cap.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The piercing assembly may include a body and a piercing element arranged on the body. The body may comprise an outer shroud defining a cavity. The piercing element may be at least partially disposed within the cavity. The outer shroud may comprise a cylindrical outer wall extending between a first end wall and an open second end. The outer shroud may define a cavity for housing the piercing element and an inner shroud.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to an embodiment, the outer shroud comprises the piercing element. The piercing element extends axially downward inside the cavity of the outer shroud. The piercing element may be integral with the outer shroud or may be attached to the inside of the first end wall of the outer shroud.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The piercing element may have any suitable shape for piercing a wall of the cartridge. For example, the piercing element may comprise one or more piercing edges or piercing points. The piercing edges or piercing points are configured to pierce a wall (for example, top wall) of the cartridge. The number of piercing points or edges is not particularly limited. The piercing element may have only a single piercing point or edge. The piercing element may have a plurality of piercing points or edges. For example, the piercing element may have 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more, 5 or more, 6 or more, or 8 or more piercing points or edges. The piercing element may have 20 or fewer, 15 or fewer, 12 or fewer, 10 or fewer, or 8 or fewer piercing points or edges. In one embodiment, the piercing element is shaped like an inverted crown with multiple piercing points extending downward. The inverted crown may have from 4 to 10 or from 6 to 8 piercing points or edges.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The piercing assembly may include an inner shroud. The inner shroud may be constructed to at least partially fit within the cavity of the outer shroud. The inner shroud may have an outer wall comprising a first part and a second part. The first and second parts may be cylindrical elements with different diameters. The first part may be a cylindrical wall with a first diameter, and the second part may be a cylindrical wall with a second diameter. The second diameter may be greater than the first diameter. The second part may be coaxial with and below the first part such that a shoulder is formed at the transition between the first and second parts. The shoulder may support a compression spring. The compression spring may fit around the first part. The compression spring may extend from the shoulder to the first end wall of the outer shroud.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The outer wall of the inner shroud may extend between a first end wall and an open second end. The inner shroud may define a cavity for receiving the cartridge. The inner shroud may have an opening at the first end wall. The opening may be configured to receive the piercing element. The opening may further include one or more recesses or channels for facilitating airflow through the inner shroud while the piercing element is received in the opening.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The outer and inner shrouds may include a track and pin system to guide the movement of the outer and inner shrouds relative to one another. The outer shroud may be vertically, horizontally, or both vertically and horizontally movable. The inner shroud may be vertically, horizontally, or both vertically and horizontally movable. In one embodiment, the inner shroud defines the track and the outer shroud comprises one or more pins. Alternatively, the track may be defined in the outer shroud and the one or more pins may be on the inner shroud. In one embodiment, the outer shroud comprises one or more pins extending radially inwardly from its cylindrical outer wall. The inner shroud may include one or more tracks corresponding to the one or more pins. The one or more tracks may be disposed on the second (lower) part of the inner shroud. The one or more tracks may define multiple positions of the outer shroud. For example, the one or more tracks may define a first position that is a rest position, a second position that is a piercing position, and a third position that is a use position. When the outer shroud is in the second position, the compression spring biases the outer shroud upward. The one or more tracks may also define a fourth position that is a release position. When the outer shroud is in the fourth position, the compression spring biases the outer shroud upward. As the compression spring biases the outer shroud upward, it also biases the cap outer frame upward.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The outer shroud may be pressed down (for example, by a user pressing on the cap outer frame) from the first position to the second position. In entering the second position, the piercing element engages and pierces the cartridge. When pressure is released from the outer shroud, the compression spring returns the outer shroud upward to a third position. In the third position, an airflow path is open through the openings formed in the cartridge. The airflow path may be open between an exterior of the shisha device and the vessel. The user may use the shisha device by drawing on the mouthpiece. To release and remove the cap, the user may again press on the outer shroud (for example, by pressing on the cap outer frame), causing the outer shroud to move to the fourth position. From the fourth position, the compression spring returns the outer shroud to the initial first position (the rest position).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The bottom of the cap outer frame may be attached to a support plate. The support plate may be configured to hold the piercing assembly inside the cavity of the outer frame. The support plate may be a substantially round plate with a center hole extending through the plate. The hole may be sized to accommodate the cartridge. The hole may also be sized to accept the receptacle that may house the cartridge. The hole may have an angled inner edge tapered inward at its upper side. The angled inner edge may aid in engaging the cap with the aerosol-generating element and receiving the cartridge in the inner shroud. The support plate may be attached in any suitable manner, such as by an adhesive or by a coupling element, such as screws, clips, a threaded coupling, snap fit, or friction fit.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The cap and piercing assembly may include a grip element configured to grip the cartridge. The grip element may include a ring member and one or more grip fingers extending from the ring member. The grip fingers may be spring fingers biased radially toward the center axis. The grip element may be positioned within the inner shroud. The grip element may be oriented with the one or more grip fingers pointing upward. When a cartridge is received in the inner shroud, the ring member may circumscribe the cartridge body. The one or more grip fingers may be configured such that the ends of the grip fingers abut against an upper flange of the cartridge. The one or more grip fingers may have a length that is less than the height of the cartridge. When the cap is removed, the cartridge is removed with the cap due to the grip fingers abutting against the flange, and thus preventing the cartridge from falling out of the cavity of the inner shroud.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cap and piercing assembly may be made from any suitable material. Suitable materials include plastic, metal, ceramic, glass, and combinations thereof. Different parts of the piercing assembly may be made from different materials. For example, some parts, such as the outer shroud and inner shroud may be made of plastic, while other parts, such as the spring and gripping element may be made of metal. Other combinations are possible.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When a user uses the shisha device with the cap and piercing assembly according to an embodiment, the user may begin by placing a cartridge in the receptacle of the shisha device, and placing the cap onto or into the aerosol-generating element such that the cartridge is received in the inner shroud. If the cap includes a grip element, the grip fingers of the grip element may slide past the top of the cartridge such that the grip fingers grip the cartridge. The user may then push on the cap to pierce the cartridge. As the user pushes on the cap, the pins of the outer shroud slide along a path formed by the track in the inner shroud, guiding the outer shroud to the piercing position, where the piercing element pierces the top of the cartridge. After the user lets go of the cap, the compression spring pushes the cap frame and outer shroud up into an operating position. In the operating position, the air path through the cartridge is open. After using the shisha device, the user may push on the cap again to release the cap. The track-and-pin system will guide the motion of the cap and outer shroud, allowing the spring to return the cap to its initial (rest) position. The user may then remove the cap from the device.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the shisha device includes a second piercing assembly. The second piercing assembly may be disposed at the upper end of the stem pipe, below the cartridge.

From the aerosol outlet, the air carrying the aerosol enters a vessel of the shisha device via the stem pipe.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The shisha device may include any suitable vessel defining an interior volume configured to contain a liquid and defining an outlet in the headspace above a liquid fill level. The vessel may include an optically transparent or opaque housing to allow a consumer to observe contents contained in the vessel. The vessel may include a liquid fill demarcation, such as a liquid fill line. The vessel housing may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the vessel housing may include glass or suitable rigid plastic material. Preferably, the vessel is removable from a portion of the shisha assembly comprising the aerosol-generation element to allow a consumer to fill, empty or clean the vessel.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The vessel may be filled to a liquid fill level by a consumer. The liquid preferably includes water, which may optionally be infused with one or more colorants, flavorants, or colorants and flavorants. For example, the water may be infused with one or both of botanical and herbal infusions.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Aerosol entrained in air exiting the aerosol outlet of the receptacle may travel through a conduit positioned in the vessel. The conduit may be coupled to the aerosol outlet of the aerosol-generating element and may have an opening below the liquid fill level of the vessel, such that aerosol flowing through the vessel flows through the opening of the conduit, then through the liquid, into headspace of the vessel and exits through a headspace outlet, for delivery to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The headspace outlet may be coupled to a hose comprising a mouthpiece for delivering the aerosol to a consumer. The mouthpiece may include an activation element, such as a switch activatable by a user, a puff sensor arranged to detect a user puffing on the mouthpiece, or both a switch activatable by the user and a puff sensor. The activation element is operably coupled to the control electronics of the shisha device. The activation element may be wirelessly coupled to the control electronics. Activation of the activation element may cause the control electronics to activate the heating element, rather than constantly supplying energy to the heating element. Accordingly, the use of an activation element may serve to save energy relative to devices not employing such elements to provide on-demand heating rather than constant heating.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For purposes of example, one method for using a shisha device as described herein is provided below in chronological order. The vessel may be detached from other components of the shisha device and filled with water. One or more of natural fruit juices, botanicals, and herbal infusions may be added to the water for flavoring. The amount of liquid added should cover a portion of the conduit but should not exceed a fill level mark that may optionally exist on the vessel. The vessel is then reassembled to the shisha device. The cartridge may be placed into the receptacle. The cap may be placed onto the receptacle and cartridge such that the cartridge is received in the cavity inside the cap. The user may press the cap down against the cartridge such that the piercing element engages the cartridge to pierce one or more walls of the cartridge. The device may then be turned on. Turning on the device may initiate a heating profile of a heating element, to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature at or above a vaporization temperature but below a combustion temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol forming compounds of the aerosol-forming substrate vaporize, generating an aerosol. The user may puff on the mouthpiece as desired. The user may continue using the device as long as desired or until no more aerosol is visible or being delivered. In some embodiments, the device may be arranged to automatically shut off when the cartridge or a compartment of the cartridge is depleted of usable aerosol-forming substrate. In some embodiments, the consumer may refill the device with a fresh cartridge after, for example, receiving the cue from the device that the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is depleted or nearly depleted. The shisha device may be turned off at any time by a consumer by, for example, switching off the device.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The shisha device may have any suitable air management. In one example, puffing action from the user will create a suction effect causing a low pressure inside the device which will cause external air to flow through an air inlet of the device, into the air inlet channel, and into the receptacle. The air may then flow through the cartridge in the receptacle and become entrained with aerosol produced from the aerosol-forming substrate. The air with entrained aerosol then exits the aerosol outlet of the receptacle, flows through the conduit to the liquid inside the vessel. The aerosol will then bubble out of the liquid and into head space in the vessel above the level of the liquid, out the headspace outlet, and through the hose and mouthpiece for delivery to the consumer. The flow of external air and the flow of the aerosol inside the shisha device may be driven by the action of puffing from the user.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Reference will now be made to the drawings, which depict one or more embodiments described in this disclosure.
