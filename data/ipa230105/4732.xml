For example, a wireless tag in which product or merchandise code is stored can be attached to items being sold in stores such as supermarkets and large retailers. Information related to the product being purchased by a customer can be read from the wireless tag using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology or other automatic recognition technologies using short-range wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are certain known types of wireless tag reading devices that have a box-shaped portion with at least one open side for permitting a product or item to be placed into box-shaped portion for tag reading. With such a wireless tag reading device, the radio waves used for wireless tag reading may leak outward from the opening, and information from a wireless tag on an item still outside box-shaped portion may be inadvertently read by the reading device. One solution to such leakage may be to decrease the radio wave output strength, but this may result in a decline in overall wireless tag reading performance for items actually placed in the reading device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some existing reading devices, radio wave leakage reduction is achieved by installation of a radio wave absorber material or the like inside the box-shaped portion. However, such a solution tends to increase manufacturing costs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a self-checkout device in an external view according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts a tag reading unit of a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts a tag reading unit of a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a self-checkout device in a YZ cross-sectional view according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a self-checkout device in an XZ cross-sectional view according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example configuration of a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example configuration of a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a behavior of a radio wave reaching a back surface of a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating aspects related to the intensity of reflected radio waves and back surface structures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example processing to be performed by a self-checkout device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating certain examples of a back surface structure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a wireless tag reading device having reduced frontside radio wave leakage at low cost.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In general, according to one embodiment, a wireless tag reading device includes an accommodation region having a bottom surface portion, a first side surface portion, a second side surface portion, and a back surface portion. The accommodation region is configured to accommodate therein a product to which a wireless tag is attached. There is an opening on a front side of the accommodation region and an upper side of the accommodation region. The opening permits the product to be placed into or taken out of the accommodation region. A tag reading unit is provided including an antenna configured to emit radio waves toward the product in the accommodation region and then receive a response signal from the wireless tag of the product therein. The outside portions of the first side surface portion, the second side surface portion, and the back surface portion are a radio wave reflecting material. A bottom portion of the bottom surface portion is also a radio wave reflecting material. The inside portion of the back surface portion is a radio wave transmitting material. The inside portion and the outside portion of the back surface portion are spaced from each other leaving a gap therebetween.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, certain example embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the example embodiments, a self-checkout device constitutes part of a self-checkout system that has a registration function and a settlement function for a product being purchased by a customer. The self-checkout device may be a product sales data device. The self-checkout system may include a server that communicates with the self-checkout device for product registration and settlement processing via network. The self-checkout device may be one example of a wireless tag reading device or may include a wireless tag reading device as one component.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(Configuration of Self-Checkout Device)</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A self-checkout device <b>101</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> according to one embodiment is placed at, for example, a checkout counter of a store, such as a supermarket and a retail store. The self-checkout device <b>101</b> has a function of a self-point-of-sales terminal (&#x201c;self-checkout POS&#x201d;) at which a customer performs operations related to merchandise (e.g., groceries or clothing) registration and settlement processing clothes by himself or herself. The self-checkout device <b>101</b> transmits and receives a radio wave to and from a wireless tag attached to a product to be purchased by a customer and reads a product code that is product identification information stored in the wireless tag. The self-checkout device <b>101</b> is an example of a wireless tag reading device in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the product code has been read, the self-checkout device <b>101</b> performs registration processing for registering the read product code as well as product-related information (herein also referred to as product information), such as a product name (type) and a price of the product, acquired from a memory unit based on the product code. Further, the self-checkout device <b>101</b> performs settlement processing for the registered product(s) by a method corresponding to the customer's request or designation. The settlement method is, for example, cashless settlement that uses customer's electronic money card or the like, or credit settlement that uses customer's credit card. If a customer wishes to make a cash settlement, a cash settlement terminal, which may be provided separately from the self-checkout device <b>101</b>, may be used for processing a cash settlement.
