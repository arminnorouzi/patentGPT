In order to meet different performance requirements of various application scenarios, it was decided at the 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Radio Access Network (RAN) #72th plenary that that a study on New Radio (NR), or what is called Fifth Generation (5G) shall be conducted. The Work Item (WI) of NR was approved at the 3GPP RAN #75th plenary to standardize NR.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In NR technology, multicarrier (including Carrier Aggregation (CA) and Dual-Connectivity) and multi-antenna technologies are important components. In order to adapt to a variety of application scenarios and meet different needs, a WI of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) and a WI of Multi-Radio Dual-Connectivity (MR-DC) enhancement under NR were also approved at 3GPP RAN #85 plenary to support more flexible and efficient multi-carrier communications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the process of multicarrier communications, such as in CA, cross-carrier scheduling is supported. At the same time, in order to support multi-antenna (e.g., multi-Transmission Reception Point (multi-TRP) and multi-panel) transmission, a number of physical downlink control channels that can be monitored by a User Equipment (UE) and a number of Non-overlapped Control Channel Elements (CCEs) are increased. The combination of CA and multi-antenna technology can maximize flexibility of network scheduling and configuration and optimizing performance of the whole system. Besides, 3GPP plans to support cross-carrier scheduling of a secondary carrier to a primary carrier.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the combination of the multicarrier and the multi-antenna as well as supporting scheduling of multicarrier transmission, the present disclosure discloses a solution. It should be noted that though the present disclosure only took the multicarrier, multi-antenna as well as DSS for example in the statement above, it is also applicable to other scenarios confronting the same difficulty, including other multicarrier transmissions or multi-channel transmissions, or other networks with specific requirements for data scheduling, where similar technical effects can be achieved. Besides, a unified solution for different scenarios (including but not limited to scenarios of DSS and multicarrier and multi-antenna transmission) can also help reduce hardware complexity and cost. If no conflict is incurred, embodiments in a first node in the present disclosure and the characteristics of the embodiments are also applicable to a second node, and vice versa. Particularly, for interpretations of the terminology, nouns, functions and variants (if not specified) in the present disclosure, refer to definitions given in TS36 series, TS38 series and TS37 series of 3GPP specifications.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a method in a first node for wireless communications, comprising:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">receiving a first

for determining a time length of the first time window; M1 is not greater than a first threshold, M2 is not greater than a second threshold, the first threshold is a positive integer, and the second threshold is a positive integer; serving cells comprised in the scheduled cell set are divided into W cell groups, W being an integer greater than 1, a first serving cell is a serving cell comprised in the scheduled cell set, a number of control resource pool(s) in a scheduling cell of the first serving cell is used for determining a cell group to which the first serving cell belongs out of the W cell groups, and any of the W cell groups comprises at least one serving cell; W number values are numbers of serving cells associated with at least one of the M1 control channel candidates comprised respectively in the W cell groups, the W number values and a target factor are used together for determining the first threshold and the second threshold, and the target factor is a positive number.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a number of control resource pool(s) in a scheduling cell of the first serving cell is used for determining a cell group to which the first serving cell belongs out of the W cell groups, so as to support judging a cell group to which a serving cell belongs according to configuration parameters of a scheduling cell of the serving cell instead of configuration parameters of the serving cell itself, thus solving the problem of mismatching of a number of monitored PDCCH candidates and a number of non-overlapped CCEs due to different grouping caused by different configuration parameters (such as whether multi-TRP or multi-panel transmission is supported) of a scheduling carrier and a scheduled carrier in cross-carrier scheduling, so that the blocking probability of the PDCCH is reduced and the scheduling performance is improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, serving cells are grouped according to scheduling

embodiment, a number of scheduling cell(s) of the first serving cell is used for determining a cell group to which the first serving cell belongs out of the W cell groups, so that when a serving cell is scheduled by multiple serving cells, or when a Primary Cell (Pcell) supports being scheduled by a Secondary Cell (Scell), the serving cells being grouped according to a number of scheduling cells is supported, which enables that a number of monitored PDCCH candidates and a number of non-overlapped CCEs can match a number of scheduling cells, thus further reducing blocking probability of the PDCCH and improving scheduling capability to improve system performance.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the above method is characterized in that the W

monitored PDCCH candidates and a number of non-overlapped CCEs can be dynamically shared between a scheduling cell supporting multi-antenna scheduling and a scheduling cell supporting cross-carrier scheduling a Pcell, thus optimizing capacity of the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the above method is characterized in that the W cell groups comprise a fifth cell group, a sixth cell group and a seventh cell group, and any two among the fifth cell group, the sixth cell group and the seventh cell group are different; conditions under which

PDCCH candidates and a number of non-overlapped CCEs are allocated independently between whether being scheduled by multiple serving cells is supported and whether being scheduled by a multi-antenna scheduling cell is supported, thus ensuring independent allocation of the PDCCH capability and maximizing flexibility of allocation of the PDCCH capability.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to

groups caused by different configuration parameters (such as whether multi-TRP or multi-panel transmission is supported) of a scheduling carrier and a scheduled carrier in cross-carrier scheduling, so
