sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, progressive, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. It affects adults 40 to 60 years of age with an incidence of 2:100,000. ALS causes irreversible degeneration of motor neurons, which is accompanied by paralysis of voluntary muscle leading to respiratory failure. Death occurs within 5 years on average from diagnosis. Abnormalities of the cytosolic enzyme CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) are central to the disease pathogenesis. Mutations in critical regions of SOD1 have been identified in familial ALS (f-ALS), while conformational defects have been identified in sporadic ALS (s-ALS). Transgenic animals carrying high copy number of mutated SOD1 develop a disease similar to human ALS humans. A common feature of ALS is mitochondrial malady due to the excess of ROS and/or the localization of the mutated SOD1 in the outer mitochondrial matrix. SOD1 functional defect and its repercussions on mitochondrial health have led us to hypothesize that SOD2, an inducible mitochondrial enzyme, but spared in the disease, could be targeted to devise a novel approach to ALS treatment. Expression of SOD2 in the brain is uniquely controlled by NF-&#x3ba;B p65 activation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Neuronal non-cytokine-dependent p50/p65 nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (the primary NF-&#x3ba;B complex in the brain) activation has been shown to exert neuroprotective actions. Thus, neuronal activation of NF-&#x3ba;B could represent a viable neuroprotective target. However, despite this discovery, the development of potent and selective small molecule activators of NF-&#x3ba;B has remained elusive. Thus, there remains a need for agents capable of strengthening NF-&#x3ba;B signaling and methods of making and using same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention, in one aspect, relates to compounds and compositions for use in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders such as, for example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, traumatic brain injury, vascular dementia, Huntington's disease, mental retardation, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and neuromuscular disorders such as, for example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed are compounds having a structure represented by a formula selected from:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="23.96mm" wi="63.16mm" file="US20230002331A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">wherein R<sup>1 </sup>is selected from hydrogen and C1-C4 alkyl;

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, example methods and materials are now described.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">While aspects of the present invention can be described and claimed in a particular statutory class, such as the system statutory class, this is for convenience only and one of skill in the art will understand that each aspect of the present invention can be described and claimed in any statutory class. Unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method or aspect set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not specifically state in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow, plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation, or the number or type of aspects described in the specification.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this pertains. The references disclosed are also individually and specifically incorporated by reference herein for the material contained in them that is discussed in the sentence in which the reference is relied upon. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided herein may be different from the actual publication dates, which can require independent confirmation.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">A.

Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a functional group,&#x201d; &#x201c;an alkyl,&#x201d; or &#x201c;a residue&#x201d; includes mixtures of two or more such functional groups, alkyls, or residues, and the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">As used in the specification and in the claims, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can include the aspects &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">Ranges can be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as &#x201c;about&#x201d; that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value &#x201c;10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; mean that the amount or value in question can be the value designated some other value approximately or about the same. It is generally understood, as used herein, that it is the nominal value indicated &#xb1;10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. The term is intended to convey that similar values promote equivalent results or effects recited in the claims. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but can be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. In general, an amount, size, formulation, parameter or other quantity or characteristic is &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximate&#x201d; whether or not expressly stated to be such. It is understood that where &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used before a quantitative value, the parameter also includes the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">References in the specification and concluding claims to parts by weight of a particular element or component in a composition denotes the weight relationship between the element or component and any other elements or components in the composition or article for which a part by weight is expressed. Thus, in a compound containing 2 parts by weight of component X and 5 parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in such ratio regardless of whether additional components are contained in the compound.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042">A weight percent (wt. %) of a component, unless specifically stated to the contrary, is based on the total weight of the formulation or composition in which the component is included.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0043">As used herein, &#x201c;IC<sub>50</sub>,&#x201d; is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. In one aspect, an IC<sub>50 </sub>can refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% inhibition in vivo, as further defined elsewhere herein.

Thus, the subject of the herein disclosed methods can be a human, non-human primate, horse, pig, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, cow, cat, guinea pig or rodent. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal. A patient refers to a subject afflicted with a disease or disorder. The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; includes human and veterinary subjects.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0047">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In various aspects, the term covers any treatment of a subject, including a mammal (e.g., a human), and includes: (i) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject that can be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal such as a primate, and, in a further aspect, the subject is a human. The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; also includes domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.), livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), and laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, fruit fly, etc.).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; refers to precluding, averting, obviating, forestalling, stopping, or hindering something from happening, especially by advance action. It is understood that where reduce, inhibit or prevent are used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the use of the other two words is also expressly disclosed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0049">As used herein, the term &#x201c;diagnosed&#x201d; means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by the compounds, compositions, or methods disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0050">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;administering&#x201d; and &#x201c;administration&#x201d; refer to any method of providing a pharmaceutical preparation to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0051">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; and &#x201c;amount effective&#x201d; refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side effects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d;; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0052">As used herein, &#x201c;dosage form&#x201d; means a pharmacologically active material in a medium, carrier, vehicle, or device suitable for administration to a subject. A dosage forms can comprise inventive a disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, or a salt, solvate, or polymorph thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as a preservative, buffer, saline, or phosphate buffered saline. Dosage forms can be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques. Dosage forms can comprise inorganic or organic buffers (e.g., sodium or potassium salts of phosphate, carbonate, acetate, or citrate) and pH adjustment agents (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sodium or potassium hydroxide, salts of citrate or acetate, amino acids and their salts) antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol), surfactants (e.g., polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, polyoxyethylene9-10 nonyl phenol, sodium desoxycholate), solution and/or cryo/lyo stabilizers (e.g., sucrose, lactose, mannitol, trehalose), osmotic adjustment agents (e.g., salts or sugars), antibacterial agents (e.g., benzoic acid, phenol, gentamicin), antifoaming agents (e.g., polydimethylsilozone), preservatives (e.g., thimerosal, 2-phenoxyethanol, EDTA), polymeric stabilizers and viscosity-adjustment agents (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone, poloxamer 488, carboxymethylcellulose) and co-solvents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycol, ethanol). A dosage form formulated for injectable use can have a disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, or a salt, solvate, or polymorph thereof, suspended in sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0053">As used herein, &#x201c;kit&#x201d; means a collection of at least two components constituting the kit. Together, the components constitute a functional unit for a given purpose. Individual member components may be physically packaged together or separately. For example, a kit comprising an instruction for using the kit may or may not physically include the instruction with other individual member components. Instead, the instruction can be supplied as a separate member component, either in a paper form or an electronic form which may be supplied on computer readable memory device or downloaded from an internet website, or as recorded presentation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">As used herein, &#x201c;instruction(s)&#x201d; means documents describing relevant materials or methodologies pertaining to a kit. These materials may include any combination of the following: background information, list of components and their availability information (purchase information, etc.), brief or detailed protocols for using the kit, trouble-shooting, references, technical support, and any other related documents. Instructions can be supplied with the kit or as a separate member component, either as a paper form or an electronic form which may be supplied on computer readable memory device or downloaded from an internet website, or as recorded presentation. Instructions can comprise one or multiple documents, and are meant to include future updates.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; include any synthetic or naturally occurring biologically active compound or composition of matter which, when administered to an organism (human or nonhuman animal), induces a desired pharmacologic, immunogenic, and/or physiologic effect by local and/or systemic action. The term therefore encompasses those compounds or chemicals traditionally regarded as drugs, vaccines, and biopharmaceuticals including molecules such as proteins, peptides, hormones, nucleic acids, gene constructs and the like. Examples of therapeutic agents are described in well-known literature references such as the Merck Index (14<sup>th </sup>edition), the Physicians' Desk Reference (64<sup>th </sup>edition), and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (12<sup>th </sup>edition), and they include, without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of a disease or illness; substances that affect the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a physiological environment. For example, the term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; includes compounds or compositions for use in all of the major therapeutic areas including, but not limited to, adjuvants; anti-infectives such as antibiotics and antiviral agents; anti-ALS agents such as entry inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NCP7 inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors; analgesics and analgesic combinations, anorexics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-epileptics, local and general anesthetics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotic agents, neuroleptic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antagonists, neuron blocking agents, anticholinergic and cholinomimetic agents, antimuscarinic and muscarinic agents, antiadrenergics, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensive agents, hormones, and nutrients, antiarthritics, antiasthmatic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antinauseants, antineoplastics, antipruritics, antipyretics; antispasmodics, cardiovascular preparations (including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, beta-agonists and antiarrythmics), antihypertensives, diuretics, vasodilators; central nervous system stimulants; cough and cold preparations; decongestants; diagnostics; hormones; bone growth stimulants and bone resorption inhibitors; immunosuppressives; muscle relaxants; psychostimulants; sedatives; tranquilizers; proteins, peptides, and fragments thereof (whether naturally occurring, chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced); and nucleic acid molecules (polymeric forms of two or more nucleotides, either ribonucleotides (RNA) or deoxyribonucleotides (DNA) including both double- and single-stranded molecules, gene constructs, expression vectors, antisense molecules and the like), small molecules (e.g., doxorubicin) and other biologically active macromolecules such as, for example, proteins and enzymes. The agent may be a biologically active agent used in medical, including veterinary, applications and in agriculture, such as with plants, as well as other areas. The term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; also includes without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of disease or illness; or substances which affect the structure or function of the body; or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a predetermined physiological environment.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; describes a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., without causing an unacceptable level of undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0057">As used herein, the term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; refers to a compound having a structure derived from the structure of a parent compound (e.g., a compound disclosed herein) and whose structure is sufficiently similar to those disclosed herein and based upon that similarity, would be expected by one skilled in the art to exhibit the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds, or to induce, as a precursor, the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds. Exemplary derivatives include salts, esters, amides, salts of esters or amides, and N-oxides of a parent compound.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; refers to sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substituted&#x201d; is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, and aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described below. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this disclosure, the heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, can have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also, the terms &#x201c;substitution&#x201d; or &#x201c;substituted with&#x201d; include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. It is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, individual substituents can be further optionally substituted (i.e., further substituted or unsubstituted).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">In defining various terms, &#x201c;A<sup>1</sup>,&#x201d; &#x201c;A<sup>2</sup>,&#x201d; &#x201c;A<sup>3</sup>,&#x201d; and &#x201c;A<sup>4</sup>&#x201d; are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents. These symbols can be any substituent, not limited to those disclosed herein, and when they are defined to be certain substituents in one instance, they can, in another instance, be defined as some other substituents.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">The term &#x201c;aliphatic&#x201d; or &#x201c;aliphatic group,&#x201d; as used herein, denotes a hydrocarbon moiety that may be straight-chain (i.e., unbranched), branched, or cyclic (including fused, bridging, and spirofused polycyclic) and may be completely saturated or may contain one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic. Unless otherwise specified, aliphatic groups contain 1-20 carbon atoms. Aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched, alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups, and hybrids thereof such as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">The term &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, s-pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl, and the like.

For example, the alkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol, as described herein. A &#x201c;lower alkyl&#x201d; group is an alkyl group containing from one to six (e.g., from one to four) carbon atoms. The term alkyl group can also be a C1 alkyl, C1-C2 alkyl, C1-C3 alkyl, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C5 alkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C7 alkyl, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C9 alkyl, C1-C10 alkyl, and the like up to and including a C1-C24 alkyl.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Throughout the specification &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; is generally used to refer to both unsubstituted alkyl groups and substituted alkyl groups; however, substituted alkyl groups are also specifically referred to herein by identifying the specific substituent(s) on the alkyl group. For example, the term &#x201c;halogenated alkyl&#x201d; or &#x201c;haloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Alternatively, the term &#x201c;monohaloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with a single halide, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The term &#x201c;polyhaloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is independently substituted with two or more halides, i.e. each halide substituent need not be the same halide as another halide substituent, nor do the multiple instances of a halide substituent need to be on the same carbon. The term &#x201c;alkoxyalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups, as described below. The term &#x201c;aminoalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups. The term &#x201c;hydroxyalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more hydroxy groups. When &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; is used in one instance and a specific term such as &#x201c;hydroxyalkyl&#x201d; is used in another, it is not meant to imply that the term &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; does not also refer to specific terms such as &#x201c;hydroxyalkyl&#x201d; and the like.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is, while a term such as &#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties, the substituted moieties can, in addition, be specifically identified herein; for example, a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as, e.g., an &#x201c;alkylcycloalkyl.&#x201d; Similarly, a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as, e.g., a &#x201c;halogenated alkoxy,&#x201d; a particular substituted alkenyl can be, e.g., an &#x201c;alkenylalcohol,&#x201d; and the like. Again, the practice of using a general term, such as &#x201c;cycloalkyl,&#x201d; and a specific term, such as &#x201c;alkylcycloalkyl,&#x201d; is not meant to imply that the general term does not also include the specific term.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">The term &#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; as used herein is a non-aromatic carbon-based ring composed of at least three carbon atoms.

In a further aspect, an organic radical can have 2-26 carbon atoms, 2-18 carbon atoms, 2-12 carbon atoms, 2-8 carbon atoms, 2-6 carbon atoms, or 2-4 carbon atoms.

Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible isomers, as well as mixtures of such isomers.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0111">Unless stated to the contrary, a formula with chemical bonds shown only as solid lines and not as wedges or dashed lines contemplates each possible isomer, e.g., each enantiomer and diastereomer, and a mixture of isomers, such as a racemic or scalemic mixture. Compounds described herein can contain one or more asymmetric centers and, thus, potentially give rise to diastereomers and optical isomers. Unless stated to the contrary, the present invention includes all such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic mixtures, their substantially pure resolved enantiomers, all possible geometric isomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mixtures of stereoisomers, as well as isolated specific stereoisomers, are also included. During the course of the synthetic procedures used to prepare such compounds, or in using racemization or epimerization procedures known to those skilled in the art, the products of such procedures can be a mixture of stereoisomers.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0112">Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (&#x2212;) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (&#x2212;) or meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0113">When the disclosed compounds contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms. Unless specifically stated to the contrary, a disclosed compound includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as the specific 50:50 mixture referred to as a racemic mixture. The enantiomers can be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization (see, CRC Handbook of Optical Resolutions via Diastereomeric Salt Formation by David Kozma (CRC Press, 2001)); formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step can liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomers can be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0114">Designation of a specific absolute configuration at a chiral carbon in a disclosed compound is understood to mean that the designated enantiomeric form of the compounds can be provided in enantiomeric excess (e.e.). Enantiomeric excess, as used herein, is the presence of a particular enantiomer at greater than 50%, for example, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90%, greater than 95%, greater than 98%, or greater than 99%. In one aspect, the designated enantiomer is substantially free from the other enantiomer. For example, the &#x201c;R&#x201d; forms of the compounds can be substantially free from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the &#x201c;S&#x201d; forms. Conversely, &#x201c;S&#x201d; forms of the compounds can be substantially free of &#x201c;R&#x201d; forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the &#x201c;R&#x201d; forms.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0115">When a disclosed compound has two or more chiral carbons, it can have more than two optical isomers and can exist in diastereoisomeric forms. For example, when there are two chiral carbons, the compound can have up to four optical isomers and two pairs of enantiomers ((S,S)/(R,R) and (R,S)/(S,R)). The pairs of enantiomers (e.g., (S,S)/(R,R)) are mirror image stereoisomers of one another. The stereoisomers that are not mirror-images (e.g., (S,S) and (R,S)) are diastereomers. The diastereoisomeric pairs can be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers within each pair may be separated as described above. Unless otherwise specifically excluded, a disclosed compound includes each diastereoisomer of such compounds and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0116">The compounds according to this disclosure may form prodrugs at hydroxyl or amino functionalities using alkoxy, amino acids, etc., groups as the prodrug forming moieties.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0119">The compounds described in the invention can be present as a solvate. In some cases, the solvent used to prepare the solvate is an aqueous solution, and the solvate is then often referred to as a hydrate.

Examples</heading><p id="p-0512" num="0467">ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons of the ventral spinal cord and cortical projection neurons, causing muscle atrophy, paralysis, and death. Strategies to prevent neuronal loss are required to prevent the onset and/or progression of ALS (Writing and Edaravone (2017) <i>The Lancet Neurology </i>16(7):505-12. PubMed PMID: 28522181). In 1-3% of ALS cases, point mutations in the Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene result in active enzymes with newly acquired properties, including hyper-generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Petrov et al. (2017) Frontiers in aging neuroscience 9:68. PubMed PMID: 28382000. Pubmed Central PMCID: 5360725). SOD1 abnormalities have been identified in both familial as well as sporadic ALS cases (Manuvakhova et al. (2011) <i>Journal of neuroscience research. </i>89(1):58-72. PubMed PMID: 21046675. Pubmed Central PMCID: 3280078). Unfortunately, co-expression of wild-type SOD1 with mutated SOD1 worsens the clinical outcome (Sarnico et al. (2009) <i>International review of neurobiology </i>85:351-62. PubMed PMID: 19607980), ruling out substitutive gene therapy. Importantly, there is substantial evidence that ROS production is involved in the progression of ALS even in non-SOD1-associated cases (Carri et al. (2015) <i>Frontiers in cellular neuroscience </i>9:41. PubMed PMID: 25741238. Pubmed Central PMCID: 4330888), raising the possibility that strategies to prevent the toxic effects of ROS could benefit patients with ALS, independent of etiology. In fact, the free radical scavenger Radicava (Edaravone) was recently FDA approved based on its ability to slow ALS progression in a subset of patients (Writing and Edaravone (2017) <i>The Lancet Neurology </i>16(7):505-12. PubMed PMID: 28522181; Petrov et al. (2017) <i>Frontiers in aging neuroscience </i>9:68. PubMed PMID: 28382000. Pubmed Central PMCID: 5360725).</p><p id="p-0513" num="0468">Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that increasing neuronal expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme that detoxifies ROS, should be used as a strategy to prevent the onset and/or progression of ALS. SOD2 is unaffected in ALS, and its expression is robustly inducible by activation of the NF-kB complex found in neurons (p50/p65) by direct binding of p65 to the SOD2 promoter (Kuntzen et al. (2007) <i>Methods in molecular biology </i>399:99-124. PubMed PMID: 18309928; Kaltschmidt et al. (2005) <i>Biochimica et biophysica acta </i>1745(3):287-99. PubMed PMID: 15993497; Neidl et al. (2016) <i>The Journal of neuroscience: the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience </i>36(15):4351-61. PubMed PMID: 27076430). To identify putative small molecule activators of NF-kB activity and SOD2 expression, a high throughput, cell-based NF-kB reporter assay was designed and a series of compounds that increase SOD2 expression were found. These compounds cause increased p65 nuclear translocation without affecting the abundance of inhibitor of NF-&#x3ba;B (I-&#x3ba;B&#x3b1;), and prevent cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide or glutamate-induced cell death in cell culture systems (Writing and Edaravone (2017) <i>The Lancet Neurology </i>16(7):505-12. PubMed PMID: 28522181). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it was hypothesized that the activation of endogenous transcriptional programs for SOD2 expression will boost neuronal antioxidant defenses and prevent and/or delay the progression of ALS.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0469">The two lead compounds demonstrated powerful neurotrophic and neuroprotective activity. In addition, they up-regulated SOD2 expression/activity in human and rat neurons. These compounds also demonstrated in in vivo activity in a mouse model of ALS. Briefly, Congenic SOD1-G93A mice were dosed with up to 50 mg/kg of both compounds (IP) to evaluate any toxicity issues prior to initiating the efficacy study. Also, mice administered 20 mg of each compound had high plasma and brain levels at 30 minutes. Next, individually genotyped SOD1-G93A mice (Prize4life-Jackson Labs) were treated with each compound (25 mg/kg, IP) at disease onset (day 96). The treatment extended survival, reduced weight loss and improved the neurologic symptoms. For example, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that compound administration at the time of onset significantly extended survival. Data document a 66% and a 81% lifespan extension for the compounds, respectively, at 50% survival in male mice. A similar trend was observed in female mice. Animal weight, which reflects muscle atrophy and metabolic weight waste, was also significantly reduced by the treatments. The average weight within the groups before the treatment was similar. However, at 120 days, control animals lost on average 12% of the body weight and compound treated mice lost only 3% (75% inhibition) and 4% (65% inhibition) of the body weight, respectively.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0470">The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, articles, devices and/or methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.

(2015) <i>Cell reports </i>12(2):335-45. PubMed PMID: 26146077. Pubmed Central PMCID: 4646662). Importantly, previous studies showed that compounds in the same series as no. 1 and no. 2 increase SOD2 expression without changing the levels of inhibitory kB, are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced toxicity in primary cultures, and do not induce the expression of cytokines (Writing et al. (2017) <i>The Lancet Neurology </i>16(7):505-12. PubMed PMID: 28522181). In all target engagement studies and ALS model studies, cytokine expression (in vitro and in vivo) and leukocyte phenotype will be evaluated to rule out any effects on activation of NF-kB in non-neuronal cells.</p><p id="p-0559" num="0514">C.

Prophetic Examples</p><p id="p-0582" num="0535">1. In Vivo PK Assay</p><p id="p-0583" num="0536">The experiments will involve the administration of compounds to 5-6 week old CD1 male mice. Mice are dosed by either a 1 mg/kg IV bolus or 5 mg/kg oral gavage. Blood samples are collected by cardiac puncture at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs. There will be three mice per time point. Plasma concentration over time will be determined by LC/MS from which the standard PK parameters of clearance, volume of distribution, t<sub>1/2 </sub>and % F can be derived using WinNoLin software (Pharsight Inc.). This will require a total of 60 mice per compound. Plasma will be analyzed by reverse phase chromatography with MS/MS detection operating in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring using an internal standard and Applied Biosystems Analyst 1.4 software. Peak time (when maximum plasma drug concentration occurs), peak drug level [approximate maximum concentrations of drug in plasma (C<sub>max</sub>)] and t<sub>1/2 </sub>for drug elimination will be estimated for each tested compound. Bioavailability (F) will be calculated from the ratio of AUC<sub>PO</sub>/AUC<sub>IV </sub>and expressed as a percentage. To determine levels in brain, six additional mice will be dosed with 1 mg/kg I.V. and sacrificed at 0.25 and 1 hr. Brain and spinal cord samples will be collected at these two time points, quick frozen in an ice box and kept at &#x2212;75&#xb1;15&#xb0; C. All samples will be weighed and homogenized with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by brain weight (g) to PBS volume (mL) ratio 1:3 before analysis. The actual concentration is the detected value multiplied by the dilution factor.</p><p id="p-0584" num="0537">2. In Vitro ADME Assay</p><p id="p-0585" num="0538">A standard panel of in vitro ADME assays will be utilized to assess drug-like properties of compounds and to inform subsequent in vivo PK studies. These assays include: (a) Permeability: MDCK (Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells transfected with the MDR1 gene encoding for the multi-drug resistant transporter (Pgp) will be utilized to determine a compound's ability to permeate the membrane in apical to basolateral (A-B) and basolateral to apical (B-A) directions. The derived apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) provides an estimate of passive permeability; a ratio of Papp in the B-A/A-B direction gives an estimate of transporter efflux; (b) Solubility: Kinetic solubility is an important parameter for accurate determinations of the dose response. This is estimated using the shake flask method with a pSol Explorer (PION, Billerica, Mass.) at pH 7.4. Compounds are added as a DMSO solution to buffer. The average of two determinations at pH 7.4 will be reported. Solubility at pH 7.4 is relevant for in vitro assays; (c) Metabolic Stability: The potential for a high metabolic clearance compound is estimated using a liver microsome assay. The compounds are incubated in human and mouse liver microsomes with the co-factor NADPH which has oxidative, esterase and protease metabolic activity. The disappearance of the parent molecule is measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) detection. Stability of the parent compound is reported as half-life.</p><p id="p-0586" num="0539">3. Biolayer Interferometry (BLI)</p><p id="p-0587" num="0540">To determine whether the new and previously identified compounds bind directly to p65 or other members of the NF-&#x3ba;B complex, BLI will be used. The compounds will be evaluated for binding affinity to recombinant p65 by BLI, by measuring the changes in association rate with increasing concentration of the molecules. BLI studies will be performed on an OctetRed (Pall ForteBio) with anti-penta-His labeled dip-and-read biosensors. Recombinant p65 (Acro Biosystems) will be loaded onto the biosensors at a concentration of 8 &#x3bc;g/mL. Loading will be done for 300 seconds, followed by a baseline reading then an association reading for 300 seconds followed by a 600-second dissociation reading. Amounts of each compound will range in concentration from 2 &#x3bc;M to 0.024 &#x3bc;M in 3:1 serial dilutions for initial binding experiments and 120-1.25 &#x3bc;M for inhibition studies. Binding data will be analyzed using the Octet software analysis system. For inhibition studies, peptide concentration will be varied while protein concentration will be held constant. BLI allows for a calculation of binding coefficients by measuring the difference in interference signal with and without bound ligand. Validation of the system will be done by determining the binding coefficient of recombinant p65 with candidate compounds. His-p65 will be immobilized on an anti-His biosensor at a fixed concentration.</p><p id="p-0588" num="0541">4.

PubMed PMID: 21046675. Pubmed Central PMCID: 3280078). Compounds will be prepared using LigPrep (Schr&#xf6;dinger&#xae;) and docked to mouse and human P65 and P50 using the induced-fit docking (IFD) protocol implemented in Schr&#xf6;dinger small molecule discovery suite (version 2015). Targets for docking are prepared from available crystal structures (1VKX for mouse P65, 1LE9 for mouse P50, and 3GUT for human P65 and P50). Binding sites are defined based on previous study (Manuvakhova et al. (2011) <i>Journal of neuroscience research </i>89(1):58-72. PubMed PMID: 21046675.

Male SOD1 G93A transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background; JAX: 004435) will be purchased from JAX and bred with wildtype females (trio breeding) to produce experimental mice (transgenics and littermate controls). All experiments will involve equal numbers of males and females. Offspring will be genotyped with assistance by Dr. Cat Lutz (JAX) to evaluate transgene copy number (and avoid use of mice which have reduced copy number below 20).

Pubmed Central PMCID: 2656381) and the ability of compounds to protect them from hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity will be determined by MTT viability assays (24 hours post-treatment) and Western blotting for activated caspase 3 (6 hours post-treatment). Cultures will be treated with different doses of the compounds to determine the EC<sub>50 </sub>for neuroprotection for each compound; parallel cultures will be treated for q-RT-PCR analysis of SOD2 mRNA expression to determine the extent of target engagement required for neuroprotection. Mouse primary neuronal cultures will be prepared from embryonic day 18 mice, cultured on coverslips or in 48/96 well plates for immunofluorescence/q-RT-PCR or cell viability assays, respectively. Vulnerability to glutamate or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the compounds will be assessed with the MTT assay, and oxidative stress and mitochondrial depolarization will be visualized and quantified as in (Berent-Spillson and Russell (2007) <i>Journal of neurochemistry </i>101(2):342-54. PubMed PMID: 17402968). Induction of SOD2 mRNA and protein will be assessed using q-RT-PCR and Western blotting. Blockade of caspase 3 activation will be assessed with immunofluorescence. The identity of cell types expressing SOD2 will be determined using double-labeling immunofluorescence with markers for excitatory (CaMKII) or inhibitory neurons (GAD67). The monocytic cell line (THP-1) or primary astrocyte cultures will be dosed with different concentrations of the compounds to determine whether they cause p65 nuclear translocation (immunofluorescence) or pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-1&#x3b2;). All cell culture experiments will be performed in triplicate. RT-PCR experiments will be performed with sample sizes of 6-8/group, and the analysis of immunocytochemistry and mitochondrial/oxidative stress experiments will include &#x3e;20 cells per condition (relative intensity measurements using Image J). Statistics will be performed using Prism, with initial analysis by 2-way ANOVA and post-hoc two-tailed t-tests, if data is distributed in a normal fashion. If data are not normally distributed, a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis) will be performed.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0549">8.

To identify the cellular location of expression, probes for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; motor neurons) or post-hoc immunostaining for glial fibriallary acidic protein (GFAP; Sigma; astrocytes) or Iba-1 (DAKO; microglia) will be used. Inventoried SM-FISH probes will be purchased from ACD-BIO for SOD2, p65, ChAT, and BDNF exon 9 (as another NF-kB-dependent gene). The percentage of ChAT, GFAP, or Iba-1-positive cell bodies occupied by SM-FISH SOD2 signal will be normalized to the amount of signal for actin R in the same cell, with the analysis of &#x3e;100 cells in the ventral horn of six sections of lumbar spinal cord (n=8 mice/group).</p><p id="p-0600" num="0553">10.

Primary antibodies include the neurofilament sampler kit #9781 and synapsin 1/D12G5, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass., USA, and fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies from Invitrogen. Preparation of coverslips for confocal microscopy requires ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA). Z-stacks will be collected at 0.4 m throughout the entirety of the NMJ using a Leica TCS-SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope and brightness will be adjusted for each NMJ individually to such that pixel intensity, as observed using the Leica LASAF software, does not surpass saturation. Qualitative analysis will be performed as described in (Vaden et al. (2015) <i>Frontiers in molecular neuroscience </i>8:11. PubMed PMID: 25954152. Pubmed Central PMCID: 4407586).

The key attributes of the lead compounds will be novelty and demonstrated structure-activity relationships and potency (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x3c;100 nM) versus the primary NF-&#x3ba;B assay. The lead compounds will be optimized via targeted chemical modifications aimed at improving both activity and drug-like properties.</p><p id="p-0637" num="0590">The synthesis of oxazole compounds will proceed as shown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) (Bursavich et al. (2010) <i>Bioorganic </i>&#x26; <i>medicinal chemistry letters </i>20(5):1677-9). Preliminary studies will be conducted on the oxadiazole series of compounds to determine if they have any advantages. A small set of derivatives will be made consisting of fluorine and carboxylic acid substitutions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>; F&#x2550;H, CH<sub>3</sub>). The synthesis of the key intermediates and procedures required for the preparation of the oxadiazoles can be adapted from a literature report (Trstenjak et al.

Determine Permeability in MDR/MDCK Cells, SOD2 Expression and Activity, and Neuroprotective Efficacy In Vitro</p><p id="p-0640" num="0593">Appropriate physical chemical properties (solubility and chemical stability), cell permeability, plasma protein binding and CYP inhibition (3A4, 2D6, 2C9) will be determined for key compounds. Then, the likelihood that compounds will cross the blood brain barrier will be predicted using MDCK (Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells transfected with the mdr1 gene (for the multi-drug resistant transporter Pgp). Subsequent experiments will investigate whether the compounds can induce SOD2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in human SH-SY5Y, mouse NSC-34, and mouse primary cortical cultures. The compounds that induce SOD2 expression will be tested for their ability to protect neurons from hydrogen-peroxide or glutamate-induced cell death (Cowell et al. (2009) <i>Biochemical and biophysical research communications </i>379(2):578-82) and whether these compounds prevent the depolarization of mitochondria associated with an increase in production of ROS (see methods). In cell cultures, the location of p65 will also be evaluated, as previous studies indicate that some of the drugs may influence gene expression by increasing p65 translocation (Writing and Edaravone (2017) <i>The Lancet Neurology </i>16(7):505-12). At this point, a separate set of studies will use q-RT-PCR to test whether the neuroprotective compounds induce pro-inflammatory genes in THP-1 monocyte-derived cells or in primary astrocyte cultures.</p><p id="p-0641" num="0594">c.

Target Engagement with Two Novel Compounds</p><p id="p-0644" num="0597">Initially, the ability of two novel compounds chosen above to increase SOD2 expression in mice will be tested (24/group: 12 M, 12 F; 4 time points: 6 hours, 24 hours, 2 weeks, 6 weeks). Compounds will be delivered via oral gavage daily. Drug-induced SOD2 expression will be evaluated in tissue homogenates (q-RT-PCR, Western blotting; n=8/group) and in a cell-specific manner (single-molecule in situ hybridization, double-labeling immunofluorescence; n=8/group) in wildtype mice. Tissue levels of cytokines will be evaluated with q-RT-PCR and ELISA, and gene expression and inflammatory profile will be evaluated in circulating leukocytes to determine whether SOD2 expression can be a peripheral readout of target engagement (n=8/group).</p><p id="p-0645" num="0598">e. Functional Engagement/Efficacy with Treatment Prior or at the Onset of Symptoms in the SOD1 G93A Mouse Line</p><p id="p-0646" num="0599">The compound that shows the higher induction of SOD2 expression in the absence of inflammation will be chosen for testing in the SOD1 G93A transgenic mouse line. Treatment will be initiated prior to or after the emergence of symptoms. The formulation used for these studies will be the same as those used for the bioavailability studies. For example, prior to initiating those studies a suitable formulation is determined. Examples include 5% DMSO/30% PEG 400/65% water for I.V. and 5% DMSO/30% PEG 400/65% water for P.O. Littermate controls or SOD1 G93A transgenic mice (24/group, 12 M, 12 F) will be treated with vehicle, low dose, or high dose compound for behavioral (rotarod) and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curve).
