Guidance for prevention of MI and IS is currently based on treatment efficacy at the group level.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing, coronary, and lower extremity artery disease, is the leading cause of death and disability globally (<i>The Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke, </i>W.H. Organization, Editor, 2014), mainly by myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke from unstable atherosclerosis worldwide (World Health Organization (WHO). <i>Cardiovascular diseases </i>(<i>CVDs</i>) <i>Fact Sheet, </i>2017, 23 Apr. 2020; Available from: www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)). New treatments have been revolutionary over the last 30 years, yet CVD still exerts an exorbitantly high financial costs (Bloom et al., <i>The Global Economic Burden of Noncommunicable Diseases, </i>W.E. Forum, Editor. 2011: Geneva), with a $320 billion annual burden on the U.S. economy alone (Mozaffarian et al., <i>Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics</i>-2015 <i>Update: A Report from the American Heart Association. </i>Circulation, 2015. 131(4): p. e29). This is exacerbated by aging and changing ethnic mix (Gierada et al., <i>Projected outcomes using different nodule sizes to define a positive CT lung cancer screening examination. </i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 2014. 106(11): p. dju284; Warner, J. <i>Stroke Costs Reaching Trillions: Without Action, Financial Costs of Strokes to Reach </i>$2.2 <i>Trillion by </i>2050. Stroke Health Center 2006 (cited 2014 Nov. 14, 2014); Available from: www.webmd.com/stroke/news/20060816/stroke-costs-reaching-trillions), as well as affecting an increasing proportion of people globally as economic development continues to narrow the gap between the developed and developing word populations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the U.S., the American Heart Association (AHA) projects that over 9% of adults are at significant (more than 20%) risk of adverse events within 10 years and over 25% more are at a moderate risk (Association, A.H., <i>AHA STATISTICAL UPDATE Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics&#x2014;</i>2018 <i>Update. </i>Circulation Journal, 2018. 137). This yields 23 million high risk patients and 57 million moderate risk people. Of these, approximately 30 million people in the U.S. are currently on statin therapy in an attempt to avoid new or recurrent CV events, and the 16.5 million with a current CVD diagnosis are almost all on maintenance medications (Ross, G., <i>Too Few Americans Take Statins, CDC Study Reveals. </i>American Council on Science and Health, 2015; Vishwanath, R. and L. C. Hemphill, <i>Familial hypercholesterolemia and estimation of US patients eligible for low</i>-<i>density lipoprotein apheresis after maximally tolerated lipid</i>-<i>lowering therapy. </i>Journal of Clinical Lipidology, 2014. 8: p. 18-28; Herper, M. <i>How Many People Take Cholesterol Drugs? </i>Forbes, 2008; Pearson et al., <i>Markers of Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease: Application to Clinical and Public Health Practice: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association. Circulation, </i>2003. 107(3): p. 499-511).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the WHO, stroke accounts for 10% of all deaths across the globe, causing at least 5.5 million deaths annually (<i>The Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke, </i>W.H. Organization, Editor. 2014). Of the approximately 800,000 annual strokes in the U.S., 87% are ischemic, and approximately 15% of all strokes are heralded by a transient ischemic attack (TIA) (Writing Group, M., D. Mozaffarian et al., <i>Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics</i>-2016 <i>Update: A Report From the American Heart Association. </i>Circulation, 2016. 133(4): p. e38-360; Bruce Ovbiagele, <i>Stroke Epidemiology: Advancing Our Understanding of Disease Mechanism and Therapy. </i>Neurotherapeutics, 2011. 2011(8): p. 319-329). Many ischemic stroke events are caused by atherosclerosis (Barrett et al., <i>Stroke Caused by Extracranial Disease. </i>Circ Res, 2017. 120(3): p. 496-501). 2.3 million subjects in the US are believed to have clinically significant stenosis (&#x3e;50%), 19% of which have over 70% stenosis (de Weerd et al., <i>Prevalence of Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis in the General Population: An Individual Participant Data Meta</i>-<i>Analysis. </i>Stroke, 2010. 41(6): p. 1294-1297). Stroke also results in enormous costs for society, accounting for $36.5 (Go et al., <i>Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics </i>2014 <i>Update: A Report From the American Heart Association. </i>Circulation, 2014. 129(3): p. e28-e292) to $74 billion annually (D.

For example, physicians and other healthcare providers can use the new methods and systems to analyze and process non-invasively obtained data, such as imaging data, e.g., computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, of arteries from patients with atherosclerosis to obtain predicted proteomic and genomic information. Based on this information, various potential therapies, e.g., pharmacotherapies and/or procedural interventions, can be simulated based on their mechanisms of action in in silico systems biology models as described herein to enable the health care provider to provide a report to the patient recommending one or more specific pharmacotherapies and/or procedural interventions to be used to treat the patient.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This disclosure also provides methods for obtaining proteomic and/or genetic information and methods for building in silico systems biology models.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The in silico systems biology models are initially generated or trained with two types of data. First, one uses experimentally determined data from biological specimens from development subjects. Development subjects are people for whom actual proteomic data is available that shows differentially expressed protein levels that are linked to the specific characteristics and morphology of the plaques in each of those subjects. Second, one uses results from searches of public literature, experimental results, and/or other databases to find journal articles and the like to obtain detailed information about the proteins in the model. These two sources of data are used to create the initial in silico systems biology model.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The initial in silico systems biology model is then updated with calibration data, such as 'omics data, from test subjects to validate and refine the initial model. The calibration data is again based on actual biological samples that show differentially expressed protein and/or transcription levels that are linked to the specific characteristics and morphology of the plaques in each of those test subjects. This update of the initial model provides a calibrated in silico systems biology model. This step confirms that the model works as intended and also augments and renders the model more robust, given the calibration data from many test subjects.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Then in operation, the calibrated in silico systems biology model is again updated, but now with patient-specific personalized data based on imaging of the patient's plaque without the need to perform an invasive blood test or biopsy. The calibrated in silico systems biology model is also updated with the predicted effects of two or more different therapies. The methods and systems described herein use the patient's non-invasively obtained data, e.g., imaging data to provide a therapy recommendation based upon an automated comparison of the two or more different therapies whose predicted effects are programmed into the model.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect, the disclosure features methods of providing a recommendation of an anti-diabetic therapy for a patient with known or suspected atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the method including: receiving non-invasively obtained data related to a plaque from the patient; accessing a systems biology model of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, wherein (i) the systems biology model represents a plurality of pathways associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, (ii) the plurality of pathways correspond to one or more of MTOR, &#x3ba;&#x3b2;1, ICAM1, or VCAM1, and (iii) the systems biology model includes a disease-associated molecule level for each molecule in the systems biology model; updating the systems biology model using personalized molecule levels derived from the non-invasively obtained data from the patient to generate a patient-specific systems biology model; updating the patient-specific systems biology model with information relating to an effect on glucose levels by an anti-diabetic agent based on a known mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic agent; simulating a therapeutic response by the patient to the anti-diabetic agent in the updated patient-specific systems biology model to obtain a simulated therapeutic effect; comparing the updated patient-specific systems biology model with and without the simulated therapeutic effect; and providing a report recommending the anti-diabetic agent for the patient when the comparison indicates an improvement for the patient.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some aspects, the molecule is a gene, a protein, or a metabolite.

Most patients are unaware of their disease progression until onset of symptoms. Risk management of patients is largely dependent on population-based scoring methods such as Framingham Risk Score (Newby et al., <i>Coronary CT Angiography and </i>5-<i>Year Risk of Myocardial Infarction. </i>N Engl J Med, 2018. 379(10): p. 924-933; Bergstrom et al., <i>The Swedish CArdioPulmonary Biolmage Study: objectives and design. </i>J Intern Med, 2015. 278(6): p. 645-59) and development of diagnostics for more precise patient categorization is warranted. As treatment options for patients with CVD have become available, stratifying patients increasingly needs to be based on per-patient rather than population-based risk factors/scoring or simplistic imaging methods. For example, accessing a degree of stenosis, calcium scoring, or even fractional flow reserve (FFR) are not sufficiently specific for determining individual patient disease category at a level necessary to identify what treatment will best serve them, that is, to select among waiting, pharmacotherapy, procedural intervention, surgery, or a specific treatment within one of these categories. This is important economically as well as clinically, because recent advances in pharmaceuticals targeting specific mechanisms with increasing efficacy are generally more expensive than earlier generation drugs such as statins and are too expensive for use in broad populations. These new drugs are also not necessarily the best therapy for all patients and the present methods and systems can be used to match the right patients with the best therapies.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">One current difficulty is that an ability to measure a response to a specific drug therapy remains elusive, and both under-treatment as well as over-treatment remain common problems, which can result in high numbers of patients that are needlessly treated while at the same time consuming financial resources and causing patients to go through needlessly invasive procedures for the results obtained. Likewise, to the extent that methods are proposed to assess vulnerable plaque, there remains the issue that just because a vulnerable plaque can be found, the causes for it are systemic rather than focal; often resulting in focal treatment being mismatched with the actual cause of the plaque, which can rather warrant systemic treatment. The concept of the &#x201c;vulnerable patient&#x201d; has been discussed, but we need markers to identify such individuals, and we need the ability to categorize the specific mechanism causing their vulnerability at an individual level, if we are to make demonstrable improvements in outcomes for given societal cost, for example by tailored therapeutics. Each of these needs and opportunities presents a challenge to the methods that have been developed so far, but are addressed by the methods and systems described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present disclosure fills gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression of atherosclerosis under differing potential treatment alternatives. Advanced software-based techniques to extract data embedded in images, which are otherwise not readily appreciated visually or quantitatively, provide biomarkers to identify patients with unstable atherosclerosis and imaging to localize unstable atherosclerotic plaques, and provide more accurate characterizations extending from clinical care to developing drugs that are more effective for patients at risk of ischemic events.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The new methods and systems described herein provide outcome and cost improvements including improved noninvasive diagnostics to identify which patients have progressing disease, and the ability to provide automated recommendations of the best therapy or combination therapy for each specific patient based on simulations of how a specific therapy is likely to affect the specific patient and how the patient will respond given a specific therapy. The methods and systems can also be used to select or modulate doses of specific medications based on simulated patient responses, as well as be used to simulate the effects of new drug candidates, i.e., virtual clinical trials.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The presently described virtual biomarkers can go beyond indicating that there is a problem, to categorizing patients specifically as to the most effective way to treat the problem. Moreover, manifestations of conditions are considered both in terms of dynamic insufficiency (e.g., stress-induced ischemia of perfused tissues) as well as disruptive events such as thrombosis and rupture (i.e., causing infarction). Plasma biomarkers serve an important role as a screening tool, but by themselves are neither as sensitive nor as specific as knowing what is happening within a tissue, e.g., within and surrounding a plaque (i.e., the transcriptomics and proteomics of the tissue and the blood).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

For instance, by obtaining genotypic and/or phenotypic information (i.e., through virtual 'omics modeling, or based on actual measurements) for a given patient, the new methods and systems described herein can be used to model a patient's expected response to various therapies, including medicinal/pharmaceutical and interventional or procedural therapies, to recommend the therapy that is predicted to provide a superior outcome for that specific patient.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Diagnostic accuracy is improved as the morphological and biological features of atherosclerotic plaques can be determined by non-invasive imaging. To do this, we have established a quantitative linkage between scales. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as time progresses, atherosclerosis progresses on a spatial scale starting at the molecular level on a time scale of seconds to minutes, and progressing to the entire person level on a time scale of months, years, and decades. As described herein, we have used computational modelling techniques to express relationships that span multiple time- and spatial-scales.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The need for the new methods and systems is clear. Myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (IS), major consequences of unstable atherosclerotic lesions, are the most common causes of death worldwide. However, any recommendations available for the prevention of MI and IS are currently based only on treatment efficacy at the group level, and practical means to tailor treatment for individual patients are a presently not available. To date, personalized treatment strategies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been possible. Other adverse outcomes from atherosclerosis include, without loss of generality, claudication, amputation, and various presentations of aorta disease such as aneurysm.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the setting of CVD, we have used existing biobanks containing detailed disease-specific information at varying morphological and molecular scales to create dedicated in silico systems biology models, with applications including evaluation of drug side effects, consideration of drug combinations, and modelling of the effect of drugs and procedural interventions on a specific patient. The ability to identify in advance, whether an individual patient may or may not respond to a drug has a strong value. Our inclusion of broad molecular pathway analysis provides an advantage by addressing fundamental complexities needed for many clinical scenarios, when measurements of molecular species in plasma or tissue biopsies are not possible.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Incorporating molecular pathway analysis into an in silico setting however requires appreciation of the numerous structural and biological features that characterize the unstable atheroma, where a number of different pathways interleave in a complex set of interactions. For example: collagen fibers confer structural stability (World Health Organization (WHO). <i>Cardiovascular diseases </i>(<i>CVDs</i>) <i>Fact Sheet, </i>see, who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds) (2017)); collagen degradation the converse (Lambin et al., Radiomics: the bridge between medical imaging and personalized medicine. <i>Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology </i>14, 749-762, doi:10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141 (2017)). Reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins resulting from phospholipid and cholesterol efflux improve stability (Lee et al., Radiomics and imaging genomics in precision medicine. <i>Precision and Future Medicine </i>1, 10-31 (2017)); endothelial to mesenchymal transition can influence tissue structure with both stabilizing and destabilizing effects (Buckler et al., Virtual Transcriptomics: Non-Invasive Phenotyping of Atherosclerosis by Decoding Plaque Biology From Computed Tomography Angiography Imaging. <i>Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology, </i>Atvbaha121315969, doi:10.1161/atvbaha.121.315969 (2021); Peyvandipour et al., Novel computational approach for drug repurposing using systems biology. <i>Bioinformatics </i>34, 2817-2825 (2018)); and perivascular adipose tissue has been suggested to increase plaque inflammation (Nguyen et al., Identifying significantly impacted pathways: a comprehensive review and assessment. <i>Genome biology </i>20, 1-15 (2019); R&#xe9;da et al., Machine learning applications in drug development. <i>Computational and structural biotechnology journal </i>18, 241-252 (2020); Pai et al., netDx: interpretable patient classification using integrated patient similarity networks. <i>Molecular systems biology </i>15, e8497 (2019)), resulting in atherothrombosis, MI, or IS (Adam et al., Machine learning approaches to drug response prediction: challenges and recent progress. <i>NPJ precision oncology </i>4, 1-10 (2020)).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the present disclosure, given the complexity and multifactorial biology of atherosclerosis, comprehensive disease modelling as presented herein required the consideration of more complete biological networks than have been reported to date. To capture sufficiently granular information including prediction of disease-critical biological responses to different drugs, we included biological processes represented by pathway networks of molecular interactions essential for disease progression.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the present disclosure, we describe comprehensive in silico systems biology models of atherosclerosis using curated networks of molecular pathways to effectively describe and predict unstable disease. Using molecular data from plaque specimens from test subjects, we incorporated disease-specific pathways across multiple cell types to develop an integrated in silico systems biology model, we can then use this calibrated in silico systems biology model to make therapy recommendations for individual patients. We evaluated the potential of the model by simulating the effects of different pharmacological treatments on molecular processes relevant for stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions, effectively predicting personalized pharmacological effects and highlighting a potential for clinical utility and tailored therapy for prevention or inhibition of adverse events such as MI and IS.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The present disclosure also provides systems and methods of using these models to provide patient-specific therapy recommendations for individual patients based only on non-invasive arterial imaging data.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">I. Methods of Obtaining Phenotypic/Endotypic/Theratypic Data Based on Virtual 'omics Modeling</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Information about prevalent biological processes that are related to plaque characterization and stability can be obtained non-invasively through virtual 'omics methods. Briefly, methods include receiving a non-invasively obtained imaging dataset for an atherosclerotic plaque from a subject; processing the non-invasively obtained imaging dataset to obtain quantitative plaque morphology data; processing the quantitative plaque morphology data with a virtual expression model to obtain estimated protein and/or gene expression data for the plaque from the subject; and generating phenotypic data for the atherosclerotic plaque from the subject based on the molecular data.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The phenotypic data refers to the set of observable characteristics of an individual patient, test subject, or development subjects, resulting from the interaction of their genotype with the environment. In particular, the phenotypic data can include endotypic data, which relates to a subtype of a disease condition that is defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism, and/or theratypic data, which is used to group patients or test subjects according to their response to specific therapeutic alternatives.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Non-Invasively Obtained Data</heading><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The first step in obtaining patient or subject data for the methods and systems described herein is to obtain data non-invasively. For example, that data can be imaging data, i.e., image(s) of the plaques in arteries, and can be obtained by various methods that are well known in the art. In some embodiments the imaging dataset is obtained by radiological methods. For instance, any of the following can be employed: computed tomography (CT), dual energy computed tomography (DECT), spectral computed tomography (spectral CT), computed tomography angiography (CTA), cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (multi-contrast MRI), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), near-infrared radiation spectroscopy (NIRS), or single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). In a particular embodiment, CTA is utilized.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, in one embodiment, CTA can be performed as a pre-operative routine procedure in the hospital using site-specific image acquisition protocols. CTA exams can be performed with 100 or 120 kVp, variation of CTDIvol 16cm between 13.9 and 36.9 mGy or CTDIvol32cm 7.9-28.3 mGy. Contrast injection rates and amounts followed by a saline chaser can be used as required. In general, a caudocranial scanning direction can be selected from the aortic arch to the vertex, using intravenous contrast. An axial image reconstruction of about 0.5 to about 1.0 mm, e.g., 0.65 mm, 0.9 mm, or 1.0 mm can be used, and transferred into a digital workstation for vascular CTA image analysis.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Variations of these examples of non-invasive imaging are contemplated and could be used by those of skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Tissue Models</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Data, such as imaging data obtained from the non-invasive imaging methods described herein are loaded into an image processing software, e.g., ElucidVivo&#xae; (Elucid Bioimaging Inc., Boston, Mass.) software, which outlines (segments) the luminal and outer wall surfaces of the common, internal, and external arteries to provide quantitative plaque morphology data. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,176,408, 10,740,880, 11,094,058, and 11,087,460, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, the software creates fully 3-dimensional segmentations of lumen, wall, and each tissue type at an effective resolution 3&#xd7; higher than the reconstructed voxel size with improved soft tissue plaque component differentiation relative to manual inspection. The common and internal artery are defined as a target with lumen and wall evaluated automatically and, when needed, edited manually.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The software provides vessel structure measurements including the degree of stenosis (calculated both by area or diameter), wall thickness (distance between the lumen boundary to outer vessel wall boundary), and remodeling index (the ratio of vessel area with plaque to a vessel area without plaque used as reference). Investigations in animal models and histological analyses of human plaque lesions have characterized distinct, but common, structural and biological tissue characteristics such as enhanced inflammation, accumulation of a large lipid-rich and necrotic central core (LRNC), intra-plaque hemorrhage (IPH), a thin and rupture-prone fibrous cap from extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), level of calcification (CALC), matrix/fibrous tissue (MATX), and fibrous cap/perivascular adipose tissue (FC/PVAT).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The software includes algorithms to decrease blur caused by image formation in the scanner. A patient-specific 3-dimensional point spread function is adaptively determined so that image intensities are restored to represent the original materials imaged more closely, which mitigates artefacts such as calcium blooming, and enables discrimination of less prominent tissue types. In particular, the image restoration is undertaken in concert with tissue characterization based on expert-annotated histology (which includes both proteome and transcriptome information), e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,176,408, 10,740,880, 11,094,058, and 11,087,460, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, CTA can be processed to obtain 3D images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> includes four columns of images (from left to right) that show CTA images (column A), processed images (columns B and C, and corresponding histopathology annotation (column D). Specifically, as described above, the images in column A were processed using the ElucidVivo&#xae; software to create fully 3-dimensional segmentations of lumen, wall, and each tissue type at a high resolution, as shown in columns B and C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Finally, column D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows the corresponding histological sections stained with Hematoxylin (LRNC, CALC), Perl's blue (IPH; arrows) and Masson's Trichrome to visualize fibrous tissue (MATX).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Processing of the CTA images allows for multiple objectively validated measurements to be made, thereby permitting the characterization of plaque morphology by CTA analysis software. These assessments included structural anatomy (&#x201c;structure&#x201d;) and tissue characterization (&#x201c;composition&#x201d;) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> both show tissues that have a lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), calcification (CALC), intra-plaque hemorrhage (IPH), matrix/fibrous tissue (MATX), and fibrous cap/perivascular adipose tissue (FC/PVAT). These specific tissues types are provided as examples without loss of generality.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The overlapping densities of tissues such as LRNC and IPH, for example, necessitate a method for accurate classification. To avoid limitations of conventional analysis of CTA utilizing fixed thresholds, the accuracy required for elucidating molecular pathways was achieved by algorithms that account for distributions of tissue constituents rather than assuming constant material density ranges. In this way, the software makes mathematical judgments to interpret the Hounsfield units (HU) of adjacent voxels by maximizing criteria that mimic expert annotation at microscopy, simultaneously mitigating variation between scanners, reconstruction kernels, and contrast levels.

Briefly, any of several methods, devices, and/or other features are used to perform a specific informational task (such as classification or regression) using a number of examples of data of a given form, and are then capable of exercising this same task on unknown data of the same type and form from a new patient or subject. The machine (e.g., a computer or processor) will &#x201c;learn,&#x201d; for example, by identifying patterns, categories, statistical relationships, etc., exhibited by training data. The result of the learning is then used to predict whether new data exhibits the same patterns, categories, and statistical relationships.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">Examples of such models include neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, Gram Schmidt models, reinforcement-based learning, genetic algorithms, and cluster-based learning. Multiple can be used to create the pool of trained machines from which the choice is made. These can include methods of feature selection and reduction, ranking of features, random generation of feature sets, correlations among features, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), ICA (Individual Component Analysis), parameter variation, and any methods known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">Supervised learning occurs when training data is labelled to reflect the &#x201c;correct&#x201d; result, i.e., that the data belongs to a certain class or exhibits a pattern. Supervised learning techniques include neural networks, SVMs, decision trees, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, etc. Test data sets encompassing known class(es) can be used to determine if a trained learning machine is able to identify patterns in data and/or classify data. The test data set is preferably generated independently from the training data set. Training Data sets (of known or unknown classes) are used to train a learning machine. Regardless of whether the class of the data is known or unknown, the data can be adequate for training a learning machine. Unsupervised learning occurs when training data is not labelled to reflect the &#x201c;correct&#x201d; result, i.e., there is no indication within the data itself as to whether the data belongs to a class or exhibits a pattern. Unsupervised learning techniques include Gram Schmidt, reinforcement-based learning, cluster-based learning, etc.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">Thus, certain embodiments of the present invention can utilize machine learning methods and/or deep learning methods, although these methods are not always required in all embodiments.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">In one embodiment, one or more neural network(s) can be generated and/or updated with virtual 'omics from vascular CT images processed as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> according to the Virtual Tissue Models in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> and together comprising the Quantitative Plaque Morphology data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> and optionally additional covariates. One or more neural networks ingest the 3D vessel image and, across multiple layers, combine the spatially-resolved signal with the covariate information encoded as scalars (for example, vessel location, patient demographics, etc., without loss of generality), to provide calibration data according to the Virtual Expression and Virtual Proteomics models in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> producing the individual patient calibration data comprising molecular level information utilized by the systems biology model.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">This method overcomes two problems. First, the quantity of annotated data, required for training, is both low and high dimensional of the CT image volume. The present disclosure exploits the dimensionality reduction provided by the Virtual Tissue Models, which also provide an opportunity for objective validation. We also leverage the large quantity of unlabeled vessels which is enabled from the use of this validated image processing step, from which the virtual 'omics networks can learn a rich representation of vessel structure in a semi- or self-supervised manner. Second, the output has high dimensionality. We address this by employing a neural architecture that constructs a common representation of the input, which is shared across the components which predict individual 'omics levels.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">In another embodiment, one or more deep learning network(s) can be used for adverse event prediction and/or drug interaction effects. The common representation described herein can be imported into a new model, which will use the features it provides to predict adverse events directly or after further fine-tuning with labelled data. These features can also be fused with numerical predictions from the systems biology model to estimate drug interaction effects.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">In another embodiment, neural networks can be used to implement portions or the whole of the therapy effect simulations, noting that portions of the systems biology model itself may be differentiable. Reaction kinetics networks are comprised fundamentally of systems of coupled ODEs and PDEs which may be implemented within neural networks to enable speedups in both model training and model inference. Neural networks can be employed to find favorable initializations of such reaction networks to allow optimal solutions efficiently.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Generating Phenotypic, Endotypic, and/or Theratypic Data for Atherosclerotic Plaques</heading><p id="p-0127" num="0124">The quantitative plaque morphology data (which relates, e.g., to the profile, characterization, type of plaque) received from the processing of CTA images, as described in the section &#x201c;Tissue Models&#x201d; above, is processed against one or more virtual proteomic/transcriptomic models, as described above, to obtain estimated/predicted gene expression and/or protein level data for the plaque from the subject. In other words, the tissue models are further processed against known gene-expression and/or known protein levels patterns (that is, the tissue models based on the imaging data are correlated to gene-expression and/or protein levels patterns) to generate a predicted 'omics model.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">The predicted 'omics model then, in turn, allows the clinician to predict which 1) gene transcript levels are likely elevated and which gene levels are likely decreased in the plaque and/or 2) protein levels are likely elevated and which protein levels are likely decreased in the plaque. 'Omics levels (elevated/decreased/unchanged) are in reference to a non-atherosclerotic patient. As a result, this data provides information about the mechanisms related to plaque pathophysiology, plaque instability, or other relevant biological insight, thereby generating phenotypic, endotypic, and/or theratypic data for the atherosclerotic plaque from the subject.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">II.

All or a selection of probes from a microarray, or species from mass spectrometry, or other assay method for obtaining so-called 'omics data, can be selected. Single as well as multiple variable regression models covering linear and non-linear modelling techniques can be performed on predictor sets constructed from a development cohort including plaque morphology, demographics, clinical (laboratory) values, and/or other variables, in part to recognize that clinical factors can affect the expression data or models, and to inspect what is the added value of morphology over clinical and demographic data, and to identify when morphology and other variables have independent information content, different predictor sets can be used, some only using plaque morphology, but others also using lab values, demographic, and other values in composite models.

MQ for continuous estimation models was computed as the product of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and regression slope of predicted vs. observed for continuous value estimation (the former to measure the tightness of fit, but augmented by the latter to ensure proportional prediction relative to observed). MQ for dichotomized categorical prediction models was computed as the product of area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) times Kappa for dichotomized prediction (the former to measure the net classification performance, but augmented by the latter to ensure performance in both high and low expression classes).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">The forgoing can be implemented using deep learning networks of various network topologies, and using either raw imagery, or enriched images identified with tissue type annotations, and/or that result from spatial normalizations such as, but not limited to, unwrapping.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">Recognizing the existence of the various virtual 'omics processing steps, the present disclosure builds on that base with further steps that provide further utility.

These treatments are provided as examples without loss of generality.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0180">The system simulates a therapeutic response for each potential therapy in the trained in silico systems biology model (<b>460</b>) by following sub processes. The system determines a known set of molecules affected by the potential therapy (<b>460</b><i>a</i>). The system defines a therapeutic effect molecule level for each molecule in the known set of molecules based on one or more known mechanisms of action of the potential therapy on the known set of molecules (<b>460</b><i>b</i>). To define the therapeutic effect level, the system sets therapeutic effect molecule levels of the set of proteins to a baseline level. The baseline level, in some implementations, is determined based on observed level of molecules from subjects or patients without disease, or a baseline can be developed for subjects or patients already on some form of pharmacotherapy where the simulation would be considered additive to that baseline therapy.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0181">The system estimates a therapeutic effect level for other molecules represented in the in silico systems biology model other than the set of known molecules, based on a simulated effect of the defined therapeutic effect levels of the set of known molecules, e.g., proteins, on one or more of the other molecules represented in the network (<b>460</b><i>c</i>). The system defines a simulated therapeutic effect level for each molecule represented in the in silico systems biology model based on the defined and estimated therapeutic effect levels (<b>460</b><i>d</i>). In the cases where the molecule is a protein, a therapeutic effect level is a therapeutic effect protein level.

For example, imaging data can be received by the system. Operations also include updating a trained in silico systems biology model using personalized calibration data derived from the received data to generate an in silico patient-specific systems biology model (<b>474</b>). The trained in silico systems biology model comprises a set of networks, wherein each network comprises a plurality of nodes, each node representing a baseline level of a molecule, and a plurality of edges between pairs of nodes, each edge representing a molecule-molecule interaction. At least two of the nodes represent molecules whose levels are affected by the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. At least one of the set of networks includes a disease-associated molecule level for each of the nodes in the network. In one implementation, the at least set of networks includes of nodes corresponding, respectively, to one or more of, for example, a glycosylated low-density lipoprotein (glyLDL), an oxidized LDL (oxLDL), a minimally-modified LDL (mmLDL), or a very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Operations of the system with such nodes also include perturbing the in silico patient-specific systems biology model to simulate a therapeutic effect of, for example, a lipid-lowering agent for the patient (<b>476</b>). Operations of the system that has such a perturbation also include providing an output indicating a level of improvement in the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by the exemplary lipid-lowering agent for the patient and a recommendation supporting a clinical decision as to whether the exemplary lipid-lowering agent would benefit the patient (<b>478</b>).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram of system components that can be used to implement systems and methods described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a computing device <b>500</b> that represents any one or more of various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.

For instance, any compound that targets (e.g., inhibits) a specific gene, protein, or metabolite. &#x201c;Inhibits&#x201d; refers to the compound's ability to control, prevent, restrain, arrest, regulate a molecule's function. Exemplary compounds include, small molecules, inucleic acids (e.g, interference RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA); a micro, interfering RNA (miRNA); a small, temporal RNA (stRNA); or a short, hairpin RNA (shRNA); small RNA-induced gene activation (RNAa); small activating RNAs (saRNAs); messenger RNA (mRNA), inhibitory antibodies.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0214">Hyperlipidemia Control Medications</p><p id="p-0219" num="0215">High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) is a characteristic feature of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. As such, these diseases can be treated with hyperlipidemia control medications (e.g., intensive lipid lowering therapies, fibrates, niacin, fish oil, statins (like, atorvastatin), ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, a proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, and marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0216">For example, the effect that an intensive lipid lowering drug would have on a subject can be represented in the in silico systems biology model, thereby allowing a clinician to predict whether an intensive lipid lowering drug would be beneficial to the patient. For instance, in some embodiments the levels, e.g., of the gene level, protein level, or both levels, of LDL are physically lowered in the in silico systems biology model by 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 10%, or 5%, depending on what is known about how the drug affects the LDL levels. For example, if a specific drug is considered in the literature to be effective in certain patients when the LDL level in the patient has been reduced by 25%, then the model is updated to show an effective reduction of 25%. In some embodiments, the gene level, protein level, or both, of LDL products, such as, glycosylated (glyLDL), oxidized (oxLDL), and minimally-modified (mmLDL), and VLDL are also manipulated (i.e., lowered) in the in silico systems biology model by, for example, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 10%, or 5%.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0217">Lowering the levels of these molecules in the in silico systems biology model shows the changes in the levels of one or more genes, proteins, or both, as well as of other molecules that are both directly and indirectly connected to the LDL mechanistic pathway. If the in silico systems biology model shows a reduced possibility of a stroke or myocardial infarction, then an intensive lipid lowering drug would be deemed as beneficial to a patient. If the in silico systems biology model shows no change, or a worsening of one of more conditions of the patient over time, then the intensive lipid lowering drug would not be deemed as beneficial to the patient and would not be recommended.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0218">Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</p><p id="p-0223" num="0219">Inflammation is highly associated with atherosclerosis. As such, therapies that inhibit IL-1, IL1&#x3b2;, TNF, IL12/23, IL17, or other agents that affect an inflammatory cascade can be beneficial in treating subjects with atherosclerosis. Examples of therapies include colchicine, canakinumab, an inhibitor of a pro-inflammatory cytokine induced on danger signaling, a pro-resolvin (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, like, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)). To date, however, it has been hard to identify which patients would benefit vs. which would not, the latter suffering potentially dangerous side effects until or unless likely response can be established. As a result these drugs are not yet widely used, despite their apparent promise.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, in some embodiments, methods for simulating the effect that an anti-inflammatory drug would have on a subject or patient. For example, in some embodiments, the gene level, protein level, or both, of inflammatory molecules (such as, but not limited to, IL-1, IL1&#x3b2;, TNF, IL12/23, or IL17) are also physically manipulated (i.e., lowered) in the in silico systems biology model by, for example, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 10%, or 5%, depending on what is known in the literature about how a specific drug affects inflammation. For example, if a specific drug is considered in the literature to be effective in certain patients when the IL-1, IL1&#x3b2;, TNF, IL12/23, or IL17 level in the patient has been reduced by 25%, then the model is updated to show an effective reduction of 25%. Lowering the levels of these molecules in the in silico systems biology model simulates the changes in gene, protein, or both, of other molecules that are both directly and indirectly connected in the inflammatory molecule pathway. In some cases, molecular levels can be raised, for example in pro-resolvin therapies or therapies which raise HDL by way of example, without loss of generality.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0221">Lower plaque instability is a desirable treatment outcome. That is, if the in silico systems biology model after an anti-inflammatory drug effect simulation shows improvement in stability, then an anti-inflammatory drug would be deemed as beneficial to a subject. Plaque stability is quantified based on molecule levels; if the molecule levels of a subject are similar to those from test subjects with stable atherosclerosis, the patient will likely have a relatively higher plaque stability. The relative change in plaque stability of the subject before and after the anti-inflammatory drug is quantified by change in molecule levels in the in silico systems biology model.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">Anti-Diabetic Drugs</p><p id="p-0227" num="0223">Metabolic diseases and diabetes are associated with a strongly elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as, atherosclerosis. In some subjects, a critical aspect for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease is the impaired lowering of blood glucose levels. Accordingly, in some instances, treatment with an anti-diabetic drug would be beneficial to a subject or patient suffering from a cardiovascular disease.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0224">Accordingly, the present disclosure provide, in some embodiments, methods for simulating the effect that an anti-diabetic drug would have on a subject. For example, in some embodiments, the gene level, protein level, or both, of glucose/metabolic-related molecules (such as, but not limited to, MTOR, NF&#x3ba;&#x3b2;1, ICAM1, or VCAM1) are also physically manipulated (i.e., lowered) in the in silico systems biology model by, for example, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 10%, or 5%, depending on what is known in the literature about how a specific drug affects glucose levels and/or metabolism. For example, if a specific drug is considered in the literature to be effective in certain patients when the MTOR, NF&#x3ba;&#x3b2;1, ICAM1, or VCAM1 level in the patient has been reduced by 25%, then the model is updated to show an effective reduction of 25%. Lowering the levels of these molecules in the in silico systems biology model shows the changes in gene, protein, or both, of other molecules that are both directly and indirectly connected to the glucose/metabolic-related molecule. If the in silico systems biology model shows that the patient would have a reduced level of diabetes, then an anti-diabetic drug would be deemed as beneficial to a subject. If the in silico systems biology model shows no change or worsening in diabetes symptoms, then an anti-diabetic drug would not be deemed as beneficial to the patient and would not be recommended.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0225">Other Drug Classes</p><p id="p-0230" num="0226">Other drug classes are also contemplated.

If the simulations in the in silico systems biology model for the various possible drug candidates for a given patient do not show any predicted benefit for the patient, then a procedural intervention should be considered. In general, procedural interventions can make larger-scale changes than pharmacotherapy, for example, outright tissue removal represented by a broad decrease in protein levels, or structural anatomic changes such as the inclusion of a stent, which can block or interfere with connections in the systems biology model. In either case, there can also be localized drug addition, such as drug-eluting stents (DES), which may not address a current condition, but a known consequent action by the biology, in reaction to the procedural intervention, which can be compensatory, but have its own undesired side effects. Perturbations or changes can be made in the trained systems biology model to represent various aspects of such procedural interventions.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0233">Procedural interventions, include, but are not limited to surgery, DES, atherectomy devices, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), drug coated balloons, variable temperature balloons, and/or prosthetic heart valves.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0234">Drug-Eluting Stents</p><p id="p-0239" num="0235">Stents can be developed for specific patient groups depending on atherosclerosis characteristics and patient co-morbidities.

Different drug coated balloons can be developed for specific patient groups depending on atherosclerosis characteristics and patient co-morbidities. Patients with diabetes combined with different proportions of biological substances of the plaque can determine which drug balloon/excipient combo would be best suited for a particular patient. The type of drug (currently either paclitaxel or sirolimus), the excipient and the timing of release (dosing) can be tailored depending on plaque morphology to extend target lesion patency. Highly lipidic lesions like in-stent restenosis can affect long term patency and warrant a patient specific drug. Highly calcified lesions can require a different kind of drug coated balloon.

The invention supports clinical decision making by informing the clinician on what the likely effect would be for different possible therapies, and also provides tools to help discuss these options with the patient. The disclosure provides a recommendation based on the statistical significance of the likely improvement, and can compare across potential recommendations to identify the one that has been considered which exceeds others in the degree of improvement provided. This recommendation can be understood as determining a clinical action, or informing a decision that leads to a clinical action.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0263">Such recommendations and actions that proceed from use of the presently disclosed methods and systems allow therapy to be tailored to the individual rather than be based only on population statistics. Presently, clinical guidelines have not been able to use such diagnostic specificity because there have been no means to do so. Individuals have different genetic pre-disposition, environmental exposures, and differing lifestyle habits. Both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors influence what is best for that patient. The in silico systems biology models described herein provide a description of the disease, and a way to process and calibrate it for individual patients. This then enables the actual expected effect of therapies to be evaluated more specifically than previously possible. The benefit is that rather than referring to the population as a whole or at best sub-populations, that actual molecular level effects may be considered.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0264">This has been widely understood in cancer treatment and is increasingly the norm. However, whereas cancer is generally informed by molecular diagnostics run on biopsied tumor tissue, it is not possible to biopsy atherosclerotic plaque tissues because it can cause a disruption, which is not desired. As a result, the computer-based systems described herein, which utilize advanced techniques, including forms of artificial intelligence, can extend what the clinicians would otherwise be able to do by themselves. The features of the tissues are generally of too complex a nature as to be easily interested by a human observer but the present invention analyses data at a far more granular level. To make such a decision support system practical is a mix of mathematical formulations, knowledge representation, and architecture in terms of user interfaces, reporting systems, and backbone of computation, all as described herein.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0265">The utility of any diagnostic system must address what can be done with the information. Presently numerous powerful therapies exist, both procedural, pharmaceutical, or combinations such as drug eluting stents. By evaluating the individualized response to these therapies, the current systems and methods make diagnostics actionable by identifying the degree of improvement and annotates that improvement level with the statistical significance of its computation. These recommendations can be presented, for example, on screen-based user interfaces or in printable PDF forms that may be used in communicating among groups of clinicians or with patients.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0266">Identification of Likely Responses at an Individual Patient Level</p><p id="p-0271" num="0267">Provided herein are methods and systems for identifying a likely response, at an individual patient level, for a potential therapeutic agent.

Intensive lipid lowering was seen to decrease the levels of many proteins related to plaque instability, while increasing some proteins estimated to confer stability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0346">The anti-inflammatory treatment was modeled by holding IL1&#x3b2; level to a minimum level observed across proteins in the dataset. The anti-diabetic treatment was modelled by holding MTOR, NFK&#x3b2;1, ICAM1, and VCAM1 (based on documented effects of Metformin) to the minimum level observed across proteins in the dataset (Ally et al., Role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase on cardiovascular functions in physiological and pathophysiological states.

Anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic therapies provided mixed results from patient to patient, manifesting as overall inferior performance compared with intensive lipid lowering. The combination therapy that included intensive lipid lowering and an anti-diabetic drug was in general the best for patients starting out from highly unstable proteomic signatures. This example illustrates that the invention can be an effective strategy for selected patients. Moreover, the fact that some initially unstable patients did not show appreciable response to the simulated pharmacotherapies suggested an ability of the modelling approach to identify individuals best treated surgically rather than medically. Patients with initially stable signatures showed less improvement by the simulated therapies, indicating sufficient preventive efficacy on standard medical treatment alone. In addition, some patients starting with unstable signatures did not benefit from simulated pharmacotherapy and should likely receive preventive surgery, suggesting a potential of the modelling approach to identify high-risk individuals and improve decision making between procedural intervention and pharmacotherapy. The individualized patient treatment recommendations differed widely across patients, highlighting the importance of individual predictions and more refined patient stratifications, as enabled by the defined systems biology model of our study. Given the dominating inflammatory proteomic signature of unstable plaques, the subtle effects observed by simulation with anti-inflammatory therapy are worth considering. This finding may be due to the fact that only a single dose of treatment was simulated whereas effective inhibition of inflammatory pathways would possibly require not only sustained presence of the antagonist but also reduction in the driving cause. In addition, the chosen treatment targeted IL1&#x3b2;, as this strategy has been shown to be effective at the group level and even more effectively in subgroups with enhanced systemic inflammation, which were not included in our cohort and may thus not be well represented in the resulting model. In different cohorts or settings, response to anti-inflammatory treatment may exceed intensive lipid lowering on patients with CVD as a comorbidity rather than as a primary indication. Nevertheless, for clinical applicability, the model should ideally capture such phenotypes. Inclusion of patients from these subgroups would improve efficacy, and if necessary, the model could be revised using indicators of enhanced systemic inflammation such as CRP. In any case, the demonstrated superior effect of combination therapy over intensive lipid lowering alone, suggests an ability of the modelling approach of the study to adequately simulate effects of drugs targeting different pathways in disease pathophysiology.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0348">Prediction of Subject-Specific Drug Response</p><p id="p-0347" num="0349">Drug response was then simulated in silico.

The first control simulation represented no change in treatment, where the expected result was to be the same as the baseline case but derived as if it was a treatment and running through the same simulation; if the output was found to differ from the baseline case, a logic or mathematical error would be detected. The second control simulation was named &#x201c;multiple insult,&#x201d; which simulated a condition of a &#x201c;perfect storm&#x201d; of atherosclerosis risk factors causing know disease drivers. In this control, the expected result was to see degraded stability, roughly in proportion to the original stability, that is, the farther the subject started form these adverse conditions the worse their relative impact should be.

Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>G</figref> each line indicates the particular therapy, with the response being shown as points for each network scope.

The use of multiple scopes is illustrated, as each represents a differing sensitivity or specificity to the simulated effect; too sensitive can produce false positive results mitigated by the higher scope networks, but the higher scope networks can miss the effect, given their more inclusive set of pathways. High numbers indicate &#x201c;more&#x201d; unstable, i.e., a lower instability is desirable from a subject's or patient's point of view.

In general it may be seen that the core scope networks tend to show greater response to therapy than the full scope networks, which is expected based on the assignment of pathways where the more comprehensive the network the less sensitive to perturbation. Likewise, different cell type respond differently based on the nature of the therapeutic mechanism of action and its effect on the different types. The multi-level statistical analysis uses the differences in response by cell type and scope to determine the significance or certainty in the result and calculates the magnitude of effect based on the values of the various responses, which is done to build a robust calculation of response that is less sensitive to errors in individual molecular levels or missing biological knowledge in the several pathways and their assignments to cell types.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0356">The multi-level analysis across cell types and scopes also demonstrated coherent estimation of mean absolute cohort-level response to treatment in the mathematical controls.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0357">Treatment effects ranged from an improvement of 20% to no improvement.

Indeed, whereas simulation with intensive lowering exceeded the other monotherapies, both anti-inflammatory and anti-lipid diabetic therapies conferred improvement, as well as simulation with the combination therapy that exceeded the benefit of intensive lipid lowering (Table 11, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0357" num="0359">Table 11, below, shows the absolute and relative improvement for baseline and treated cases.

Patients P853, P450, and P737 represent highly unstable plaques showing a lack of treatment effects, indicating that these cases could be viewed as the most to benefit from surgical intervention, given their highly unstable phenotypes and lack of improvement by pharmacotherapy.

For each patient, four potential treatments and two mathematical controls were simulated. The light gray outer region (or green) indicates protein level signatures conferring increased stability, and inner, dark gray region (or red) indicates decreased stability. The treatments included intensive lipid lowering, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetics and a combination of intensive lipid lowering and anti-diabetics.

Each of these conditions was plotted as the relative improvement as compared to the untreated or baseline condition.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0362">We next observed a relatively well-defined threshold of absolute instability level of approximately 76%, where subjects with greater instability in the baseline state showed benefit from intensive lipid lowering and improved further with combination therapy but did not benefit when anti-inflammatory or anti-diabetic agents alone were simulated.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0363">One set of patients that were initially characterized as highly unstable, did not show any response to the simulated pharmacotherapies. Importantly, this finding suggested an ability of the modelling approach of the study to identify individuals with a high risk, rather suitable for surgical treatment than pharmacotherapy. Further, we found that patients with initially more stable plaque signatures either did not improve, regardless of treatment category simulated. In this proof-of-concept setting, combinatory treatment or intensive lipid lowering alone had a generally beneficial effect on stability, with combination therapy providing incremental benefit for many patients.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0364">Full results including summary of mean effects, confidence intervals, and assessment of contribution variance are provided in Table 12 and Table 13, shown

recommendations were then composed based on the in-silico results for each patient using an automated decision algorithm where simulations of different pharmacotherapies were incorporated. The recommendations combined the level of instability achieved on the selected drug choices and the controls, with a text statement automatically generated to reflect the best therapy for that patient (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-<b>25</b>C</figref>). Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-<b>25</b>C</figref> show personalized patient treatment recommendations for the three example patients, as might be printed by a clinical decision support system incorporating the technique from this study. A printed or digital recommendation such as this could be used in a patient-doctor consultation. Recommendations generated by the software include one or more of the individual's absolute and relative radar plots, a statement on the benefit available through pharmacotherapy, and one or two heatmaps representing treated and untreated or baseline protein signatures.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">Patient &#x201c;John Doe&#x201d; is an example of a patient with a highly unstable initial condition that can be improved with high confidence by pharmacotherapy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>). The simulated treatments for patient P491 demonstrated statistically significant benefit on combination therapy. The top five baseline protein levels matched four out of five unstable exemplars and one stable, thus providing strong support for an unstable state. After recommended treatment, two minimal disease, two stable, and only one unstable exemplar were matched, reflecting improvement by treatment.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">Patient &#x201c;Bill Smith&#x201d; represents a patient starting from a more stable initial condition where pharmacotherapy would not be recommended (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>). Patient P265's baseline protein levels showed matches with four minimal disease and one stable exemplar, indicating stability, with no improvement after simulated treatments.

The degree to which this would be clinically significant is determined from the difference in clinical presentation; treatments demonstrate a strength commensurate with the difference between being asymptomatic vs. symptomatic.
