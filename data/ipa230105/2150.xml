The present disclosure further relates to a method of servicing a waste bin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many public facilities such as airports, railway stations, hotels, retail stores or the like, public washrooms or toilets are provided. In these washrooms or toilets, waste bins for collecting used paper towels are usually installed. A common method of servicing such waste bins resides in scheduling predetermined emptying time intervals. However, due to a wide variety regarding intensity of use, it may happen that service personnel arrive at a public washroom or toilet in order to empty a waste bin, yet, the respective waste bin is not completely full. Likewise, it may occur that a waste bin is already full well before expiration of the predetermined emptying time interval. In the latter case, customers may (due to lack of alternatives) already have disposed used paper towels elsewhere, e.g., on the floor of the public washroom or toilet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above-described cases may be associated, e.g., with an avoidable amount of workload (in case of emptying a waste bin too early), or with increased cleaning effort (in case of emptying a waste bin too late). On top of that, a public washroom or toiled having an overfilled waste bin (and maybe even used paper towels disposed on the floor of the washroom or toilet) may be associated with reduced comfort of use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some cases, a waste bin installed in a public washroom or toilette may appear to be completely filled due to relatively voluminous paper towels, however, compressing the content of the waste bin (instead of emptying it) may be sufficient in order to reenable the respective waste bin for use. Merely compressing a waste bin in order to reenable it for use may be advantageous in terms of effort and time (compared to immediately emptying it). It has, however, turned out that only a fill level of a waste bin is easily obtainable (i.e., due to an optical impression), but not an absolute number (or mass) of paper towels disposed therein. Moreover, as regards to the fill level, service personnel would still have to access a public washroom or toilet in order to obtain the respective information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem may arise from the fact that used paper towels are commonly (at least partially) moist or wet when being disposed into a waste bin. Yet, moist or wet items usually bear the risk of getting mouldy and/or rotten, and, consequently, starting to smell badly. It is, hence, desired to promote drying of paper towels even after they have been disposed into a waste bin. This may be achieved, e.g., if a waste bin comprises a basked made of metal wire such that air may permeate through layers of paper towels in order to (at least partially) dry them. If a waste bin comprises a basket made of metal wires, a liquid proof floor panel may be provided on the lower side of the basket in order to prevent liquid (which may leak from the basket due to wet items provided therein) from reaching the floor of the public washroom or toilet. However, waste bins utilizing a liquid proof floor panel may be associated with increased cost due to an increased number (and complexity) of components.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Challenges may also arise as soon as customers using public washrooms or toilets want to dispose other types of waste (other than used paper towels), such as packaging waste, empty plastic bottles, or the like into a waste bin. That is, if no additional waste bin for other types of waste is provided in a public washroom or toilet, the customer might dispose the items in question into a waste bin originally intended for used paper towels. It may then be challenging (and expensive) to separate the used paper towels from the other types of waste (e.g., in order to manufacture new paper towels from the material of the used paper towels). Therefore, the provision of at least one further waste bin (i.e., a waste bin for other types of waste) is envisaged more often in public washrooms or toilets. However, providing more than one waste bin may be associated with additional cost and increased installation space (in particular, a higher volume share and a higher areal share), compared to only one waste bin.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A waste bin has been proposed that relies upon two compartments, each of which is accessible from an opening formed in a top side portion of the waste bin. Through each of these openings, different types of waste may be disposed into the respective compartments of the waste bin, thereby promoting waste separation. Yet, if such a waste bin were to have the same installation space as a waste bin having only one compartment, each of the openings of the waste bin having two compartments would have a smaller cross-sectional area than an opening of a similar waste bin having only one compartment. Openings having small cross-sectional areas may, however, lead to limitations regarding the types of waste which are disposable into the respective compartments. That is, only items having smaller dimensions than a predetermined dimension may be disposable into the respective compartments, the predetermined dimension being smaller than a predetermined dimension associated with a waste bin having only one opening on a top side thereof. Further, a rather small opening of a waste bin may render it difficult to dispose used paper towels therethrough. In particular, it might in some cases be necessary to actively push a used paper towel through such a rather small opening. The risk then increases that a customer accidentally touches portions of the waste bin, which should be avoided at least for hygienic reasons.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an objective of the present disclosure to overcome at least one of the above-mentioned disadvantages in a simple but nevertheless effective way.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is defined in claim <b>1</b>. Another waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is defined in claim <b>21</b>. Another waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is defined in claim <b>22</b>. A method of servicing a waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is defined in claim <b>24</b>. Dependent claims relate to preferred embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present disclosure, a waste bin for waste paper products and other types of waste is provided. The waste bin comprises: a frame for supporting at least two, preferably exactly two, compartments; an upper compartment supported by the frame and configured to receive waste paper product, in particular, paper towels; and a lower compartment supported by the frame and configured to receive other types of waste. The upper compartment is arranged above the lower compartment in a vertical direction of the waste bin. In other words, an imaginary line extending from the upper compartment to the lower compartment may be defined to be the vertical direction. Preferably, an imaginary line extending from a center of the upper compartment to a center of the lower compartment is defined to be the vertical direction. The respective centers may be mass- or volume centroids. In use, the vertical direction may be the gravity direction. The lower compartment comprises a liquid-impermeable bottom section and, preferably, liquid-impermeable side-wall sections. An intermediate section (or a plurality of intermediate sections) may be provided in-between the bottom section and (at least one of) the side-wall sections of the lower compartment, said intermediate section(s) preferably also being liquid-impermeable. At least one of the upper compartment and the lower compartment is detachable from the frame. Preferably, each of the lower compartment and the upper compartment is independently detachable from the frame.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;detachable&#x201d; relates to a configuration allowing a fixation between a respective compartment to be released such that the respective compartment may be spatially separated from the frame. Preferably, the term detachable also includes cases allowing the fixation to be reestablished. The waste bin may, for example, be configured such that the upper compartment, the lower compartment or both compartments may be detached and re-attached independently from each other any number of times.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above-described configuration (in particular, the feature wherein the upper compartment is arranged vertically above the lower compartment) allows providing a waste bin having two compartments (e.g., for promoting separation of different types of waste) while utilizing the installation space (in particular, the installation area) of a waste bin having only one compartment. The above-described waste bin, hence, allows installing a waste bin having two compartments also in small public washrooms or toilets. Put differently, the above-described configuration may be considered to promote environmental sustainability, as it allows increasing the share of washrooms or toilets being equipped with a waste bin enabled for waste separation. Moreover, the (reduced) installation space of the above-described waste bin may be associated with reduced cost as it allows public washrooms or toilets to be designed smaller.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">On top of that, the configuration of the above-described waste bin may be considered to promote simplicity (and ease) of an emptying operation (compared to waste bins having more than one compartment). That is, due to the fact that at least one of the compartments of the above-described waste is independently detachable, the absolute weight that has to be lifted (e.g., by service personnel) during an emptying operation may be reduced. Put differently, the independent detachability of the at least one compartment may be considered to enable a sequential (and/or serial) emptying operation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The liquid impermeability of the (above-mentioned components of the) lower compartment may be considered to advantageously promote cleanliness of the public washroom or toilet in which the respective waste bin is installed. That is, a liquid impermeable lower compartment may prevent liquid (which may leak from the upper compartment, e.g., due to wet paper towels provided therein) from reaching the floor of the public washroom or toilet. The lower compartment may, hence, be considered to fulfil the additional purpose (besides the purpose of receiving other types of waste) of collecting liquid potentially leaking from the upper compartment. The (vertical) arrangement of the upper compartment and the lower compartment as well as the liquid impermeability of the lower compartment, hence, synergistically promote cost saving effects.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is configured such that each of the upper compartment and the lower compartment is accessible for introducing waste material thereinto independently from the respective other compartment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this context, the term &#x201c;independently&#x201d; may be understood such that one does not have to utilize (e.g., open, detach, or push aside) a first compartment in order to access a second compartment for introducing waste material thereinto. Moreover, the term &#x201c;independently&#x201d; may be considered to exclude cases in which waste material inevitably has to pass through a first compartment in order to arrive at a second compartment (e.g., if the first compartment serves as a &#x201c;sieve&#x201d; or &#x201c;filter&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Yet, it is to be noted that the upper compartment serving as sieve or filter may be a desirable feature, e.g., if a mesh structure is provided in the first compartment (such as the mesh structure described further below). That is, the mesh structure may, e.g., have a mesh size configured such that used paper towels stay inside the upper compartment (i.e., do not fall through openings of the mesh), whereas other types of waste (e.g., other types of waste accidentally disposed into the upper compartment, such as cigarette ends or the like) fall through openings of the mesh. For this purpose, the mesh may only have openings, the maximum extension (in any direction) of which is equal to or lower than 10 cm. Preferably, the maximum extension (in any direction) of each opening of the mesh is equal to or lower than 5 cm. Most preferably the maximum extension (in any direction) of each opening of the mesh is equal to or lower than 2 cm. It is further preferred that the cross-sectional area of each openings of the mesh is equal to or greater than 100 cm<sup>2</sup>, equal to or greater than 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, or equal to or greater than 4 cm<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, one or more of the previously defined conditions as regards areas and/or maximum extensions of the openings may apply only to openings of a mesh (or a portion of the mesh) provided in a lower end portion of the upper compartment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to some aspects, at last one of, preferably both of, the upper compartment and the lower compartment are detachable from the frame independently from each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Detaching a (first) compartment independently means that no other (i.e., second) compartment has to be detached (or utilized otherwise) during the process of detaching the first compartment. An example of a first compartment not being independently detachable would, hence, include that one would firstly have to detach (or, e.g., open) a second compartment in order to subsequently detach the first compartment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above-described waste bin may have a plurality of lower compartments. The plurality of lower compartments may be provided below the upper compartment, and arranged adjacent to each other in a horizontal direction, the horizontal direction intersecting the vertical direction. Preferably, the horizontal direction is substantially perpendicular to the vertical direction. The frame of the above-mentioned waste bin may have a receiving portion configured to hold one, as well as several lower compartments, such that a configuration of the waste bin may be easily and quickly varied in accordance with specific demands.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A third compartment (or a plurality of third compartments) may be provided below the lower compartment or below the lower compartments. A waste bin having multiple compartments as described above may advantageously promote highly differentiated waste separation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The above-described waste bin may further comprise a wall mounting interface configured for attaching the waste bin to a wall, in particular, a wall of a public washroom or toilet. A waste bin having a wall mounting interface may advantageously allow installing the respective waste bin such that the space below the waste bin is accessible (e.g., in order to facilitate cleaning of the space below the waste bin, or in order to place other items such as a storage board, a shoe cleaning machine, or the like under the waste bin).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively or additionally, the above-described waste bin may comprise a pedestal configured to enable floor standing operation of the waste bin. It is noted that floor standing operation is a rather simple mode of operation (as, e.g., no holes need to be drilled into walls of a public washroom or toilet). Providing a pedestal may, hence, be considered to facilitate quick and easy use of the waste bin. Moreover, if both a pedestal and a wall mounting interface are provided, the respective waste bin may be associated with increased flexibility in use.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above-described waste bin, at least a part of the upper compartment may be made of an air-permeable and/or liquid-permeable material. Alternatively or additionally, at least a part of the upper compartment may have an air-permeable and/or liquid-permeable structure. Examples for air-permeable and/or liquid permeable materials comprise membranes such as EPTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, which is also known as GoreTex), PES (polyethersulfone), Zeolite (Aluminosilicate) or the like. Examples of an air-permeable and/or liquid permeable structure comprise a structure having a plurality of openings, or a structure having a plurality of channels, in order to enable communication between the upper compartment and the outside air, e.g., through side walls of the upper compartment. The upper compartment of the waste bin may comprise at least five faces (e.g., a front face, a left face, a right face, a back face and a bottom face). A plurality of openings may be provided, e.g., in exactly one of the previously mentioned faces, in exactly two of the previously mentioned faces, in exactly three of the previously mentioned faces, in exactly four of the previously mentioned faces, or in exactly five of the previously mentioned faces. Preferably, a plurality of openings are provided in each of the faces of the upper compartment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an aspect, the upper compartment comprises a plurality of openings in all faces thereof except in a face of the upper compartment facing the frame.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An upper compartment having the above-described configuration may be considered to promote drying of moist or wet paper towels disposed therein. Therefore, a risk of the paper towels getting mouldy and/or rotten may be reduced. Likewise, the generation of bad smells arising from mouldy paper towels may be prevented. It is noted that an upper compartment having the above-described configuration may be considered particularly advantageous in conjunction with the (liquid impermeable) lower compartment, as this combination allows using the waste bin (in particular, the upper compartment) without a garbage bag.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The upper compartment of the waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure may be made of or otherwise comprise a mesh structure. Preferably, the mesh structure is made of (or comprises) a plastic material or a metal, such as a steel-based alloy or an aluminum-based alloy. While both the plastic and the metal type may be associated with low cost production, the plastic type may further be advantageous as regards to weight of the upper compartment. Specifically, an upper compartment being made of (or comprising) a plastic material may allow an operator (e.g., service personnel) to easily lift the upper compartment, for example during an emptying procedure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">If plastic material is utilized in the upper compartment, the plastic material may comprise or consist of a Polypropylene-, and/or Polyethylene-compound, preferably a reinforced Polypropylene- and/or Polyethylene-compound such as a glass-fibre-reinforced Polypropylene- and/or Polyethylene-compound. Preferably, the Polypropylene- and/or Polyethylene-compounds comprise recycled material. Polypropylene-, and Polyethylene-compounds (in particular, such compounds comprising recycled material) may be associated with cost advantages and environmental sustainability. Reinforcing said compounds with fibers, such as glass fibers, may lead to increased mechanical properties, in particular, to increased tensile/flexural strength, increased tensile/flexural moduli, and optimized impact strength.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure, the upper compartment may comprise a deposit opening for depositing waste paper products into the upper compartment, the deposit opening being provided in an upper end portion of the upper compartment. A vertical projection of an area of the deposit opening may occupy at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of a maximum cross-sectional area of the waste bin in a plane perpendicular to the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An upper compartment having a large deposit opening on a top side thereof (i.e., a deposit opening as defined above) may be associated with benefits as regards to comfort in use and hygiene. As discussed in the introductory portion of the present application, deposit openings having small cross-sectional areas may lead to limitations regarding the types of waste which are disposable into the respective compartments. That is, only items having smaller dimensions than a predetermined dimension may be disposable into the respective compartments, the predetermined dimension being smaller than a predetermined dimension associated with a waste bin having only one opening on a top side thereof. Also, a rather small opening of a compartment may render it particularly difficult to dispose used paper towels therethrough. Specifically, it might in some cases be necessary to actively push a used paper towel through such a rather small opening. The risk would then increase that a customer accidentally touches portions of the waste bin, which should be avoided at least for hygienic reasons.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is noted that the above-defined size of an opening may only be achieved due to the fact that no other compartment is provided (horizontally) adjacent to the upper compartment. Put differently, the previously described features may be considered to synergistically interact with the vertical arrangement of the upper and the lower compartment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure, the deposit opening (of the upper compartment) preferably lies within a horizontally-oriented plane (i.e., a plane being perpendicular to the vertical direction). However, the deposit opening may alternatively be provided (substantially) in a plane which is inclined with respect to the vertical direction at an angle between 30&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, at an angle between 60&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, or at an angle between 80&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;. The above-defined orientations may be considered advantageous as they promote ease of depositing waste items therethrough. That is, as long as the deposit opening is not exclusively provided in a vertically oriented plane, gravity may assist in disposing used paper towels through the deposit opening.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure, also the lower compartment may comprise a deposit opening provided in an upper end portion thereof. The deposit opening of the lower compartment may lie in a plane which is inclined with respect to the vertical direction at an angle between 30&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, preferably at an angle between 60&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, and more preferably at an angle between 80&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the deposit opening of the lower compartment is accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto least from, preferably exclusively from, a front side, a first lateral side and/or a second lateral side of the waste bin. Preferably, the lower compartment comprises exactly one deposit opening. The front side and the lateral sides are sides of the waste bin provided substantially parallel to the vertical direction. If the waste bin comprises a wall mounting interface, the front side of the waste bin is preferably a side provided on a side opposite the the wall mounting interface. Further, if the waste bin comprises a wall mounting interface, the lateral sides of the waste bin are preferably sides provided adjacent to the wall mounting interface. Measures that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto are described hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A measure that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto may reside in that a lower portion of the upper compartment is tapered and/or rounded such that a cross-sectional area of the upper compartment in a plane perpendicular to the vertical direction decreases in the direction from the upper compartment towards the lower compartment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another measure that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto may reside in that the upper compartment and the lower compartment are spaced from each other along the vertical direction. In that case, a lowermost portion of the upper compartment may, provided, e.g., at least 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm, 25 cm or 30 cm above an uppermost portion of the lower compartment in the vertical direction of the waste bin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Yet another measure that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto may reside in that the upper compartment comprises a deposit opening provided in an upper end portion thereof, wherein the lower compartment comprises a deposit opening provided in an upper end portion thereof, wherein a vertical projection of an area of the deposit opening of the lower compartment extends at least partially beyond a vertical projection of a bottom portion of the upper compartment in one or more directions perpendicular to the vertical direction of the waste bin.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Yet another measure that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto may reside in that the lower compartment comprises a deposit opening provided in an upper end portion thereof, wherein the deposit opening (at least partially) extends in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure, a lower portion of the lower compartment may be tapered and/or rounded. On one hand, this may be associated with preventing dirt from accumulating in inner corners of the lower compartment (e.g., due to the absence of narrow corners). On the other hand, tapered and/or rounded lower portions of the lower compartment may enable a configuration in which a deposit opening of the lower compartment (provided in an upper portion thereof) protrudes to a side of the waste bin (in a horizontal direction) with respect to a bottom portion of the lower compartment. The above-described configuration may, hence, also be considered a measure that may enable (or promote) a lower compartment to be accessible for incorporating waste material thereinto.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The above-described measures may be combined in any permutations thereof in so far not structurally or functionally interfering with each other.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure, the lower compartment may be provided with a disposable insert. The disposable insert preferably comprises (or is made of) an absorbent material. In particular, the disposable insert may be made of or comprise compressed fibers, such as wood fibers, or other types of cellulose-based material (including recycled cellulose-based material). Providing a disposable insert as described above may be considered to advantageously promote simplicity (and duration) of an emptying operation of the lower compartment. That is, in order to empty a lower compartment having a respective insert, an operator (e.g., service personnel) would only have to remove the insert comprising the waste material from the lower compartment, and dispose the insert comprising the waste material (e.g., into a larger waste collector). In contrast, without such an insert, an operator would have to detach the lower compartment from the frame of the waste bin, empty the lower compartment (e.g., into a larger waste collector), and reattach the lower compartment to the frame. Also, proving said insert may be associated with advantages as regards to cleanliness of the lower compartment (i.e., no waste material may get in contact with inner surfaces of the lower compartment).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure may further comprise a cover lid pivotably mounted to the frame in an upper end portion thereof and configured to adopt a plurality of positions including a use-position. The cover lid may comprise a lid opening which is, in the use-position, provided so as to align with a deposit opening of the upper compartment such that an outer circumferential edge of the deposit opening of the upper compartment is covered by the cover lid. Providing a cover lid as described above may be advantageous as it may allow further components to be hidden thereunder (such as a sensor, an attachment mechanism for attaching the upper compartment to the frame, an operating manual of the waste bin, or the like).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the above-described waste bin, the use-position may be a position in which the upper compartment is fixed to the frame by the cover lid. Further, the cover lid may be configured to adopt a release position enabling the upper compartment to be detached from the waste bin. The use-position may be a position in which a plane in which the lid opening is provided is substantially parallel to a plane in which the deposit opening of the upper compartment is provided. The release position may be a position in which a plane in which the lid opening is provided is inclined with respect to a plane in which the deposit opening of the upper compartment is provided. In the latter case, the angle of inclination may, e.g., be between 30&#xb0; and 120&#xb0;, between 50&#xb0; and 100&#xb0;, between 60&#xb0; and 100&#xb0; or between 80&#xb0; and 100&#xb0;, the boundary values being respectively included.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is a waste bin for waste paper products and/or other types of waste. Preferably, the other waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is one of the above-described waste bins. The other waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure comprises: a frame, the frame preferably comprising a wall mounting interface configured for attaching the waste bin to a wall, in particular, a wall of a public washroom; a compartment configured to receive waste paper products and/or other types of waste; a holder part pivotably attached to the frame, so as to be pivotable relative to the frame around a pivot axis, and configured to support the compartment at at least two, preferably exactly two, contact portions thereof. The pivot axis is arranged such that a gravity force of the compartment acting on the holder part is at least partially converted into a force having a component in a horizontal direction. The horizontal direction is a direction perpendicular to a gravity direction. The other waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure further comprises a sensor configured to measure at least a part of the component of the force in the horizontal direction. The sensor may, hence, be considered to be a weight sensor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described in the introductory portion of the present application, it may be difficult to obtain a weight of used paper towels disposed in a compartment of a waste bin (e.g., purely from an optical impression). Yet, in some cases, obtaining weight-related information may be crucial in order to decide whether a waste bin has to be emptied (e.g., if mechanical overload/breakage of components of the waste bin were to be prevented). The above-described configuration, hence, provides a simple, yet cost-efficient way of obtaining the desired weight information.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The other waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure may further comprise output means for outputting information obtained by the sensor. The output means may, e.g., be provided spatially close to the waste bin. Alternatively or additionally, the output means may be a remotely operable device, such as a cellphone or a tablet. For the latter purpose, the waste bin may further comprise a network device configured to (wirelessly) provide information obtained by the sensor to the remotely operable device. Utilizing a remotely operable device as an output means may be considered particularly advantageous as it may allow an operator (e.g., service personnel) to permanently monitor a waste bin (or a plurality of waste bins installed in different washrooms or toilets, respectively) without the necessity of being physically present.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Yet another waste bin in accordance with the present disclosure is a waste bin for waste paper products and/or other types of waste. Preferably, this waste bin is any one of the above-described waste bins. This waste bin comprises: a compartment configured to receive waste paper products and/or other types of waste; a weight sensor configured to measure a total weight of the compartment or a weight of waste introduced into the compartment; and a level sensor configured to measure a fill level of the compartment. The level sensor may comprise a time of flight sensor, preferably utilizing infrared light, a radar sensor, a capacitive sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a photoelectric barrier, and/or an array of photoelectric barriers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the above-described waste bin further comprises first output means for outputting information obtained by the weight sensor, and second output means for outputting information obtained by the level sensor. Each of the output means may, e.g., be provided spatially close to the waste bin, respectively. Alternatively or additionally, each of the output means may be a remotely operable device, such as a cellphone or a tablet. Moreover, the above-described waste bin may further comprise a network device configured to (wirelessly) provide information obtained by the weight sensor and information obtained by the level sensor to the remotely operable device. The first output means and the second output means may be different output means, or they may be the same output means.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The above-described waste bin may be considered advantageous as it may allow an operator to decide whether emptying or compressing is necessary. Another advantage of the above-described waste bin may arise if a remotely operable device is used as the output means. In this case, the operator may not be physically present in a washroom or toilet in order to obtain information whether a waste bin requires a type of servicing (such as compressing or emptying) or not.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Analogous advantages and effects may be associated with a method in accordance with the present disclosure, which is a method of servicing any one of the above-described waste bins. In this method, the waste bin further is further configured to output a value W measured by the weight sensor and a value L measured by the level sensor.
