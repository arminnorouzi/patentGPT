INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor manufacturing processes, in particular to a semiconductor structure including salicide layer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Field effect transistors are important electronic devices in the fabrication of integrated circuits, and as the size of the semiconductor device shrinks, fabrications of the transistors and interconnects have to be improved for fabricating transistors with smaller sizes and higher quality.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, after forming the transistors, contact plugs are often utilized for interconnection purposes, in which the contact plugs are composed of conducting metals such as tungsten or copper to electrically connect the gate, source, and drain to upper level interconnect layers. Furthermore, salicide layers are often formed over the surface of the gate structure and the source/drain region to improve the Ohmic contact between the contact plugs and the gate structure and the source/drain region. For example, a self-align salicide (salicide) process has been widely utilized to fabricate the salicide layers. The salicide process, after forming a salicide block (SAB) layer over non-salicide regions that are defined by a layout pattern according to a design rule provided from clients, includes steps of disposing a metal layer comprised of cobalt, titanium, or nickel on a source/drain region and a gate structure, and performing a rapid thermal process (RTP), thus the metal layer reacts with the silicon contained within the gate structure and the source/drain region to form a metal salicide.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As mentioned above, the salicide is utilized to reduce contact resistance of diffusion regions in typical logic circuits. However, the applicant found that if salicide is excessively formed, it will easily lead to leakage current of the device. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a top view of a transistor device. In the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate <b>10</b> is provided, on which an active area AA is defined, a gate structure <b>12</b> spans the active area AA, the active areas AA on both sides of the gate structure <b>12</b> are defined as source regions <b>14</b> and drain regions <b>16</b>, respectively, and a plurality of contact structures <b>22</b> are located on and electrically connected to the source regions <b>14</b> and drain regions <b>16</b>. Generally, in order to reduce the resistance between the contact structure <b>22</b> and the source region <b>14</b>/the drain region <b>16</b>, a salicide layer <b>20</b> can be formed on the source region <b>14</b> and the drain region <b>16</b>. However, the applicant has found that when salicide layer <b>20</b> is formed on the whole source region <b>14</b> and drain region <b>16</b>, leakage current is easily generated at the interface between gate structure <b>12</b> and active area AA (especially at the corner A, the corner B, the corner C and the corner D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), which affects the device performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for an improved semiconductor structure to solve the above problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor structure is provided, and the semiconductor structure includes a substrate, and an active area is defined thereon, a gate structure spanning the active area, wherein the overlapping range of the gate structure and the active area is defined as an overlapping region, and the overlapping region includes four corners, and at least one salicide block covering the four corners of the overlapping region.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To sum up, the present invention is characterized in that the shape of salicide block is designed so that salicide block covers at least the corners at the interface of the gate structure and the active area, but does not cover the long sides of both sides of the gate structure. In this way, the salicide layer formed later will not cover the corners at the interface of the gate structure and the active area, which can prevent the leakage current of the gate structure from flowing into the salicide layer. Therefore, the semiconductor structure with salicide layer of the present invention has the advantages of preventing leakage current, improving product yield, and being compatible with the existing process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various Figures and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a top view of a conventional transistor device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref> shows a top view of a semiconductor structure according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a top view of a semiconductor structure according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a top view of a semiconductor structure according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To provide a better understanding of the present invention to users skilled in the technology of the present invention, preferred embodiments are detailed as follows. The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings with numbered elements to clarify the contents and the effects to be achieved.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Please note that the figures are only for illustration and the figures may not be to scale. The scale may be further modified according to different design considerations. When referring to the words &#x201c;up&#x201d; or &#x201c;down&#x201d; that describe the relationship between components in the text, it is well known in the art and should be clearly understood that these words refer to relative positions that can be inverted to obtain a similar structure, and these structures should therefore not be precluded from the scope of the claims in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref> shows a top view of a semiconductor structure according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in this embodiment, a substrate <b>10</b>, such as a silicon substrate, is provided, on which an active area (AA) and a shallow trench isolation (STI) surrounding the active area are formed. The active area AA comprises the same material as the silicon substrate, and the shallow trench isolation STI comprises an insulating layer (such as silicon oxide). Then, a gate structure <b>12</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, with spacers <b>13</b> beside the gate structure <b>12</b>, and the active areas AA on both sides of the gate structure <b>12</b> are defined as a source region <b>14</b> and a drain region <b>16</b>, respectively. The gate structure described here is not limited to polysilicon gate or metal gate, and the spacer <b>13</b> is an insulating material such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride. Until this step, it is similar to the structure described in the prior art (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), in which the substrate <b>10</b>, the active area AA, the shallow trench isolation STI, the gate structure <b>12</b>, the source region <b>14</b>, the drain region <b>16</b> and other components described here belong to the conventional technology in this field, and are not described in detail here.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Here, the overlapping range between the gate structure <b>12</b> and the active area AA is defined as an overlapping region OR, and the overlapping region OR includes four corners (corner A, corner B, corner C and corner D). As mentioned in the prior art paragraph, if salicide layer is directly and completely formed on the source region <b>14</b> and the drain region <b>16</b>, salicide layer will also be formed at the corners (corners A to D) where the gate structure <b>12</b> overlaps with the active area AA. According to the applicant's observation, the salicide layer located at corner A-D is easy to generate leakage current. However, if the salicide layer is not formed on the source region <b>14</b> and the drain region <b>16</b>, the Ohmic resistance cannot be reduced. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention that no salicide layer is formed at the corners (corners A to D) where the gate structure <b>12</b> overlaps with the active area AA, but salicide layer is still formed on the surfaces of the rest of the source region <b>14</b>/the drain region <b>16</b>. In order to achieve the above purpose, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, after the source region <b>14</b> and the drain region <b>16</b> are formed, a salicide block (SAB)<b>19</b> is formed to cover at least the corners A to D. Then, a salicide process is performed to form a salicide layer <b>20</b> in the region except the salicide block <b>19</b>. The salicide process mentioned above comprises forming a metal layer (such as cobalt, titanium, or nickel, etc.) and performing a heating step (RTP). The above salicide step belongs to the conventional technology in the field, and is not described in detail here.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is worth noting that in the present invention, the salicide block <b>19</b> is designed to cover at least the corners A to D of the overlapping region OR. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the formed salicide block <b>19</b> has four patterns separated from each other, each of which is a rectangular pattern, covering one of the corners A to D respectively. In addition, in this embodiment, the total area of salicide block <b>19</b> is less than 1/10 of the total area of source region <b>14</b> and drain region <b>16</b>, but it is not limited to this. Besides, the salicide block formed in the present invention can be formed together with other salicide block processes (for example, in the original process, salicide block was formed on devices such as resistors and I/O regions), so the salicide block formed in the present invention does not use additional steps.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Then, a salicide process is performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the salicide layer <b>20</b> is formed on the source region <b>14</b> and the drain region <b>16</b>, but it is not formed at the corner A-D. Then, a contact structure <b>22</b> is formed on the salicide layer <b>20</b>. The salicide layer <b>20</b> in this embodiment can reduce the interface resistance between the source region <b>14</b>/the drain region <b>16</b> and the contact structure <b>22</b>, but it is not located at the corner A-D, so the probability of leakage current caused by salicide being located at the corner can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, it is worth noting that although the salicide layer <b>20</b> in this embodiment does not cover the corners A-D, it will be located beside the long sides of the gate structure <b>12</b>, that is, adjacent to the two long sides of the overlapping region OR. In other words, the salicide layer <b>20</b> in this embodiment directly contacts the spacer <b>13</b> on both sides of the middle part of the gate structure <b>12</b>. According to the observation results of the applicant, when the salicide layer <b>20</b> is adjacent to the long sides of the gate structure <b>12</b>, the control effect of the gate structure on electrical properties is better.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other embodiments of the present invention, the shape of the salicide block <b>19</b> can be changed, so that salicide layer <b>20</b> with different shapes can be produced. The following paragraphs will illustrate different shapes of salicide layer in different embodiments of the present invention. To simplify the description, the following description will detail the dissimilarities among the different embodiments and the identical features will not be redundantly described. In order to compare the differences between the embodiments easily, the identical components in each of the following embodiments are marked with identical symbols.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a salicide block <b>19</b>A has a different shape from the salicide block <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Furthermore, the salicide block <b>19</b>A in this embodiment includes two patterns separated from each other, one pattern covering two corners (such as corner A and corner B) of the overlapping region OR, and the other pattern covering the other two corners (such as corner C and corner D) of the overlapping region OR, the two patterns are rectangular shape patterns, but not limited to this. In this embodiment, the shape of the salicide block is changed, so the shape of the salicide layer formed later will also be changed. However, it can be understood that the salicide layer in this embodiment still does not cover the corner A-D, thus reducing the probability of leakage current.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a salicide block <b>19</b>B has a different shape from the salicide block <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Furthermore, in this embodiment, salicide block <b>19</b>B includes a frame shape pattern covering the four corners of the overlapping region, but it is not limited to this. In this embodiment, the shape of the salicide block is changed, so the shape of the salicide layer formed later will also be changed.
