id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention pertains in general to the field of cardiac valve replacement and repair. More particularly the invention relates to an annuloplasty system for delivery of an annuloplasty device to a cardiac valve.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Diseased mitral and tricuspid valves frequently need replacement or repair. The mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets or supporting chordae may degenerate and weaken or the annulus may dilate leading to valve leak. Mitral and tricuspid valve replacement and repair are frequently performed with aid of an annuloplasty device, such as an annuloplasty ring, to reduce the diameter of the annulus, or modify the geometry of the annulus in any other way, or aid as a generally supporting structure during the valve replacement or repair procedure. Such annuloplasty devices are implanted into position by various delivery devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A problem with prior art devices are less-than-optimal engagement and deployment mechanisms between the annuloplasty device and the delivery device which does not provide sufficient reliability during the positioning phase and during deployment to get the annuloplasty device in the final secured position, which may lead to a more complicated and time consuming procedure. Previous devices thus require exact, i.e. time consuming, navigation and manipulation to minimize the risk of sub-optimal fixation of the annuloplasty device. During heart surgery, a premium is placed on reducing the amount of time used to replace and repair valves as the heart is frequently arrested and without perfusion. The above problems may have dire consequences for the patient and the health care system. Patient risk is increased. A problem with prior art devices seeking to improve upon the mentioned disadvantages is increased complexity of the deployment mechanisms between the annuloplasty device and the delivery device. This leads to less cost-effectiveness, and/or lack of a compact cross-sectional profile which typically has a negative impact on the steerability of the annuloplasty device and an overall more cumbersome navigation of the annuloplasty device to its final position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, an improved annuloplasty system for delivery and implantation of an annuloplasty device at a cardiac valve would be advantageous and in particular allowing for avoiding more of the above mentioned problems and compromises, and in particular allowing for a more secure implantation procedure and reducing the time of lengthy surgery procedures, and increased patient safety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, examples of the present invention preferably seek to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more deficiencies, disadvantages or issues in the art, such as the above-identified, singly or in any combination by providing a device according to the appended patent claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect a system for annuloplasty is provided comprising an annuloplasty device comprising first and second support rings having a coiled configuration in which the first and second support rings are arranged as a coil around a central axis, wherein the first and second support rings are configured to be arranged on opposite sides of native heart valve leaflets of a heart valve, a line attached to the first and/or second support ring, and a heating element configured to be heated upon receiving a supply of energy, wherein the heating element is positionable to heat and sever the line upon the heating element receiving said energy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a second aspect a method for delivering an annuloplasty device is provided comprising positioning first and second support rings of the annuloplasty device on opposite sides of native heart valve leaflets of a heart valve, positioning a heating element adjacent a line attached to the first and/or second support ring, supplying energy to the heating element to heat and sever the line, and withdrawing the heating element from the heart valve.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further examples of the invention are defined in the dependent claims, wherein features for the second and subsequent aspects of the disclosure are as for the first aspect mutatis mutandis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some examples of the disclosure provide for implanting an annuloplasty device more securely.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some examples of the disclosure provide for an annuloplasty device which is easier to reposition during an implantation procedure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some examples of the disclosure provide for a less time consuming deployment and positioning of an annuloplasty device at a cardiac valve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some examples of the disclosure provide for a less cumbersome detachment of an annuloplasty device to a delivery device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some examples of the disclosure provide for increased accuracy in positioning an annuloplasty device at the annulus of a cardiac valve and thereby reducing the risk of complications.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some examples of the disclosure provide for a reduced risk of damaging the cardiac valve during a repair or replacement procedure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some examples of the disclosure provide for increased steerability or maneuverability of the annuloplasty device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be emphasized that the term &#x201c;comprises/comprising&#x201d;

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the examples set forth herein; rather, these examples are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The terminology used in the detailed description of the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings is not intended to be limiting of the invention. In the drawings, like numbers refer to like elements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The following description focuses on examples applicable to cardiac valve devices such as annuloplasty rings. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this application but may be applied to many other annuloplasty implants and cardiac valve implants including for example replacement valves, and other medical implantable devices.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example of an annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; comprising a first support ring <b>101</b> and second support ring <b>102</b> which are adapted to be arranged as a coil, i.e. in a helix-shape, in a coiled configuration around a central axis <b>103</b>. The annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; is arranged in the coiled configuration at least when in a relaxed state of the material from which the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; is formed, i.e. free from outside forces acting upon the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;. The first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, are configured to be arranged on opposite sides of native heart valve leaflets <b>301</b> of a heart valve, as illustrated in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the first support ring <b>101</b> may be arranged on an atrial side of the heart valve, around the annulus of the valve, and the second support ring <b>102</b> may be arranged on a ventricular side. The first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, are connected to form a coil- or helix shaped ring. The coil extends through the valve opening at a commissure thereof. The first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, may thus assume the coiled configuration also when in an implanted state. The annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; may comprise a shape-memory material, so that the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; re-assumes the coiled configuration after having been delivered from a delivery device (not shown), such as a delivery catheter, to the target site, after having been temporarily restrained in an elongated configuration inside such catheter. The annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;, i.e. annuloplasty implant <b>100</b>&#x2032;, may comprise a shape memory material, such as NiTiNol, or another suitable biocompatible alloy that can be heat-set in defined shapes, i.e. in a defined relaxed shape in absence of outside acting forces, such as in a coiled configuration, in a heat treatment procedure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref> show examples of a system <b>100</b> for annuloplasty, i.e. for delivery of an annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;, such as an annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; described above. The system <b>100</b> thus comprises an annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; comprises first <b>101</b> and second <b>102</b> support rings having a coiled configuration in which the first and second support rings are arranged as a coil around a central axis <b>103</b>. The first and second support rings are configured to be arranged on opposite sides of native heart valve leaflets <b>301</b> of a heart valve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref> show only part of the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;, i.e. by showing a part of the first or second support ring <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, for a clearer presentation in the figures. The system <b>100</b> comprises a line <b>104</b> attached to the first and/or second support ring <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. The line may <b>104</b> may be a suture, wire, or any other essentially flexible and elongated element sized to be arranged in, and/or connect to, a delivery device <b>109</b>, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The system <b>100</b> further comprises a heating element <b>105</b> configured to be heated upon receiving a supply of energy, such as a current supply or a magnetic field for inducing a current in the heating element <b>105</b>, as discussed further below. The heating element <b>105</b> is positionable to heat and sever the line <b>104</b> upon the heating element <b>105</b> receiving said energy. The heating element <b>105</b> may be moved into position, where the line <b>104</b> is to be cut, by a delivery device <b>109</b> as discussed in relation to e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and or by any other control element, such as a control wire <b>108</b>, <b>108</b>&#x2032;, as discussed in relation to e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Thus, the heating element <b>105</b> can be position in contact with the line <b>104</b>, or in sufficiently close proximity with the line <b>104</b> to heat and melt the material from which the line <b>104</b> is formed, thereby severing the line <b>104</b>. The first and second support ring <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, is thereby released from the line <b>104</b> and may be fixed to the cardiac valve. This provides for an effective and robust release mechanism for the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032;. The implantation procedure may thus be completed in a less amount of time, while maintaining an advantageous safety mechanism by having a connection to the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; with a line <b>104</b> as long as possible. E.g. repositioning is facilitated by manipulation of the line <b>104</b>. The position of the first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, at the cardiac valve may be changed by e.g. pulling of the line <b>104</b>, to optimize the respective positions on the ventricular and atrial side. The line <b>104</b> also provides for fully withdrawing the first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, from the implantation site in case of complications. A more secure implantation of the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; is thus provided. Having a heating element <b>105</b> to heat and sever the line <b>104</b> for releasing the annuloplasty device <b>100</b>&#x2032; provides also for a less complex delivery mechanism and a minimized cross-section of the annuloplasty system <b>100</b> in a radial direction <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), i.e. in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction <b>117</b> in which the first and second support rings <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, generally extend. The compact cross-section facilitates integration with existing delivery devices, and the procedure may be completed with less components and with fewer steps.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The heating element <b>105</b> may comprise a resistor, also denoted with reference numeral <b>105</b> in e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, being configured to receive the energy as electrical energy for heating of the resistor. The resistor <b>105</b> may receive an electrical current via a conductor <b>112</b>, as schematically shown in e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This provides for an efficient heating of the line <b>104</b>, for melting and cutting the line <b>104</b> in a short amount of time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another example, the heating element <b>105</b> may comprise an electrically conductive material, and the heating element <b>105</b> may receive energy from a fluctuating magnetic field. The electrically conductive material may thus be arranged so that the magnetic field induces a current in the heating element <b>105</b> to heat the heating element <b>105</b>. Such inductive heating of the heating element <b>105</b> may be advantageous in some applications. This may in some examples provide for a facilitated positioning of the heating element <b>105</b> at the desired position relative the line <b>104</b>. The aforementioned conductor <b>112</b> may be dispensed with in such case. Thus, eventhough the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, indicate having a conductor <b>112</b> coupled to the heating element <b>105</b>, it is conceivable that the heating element <b>105</b> may be heated by inductive heating in these examples.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The annuloplasty system <b>100</b> may comprise an inductor <b>106</b> arranged to induce said current in the heating element <b>105</b>. The inductor <b>106</b> may thus be supplied by an alternating current which produces a varying magnetic field of a magnetizable core material of the inductor <b>106</b>. The inductor <b>106</b> is positionable adjacent the heating element <b>105</b> so that currents are generated by the varying magnetic field in the conductive material of the heating element <b>105</b>. The currents flowing through the resistance of the conductive material heats the heating element <b>105</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic illustration showing an inductor <b>106</b> positioned adjacent the heating element <b>105</b>. The inductor <b>106</b> may have varying shapes such as round or oval as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a</i></figref>. The line <b>104</b> may pass through the inductor <b>106</b>, as further exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>show another example where the inductor <b>106</b> is elongated and cylindrically shaped, and positioned at the side of the line <b>104</b> and adjacent the heating element <b>105</b>.
