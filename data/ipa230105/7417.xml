authentication, and voice authentication have been known as personal authentication technologies (referred to as biometric authentication technologies) based on individual characteristics of living bodies. Among the personal authentication technologies, particularly in-ear acoustic authentication pays attention to individual characteristics of internal structures of human ear holes. In the in-ear acoustic authentication, an inspection signal is input to an ear hole of an individual to be authenticated, and personal authentication is performed using an echo signal based on an echo sound from the ear hole.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The individual (person to be authenticated) to be subjected to the personal authentication wears a device (referred to as an earphone device or a hearable device) having an earphone shape incorporating an in speaker and a microphone on the auricle. The speaker of the earphone device transmits the inspection signal (sound wave) toward the inside of the ear hole of the person to be authenticated. The microphone of the earphone device collects echo sound from the ear hole. Then, an echo signal based on the echo sound is transmitted from the earphone device to a personal authentication device. The personal authentication device performs personal authentication by collating the echo signal received from the earphone device with echo signals of one or a plurality of individuals registered in advance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The in-ear acoustic authentication technology has advantages that personal authentication is completed instantaneously and stably, that personal authentication can be immediately performed in a state where an individual wears the earphone device (hands-free) even when the individual is moving or working, and that confidentiality regarding an internal structure of a human ear hole is high.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">[PTL 1] WO 2017/069118 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">[PTL 2] WO 2013/172039 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">[PTL 3] JP 2005-535017 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">[NPL 1] &#x201c;PATTERN RECOGNITION AND MACHINE LEARNING&#x201d; (CHRISTOPHER M.

An auricle model is placed on the ear model <b>20</b>. The auricle model is manufactured to match a shape of the earphone device <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, the auricle model is manufactured by taking a mold of an auricle of an individual and pouring a material such as silicone rubber of a fluid into the mold.
