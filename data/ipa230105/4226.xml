For example, some existing techniques use a complex and time-consuming user interface, which may include multiple key presses or keystrokes. Existing techniques require more time than necessary, wasting user time and device energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the present technique provides electronic devices with faster, more efficient methods and interfaces for managing content-based tactile outputs. Such methods and interfaces optionally complement or replace other methods for managing content-based tactile outputs. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For example, such methods and interfaces enhance user experience and convenience in navigating content shown on a device, and thus enable the user to more easily and efficiently navigate content shown on the device. For battery-operated computing devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with some embodiments, a method performed at an electronic device with a display, an input element, and one or more tactile output generators is described.

In some embodiments, the device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone&#xae;, iPod Touch&#xae;, and iPad&#xae; devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Other portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touchpads), are, optionally, used.

It should be understood, however, that the electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface.

In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch-sensitive displays. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device <b>100</b> with touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> is sometimes called a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d; for convenience and is sometimes known as or called a &#x201c;touch-sensitive display system.&#x201d; Device <b>100</b> includes memory <b>102</b> (which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory controller <b>122</b>, one or more processing units (CPUs) <b>120</b>, peripherals interface <b>118</b>, RF circuitry <b>108</b>, audio circuitry <b>110</b>, speaker <b>111</b>, microphone <b>113</b>, input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>106</b>, other input control devices <b>116</b>, and external port <b>124</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more optical sensors <b>164</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more contact intensity sensors <b>165</b> for detecting intensity of contacts on device <b>100</b> (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b>). Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more tactile output generators <b>167</b> for generating tactile outputs on device <b>100</b> (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b> or touchpad <b>355</b> of device <b>300</b>). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure, and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch-sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;tactile output&#x201d; refers to physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an &#x201c;up click,&#x201d; a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; &#x201c;roughness&#x201d;), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or average) user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be appreciated that device <b>100</b> is only one example of a portable multifunction device, and that device <b>100</b> optionally has more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the components.

Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits information it receives from I/O subsystem <b>106</b> or a sensor, such as proximity sensor <b>166</b>, accelerometer(s) <b>168</b>, and/or microphone <b>113</b> (through audio circuitry <b>110</b>).

In other embodiments, peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits event information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0144">In some embodiments, event sorter <b>170</b> also includes a hit view determination module <b>172</b> and/or an active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0145">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> provides software procedures for determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can see on the display.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0146">Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0147">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> receives information related to sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit view determination module <b>172</b> identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module <b>172</b>, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0148">Active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines which view or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that all views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0149">Event dispatcher module <b>174</b> dispatches the event information to an event recognizer (e.g., event recognizer <b>180</b>). In embodiments including active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>, event dispatcher module <b>174</b> delivers the event information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>.

Event definitions <b>186</b> contain definitions of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>), event 2 (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (<b>187</b>) include, for example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition for event 1 (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event handlers <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0155">In some embodiments, event definition <b>187</b> includes a definition of an event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler <b>190</b>, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler <b>190</b> should be activated. For example, event comparator <b>184</b> selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0156">In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (<b>187</b>) also includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event type.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0157">When a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> determines that the series of sub-events do not match any of the events in event definitions <b>186</b>, the respective event recognizer <b>180</b> enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0158">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> includes metadata <b>183</b> with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0159">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> activates event handler <b>190</b> associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> delivers event information associated with the event to event handler <b>190</b>. Activating an event handler <b>190</b> is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler <b>190</b> associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0160">In some embodiments, event delivery instructions <b>188</b> include sub-event delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0161">In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b> creates and updates data used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, data updater <b>176</b> updates the telephone number used in contacts module <b>137</b>, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some embodiments, object updater <b>177</b> creates and updates objects used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, object updater <b>177</b> creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI updater <b>178</b> updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater <b>178</b> prepares display information and sends it to graphics module <b>132</b> for display on a touch-sensitive display.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0162">In some embodiments, event handler(s) <b>190</b> includes or has access to data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b>. In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b> are included in a single module of a respective application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> or application view <b>191</b>. In other embodiments, they are included in two or more software modules.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0163">It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate multifunction devices <b>100</b> with input devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc. on touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a portable multifunction device <b>100</b> having a touch screen <b>112</b> in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more graphics within user interface (UI) <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for example, with one or more fingers <b>202</b> (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more styluses <b>203</b> (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes (from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device <b>100</b>. In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select the graphic.

In some implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad <b>355</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or touch-sensitive surface <b>451</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) while the cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or touch screen <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) that enables direct interaction with user interface elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch screen acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface elements shown on a display of the device).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0205">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;characteristic intensity&#x201d; of a contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact. In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact, prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally, based on one or more of: a maximum value of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more intensity thresholds optionally includes a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold. In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the second threshold results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo performing the respective operation), rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation or a second operation.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0206">In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface optionally receives a continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity of the contact at the end location is, optionally, based on only a portion of the continuous swipe contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm is, optionally, applied to the intensities of the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding-average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0207">The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, characterized relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection intensity threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a focus selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface without performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the deep press intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds are consistent between different sets of user interface figures.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0208">An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;light press&#x201d; input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;deep press&#x201d; input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is greater than zero.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0209">In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., a &#x201c;down stroke&#x201d; of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input threshold (e.g., an &#x201c;up stroke&#x201d; of the respective press input).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0210">In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid accidental inputs sometimes termed &#x201c;jitter,&#x201d; where the device defines or selects a hysteresis intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90%, or some reasonable proportion of the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an &#x201c;up stroke&#x201d; of the respective press input). Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending on the circumstances).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0211">For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0212">Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces (&#x201c;UI&#x201d;) and associated processes that are implemented on an electronic device, such as portable multifunction device <b>100</b>, device <b>300</b>, or device <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>AF</figref> illustrate exemplary user interfaces associated with content-based tactile outputs, in accordance with some embodiments.

The one or more tactile output generators generate different types of tactile output sequences, as described below in Table 1, based on the type of content (e.g., continuous content, such as continuous text, or discrete content, such as platters, affordances, buttons) being displayed and navigated/scrolled/adjusted on display <b>602</b> of the device.

For example, a tactile output pattern specifies characteristics of a tactile output, such as the amplitude of the tactile output, the shape of a movement waveform of the tactile output, the frequency of the tactile output, and/or the duration of the tactile output. When tactile outputs with different tactile output patterns are generated by a device (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that move a moveable mass to generate tactile outputs), the tactile outputs may invoke different haptic sensations in a user holding or touching the device. While the sensation of the user is based on the user's perception of the tactile output, most users will be able to identify changes in waveform, frequency, and amplitude of tactile outputs generated by the device.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0217">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>E</figref> provide a set of sample tactile output patterns that may be used, either individually or in combination, either as is or through one or more transformations (e.g., modulation, amplification, truncation, etc.), to create suitable haptic feedback in various scenarios and for various purposes, such as those mentioned above and those described with respect to the user interfaces and methods discussed herein. This example of a palette of tactile outputs shows how a set of three waveforms and eight frequencies can be used to produce an array of tactile output patterns. In addition to the tactile output patterns shown in these figures, each of these tactile output patterns is optionally adjusted in amplitude by changing a gain value for the tactile output pattern, as shown, for example for FullTap 80 Hz, FullTap 200 Hz, MiniTap 80 Hz, MiniTap 200 Hz, MicroTap 80 Hz, and MicroTap 200 Hz in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>F-<b>5</b>H</figref>, which are each shown with variants having a gain of 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>F-<b>5</b>H</figref>, changing the gain of a tactile output pattern changes the amplitude of the pattern without changing the frequency of the pattern or changing the shape of the waveform. In some embodiments, changing the frequency of a tactile output pattern also results in a lower amplitude as some tactile output generators are limited by how much force can be applied to the moveable mass and thus higher frequency movements of the mass are constrained to lower amplitudes to ensure that the acceleration needed to create the waveform does not require force outside of an operational force range of the tactile output generator (e.g., the peak amplitudes of the FullTap at 230 Hz, 270 Hz, and 300 Hz are lower than the amplitudes of the FullTap at 80 Hz, 100 Hz, 125 Hz, and 200 Hz).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>H</figref> show tactile output patterns that have a particular waveform. The waveform of a tactile output pattern represents the pattern of physical displacements relative to a neutral position (e.g., Xzero) versus time that a moveable mass goes through to generate a tactile output with that tactile output pattern. For example, a first set of tactile output patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> (e.g., tactile output patterns of a &#x201c;FullTap&#x201d;) each have a waveform that includes an oscillation with two complete cycles (e.g., an oscillation that starts and ends in a neutral position and crosses the neutral position three times). A second set of tactile output patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> (e.g., tactile output patterns of a &#x201c;MiniTap&#x201d;) each have a waveform that includes an oscillation that includes one complete cycle (e.g., an oscillation that starts and ends in a neutral position and crosses the neutral position one time). A third set of tactile output patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> (e.g., tactile output patterns of a &#x201c;MicroTap&#x201d;) each have a waveform that includes an oscillation that include one half of a complete cycle (e.g., an oscillation that starts and ends in a neutral position and does not cross the neutral position). The waveform of a tactile output pattern also includes a start buffer and an end buffer that represent the gradual speeding up and slowing down of the moveable mass at the start and at the end of the tactile output. The example waveforms shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>H</figref> include Xmin and Xmax values which represent the maximum and minimum extent of movement of the moveable mass. For larger electronic devices with larger moveable masses, there may be larger or smaller minimum and maximum extents of movement of the mass. The examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>H</figref> describe movement of a mass in one dimension, however similar principles would also apply to movement of a moveable mass in two or three dimensions.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0219">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>E</figref>, each tactile output pattern also has a corresponding characteristic frequency that affects the &#x201c;pitch&#x201d; of a haptic sensation that is felt by a user from a tactile output with that characteristic frequency. For a continuous tactile output, the characteristic frequency represents the number of cycles that are completed within a given period of time (e.g., cycles per second) by the moveable mass of the tactile output generator. For a discrete tactile output, a discrete output signal (e.g., with 0.5, 1, or 2 cycles) is generated, and the characteristic frequency value specifies how fast the moveable mass needs to move to generate a tactile output with that characteristic frequency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>H</figref>, for each type of tactile output (e.g., as defined by a respective waveform, such as FullTap, MiniTap, or MicroTap), a higher frequency value corresponds to faster movement(s) by the moveable mass, and hence, in general, a shorter time to complete the tactile output (e.g., including the time to complete the required number of cycle(s) for the discrete tactile output, plus a start and an end buffer time). For example, a FullTap with a characteristic frequency of 80 Hz takes longer to complete than FullTap with a characteristic frequency of 100 Hz (e.g., 35.4 ms vs. 28.3 ms in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). In addition, for a given frequency, a tactile output with more cycles in its waveform at a respective frequency takes longer to complete than a tactile output with fewer cycles its waveform at the same respective frequency. For example, a FullTap at 150 Hz takes longer to complete than a MiniTap at 150 Hz (e.g., 19.4 ms vs. 12.8 ms), and a MiniTap at 150 Hz takes longer to complete than a MicroTap at 150 Hz (e.g., 12.8 ms vs. 9.4 ms). However, for tactile output patterns with different frequencies this rule may not apply (e.g., tactile outputs with more cycles but a higher frequency may take a shorter amount of time to complete than tactile outputs with fewer cycles but a lower frequency, and vice versa). For example, at 300 Hz, a FullTap takes as long as a MiniTap (e.g., 9.9 ms).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0220">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>E</figref>, a tactile output pattern also has a characteristic amplitude that affects the amount of energy that is contained in a tactile signal, or a &#x201c;strength&#x201d; of a haptic sensation that may be felt by a user through a tactile output with that characteristic amplitude. In some embodiments, the characteristic amplitude of a tactile output pattern refers to an absolute or normalized value that represents the maximum displacement of the moveable mass from a neutral position when generating the tactile output. In some embodiments, the characteristic amplitude of a tactile output pattern is adjustable, e.g., by a fixed or dynamically determined gain factor (e.g., a value between 0 and 1), in accordance with various conditions (e.g., customized based on user interface contexts and behaviors) and/or preconfigured metrics (e.g., input-based metrics, and/or user-interface-based metrics). In some embodiments, an input-based metric (e.g., an intensity-change metric or an input-speed metric) measures a characteristic of an input (e.g., a rate of change of a characteristic intensity of a contact in a press input or a rate of movement of the contact across a touch-sensitive surface) during the input that triggers generation of a tactile output. In some embodiments, a user-interface-based metric (e.g., a speed-across-boundary metric) measures a characteristic of a user interface element (e.g., a speed of movement of the element across a hidden or visible boundary in a user interface) during the user interface change that triggers generation of the tactile output. In some embodiments, the characteristic amplitude of a tactile output pattern may be modulated by an &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; and the peaks of adjacent cycles may have different amplitudes, where one of the waveforms shown above is further modified by multiplication by an envelope parameter that changes over time (e.g., from <b>0</b> to <b>1</b>) to gradually adjust amplitude of portions of the tactile output over time as the tactile output is being generated.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0221">Although specific frequencies, amplitudes, and waveforms are represented in the sample tactile output patterns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>E</figref> for illustrative purposes, tactile output patterns with other frequencies, amplitudes, and waveforms may be used for similar purposes. For example, waveforms that have between 0.5 to 4 cycles can be used. Other frequencies in the range of 60 Hz-400 Hz may be used as well.

The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user for managing and navigating user interfaces, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface.

In some embodiments, a platter is a predefined unit of a user interface that is a visually discrete and selectable user interface object, item, or element that is separate in functionality and/or purpose from other platters within the user interface, and is visually distinct and/or distinguishable from other platters and other user interface objects, items, or elements within the user interface.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0260">While displaying the user interface (e.g., <b>608</b>, <b>616</b>), the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>704</b>), via the input element (e.g., <b>604</b>), a first input (e.g., <b>601</b>, <b>605</b>, a rotational input on the input element, where the rotational input is in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction).</p><p id="p-0222" num="0261">In response to detecting (<b>706</b>) the first input (e.g., <b>601</b>, <b>605</b>), the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) navigates (<b>708</b>) through (e.g., scrolls through) the user interface (e.g., <b>608</b>, <b>616</b>).

When tactile outputs with different tactile output patterns are generated by a device (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that move a moveable mass to generate tactile outputs), the tactile outputs may invoke different haptic sensations in a user holding or touching the device.

Detecting a rotational input via an input element (e.g., a rotatable input element) enhances usability and user efficiency of the device by enabling a user to quickly, easily, and intuitively navigate/scroll through displayed content. This is in turn enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0305">In response to detecting (<b>906</b>) the first input (e.g., <b>801</b>, <b>803</b>), the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) navigates (<b>908</b>) through the content (e.g., <b>804</b>) (e.g., scrolling through the content) to display a second portion of the content (e.g., a different portion of the content that was previously not displayed).

In some embodiments, the terminal portion of the content is a beginning portion (e.g., top portion, a top-edge portion) of the content or an end portion (e.g., a bottom portion, a bottom-edge portion) of the content. Displaying a visual indication that the content is a terminal portion of the content improves visual feedback by providing an intuitive visual effect that enables a user to quickly and easily recognize that an end of the content has been reached while the user interface can still be moved. Providing improved visual feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0308">In some embodiments, displaying the visual indication (e.g., the rubberbanding effect) that the content is a terminal portion of the content includes displaying a visual effect that changes as the input (e.g., <b>803</b>) continues such as displaying an area (e.g., a background) beyond the terminus of the visual content, displaying a graphical element that increases or decreases in size, opacity or brightness as the input continues to be detected after reaching at terminus of the content, or continuing to move the content on the display (e.g., <b>602</b>) in a respective direction but decreasing the amount by which a unit of movement of the input moves the content in the respective direction as the input continues. Displaying a visual effect that changes as the input continues, such as displaying an area (e.g., a background) beyond the terminus of the visual content improves visual feedback by providing an intuitive visual effect that enables a user to quickly and easily recognize that an end of the content has been reached while the user interface can still be moved.

In some embodiments, after shifting the second portion of the content, the content is subsequently shifted back to its initial position on the display. Displaying a shifting of the content and then a subsequent bounce-back of the content improves visual feedback by providing an intuitive visual effect that enables a user to quickly and easily recognize that an end of the content has been reached while the user interface can still be moved.

In some embodiments, a particular type of tactile output corresponds to a particular tactile output pattern. For example, as described in greater detail above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C-<b>5</b>H</figref> and in Table 1, a tactile output pattern specifies characteristics of a tactile output, such as the amplitude of the tactile output, the shape of a movement waveform of the tactile output, the frequency of the tactile output, and/or the duration of the tactile output. When tactile outputs with different tactile output patterns are generated by a device (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that move a moveable mass to generate tactile outputs), the tactile outputs may invoke different haptic sensations in a user holding or touching the device. While the sensation of the user is based on the user's perception of the tactile output, most users will be able to identify changes in waveform, frequency, and amplitude of tactile outputs generated by the device.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0313">In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>914</b>) the second input (e.g., <b>803</b>, a rotational input on the input element (e.g., <b>604</b>), a rotational input in a particular direction, such as the clockwise direction or a counter-clockwise direction) and in accordance with the determination that the second portion of the content is a terminal portion (e.g., a beginning or end portion, a border portion, an edge portion) of the content, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) generates (<b>934</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, a third type of tactile output sequence (e.g., different from the first type of tactile output sequence, a reduced-amplitude version first type of tactile output sequence). Generating the tactile output sequence upon first reaching an end of the content improves sensory feedback and user efficiency by enabling the user to quickly and easily recognize, while providing a rotational input on an input element, that the end of the content has been reached. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0314">In some embodiments, subsequent to detecting the second input (e.g., <b>803</b>) and while displaying the second portion of the content, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>936</b>), via the input element, a third input (e.g., a rotational input on the input element), where the second input (e.g., a rotational input) is in a first direction (e.g., a clockwise direction or a counter-clockwise direction) and the third input is in a direction opposite of that of the second input. In some embodiments, in response to detecting the third input, the electronic device forgoes generating (<b>938</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, the third type of tactile output sequence (e.g., <b>630</b>, and instead generating, via the one or more tactile output generators, the first type of tactile output sequence). Forgoing generating the tactile output upon reaching the end of the content a second time (e.g., after a bounce-back from a rubberbanding effect) improves the operability and user convenience of the device by forgoing generating unnecessary feedback, which in turn makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0315">In some embodiments, the third type of tactile output sequence (e.g., <b>630</b>) corresponds to (e.g., has the same types/pattern of tactile outputs as) the first type of tactile output sequence, the first type of tactile output sequence is associated with a first type of audio output sequence, and the third type of tactile output sequence is associated with a second type of audio output sequence different from (e.g., different in types and/or pattern) the first type of audio output sequence. In some embodiments, similar to a tactile output, a particular type of audio output corresponds to a particular type of audio output pattern. For example, an audio output pattern specifies characteristics of an audio output, such as the magnitude/amplitude/volume of the audio output, the shape of a sound waveform of the audio output, the frequency of the audio output, and/or the duration of the audio output. When audio outputs with different audio output patterns are generated by a device (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that move a moveable mass to generate audio outputs, via one or more speakers), the audio outputs may invoke different audio-related sensations in a user holding or touching the device or proximate to the device.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0316">In some embodiments, subsequent to detecting the second input (e.g., <b>803</b>) and while displaying the second portion of the content, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>926</b>), via the input element (e.g., <b>604</b>), a third input (e.g., a third rotation of the input element), where the third input is in a direction opposite of the second input. In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>928</b>) the third input, the electronic device navigates back (<b>930</b>) (e.g., navigating in the opposite direction from the navigation caused by the first input) through the content to display the first portion of the content. In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>928</b>) the third input, the electronic device generates (<b>932</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, the first type of tactile output sequence (e.g., a textural tactile output sequence that is based on an input metric of the input).</p><p id="p-0278" num="0317">In some embodiments, while displaying the second portion of the content, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>940</b>), on the display (e.g., <b>602</b>, via a touch-sensitive surface of the display), a fourth input (e.g., a touch-based scrolling input on a touch-sensitive surface of the display and not on the input element). In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>942</b>) the scrolling input and in accordance with the determination that the second portion of the content is a terminal portion (e.g., a beginning or end portion, a border portion, an edge portion) of the content, the electronic device displays (<b>944</b>) the visual indication that the content is a terminal portion of the content. In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>942</b>) the scrolling input and in accordance with the determination that the second portion of the content is a terminal portion (e.g., a beginning or end portion, a border portion, an edge portion) of the content, the electronic device forgoes generating (<b>946</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, the first type of tactile output sequence and, optionally, forgoing any tactile output/tactile output sequence associated with navigating through the content.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0318">In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>920</b>) the second input (e.g., <b>803</b>) and in accordance with a determination that the second portion of the content is not a terminal portion (e.g., a beginning or end portion, a border portion, an edge portion) of the content, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) displays (<b>922</b>), on the display (e.g., <b>602</b>), a third portion of the content (e.g., navigating through the content to display a portion of the content adjacent to/continuous with the second portion of the content). In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>920</b>) the second input and in accordance with a determination that the second portion of the content is not a terminal portion (e.g., a beginning or end portion, a border portion, an edge portion) of the content, the electronic device generates (<b>924</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, the first type of tactile output sequence (e.g., a textural tactile output sequence that is based on an input metric of the input). Generating a different type of tactile output for navigating/scrolling through content and for reaching an end of the content improves feedback by enabling the user to quickly and easily recognize that whether the displayed content is being scrolled and can be further scrolled. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0319">Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method <b>900</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described above and below. For example, method <b>700</b> optionally includes one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with reference to method <b>900</b>. For example, one or more tactile output sequences, as described in method <b>700</b> are provided while scrolling content in response to a rotational input on an input element and upon reaching the end of the content.

Setting a higher threshold for moving the user interface object to the respective position on the display for one type of input (e.g., a touch input) over a different type of input (e.g., a rotational input on the input element) helps to prevent a user from accidently moving the user interface object to the respective position on the display against the user's intention when one type of input (e.g., a touch input) is more prone to accidental inputs than the different type of input (e.g., the rotational input). Providing additional control options and reducing the number of inputs needed to perform an operation enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0347">In some embodiments, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) includes a (e.g., single) tactile output generator (e.g., wherein the tactile output generator is located in and is connected to (e.g., and configured to generate tactile outputs to) the rotatable input element (e.g., <b>604</b>) and a housing of the electronic device).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0348">In some embodiments, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) includes one or more tactile output generators that generate localized tactile outputs directed to the rotatable input element (e.g., <b>604</b>) and one or more separate tactile output generators that generate tactile outputs for the electronic device that are not specifically directed to the rotatable input element (e.g., and instead is located in and is connected to (e.g., and configured to generate tactile outputs to) a main housing of the electronic device or generate tactile outputs that are localized to a different component of the electronic device). In some embodiments, the tactile output generator located in or near the rotatable input element, and is configured to generate tactile outputs that move the rotatable input element relative to the housing (e.g., by moving the shaft of the rotatable input element).</p><p id="p-0310" num="0349">In some embodiments, the one or more tactile output generators are configured to (e.g., in addition to generating tactile outputs) generate audio outputs (e.g., wherein the audio outputs correspond to and/or are associated with tactile outputs generated by the one or more tactile output generators and are generated in a coordinated manner with the tactile outputs to generate combined audio/tactile outputs).</p><p id="p-0311" num="0350">In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>1110</b>) the second portion of the input (e.g., an end of the input or movement of the user interface object beyond a threshold amount), in accordance with the determination that the input (e.g., <b>1003</b>) includes rotational input directed to the rotatable input element (e.g., <b>604</b>) and that the rotational input meets criteria for moving (e.g., snapping) the user interface object (e.g., <b>1004</b>) to the respective (e.g., predefined) position on the display, the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) moves (<b>1136</b>) the user interface object to the respective position on the display in conjunction with generating (e.g., via the one or more tactile output generators) a tactile output (e.g., a sequence of tactile outputs) corresponding to the movement of the user interface object. In some embodiments, if the displayed content is a first type of content (e.g., continuous content, such as continuous text), the tactile output includes a first type of tactile output sequence (e.g., a textural tactile output sequence) that includes one or more tactile outputs determined based on an input metric (e.g., a speed and/or magnitude) of the input. In some embodiments, if the displayed content is a second type of content (e.g., discrete content, such as buttons, affordances, rows, platters, paragraphs), the tactile output includes a second type of tactile output sequence (e.g., a content-driven tactile output sequence) that includes one or more tactile outputs determined based on movement of predefined units of content in the user interface. In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>1110</b>) the second portion of the input, in accordance with the determination that the input includes movement of a contact on the touch-sensitive display that meets criteria for moving (e.g., snapping) the user interface object to the respective (e.g., predefined) position on the display, the electronic device moves (<b>1138</b>) the user interface object to the respective position on the display without generating (e.g., via the one or more tactile output generators) the tactile output. Generating the tactile output for one type of input (e.g., a rotational input on the input element) but not for another type of input (e.g., a touch input) enables the device to conserve battery power and thus improve battery life by providing sensory feedback for (e.g., only for) types of input that will have a greater benefit to user experience and convenience if the sensory feedback were provided.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0351">In some embodiments, an amplitude of the tactile output is based on (e.g., corresponds to) a size of the user interface object (e.g., <b>1004</b>). In some embodiments, the amplitudes of the one or more tactile outputs are larger if the user interface object is a relatively larger object and are smaller if the user interface object is a relatively smaller object.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0352">In some embodiments, the tactile output (e.g., a sequence of tactile outputs) corresponding to the movement (e.g., snapping) of the user interface object (e.g., <b>1004</b>) to the respective (e.g., predefined) position on the display (e.g., <b>602</b>) comprise a tactile output sequence having a first predetermined frequency range (e.g., 180-200 Hz) that is different from a second predetermined frequency range (e.g., around 100 Hz) corresponding to a tactile output sequence associated with displaying a notification (e.g., for an alert, for an incoming electronic communication) on the display. Thus, from the perspective of a user of the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>), the sensory sensation experienced from tactile output sequence having the first predetermined frequency (e.g., 180-200 Hz) and from the tactile output sequence having the second predetermined frequency (e.g., around 100 Hz) are distinguishable.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0353">In some embodiments, while displaying the user interface (e.g., <b>1002</b>), the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>1120</b>) a second input (e.g., a press input, a press-and-hold input, an input applied with a downward pressing force, a non-rotational input, a non-rotational touch input, a tap input) directed to the rotatable input element (e.g., <b>604</b>). In some embodiments, in response to detecting the second input directed to the rotatable input element, the electronic device forgoes (e.g., suppresses) generating (<b>1122</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, tactile output corresponding to rotation of the rotatable input element (e.g., even when the second input includes both a press of the rotatable input element and rotational input directed to the rotatable input element). Thus, in some embodiments, certain types of inputs on the rotatable input element (e.g., a rotatable input that causes a modification of the user interface) causes the electronic device to generate (e.g., via a tactile output generator) tactile outputs, whereas certain types of inputs on the rotatable input element (e.g., a press input, a press-and-hold input, or a touch input) does not cause the electronic device to generate (e.g., via a tactile output generator) tactile outputs.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0354">In some embodiments, while displaying the user interface (e.g., <b>1002</b>), the electronic device (e.g., <b>600</b>) detects (<b>1124</b>) a third input directed to the rotatable input element (e.g., <b>604</b>). In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>1126</b>) the third input directed to the rotatable input element, in accordance with a determination that the third input includes rotation of the rotatable input element without a press of the rotatable input element, the electronic device generates (<b>1128</b>), via the one or more input devices, tactile output corresponding to rotation of the rotatable input element. In some embodiments, in response to detecting (<b>1134</b>) the third input directed to the rotatable input element, in accordance with a determination that the third input includes rotation of the rotatable input element and a press of the rotatable input element, the electronic device forgoes generating (<b>1130</b>), via the one or more tactile output generators, the tactile output corresponding to rotation of the rotatable input element.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0355">Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method <b>1100</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref>) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described above and below.

However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the techniques and their practical applications. Others skilled in the art are thereby enabled to best utilize the techniques and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0435">Although the disclosure and examples have been fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as being included within the scope of the disclosure and examples as defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0436">As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of data available from various sources to improve sensor feedback to users, and thus enhance user experience, convenience, and efficiency, as a user navigates through content of a user interface displayed on an electronic device. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter IDs, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0437">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0438">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0439">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. In addition to providing &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; and &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0440">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0441">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
