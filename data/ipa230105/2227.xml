The 2D group-IV materials including silicene, germanene and stanene have been realized experimentally after graphene. For group-V elements, few-layer black phosphorus, named phosphorene, has also been successfully fabricated by exfoliation, which exhibits prominent properties such as high carrier mobility and high on/off ratio. Very recently, the novel 2D group-III material of borophene has been fabricated successfully. Beside the allotropes of single element in 2D family, the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoSe<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2</sub>, and WSe<sub>2</sub>, have been synthesized and attracted both experimental and theoretical interests because of their relatively large and direct band gap as well as good carrier mobilities.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The 2D structures of simple group VI elements has only recently been predicted to be possible.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of this disclosure is thereby intended.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present disclosure the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can allow for a degree of variability in a value or range, for example, within 10%, within 5%, or within 1% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;2D tellurene&#x201d; refers to an allotrope of tellurium element. The term &#x201c;2D tellurene&#x201d; refers the allotrope in the form of two-dimensional, atomic scale, and hexagonal lattice in which one atom forms each vertex. One well-known 2D material is graphene, which is an allotrope of carbon.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; refers to either the length or width of the 2D tellurene crystals. Therefore, &#x201c;lateral length&#x201d; may refer to either the length of the length side or width side of the crystals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;substrate-free 2D tellurene&#x201d; refers to 2D tellurium crystals that are prepared through a solution condition instead of being deposited on a substrate as disclosed by Chen et al. regarding 2D tellurene grown on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). The disadvantage of 2D tellurene grown on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate is that such material cannot be easily used and is not available as standalone 2D tellurene crystal. Therefore, the substrate-free 2D tellurene disclosed in the present disclosure provides a standalone, stable and convenient source of pure 2D tellurene. A skilled artisan will appreciate that &#x201c;substrate-free 2D tellurene&#x201d; refers to &#x201c;substrate-free 2D tellurene&#x201d; as made. The later prepared composition by any other physical and/or chemical mixing or combining the as made &#x201c;substrate-free 2D tellurene&#x201d; with another material, even could be named as &#x201c;substrate&#x201d;, should still be within the definition of &#x201c;substrate-free 2D tellurene&#x201d; as defined here.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Group VI tellurium (Te) has a trigonal crystal lattice in which individual helical chains of Te atoms are stacked together by van der Waals type bonds and spiral around axes parallel to the [0001] direction at the center and corners of the hexagonal elementary cell. Each tellurium atom is covalently bonded with its two nearest neighbors on the same chain. Tellurium can be considered as a 1D van der Waals solid. Earlier studies revealed bulk Te has small effective masses and high hole mobilities due to spin-orbit coupling. The lone-pair and anti-bonding orbitals give rise to a slightly indirect bandgap in the infrared regime (&#x2dc;0.35 eV) in bulk Te. The conduction band minimum (CBM) in bulk Te is located at the H-point, while valence band maximum (VBM) is slightly shifted from the H-point along the chain direction, giving rise to hole pockets near H-point. When the thickness is reduced, the indirect feature becomes more prominent. For example, the VBM of 4-layer Te is further shifted to (0.43, 0.34) (in the unit of the surface reciprocal cell), while CBM remains at (&#xbd;, &#x2153;). Accompanied by the shift of VBM, the band gap also increases due to the quantum confinement effect, and eventually reaches &#x2dc;1 eV for monolayer Te20. Te has other appealing properties, e.g. photoconductivity, thermoelectricity, and piezoelectricity for applications in sensors, optoelectronics, and energy devices. A wealth of synthetic methods has been developed to derive Te nanostructures, which favor the 1D form due to the inherent structural anisotropy in Te. Much less is known about the 2D form of Te and related properties.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Large-area, high-quality, and substrate-free 2D Te crystals (termed tellurene) were synthesize with a solution process. The term X-ene is used to generally describe 2D forms of elemental materials without considering the specific bonding. The samples are grown through the reduction of sodium tellurite (Na<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>) by hydrazine hydrate (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) in an alkaline solution at temperatures from 160-200&#xb0; C., with the presence of crystal-face-blocking ligand polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tellurene flakes can be transferred and assembled at large scale, through a Langmuir-Blodgett process, onto various substrates for characterization and device integration. The structure, composition, and quality of these tellurene crystals have been analyzed by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) No point defects or dislocations were observed over a large area within single crystals. EDS result confirmed the chemical composition of Te. Similar characterizations and analyses of dozens of tellurene flakes with different sizes indicate that all samples grow laterally along the &#x3c;0001&#x3e;and &#x3c;1210&#x3e;directions, with the vertical stacking along the &#x3c;1010&#x3e;directions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controlled PVP concentration is critical for obtaining 2D tellurene. When a smaller amount of PVP is used, the first 2D structures occur after a shorter reaction time. A closer examination of reactions with different PVP concentrations reveals an intriguing morphology evolution in growth products with time. For each PVP concentration, the initial growth products are dominantly 1D nanostructures. After a certain period of reaction, structures possessing both 1D and 2D characteristics start to emerge. TEM characterizations indicate that the long axes of these flakes are &#x3c;0001&#x3e;oriented, and the lateral protruding regions) grow along the &#x3c;1210&#x3e;directions, with the {1010} facets as the top/bottom surfaces. The 2D regions are enclosed by edges with atomic level step roughness. These high energy edges are not specific to certain planes during the intermediate states. These structures also have more uneven surfaces compared to 2D tellurene, further manifesting their intermediate nature. Finally, the ratio of 2D tellurene flakes which have a straight {1210} edge increases with a reduction in 1D and intermediate structures and reaches a plateau after an extended growth, e.g. &#x2dc;30 hours. The growth with a lower level of PVP has a smaller final productivity. The observed morphology evolution suggests that the balance between the kinetic and thermodynamic growth dictates the transformation from 1D structures to 2D forms. In the initial growth, PVP is preferentially adsorbed on the {1010} surfaces of the nucleated seeds25, which promotes the kinetic-driven 1D growth. When the reaction continues, {1010} surfaces of the formed structures would become partially covered due to the insufficient PVP capping. Since {1010} surfaces have the lowest free energy in tellurium, the growth of {1010} surfaces along the &#x3c;1210&#x3e;direction significantly increases through the thermodynamic-driven assembly, giving rise to the observed intermediate structures. The enhanced growth along the &#x3c;1210&#x3e;directions together with the continued &#x3c;0001&#x3e;growth leads to the formation of 2D tellurene.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sizes and thicknesses of tellurene can also be effectively modulated by controlling the ratio between sodium tellurite and PVP. The width of tellurene monotonically decreases with the reduction of PVP level; the thickness is minimized when a medium level of PVP is used (e.g. Na2TeO3/PVP ratio &#x2dc;52.4/1), and increases with both the increase and decrease of PVP. With a small amount of PVP, the solution is supersaturated with Te source, and homogeneous nucleation of Te can occur in large scale, consuming resource for subsequent growth. As a result, the Ostwald ripening of Te nuclei is shortened, and the final tellurene crystals have smaller sizes compared to samples grown at higher PVP concentrations. The low PVP level also leads to more significant growth along thickness directions. On the other hand, when the PVP level is high, the fewer nucleation events allow the sufficient supply of Te source for subsequent growth, leading to the increased width and thickness. Also, the productivity of tellurene increases with the reaction temperature from 160&#xb0; C. to 180&#xb0; C. This is likely because higher temperature promotes the forward reaction rate in the half reaction of endothermic hydrazine oxidation. However, when temperature increases from 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., the possible breaking of the van der Waals bonds between Te chains by the excessive energy could lead to the saturated productivity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The 2D tellurene crystals with a thickness smaller than 10 nm can be further derived through a solvent-assisted post-growth thinning process. The thickness of tellurene decreases with time after acetone is introduced into the growth solution. After 6 hours, the average thickness of tellurene is reduced to &#x2dc;10 nm, with the thinnest flake down to 0.9 nm thick when sufficient amount of NaOH solution is added instead of adding acetone. Due to the poor solubility in acetone, PVP molecules tend to desorb from the tellurene and undergo aggregation, giving rise to the sediment of tellurene over the time in acetone. Lacking the protection of PVP, the tellurene surfaces get exposed and react with the alkaline growth solution (pH &#x2dc;11.5), leading to the reduced thickness. Other types of solvents may provide similar effect. PVP solubility in the solvent may significantly affect the post-growth thinning process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These high-quality ultrathin tellurene crystals with controlled thicknesses provide an ideal system to explore their intrinsic properties in the 2D limit. Back-gate tellurene transistors was fabricated to assess their electronic properties. Excellent and air-stable transistor performances were achieved at room temperature for over two months without encapsulation. In particular, important metrics of devices such as on/off ratio, mobility, and current density are superior or comparable to transistors based on other 2D material. Source and drain regions were patterned by electron beam lithography with the channel parallel to the [0001] direction of tellurene. By simply scaling down the channel length to 100 nm, the maximum on current exceeds 550 mA/mm, which stands out among most 2D materials based transistors. Such large Ion values show the potential of the solution-grown tellurene in enabling novel low-power transistors. Remarkably, the tellurene transistors demonstrate good stability in the air without encapsulation. No significant degradation was observed in the transfer curves for the 15 nm tellurene transistor after two months being stored in air. Such an air-stability, superior to other materials such as phosphorene and silicene9, is likely due to the weak binding of oxygen atoms to Te surface, as shown by our first-principles calculations.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The process-tunable thickness of tellurene allows the modulation of device performance in tellurene transistors through tuning the electronic structures. We further explore the thickness dependence of two key metrics of material performance, on/off ratios and field-effect mobilities, to elucidate the transport mechanism of tellurene FETs. Field-effect mobilities with various thicknesses are displayed in FIG. 3<i>b</i>. It peaks with &#x2dc;700 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs at room temperature at around 16 nm thickness and decreases gradually with the further increase of the thickness. This trend is similar to layered materials that experience screening and interlayer coupling13,14 (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary FIG. 15). We expect to be able to improve the mobility of tellurene through approaches such as surface passivation by high-k dielectric39 or h-BN. The thickness-dependent on/off ratios are shown in FIG. 3<i>c</i>, which steeply decrease from &#x2dc;10<sup>6 </sup>for a 4 nm crystal to less than 10 once the crystal thickness exceeds 25 nm, with a trend similar to reported layered materials13,14. The above results also indicate the importance of thickness engineering in tellurene transistors for different applications where the trade-off between higher mobility and better switching behavior need to be carefully considered, which warrants further investigations for testing the performance limit of tellurene FETs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The in-plane anisotropy of few-layer tellurene flakes was also examined. Reduced in-plane symmetry in the crystal structure can lead to interesting anisotropic properties that may enable novel functionalities and applications of 2D materials. The anisotropic optical properties of as-synthesized tellurene was characterized by angle-resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy at room temperature. The incident light comes in along the [1010] direction and is polarized into the [0001] helical chain direction of the tellurene. Three Raman active modes locating at 92 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(E-mode), 121 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(A1 mode) and 141 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(E-mode) were identified. By rotating the tellurene flake in steps of 30&#xb0;, changes were observed in the angle-resolved Raman peak intensities. The peak intensities of different modes were extracted by fitting with Gauss function and plotted them into the corresponding polar figures. The angle-resolved Raman results confirm that the helical Te atom chains in the as-synthesized tellurene are oriented along the growth direction of the tellurene flake. The first-principle calculations show a similar degree of anisotropy in the effective masses along these two orthogonal directions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In summary, a simple, low-cost, solution-based chemical pathway to the scalable synthesis and assembly of 2D tellurene crystals was developed. These high-quality 2D ultrathin tellurene crystals have high carrier mobility and are air-stable. This approach has the potential to produce stable, high-quality, ultrathin semiconductors with a good control of composition, structure, and dimensions for applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion, energy storage, sensors, and quantum devices. Tellurene, as a 1D van der Waals solid, adds a new class of nanomaterials to the large family of 2D crystals and enables possibilities for the further investigation of many exciting properties and intriguing applications.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides substrate-free 2D tellurene crystals.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a composition comprising substrate-free 2D tellurene crystals.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a composition comprising substrate-free 2D tellurene crystals, wherein the 2D tellurene crystals comprising single crystals.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the 2D tellurene crystals in the present disclosure have a lateral length from 0.1-500 &#x3bc;m, 0.1-250 &#x3bc;m, 0.1-100 &#x3bc;m, 0.1-50 &#x3bc;m, 10-500 &#x3bc;m, 10-250 &#x3bc;m, 10-100 &#x3bc;m, 10-50 &#x3bc;m, 20-500 &#x3bc;m, 20-250 &#x3bc;m, 20-100 &#x3bc;m, 20-50 &#x3bc;m, 30-500 &#x3bc;m, 30-250 &#x3bc;m, 30- 100 &#x3bc;m, 30-50 &#x3bc;m, 40-500 &#x3bc;m, 40-250 &#x3bc;m, 40-100 &#x3bc;m, 40-50 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the substrate-free 2D tellurene crystals in the present disclosure have a thickness from about 0.5-250 nm, 0.5-200 nm, 0.5-150 nm, 0.5-100 nm, 0.5-50 nm, 1-250 nm, 1-200 nm, 1-150 nm, 1-100 nm, 1-50 nm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the substrate-free 2D tellurene crystals in the present disclosure are mono layer crystals.

Furthermore, it is also well known in the crystallography art that for any given crystal form the angular peak positions may vary slightly. For example, peak positions can shift due to a variation in the temperature or humidity at which a sample is analyzed, sample displacement, the presence or absence of an internal standard, or the reaction residue which is not completely removed.
