More specifically, it relates to visualization of the extent of myocardium fibrosis of human heart for better characterization of the fibrosis.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIORITY INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter takes priority from the provisional application of application number: 201941050089, TITLE: &#x201c;CPR <sub>2D </sub>Reconstruction&#x201d; and filed in Indian Patent Office, Chennai Branch on 05 Dec. 2019.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the serious health problems faced by human beings world over is heart failure. While there are several causes and factors leading to heart failures, one of the leading causes is Ischemic Cardio Myopathy (ICM). ICM is a term that refers to the heart's decreased ability to pump blood, due to myocardial damage brought upon by ischemia. Ischemia is defined as inadequate blood supply (circulation) to a local area due to blockage of the blood vessels supplying the area. In case of ischemia of heart, thickening of heart muscles known as fibrosis of myocardium occurs. Fibrosis of myocardium is a subject of intense study by Cardiologists world over in order to advice preventive measures to affected people.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Images of Myocardium from diagnostic imaging systems known as &#x2018;imaging modalities&#x2019;, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)are found to be useful for studying the extent of fibrosis. The images obtained from such diagnostic systems e.g., Late Gadolinium Enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI), are captured in the form of layers or slices of cross-sectional images of heart muscles. These set of 2D images have to be transformed, reconstructed and presented to Cardiologists by means of advanced image processing techniques for unambiguous visualization of abnormalities of heart muscles. Quantification, localization and visualization of fibrosis of myocardium are routinely and repeatedly performed by Cardiologists. Hence a user-friendly and efficient method of visualization may be of immense help to a Specialist Doctor in his/her clinical decision-making process to assess and advice about the extent of cardiomyopathy and its viability, i.e. restoration of normal cardiac function.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The existing approach for visualization of fibrosis is done using Bull's Eye View (BEV) graph of fibrosis of myocardium of human heart. BEV scheme of dividing the myocardial wall in to 17 segments is based on the arteries supplying blood to the myocardium. In the BEV graph, the myocardium is divided into a graphical representation of three ring-like structures which are further divided into 17 segments arranged in a circular order as explained in this document subsequently in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>. BEV map and BEV graph refer to the same type of presentations in this document. In this document, by fibrosis, it is referred to myocardium fibrosis of human heart. The existing system of representation and study of fibrosis by means of a BEV map presents many shortcomings to the Physicians studying the fibrosis of epicardium of myocardium for characterization and further necessary action. It is not possible to see transmurality of fibrosis in BEV. Also, information about the spatial distribution of fibrosis on the entire surface of myocardium is absent in this scheme. Further, correlation of fibrosis with wall motion and thickness analysis and abnormality analysis are not possible in the present BEV map of fibrosis. Dynamic behaviour of heart from the time series images is studied by adopting a cumbersome procedure in the present representation and analysis of myocardium fibrosis.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore one of the objects of the subject matter to provide a method and device that overcomes the above and other limitations. The subject matter provides a method and device that meets the above and other challenges. The proposed solution is based on a transformation, reconstruction, and superimposition of segment boundaries, as per BEV definition, on the reconstructed myocardium image of a human heart for efficient visualization.

The human heart has four chambers namely left ventricle (LV), right ventricle, left atrium and right atrium. The LV is the main chamber that pumps blood to the entire body. Myocardium of LV is specifically studied for heart ailments. Myocardium of LV resembles the shape of a hallow cone. In some applications, the visualization of myocardium is modelled as a hallow cone to study its abnormalities. The heart is supplied with blood by coronary blood vessels (arteries). Ischemia or obstruction to blood circulation in one or more coronary arteries can lead to scarring (dead myocardium tissues) of heart muscle, or fibrosis formation. Fibrosis in myocardium can also occur due to infection, genetic and other causes. Fibrosis caused due to different reasons have different patterns and distributions in the myocardium. One of the main attributes is the extent of transmurality, i.e., presence of fibrosis across a thickness of the myocardium. Thickness of fibrosis may extend from endocardium (inner surface) to epicardium (outer surface).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of imaging planes and axes of imaging of a human heart. The rectangular coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a standard model for visualization and interpretation of heart disorders in a reconstructed image obtained from a diagnostic imaging system. Long axis and short axis are longitudinal and lateral axes as shown in the figure. Images acquired in a plane perpendicular to long axis are called short axis (SAX) image. Images acquired in a plane perpendicular to short axis are called long axis (LAX) images. The orientation of LAX plane may be chosen so as to be able to see all the 2, 3 and 4chamber of the heart, which are called LAX <b>2</b>C, LAX <b>3</b>C, LAX <b>4</b>C respectively. The coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is found to be useful for the study of Myocardium of LV. The origin is not defined for heart imaging but it is considered to be lying on the long axis and at the centre of the mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A 3D volume of left ventricle is made of a set of 2D SAX images</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">(SAX<sub>k</sub>, for k=0 to z-1) where k is the slice position (i.e., plane) along the cardiac long axis. The &#x2018;z&#x2019; SAX images, each taken at a different slice position, makes the entire LV mass and volume. The image may extend beyond the LV and heart. The value of z is in the range of 8-15, with 9 being a typical value. For each imaging plane (i.e., value of k), one can also acquire multiple images (SAX<sub>k</sub><sup>RR</sup>) at the same plane but may be acquired at a regular plane and at a fraction of the time intervals between heart-beats. Each one of these SAX<sub>k</sub><sup>RR </sup>images capture the beating heart in a different beating cycle (phase). A set of time varying or temporal sequence of images can be captured by a diagnostic imaging system which when played in a rapid sequence can render the movement of a beating heart. Usually SAX<sub>k</sub><sup>RR </sup>may consist of 25 images typically covering one full beating cycle of heart from end-diastole to end-systole. End-diastole is the state at which a heart is relaxing and at rest with maximum size. End-systole is the state at which the heart has shrunk to its smallest size and is at rest. A heart moving from diastole to systole position leads to pumping of blood which may be studied in detail by heart specialists for detecting abnormalities of the heart.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a schematic a representation of three sections perpendicular to the long axis of a human heart. The long axis may substantially coincide with a centerline shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>. For regional analysis of Left Ventricle (LV) function, the LV is divided into three sections perpendicular to the long axis of the heart as shown. They are called basal, mid-cavity and apical, sectioned across the short axis of the LV. The basal section is designated as the area extending from the mitral annulus to the tips of the papillary muscles at the end diastole. The mid-cavity section is the region that includes the entire length of the papillary muscles. The apical section is the area beyond the papillary muscles to just before where the cavity ends. The true apex or apical cap is the area of myocardium beyond the end of the left ventricular cavity. Each basal, mid-cavity and apical section consists of multiple SAX images.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a schematic representation of further sub-division of the three sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>into 17 segments of myocardium. The three sections namely the basal, mid-cavity and the apical sections are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>. The basal and mid-cavity sections are further divided into six segments each, as shown in the figure here. The apical segment is divided into four segments and the apex is considered as one segment. Together they constitute 17 segments, of LV myocardium, each approximately representing 1/17 part by volume of the myocardium. This 17 segments map of LV is also called Bull's Eye View (BEV) map.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a representation of a Bull's Eye View (BEV) map of representation of the 17 segments of myocardium.

The BEV is a standard method of representation of fibrosis percentage in each of the 17 segments, arranged in a circular order, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>. In this graph, it can be seen that the outer-most ring represents for basal segments, the second ring represents mid-cavity segments, the third ring counted from the outer-most ring represents apical segments and the innermost circle represents an apex of a myocardium.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a method <b>300</b> according one embodiment of the present subject matter.

Blocks and steps of the method <b>300</b> may be interchangeably used as each block is representing a step of the method <b>300</b>. The inputs for the blocks <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b>,<b>350</b>, <b>360</b> and <b>370</b> of the method <b>300</b> are shown as <b>301</b>, <b>311</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>341</b>, <b>351</b> and <b>361</b>respectively. According to the proposed embodiment of the method <b>300</b>, a first set of volumetric image data <b>301</b> comprising cross-sectional images of a myocardium are received at block <b>310</b>. By volumetric image data, it is meant a set of 2D SAX images (SAX<sub>k</sub>, for k=0 to z-1) where k is the slice position (i.e., plane) along the cardiac long axis. This set of images completely represent a 3D volume of a left ventricle. The &#x2018;z&#x2019; SAX images, each taken at a different slice position, makes the entire LV mass and volume.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a result of the steps of the proposed method <b>300</b>, as second set of volumetric image data <b>361</b> of the myocardium walls of a LV are transformed for r better interpretation and visualization of the myocardium for detecting and estimating the extent of abnormalities such as fibrosis of myocardium walls.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples the pre-processing step <b>310</b> of the method may be configured to locate and segment myocardium boundary by one of the well known and standard techniques. Preprocessing a set of cross sectional images of myocardium involves segmenting the shape of myocardium represented in the form of concentric circles by using any one of the standard techniques (Reference: Olivier Bernard et al, &#x201c;Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic MRI Cardiac Multi-structures Segmentation and Diagnosis: Is the Problem Solved?&#x201d;, IEEE TAN Journal.) As a result of this preprocessing, centroids of the myocardium and radii of the inner and outer boundaries representing the substantially concentric circles are also obtained after segmentation. The preprocessing step <b>310</b> is further explained and illustrated with the help of input and output images in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the set of images <b>301</b> provided as input to the step <b>310</b> may already contain the segmented output of the myocardium images. By segmented output of the myocardium, it means and refers to a set of cross sectional images of myocardium with outer and inner walls of the myocardium segmented with boundaries clearly marked and the coordinates of the boundaries and the pixel values within the inner and outer boundaries can be read and stored. A centroid of each one of the segmented output of the myocardium is computed and made available for further computations. In addition, it is also understood that the outer and inner radii of the boundaries of myocardium are computed and are available for further computations. In such cases, the step <b>310</b> may be skipped or by-passed and the segmented set of myocardium images <b>311</b> may be directly made available to the step <b>320</b> of the method <b>300</b>. An example of an image comprising a cross sectional image of a myocardium is illustrated and explained in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step <b>320</b>, each one of the set of segmented images of myocardium is transformed from a polar coordinate system to a rectangular coordinate system. In a segmented myocardium image, a cross section of myocardium is seen as an annulus bounded by the two concentric circles corresponding to the inner and outer walls of a myocardium. The shape of annulus can be represented using cylindrical coordinates or polar coordinates by means of two variables namely an angle (&#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>) and a radius (r<sub>i</sub>). By first placing the pixel values in the polar coordinates of discrete values of angle (&#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>) and radius (r<sub>i</sub>) on a digital grid, the discrete values can then be transformed in to rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to obtain a rectangular representation of the annulus shape of the myocardium. The annulus or ring shaped walls of the myocardium as a result of the transformation appears as a rectangular strip or ribbon-like two-dimensional surface. This transformation is done by preserving pixel sizes in different SAX imaging planes, thereby maintaining the aspect ratio of the left ventricle myocardium. Therefore the original pixel values and their locations undergo a transformation and they have to be recalculated to fit into the rectangular grid of discrete values e.g. in (X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>) coordinates. In the recalculation, the original pixel values are re-sampled to fit the rectangular grid of discrete values in (X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>). In this manner, a curved plane is reconstructed into a rectangular plane. An example of the transformation step <b>320</b> is illustrated and explained in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>330</b>, a combining operation is performed to combine and assemble all the transformed myocardium images of the slices of myocardium to build a single 3D image of the myocardium for effectively visualizing and studying fibrosis of myocardium tissues. As a result of the combining step <b>330</b>, a reconstructed set of myocardium images is obtained. The step <b>330</b> effectively combines three operations such as (a) stacking up the individual slices in a pre-defined sequence, (b) displacing each individual slice to coincide the edges with an axis and (c) adjusting the scales of different sizes of myocardium walls in order to obtain a combined 3D model of the myocardium and in the shape of a uniform rectangle. In the displacing operation, positions of each rectangular image are adjusted to coincide with one another so that assembling them as a stack is achieved such that adjacent pixels preserve their neighborhood criteria. An example of the combining, stacking up and scaling operations is illustrated and explained in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A 3D model of a myocardium is reconstructed and displayed by using the proposed method. The proposed method provides a complete 360&#xb0; view of myocardium from apex to basal and endocardium to epicardium. In this 3D image of myocardium (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), the pixel size and aspect ratio are maintained across different SAX imaging planes. In this method of reconstruction of the myocardium, abnormalities such as fibrosis may be detected by a simple image processing operation such as thresholding. The image is adjusted in scale for different sizes of myocardium in different slices. Thus, the proposed method provides a transformation of a set of input SAX images into a 3D volume image of a myocardium thereby making it amenable for further processing using standard image processing techniques and also for complete visualization of myocardium for clinical decision making.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step <b>340</b>, the output of the combining step <b>330</b> namely the reconstructed set of myocardium images is demarcated with the standard Bull's Eye View (BEV) map. BEV comprises 17 segments of a myocardium walls a standard set for further interpretation. However, in some user groups, 16 or 18 segments may also be in practice as a standard BEV map. Hence there is no limit or constrain in the number of segments used. The superimposition and segmenting of the reconstructed image is further explained with the help of illustrative figures <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>350</b>, a set of parameters indicative of the extent of fibrosis of the myocardium are estimated from the respective pixel values of each one of the demarcated plurality of BEV image segments. The fibrosis pixels are defined as those that fall outside a known range of values that fall within the myocardium. The mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) are calculated for all pixels within the myocardium. Pixels having values greater than (M+(n*SD)) (where &#x2018;n&#x2019; can take values 2, 3, or 4, . . . and is user-selectable) are considered as fibrosis pixels. From the respective image segments and their respective pixel values, computation of average fibrosis, maximum fibrosis, wall thickness and wall displacement can be configured.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>360</b>, superimposing the estimated set of parameters on the respective myocardium segments enables the practitioners to get a better picture of the extent of fibrosis. In the proposed method, the volumetric image and the myocardium segments are adapted to a new method of presentation by modifying the BEV map and superimposing on a reconstructed 3D plane. A visual image and measured values of the abnormality are combined and integrated in the visualization, which was not available in the conventional method of visualization with the BEV map. Estimated sets of parameters <b>351</b> indicative of extent of fibrosis of the myocardium at their respective positions on the plurality of BEV image segments to obtain the second set of volumetric image data <b>361</b> of the myocardium. In this manner, a better method of quantification and visualization of abnormal tissues of myocardium is provided in the proposed solution.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>370</b>, the second set of volumetric image data <b>361</b> is displayed on a display device.

This transformation (a) makes it more amenable to detect pattern in continuum of 3D space of myocardium for better quantification of heart abnormalities; (b) enables a user to see myocardium tissues between endocardium and epicardium and (c) allows better visualization of abnormal myocardium tissues, such as fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a step <b>370</b> of the method <b>300</b> according one embodiment of the present subject matter.

A set of such cross sectional images of myocardium from apex to base, can be received for reconstruction and display for further study of the myocardium. In one embodiment, an image may be represented as I (x<sub>N</sub>, y<sub>N</sub>) of size N&#xd7;N pixels. It may be noted that the size of pixels in X and Y direction need not be same. In one embodiment, a set of such cross sectional images of a myocardium may be provided as input for the proposed reconstruction method of the myocardium image. In one example, the set of such cross-sectional images of a myocardium may be generated from one of the many medical diagnostic modalities and systems such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound imaging and Single Photon Emission Computer Tomography (SPECT). Ultrasound imaging systems are also useful in studying the heart abnormalities and conditions.

There are many such standard techniques available for segmentation and circular object detection, e.g., Hough Transform, Deep Learning (DL) methods and many digital image processing (DIP) methods. Recent methods involving Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques may be applied to segment such concentric circles representing the inner and outer boundaries of myocardium.

Since there is a pair of circles in each segmented myocardium image, the radius of the shape varied from a minimum value to a maximum value viz., r<sub>max </sub>and r<sub>min</sub>. It can be understood by a skilled person that as the value of radius (r<sub>i</sub>) varies from r<sub>max </sub>to r<sub>min</sub>, pixel widths along the radius (r<sub>i</sub>) may vary proportionately to their distance from the origin. Therefore, pixel widths have to be computed for each discrete value of angle (&#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>) ranging from r<sub>max </sub>to r<sub>min </sub>in a finite number of steps. A set of calculations for pixel values are computed using an equation with a set of variables. From the polar grid, a set of coordinates of rectangular grid are computed in the next step. This is a straight forward computation obeying the equations X=r Sin (&#x3b8;) and Y=r Cos (&#x3b8;). A second set of image pixels corresponding to the set of discrete rectangular coordinates are computed. Subsequently, corresponding pixel values are computed to fit into the rectangular grid. In this manner, a curved surface is converted to a rectangular plane. A complete set of computations for the curved surface reconstruction to a rectangular plane is shown in Appendix &#x2018;A&#x2019; titled &#x201c;Methodology for Myocardium reconstruction&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an illustration of an assembled and reconstructed 3D myocardium image, with uniform sampling of myocardium from apex to base. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an illustration of an assembled and reconstructed 3D myocardium image after adjusting it for different sizes of the myocardium in different slices.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, Y-axis represents layers or slices of images or slice positions.

This makes it very easy to apply image processing techniques, such as thresholding, to segment myocardium for characterizing abnormal structures such as fibrosis e.g., the white patch seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a schematic representation of an opened up myocardium image superimposed with 17 segments of the BEV representation. Effectively, a 3D conical shape of the myocardium is sliced in the vertical plane and spread sidewise to obtain a clear view of the walls. The image is labeled as CPR<sub>myo </sub>and the three sections namely the basal, the mid-cavity and the apical sections are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a schematic representation of an opened up myocardium with extended portions on both the sides by a predetermined fraction. In general, it is observed that a 60&#xb0; extension may result in a better representation. The extension is created by reproducing the pixels from the opposite edge. Abrupt cutting off of the edges is avoided. For example, a fraction of the right side of the myocardium wall is copied and pasted on the left side and vice-versa to generate a myocardium image with a wrap around. One of the advantages of the presentation in a wrap around method is to preserve the adjacency of pixels thereby enabling the study of continuity of fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>c</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b></figref><i>a, </i><b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>c </i>show schematic representations of computation and display of average fibrosis, maximum fibrosis in a plane and fibrosis in one r plane in the reconstructed 3D image of myocardium. From the reconstructed image as illustrated in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an extent of fibrosis can be calculated and characterized by means of pixel values. Average fibrosis is computed in all the segments of the reconstructed image and the computed parameter values are superimposed on the respective segments for better interpretation of the abnormality. Average fibrosis in all the CPR<sub>r</sub><sub><sub2>i</sub2></sub><sup>R </sup>images (for i=0 to R-1), as well as the maximum value in any of the plane are computed and displayed on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>respectively. It can be seen that there are four sections of myocardium corresponding to basal, mid-cavity, apical and apex, separated by horizontal green lines. The 17 image segments corresponding to a BEV map can be seen on the myocardium, demarcated by red lines. Hence possibilities of unique perspective, visualization and interpretation are available for the first time to Physicians wherein the fibrosis values in each of the seventeen segments of myocardium are superimposed on the adapted BEV map, while maintaining special relationship and neighbourhood information of each of the segments. A skilled person can apply this proposed solution and achieve significant improvement over the conventional BEV presentation map of visualizing myocardium of human heart. The proposed solution addresses many of the shortcomings of the BEV representation map of myocardium of human heart.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of an integrated display of different views and cross-sections of the myocardium.
