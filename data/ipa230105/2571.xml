In particular, such additives are useful for films of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), where inter-fiber bonding is weak due to the fineness of the MFC.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One problem which occurs in cellulose film manufacture when casting on a substrate is the very high degree of adhesion between the film and the substrate that such components can impart. Even at very low dosages, the film-forming polymer can create such high adhesion that the cellulose film cannot be separated from the casting substrate when dry. Solutions to this problem include brushing or washing the cellulose film from the casting substrate. However, such solutions are less effective in continuous production processes, where machine speed is high and the cellulose film needs to be separated from the casting substrate in a precise and controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known in the optical film and plastic film industries to use release agents based on fluoropolymers, silanes, silanols, or siloxanes to separate plastic films from casting substrates. Such release agents are often toxic and therefore unsuitable for production of films intended for e.g. food contact.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a need for an improvement in the release of cellulose films comprising MFC from the casting substrate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">So, in a first aspect a method for making a cellulose film comprising microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) is provided, said method comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a. providing a casting substrate having at least one surface;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">b. applying an aqueous emulsion of one or more vegetable oils to said surface of said casting substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">c. casting a film-forming composition on the treated surface of said casting substrate, said film-forming composition comprising MFC and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">d. drying the film-forming composition on the casting substrate to form a cellulose film comprising microfibrillated cellulose (MFC); and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">e. separating the formed cellulose film from the casting substrate.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">The use of a release agent is also provided, said release agent being an aqueous emulsion of one or more vegetable oils, in promoting the release of a cellulose film comprising MFC and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer from a surface of a casting substrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">Furthermore, a cellulose film is provided which comprises microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer, said cellulose film defining a surface, wherein at least one vegetable oil is present on said surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Further details of the invention are apparent from the following description and dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0015">It has been found that a significant improvement in the release of cellulose films containing MFC and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer from the casting substrate can be achieved by applying a thin layer of release agent being at least one vegetable oil on a surface of the casting substrate prior to MFC film formation on said surface. Such a release agent enables separation of neat, undamaged MFC film containing film-forming polymer from the surface of the casting substrate. In particular, this type of release agent may be substantially non-toxic, and can be added during continuous production and gives a rapid response in the release properties, enabling precise control of film adhesion and release, without influencing the properties of the MFC film itself (e.g. oxygen barrier properties).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">In particular, even low doses of vegetable oil release agent may provide a significant improvement in release. This is important, as certain chemicals may function as a &#x201c;debonder&#x201d;, and application at low doses is therefore useful.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">The vegetable oils used in the present invention may be approved for direct food contact according to the &#x201c;GRAS&#x201d; designation from the FDA or may comply with BfR recommendation XXXVI. The vegetable oils may be edible.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">The use of the release agents of the present invention enables the adjustment of adhesion of an MFC film to the casting substrate in a controllable manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">A method for making a cellulose film comprising microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) is provided; i.e. an MFC film. The method comprising the general steps of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0020">a. providing a casting substrate having at least one surface;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0021">b. applying an aqueous emulsion of one or more vegetable oils to said surface of said casting substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0022">c. casting a film-forming composition on the treated surface of said casting substrate, said film-forming composition comprising MFC and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0023">d. drying the film-forming composition on the casting substrate to form a cellulose film comprising microfibrillated cellulose (MFC); and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0024">e. separating the formed cellulose film from the casting substrate.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0025">One advantage of MFC films is that they can be transparent to visible light. Preferably, therefore, the MFC film has a transparency of more than 50% preferably more than 65% and more preferably more than 75% when measured for a film with grammage of ca 30 gsm using the standard DIN 53147. Note that the MFC film can have high transparency for visible light but poor transparency for UV light.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0026">The MFC film described herein can provide increased barrier at least against one of grease/oil, moisture, oxygen or aroma. The MFC film suitably has an Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) value less than 5000 cc/m<sup>2</sup>/24 h (23&#xb0; C., 50% RH) according to ASTM D-3985 at a grammage between 10-50 gsm, more preferably in the range of 100-1000 cc/m<sup>2</sup>/24 h. The OTR may also be lower than 100 cc/m<sup>2</sup>/24 h, such as 0.1-100 cc/m<sup>2</sup>/24 h under these conditions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0027">Furthermore, at least 60%, more preferably at least 70% or most preferably at least 80% of the tensile strength (index) of the MFC film made according to the invention may be maintained compared to a reference MFC film of the same composition, made without using the release agents of the invention. This is particularly relevant when the release agent is applied in low amounts and thereby does not affect the tensile strength of the film.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0028">Casting Substrate</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">The method requires a casting substrate having at least one surface. The casting substrate can be any such substrate commonly used for casting fibrous suspensions. The substrate may be formed from plastic or metal, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, where the method is continuous, the casting substrate is a belt, such as a metal belt.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">The surface upon which the MFC film (film-forming composition) is cast may be substantially planar, or may be textured, or may have regions which are textured and other regions which are substantially planar. The surface may have openings for draining liquid from the film-forming composition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">The surface (e.g. belt) upon which the film-forming composition is cast may have a length of 1-300 m and a width of 0.2-10 m. The surface might also be coated with e.g. a ceramic or plastic coating e.g. to adjust surface energy.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">If the surface is textured, it may contain recesses or protruding areas in a random or predetermined pattern. For example, a pattern of recesses can be created in the textured surface by etching non-conducting or conducting channels. It is also possible to deposit material to create protruding areas. One example is to use laser technology for engraving the textured surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">In one embodiment, where the casting substrate is a metal belt, the surface can have ground or polished finish to provide smooth film surface. For very smooth film surface, mirror quality polished metal belt can be used. A metal belt can also have a polymer coating, such as a PTFE coating.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">Release Agent</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">An aqueous emulsion of one or more vegetable oils is applied to the surface of said casting substrate. As mentioned above, the use of such a vegetable oil enables separation of neat, undamaged MFC film containing film-forming polymer from the surface of the casting substrate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">Release agents based on vegetable oils are used in the tissue paper industry, in modifying Yankee cylinder surface properties for good creping of the tissue base paper, see e.g. &#x201c;Pulp and paper industry chemicals&#x201d; by Pratima Bajpai (2015, ISBN 978-0-12-803408-8) and WO2011156313A1. However, creping is a different process to casting, and tissue paper generally does not comprise MFC fibres. Such release agents are not normally used in casting processes or cellulosic films comprising MFC.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">Suitably, the emulsion is applied to the surface of said casting substrate such that the one or more vegetable oils are coated at a level of 0.1-500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, preferably 0.5-150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The aqueous emulsion may comprise a low amount of vegetable oils, such as 0.01-20 wt %, preferably 0.01-10 wt %, more preferably 0.1-5 wt % of said one or more vegetable oils, while still providing good release from the casting substrate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">The one or more vegetable oils may be selected from ben oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, canola oil, coconut oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, linseed oil, corn oil, safflower oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, almond oil, castor oil, colza oil, false flax oil, hemp oil, mustard oil, radish oil, ramtil oil, rice bran oil, tung oil, salicornia oil, jatropha oil or algae-based oil.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">The aqueous emulsion of one or more vegetable oils should be of sufficiently low viscosity so that it can be sprayed or otherwise spread on the surface. The aqueous emulsion of vegetable oils suitably has a viscosity of less than 1000 mPas, preferably less than 500 mPas, when measured according to DIN 53015 at 20&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">The aqueous emulsion may contain stabilizers or emulsifiers. The emulsifier may be selected from a non-ionic, cationic or anionic emulsifier. The average particle size in the emulsion is 10-1000 nm or preferably 20-400 nm.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">Film-Forming Composition</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">The film-forming composition of the invention comprises MFC and a hydrophilic film-forming polymer. The composition is typically an aqueous suspension of MFC, in which the hydrophilic film-forming polymer is dissolved. Preferably the film-forming composition is an aqueous composition comprising 10-99 wt % MFC, preferably 50-99 wt % MFC, more preferably 70-95 wt % MFC based on the total solids content of the film-forming composition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">The viscosity of the film-forming composition should be more than 500 cP, preferably more than 1000 cP when measured with Brookfield viscosimeter at 100 rpm at 20&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">Microfbillated Cellulose (MFC)</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">The present invention provides a cellulose film comprising microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). MFC shall in the context of the present technology mean a nano-scale cellulose fiber or fibril with at least one dimension, preferably diameter, less than 1000 nm. An MFC suspension might also comprise partly or totally non-fibrillated cellulose or lignocellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber is preferably fibrillated to such an extent that the final specific surface area of the formed MFC is from about 1 to about 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, such as from 10 to 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more preferably 50-200 m<sup>2</sup>/g when determined for a solvent exchanged and freeze-dried material with the BET method. The mean average fibril diameter of the MFC is 1-1000 nm, preferably 10-1000 nm. The MFC may be characterised by analysing high resolution SEM or ESEM images.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">Preferably, the MFC content in the MFC film is at least 10 wt %, preferably 50 wt %, more preferably at least 60 wt % and most preferably at least 70 wt % based on the total solids content. In an embodiment, the MFC film comprises at most 50 wt %, such as at most 30 wt %, suitably at most 20 wt %, based on the total solids content, of partly or totally non-fibrillated cellulose or lignocellulose fibers, having a mean average fibril diameter greater than 1000 nm.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">Various methods exist to make MFC, such as single or multiple pass refining, pre-hydrolysis followed by refining or high shear disintegration or liberation of fibrils. One or several pre-treatment steps are usually required in order to make MFC manufacturing both energy-efficient and sustainable. The cellulose fibers of the pulp to be supplied may thus be pre-treated enzymatically or chemically, for example to reduce the quantity of hemicellulose or lignin. The cellulose fibers may be chemically modified before fibrillation, wherein the cellulose molecules contain functional groups other (or more) than found in the original cellulose. Such groups include, among others, carboxymethyl, aldehyde and/or carboxyl groups (cellulose obtained by N-oxyl mediated oxidation, for example &#x201c;TEMPO&#x201d;), or quaternary ammonium (cationic cellulose). After being modified or oxidized in one of the above-described methods, it is easier to disintegrate the fibers into MFC.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">The MFC may contain some hemicelluloses; the amount is dependent on the plant source. Mechanical disintegration of the pre-treated fibers, e.g. hydrolysed, pre-swelled, or oxidized cellulose raw material is carried out with suitable equipment such as a refiner, grinder, homogenizer, colloider, friction grinder, ultrasound sonicator, single&#x2014;or twin-screw extruder, fluidizer such as microfluidizer, macrofluidizer or fluidizer-type homogenizer. Depending on the MFC manufacturing method, the product might also contain fines, or nanocrystalline cellulose or e.g. other chemicals present in wood fibers or in papermaking process. The product might also contain various amounts of micron size fiber particles that have not been efficiently fibrillated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">MFC can be produced from wood cellulose fibers, both from hardwood or softwood fibers. It can also be made from microbial sources, agricultural fibers such as wheat straw pulp, bamboo, bagasse, or other non-wood fiber sources. It is preferably made from pulp including pulp from virgin fiber, e.g. mechanical, chemical and/or thermomechanical pulps. It can also be made from broke or recycled paper, i.e. pre and post-consumer waste.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">The MFC can be native (i.e. chemically unmodified), or it can be chemically modified. Phosphorylated MFC is typically obtained by reacting cellulose fibers soaked in a solution of NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, water and urea and subsequently fibrillating the fibers. One particular method involves providing a suspension of cellulose pulp fibers in water, and phosphorylating the cellulose pulp fibers in said water suspension with a phosphorylating agent, followed by fibrillation with methods common in the art. Suitable phosphorylating agents include phosphoric acid, phosphorus pentaoxide, phosphorus oxychloride, diammonium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The film may also include other cellulosic components.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">Hydrophilic Film-Forming Polymer</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The film-forming composition comprises a hydrophilic film-forming polymer. The polymer assists in bonding the MFC fibres of the film together. The film-forming composition typically comprises 0.1-50 wt %, preferably 0.1-25 wt %, more preferably 0.1-15 wt % of said film-forming polymer based on the total solids content of the film-forming composition. The term &#x201c;hydrophilic&#x201d; means that&#x2014;when in solid form&#x2014;the polymer has a contact angle with water being less than 90 degrees, preferably less than 70 degrees.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">Suitably, the film-forming polymer is selected from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cellulose derivatives, polyacrylamide, polyethylene imine, acrylic polymers and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Preferred film-forming polymers are polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">Partly- or fully-hydrolysed derivatives of these film-forming polymers are also potentially used. The degree of hydrolysis can be from 85-99%.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">The film-forming polymers&#x2014;in particular the PVA&#x2014;can also be derivatised with various functional groups such as e.g. silanols or carboxylic acids.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">Cellulose derivatives used as the film-forming polymer include methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Cellulose derivatives may also include starch or hemicellulose, or derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The film-forming composition may comprise one hydrophilic film-forming polymer or two or more hydrophilic film-forming polymers.
