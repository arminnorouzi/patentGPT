More particularly, the present invention provides a method for producing whitlockite, which is capable of producing whitlockite in large amounts by increasing the production efficiency of whitlockite, and whitlockite produced according to the production method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In bone graft surgery, a method of grafting autogenous bone is usually used. However, this autologous bone grafting method has a problem in that it may involve complications such as pain at the donor site, infection, hematoma, and fracture. In particular, this method has a shortcoming in that it is difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of bone graft required to perform autologous bone grafting (Silber J S, Anderson D G, Daffner S D, Brislin B T, Leland J M, Hilibrand A S, et al. Donor site morbidity after anterior iliac crest bone harvest for single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Spine. 2003; 28(2):134-9). Meanwhile, allogeneic bone and xenogenic bone have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of autogenous bone, but are hardly comparable with autogenous bone due to their lower osteogenic ability than autogenous bone. In addition, they have a problem in that cross-infection or antigen-antibody reaction cannot be completely excluded.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to overcome these shortcomings, many studies on the development of artificial bone materials have been conducted. Among them, synthetic bioactive ceramics such as hydroxyapatite (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;HAP&#x2019;) and beta tricalcium phosphate (Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;&#x3b2;-TCP&#x2019;) show excellent biocompatibility and bone conduction ability, and have already been widely used as bone graft replacement materials in clinical practice. In addition, biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), which is a mixture of the above-described HAP and &#x3b2;-TCP, has excellent biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and biodegradability, and thus has been extensively studied and reported (Bagambisa FB, Joos U, Schilli W. Mechanism and structure of the bond between bone and hydroxyapatite ceramics. J Biomed Mater Res 1993;27:1047-1055. Bagambisa F B, Joos U, Schilli W. Mechanism and structure of the bond between bone and hydroxyapatite ceramics. J Biomed Mater Res 1993; 27:1047-1055).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ceramics having a porous structure as described above have a large contact surface with blood flow when grafted in vivo compared to a dense form, and new blood vessels and surrounding bone tissue may easily grow thereon to improve the union rate (Chang B-S, Hong K-S, Youn H-J, Ryu H-S, Chung S-S, Park K-W. Osteoconduction at porous hydroxyapatite with various pore configurations. Biomaterials. 2000; 21(12):1291-8).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">HAP is a major mineral that accounts for 60 to 70% of bone in vivo and constitutes bone in vivo through three-dimensional self-assembly alignment, and it has excellent biocompatibility and is capable of bonding directly with natural bone, and thus has been synthesized artificially in vitro and used as a bone graft material (Lee J H, Hwang C J, Song B W, Koo K H, Chang B S, Lee C K. A prospective consecutive study of instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion using synthetic hydroxyapatite (Bongros-HA) as a bone graft extender. Journal of biomedical materials research Part A. 2009; 90(3):804-10).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the ultimate purpose of bone grafting is to replace the bone graft material with autologous bone, and externally synthesized HAP has a shortcoming in that it remains in vivo without being substantially degraded, which interferes with complete replacement with autologous bone.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, although not being as biocompatible as HAP, &#x3b2;-TCP is known as a material that is easily degraded in vivo, and thus when it is grafted in vivo, it is gradually degraded and replaced with regenerated bone, but is absorbed excessively quickly and cannot serve as a support until natural bone is sufficiently regenerated (Lim J Y, Donahue H J. Cell sensing and response to micro- and nanostructured surfaces produced by chemical and topographic patterning. Tissue engineering. 2007; 13(8):1879-91).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, in bone and teeth in vivo, whitlockite (Ca<sub>18</sub>Mg<sub>2</sub>(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>12</sub>, hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;WH&#x2019;), which is a calcium phosphate compound in which a small amount of calcium is substituted with magnesium, exists in addition to HAP which is the major component. WH has been found in various tissues in the human body, such as bone and cartilage, gallstones or decayed teeth, calculus, tuberculosis tissue, intervertebral discs, aorta, and teeth that have not yet protruded, and is widely distributed in normal and pathological tissues in the human body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To commemorate the discovery of TCP in phosphate rocks by mineralogist Whitlock in 1941 using X-ray diffraction, Frondel named TCP Whitlockite. Although the crystal discovered by Whitlock at that time was actually a material in which a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is substituted with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, this name is still used.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such whitlockite is known as a material suitable for bone or teeth in terms of its structure or composition. In addition, the Ca/P ratio of WH is about 1.43:1, which is closer to the Ca/P ratio of &#x3b2;-TCP (1.5:1) than to the Ca/P ratio of HAP (1.67:1), suggesting that WH has properties more similar to &#x3b2;-TCP than to HAP. In addition, when whitlockite and HAP are used in certain amounts, it may be more suitable for purposes such as repairing bone or tooth tissue of the human body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Nevertheless, the utilization of WH was insignificant. This is because there was considerable difficulty in obtaining WH in high purity, even though experiments for synthesizing WH in various ways have been conducted in the prior art. In addition, when the synthesis of WH is performed according to a conventional method that makes it possible to obtain high-purity WH, a problem arises in that the actual production yield of WH is considerably low. Thus, according to the conventional art, there is a problem in that it is impossible to produce WH through mass production resulting from process scale-up.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, in a certain case, when WH was produced, a certain amount of HAP was also produced, but it could not be adjusted within a certain range. Thus, when artificial bone composed of a mixture of WH and HAP is used, problems arise in that it is impossible to obtain a mixture of WH and HAP having an appropriate WH content for application to bone or teeth, and the produced WH and HAP have to be mixed and used within a certain ratio range.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent Document 1 (KR 10-2014-0020605 A) discloses a method for mass production of nano-sized high-purity whitlockite powder, which is capable of producing whitlockite without a high-temperature heat treatment process and a washing process and may achieve process simplification. Patent Document 1 has significance over other prior arts in that it achieves process simplification. However, when the process is scaled up according to the embodiment disclosed in Patent Document 1 beyond the small-scale process which is a lab-scale process, there is a problem in that it is difficult to obtain high-purity nanoparticles. That is, in the prior art, the process of obtaining high-purity whitlockite is complicated, and the amount of whitlockite obtained is very limited in spite of this complicated process. Therefore, it appears that Patent Document 1 mentions the possibility of mass production with the advantage that the process is simpler than other prior art. However, when process scale-up is applied to Patent Document 1, it is impossible to produce high-purity nanoparticles. Therefore, Patent Document 1 has a limitation in that industrially meaningful mass production is impossible.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Patent Document 2 (KR 10-2014-0020605 A) discloses whitlockite having a chemical formula of Ca<sub>20-y</sub>X<sub>y</sub>(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>12 </sub>while presenting an oral composition. In addition, Patent Document 2 discloses as a specific example of producing whitlockite, in which a calcium ion source material is calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), a cation (X) source material is magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and a phosphate source material is phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), as in Patent Document 1, or in which a calcium ion source material is calcium nitrate (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), a cation source material is magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), and a phosphate source material is phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). However, according to the above example, it is possible to produce a small amount of whitlockite in a lab-scale process, but when the process is scaled up and applied to a mass-production process, a problem arises in that whitlockite is not produced, unlike the lab-scale experiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Patent Document 3 (JP 4522549 B1) discloses mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO<sub>4</sub>) with calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide while disclosing a process for producing whitlockite. However, the process according to Patent Document 3 is not only disadvantageous in terms of the purity and crystalline form of the produced whitlockite, but also applied only to small-scale production, and when the process is scaled up and applied to mass production, a problem arises in that whitlockite is not produced, unlike the lab-scale experiment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(Patent Document 1) KR 10-2014-0020605 A</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(Patent Document 2) KR 10-2014-0020605 A</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(Patent Document 3) JP 4522549 B1</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(Patent Document 4) KR 10-2016-0080512 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing whitlockite, which is capable of producing high-purity whitlockite while simplifying the process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing whitlockite, which may be applied to a scaled-up process for industrially meaningful mass production.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a mixture of whitlockite and hydroxyapatite, which is capable of controlling the mixing ratio between whitlockite and hydroxyapatite (HAP).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide whitlockite or a mixture of whitlockite and hydroxyapatite.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To achieve the above objects, a method for producing whitlockite according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises: a step of preparing a precursor solution by mixing a first solution containing a calcium (Ca) ion source material, a second solution containing a magnesium (Mg) ion source material, and a third solution containing a phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) source material;

a heat-treatment step of heat-treating the precursor solution; and a step of separating and purifying a precipitate formed in the solution, after the heat-treatment step.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Whitlockite according to the present invention includes whitlockite nanocrystals. In addition, whitlockite according to the present invention may have one or more shapes selected from the group consisting of sphere, rod, plate, polygon, rice grain, and cubic shapes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The solvent of the solution may be any one selected from the group consisting of water, an organic solvent, an acid-base inorganic solvent, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the solvent may be any one selected from the group consisting of water, oleic acid, methanol, ethanol, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, when the step of preparing a precursor solution comprises mixing the first to third solutions together simultaneously, the solvent of each of the solutions may be a mixed solvent obtained by adding 0.001 to 1 part by weight of oleic acid to 100 parts by weight of water. The use of the mixed solvent may be quite advantageous in terms of process simplification, because it makes it possible to produce whitlockite while mixing the solutions together simultaneously. In particular, it enables stable production yield to be maintained even in a scaled-up process.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The heat-treatment step plays an important role in stably producing and maintaining nanoparticles in high purity while synthesizing whitlockite. Meanwhile, in the prior art, a method of performing heat treatment at a relatively high temperature is used. However, when the method of performing heat treatment at a relatively high temperature is a small-scale process which is a lab-scale process, there is no particular problem in the formation and maintenance of whitlockite, but when the method is a scaled-up process, a problem arises in that whitlockite is not produced, or the crystallinity of whitlockite is greatly reduced, or other crystals such as hydroxyapatite are formed while particles become larger, unlike the small-scale production process. This is because large differences in heat dissipation, mixing of solutions, transport of raw material solutions, and the like occur in the scaled-up process. Thus, as the heat treatment temperature in the heat treatment process decreases, even the large-scale process may exhibit the same quality and yield as in the small-scale process.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The heat-treatment step may be performed at 30 to 150&#xb0; C. Preferably, the heat-treatment step may be performed at 50 to 90&#xb0; C. When the heat-treatment step in the production method according to the present invention is performed at a temperature within the above-described temperature range, high-purity whitlockite may be stably produced at a relatively low temperature, and in particular, the appearance, purity and yield of particles may be maintained without changes even in a scaled-up process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the heat-treatment step may be performed for 8 to 36 hours. If the heat-treatment step is performed for less than 8 hours in the above-described temperature range, a problem arises in that produced whitlockite is difficult to grow into regular particles. On the other hand, when the heat-treatment time exceeds 36 hours, a problem arises in that the shape and structure of particles are changed as the particles grow larger, and thus it is difficult to obtain whitlockite. In particular, as the scale of the process increases, the quality and yield of whitlockite may significantly change depending on the heat-treatment time.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">More preferably, the heat-treatment step may be performed for 12 to 24 hours. When the heat-treatment time is within the above range, it is possible to produce whitlockite having a uniform shape and high stability in a certain yield even when a scaled-up process is applied.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the method for producing whitlockite, the calcium ion source material may be any one selected from the group consisting of calcium hypochlorite, calcium perchlorate, calcium bromide, calcium iodide, calcium nitrate, calcium chloride, calcium acetate, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, the calcium ion source material may be calcium chloride. When calcium chloride is used, a stable reaction may be exhibited even in a large-scale process at low temperature, and considerable simplification of the process of mixing the solutions may also be achieved. In particular, the use of calcium chloride has an advantage over the use of calcium hydroxide or other calcium ion source materials in that the particle shape, purity and yield of whitlockite are significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the method for producing whitlockite, the magnesium ion source material may be any one selected from the group consisting of magnesium perchlorate, magnesium bromide, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfide, magnesium nitrate, magnesium acetate, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, the magnesium ion source material may be magnesium chloride. When magnesium chloride is used, a stable reaction may be exhibited even in a large-scale process at low temperature, and considerable simplification of the process of mixing the solutions may also be achieved. In particular, the use of magnesium chloride has an advantage over the use of magnesium hydroxide or other magnesium ion source materials in that the particle shape, purity and yield of whitlockite are significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the method for producing whitlockite, the phosphate source material may further comprise any one selected from the group consisting of calcium phosphate, calcium metaphosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium phosphate, magnesium hydrogen phosphate, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Preferably, the phosphate source material in the third solution may be sodium hydrogen phosphate. When sodium hydrogen phosphate is used, a stable reaction may be exhibited even in a large-scale process at low temperature, and considerable simplification of the process of mixing the solutions may also be achieved. In particular, if a phosphate source material other than sodium hydrogen phosphate is used, an effective reaction does not proceed in a scaled-up process, and thus whitlockite having a certain purity and particle shape may not be produced in the scaled-up process. Specifically, if phosphoric acid is used, a problem arises in that whitlockite having a certain purity and particle shape may not be produced when the process is scaled up beyond a lab-scale experimental process of producing whitlockite in &#x3bc;g to mg scale. Thus, if phosphoric acid is used, a problem arises in industrially meaningful mass production is practically impossible. In addition, if calcium phosphate, calcium metaphosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, magnesium phosphate, or magnesium hydrogen phosphate is used, whitlockite having a certain purity and particle shape may not be produced in a mass production process which is beyond a small-scale process, similar to the use of phosphoric acid.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, when sodium hydrogen phosphate is used, the shape, purity and yield of whitlockite may be maintained without changes even in the process of producing whitlockite in kg scale. Thus, when whitlockite is produced by a mass production process, it is most preferable to use sodium hydrogen phosphate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the method for producing whitlockite, the step of preparing a precursor solution may comprise preparing a mixed solution by mixing the first solution with the second solution, and then mixing the third solution with the mixed solution.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the third solution is mixed with the mixture of the first solution and the second solution as described above, it is possible to produce whitlockite using more various calcium ion source materials, magnesium ion source materials and phosphate source materials.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the step of preparing a precursor solution may comprise preparing a mixed solution by mixing the first solution and the second solution, and then adding the mixed solution dropwise to the third solution.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Conversely, when a certain amount of phosphoric acid is added dropwise to the mixture of the calcium ion source material and the magnesium ion source material, types of compounds that may be used as the calcium ion source material, the magnesium ion source material and the phosphate source material may be relatively diverse. However, if the process is scaled up to a certain level or higher, a problem arises in that the purity or particle shape and yield of whitlockite are greatly reduced.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">However, in the case in which the mixture of the calcium ion source material and the magnesium ion source material is added dropwise to the phosphate source material as described above, compounds that may be used as the calcium ion source material, the magnesium ion source material and the phosphate source material are limited, but there is an advantage in that the purity or particle shape and yield of the produced whitlockite may be maintained even when the process is scaled up. Thus, this case may be suitable for industrially meaningful mass production.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the method for producing whitlockite, the step of preparing a precursor solution may comprise mixing the first solution, the second solution and the third solution together simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the solutions are mixed together simultaneously as described above, there is an advantage in that the process efficiency is increased due to simplification of the process. In particular, when this mixing method is applied to a large-scale process, the advantage becomes greater. However, a problem arises in that the types of calcium ion source material, magnesium ion source material and phosphate source material that may be used are limited. For example, if calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and phosphoric acid are mixed together, a problem arises in that whitlockite cannot be produced by the above-described process because the reaction occurs rapidly. In addition, a problem arises in that it is more difficult to produce whitlockite not only in a large-scale process but also in a small-scale process.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Preferably, when the first solution, the second solution and the third solution are mixed together simultaneously, the calcium ion source material may be calcium chloride, the magnesium ion source material may be magnesium chloride, the phosphate source material may be sodium hydrogen phosphate, and the process may be applied to a large-scale process which is a scaled-up process. In this case, it is possible to scale-up the process and to effectively produce whitlockite having an excellent purity, appearance and yield in an environment in which the materials come into contact and react with one another.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, a method for producing whitlockite according to one embodiment of the present invention may comprise: a step of preparing a mixed solution by mixing a first solution containing a calcium (Ca) ion source material and a second solution containing a magnesium (Mg) ion source material; a step of preparing a precursor solution by adding and mixing the mixed solution with a third solution containing a phosphoric acid (PO<sub>4</sub>) source material; a heat-treatment step of heat-treating the precursor solution; and a step of separating and purifying a precipitate formed in the solution, after the heat-treatment step.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the method for producing whitlockite, the calcium ion source material and the magnesium ion source material may be mixed together such that the molar ratio between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> may be 10:1 to 1:4.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the molar ratio is out of the above-described range, a problem arises in that whitlockite is not produced, but newberyite, hydroxyapatite, etc. are produced, or newberyite, hydroxyapatite, brushite, etc. are produced together with whitlockite in uncontrollable amounts.

In this case, the purity of whitlockite is lowered, and the contents of hydroxyapatite and brushite produced together with whitlockite cannot be predicted. Thus, if hydroxyapatite and the like are produced together with whitlockite in unpredictable amounts as described above, they are simply classified as low-purity whitlockite, and a problem arises in that the above product cannot be used for a specific purpose.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, as an artificial bone material, a mixture obtained by mixing whitlockite and hydroxyapatite at a certain ratio is used in many cases.

Thereby, it can be confirmed that, in the case of the L1CP-1, L 1 CP-2 and L 1 CP-3 compositions, it was difficult to perform process scale-up for mass production. Accordingly, the L2CP and L3CP processes did not need to be performed. On the other hand, it can be confirmed that, in the case of the L1CP-3 composition, whitlockite was produced in L 1 CP-3, L2CP-3, and L3CP-3. Therefore, it can be seen that, in the case of the above range, whitlockite could be mass-produced through the scale-up of the process.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0153">In addition, the production yield was the highest in the case of L2CP-3, and L3CP-3 showed a yield similar to that of L1CP-1, but had excellent process efficiency due to process simplification. In particular, higher scale-up level may be more advantageous in terms of the process efficiency.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0154">Specifically, L3CP-3 and L 1 CP-1 showed a production yield corresponding to about 70 to 80% of the production yield shown by L2CP-3. Meanwhile, L3CP-3 showed very higher process efficiency than L1CP-1. Specifically, for example, in the case of L3CP-3, the number of reactions can be reduced to half or less of that in L 1 CP-1, and the process may be performed using an in-line mixer or the like without a reactor due to the process of mixing the materials together simultaneously, unlike the case of L1CP-1 which necessarily requires a reactor. Thus, in the case of L3CP-3, it is possible to greatly reduce the process equipment, and the greater the size of the process, the greater the advantage.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3</heading><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Experiment on WH Synthesis Conditions</heading><p id="p-0180" num="0155">To confirm the production yield of whitlockite depending on reaction conditions, the reactor was configured to have such a size that the final product was obtained in mg scale.
