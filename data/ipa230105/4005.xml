Another part of the light (for example, dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) directly reaches the human eyes through the beam splitter <b>2</b>.

Therefore, the light emitted by the light-emitting source <b>10</b> is prevented from reaching human eyes, thereby eliminating stray light and improving the display effect of the near-eye display device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, to achieve better imaging quality, a second angle is provided between a transmission axis of the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b> and an optical axis of the first phase retarder <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the second angle may be 45 degrees. In this case, the second light converted by the first phase retarder <b>22</b> is circularly polarized light, and further obtained imaging quality is good.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the second angle may be, for example, any other angle other than 45 degrees. In this case, the second light converted by the first phase retarder <b>22</b> is elliptically polarized light.

For example, if the third light is P-polarized light, the fifth light is S-polarized light. If the third light is S-polarized light, the fifth light is P-polarized light.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It may be understood that in this embodiment, by using the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> with a vibration direction orthogonal to the vibration direction of the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b>, the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> can reflect linearly polarized light transmitted from the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b>. Through the cooperation between the second phase retarder <b>32</b> and the first phase retarder <b>22</b>, a vibration direction of the linearly polarized light transmitted from the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b> can be adjusted, so that the linearly polarized light can be reflected by the reflective polarizer <b>31</b>, and a vibration direction of linearly polarized light reflected by the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> to return to the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b> can also be adjusted, so that the linearly polarized light can be absorbed by the absorptive polarizer <b>21</b>. Therefore, light emitted by the light-emitting source <b>10</b> is prevented from reaching human eyes, thereby eliminating stray light and improving the display effect of the near-eye display device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, both the first phase retarder <b>22</b> and the second phase retarder <b>32</b> may be quarter-wave plates.

The absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> may be on a side of the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> away from the light conversion unit <b>20</b>, and a vibration direction of the absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> is the same as the vibration direction of the reflective polarizer <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, when an environment in which the optical system is in has ambient light A that is transmitted to the first reflection unit <b>30</b> from a side of human eyes, the absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> can absorb all light with vibration directions different from the vibration direction of the absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> from the ambient light A. Therefore, polarized light that is in the ambient light A and has a vibration direction orthogonal to the vibration direction of the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> can be prevented from being reflected by the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> to the human eyes to form stray light and cause visual interference, and polarized light transmitted from the reflective polarizer <b>31</b> can be directly transmitted from the absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> to reach the human eyes, so that imaging is not affected.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the reflective polarizer <b>31</b>, the second phase retarder <b>32</b>, and the absorptive polarizer <b>33</b> are adhered to each other.

The eighth light is then reflected by the second reflection unit <b>40</b> to the first reflection unit <b>30</b> and converted by the first reflection unit <b>30</b> into a ninth light to pass through the first reflection unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, the sixth light may be natural light, the seventh light may be circularly polarized light, the eighth light may be linearly polarized light, and a ninth light may be linearly polarized light. A vibration direction of the eighth light is orthogonal to a vibration direction of the ninth light. For example, if the eighth light is S-polarized light, the ninth light is P-polarized light. In some embodiments, if the eighth light is P-polarized light, the ninth light is S-polarized light.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It may be understood that the light emitted by the light-emitting source <b>10</b> sequentially passes through the light conversion unit <b>20</b>, the first reflection unit <b>30</b>, and the second reflection unit <b>40</b> to be projected to the first reflection unit <b>30</b>, and is converted by the first reflection unit <b>30</b> to reach human eyes to form a virtual image, thereby implementing near-eye display.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that, for an AR device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second reflection unit <b>40</b> may allow ambient light (such as ambient light B shown in the figures) from a side away from the first reflection unit <b>30</b> to pass through. This part of ambient light passes through the second reflection unit <b>40</b> to enter the first reflection unit <b>30</b>, and is converted by the first reflection unit <b>30</b> to pass through the first reflection unit <b>30</b> to reach the human eyes to form a real image. Therefore, the formed real image and virtual image are combined and augment each other to form augmented reality AR display.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the second reflection unit <b>40</b> may include a curved lens. A surface <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the curved lens facing the first reflection unit <b>30</b> is a plane, a surface of the curved lens away from the first reflection unit <b>30</b> is a curved surface <b>40</b><i>a</i>, and a concave surface of the curved surface <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be formed as a reflecting surface. Therefore, a dispersion degree of the curved surface can be reduced, which facilitates more stable reflection and transmission of light in the second reflection unit <b>40</b> and does not affect the imaging effect of the optical system.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the optical system provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure may further include a lens <b>50</b>. The lens <b>50</b> is arranged between the light-emitting source <b>10</b> and the light conversion unit <b>20</b>, and may correct the light emitted by the light-emitting source <b>10</b>, thereby eliminating the aberration and therefore further improving the display effect of the near-eye display device. During application, a quantity of lenses <b>50</b> may be set according to an actual need. For example, there may be one or more lenses <b>50</b>. This is not specifically limited herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, black dots indicate that vibration directions are perpendicular to a paper surface, and rotation arrows indicate rotation directions of light.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The embodiments of this specification further provide a near-eye display device, including the optical system provided in the foregoing one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It may be understood that in the embodiments of this specification, the near-eye display device may be an augmented reality device, a Virtual Reality (VR) device, or another near-eye display device, which is not specifically limited herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;include&#x201d; or any other variation thereof in this specification is intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, which specifies the presence of stated processes, methods, objects, or apparatuses, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other processes, methods, objects, or apparatuses.
