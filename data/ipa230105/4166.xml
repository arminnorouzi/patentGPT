To avoid these inefficiencies, &#x201c;safeguards&#x201d; may be put in place, such as switching operation of a tractor and/or a tool to manual operation, preventing dispensing of a product unless it is guaranteed that a product will be dispensed where it is supposed to be dispensed, and so on. However, the safeguards themselves ensure inefficiencies in that they prioritize avoiding one dimension of inefficiency (e.g., loss of product) in exchange for an inefficiency in another (e.g., loss of time and loss of fuel).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Systems and methods are disclosed herein for improving predictive techniques in autonomous farming equipment. The improvement in predictive techniques incorporates parameters of tractor operation (e.g., speed, acceleration, turn parameters), to predict when a tractor is a certain distance away from where a product should be dispensed (e.g., a distance that would be covered in an amount of time corresponding to a mechanical delay time of dispensing product using a tool). A tractor controller may thus cause a dispensing of product to begin ahead of when a tractor tool is located where the product is to be dispensed. As an example, a planter or air seeder tool might take five seconds to discharge seeds from a time at which a dispense operation begins. The tractor controller as disclosed herein would enable the planter tool to begin a dispense operation five seconds before arriving at a plantable site, thus ensuring that product is not lost while optimizing for time and fuel expenditure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an embodiment, a tractor controller detects a trigger to dispense a product using a tool operably coupled to a tractor. The controller determines whether the tractor is in an automated mode, the automated mode enabling autonomous speed and direction navigation of the tractor. Responsive to determining that the tractor is not in the automated mode, the controller determines whether the tool is in a ready state. Responsive to determining that the tool is in the ready state, the controller commands the tool to dispense the product, where the tool is not commanded to dispense the product until the tool is in the ready state. Responsive to determining that the tractor is in the automated mode, the controller commands the tool to dispense the product without regard to whether the tool is in the ready state.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a tractor controller (or controller implemented in the tool itself, in the cloud, or otherwise communicatively coupled to the components discussed herein) detects a trigger to dispense a product at a dispense point using a tool operably coupled to a tractor. In response to detecting the trigger, the tractor controller determines a delay time between commanding the tool to dispense the product and the product actually being dispensed. The tractor controller determines a release point based on operating parameters of the tractor, the release point being a point at which the tractor is predicted to be an amount of time away from the dispense point equal to the delay time, determines that the tractor has reached the release point, and commands the tool to dispense the product, wherein the product reaches the dispense point based on the delay time.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed embodiments have other advantages and features which will be more readily apparent from the detailed description, the appended claims, and the accompanying figures (or drawings).

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, tractor <b>100</b> is operably coupled to tool <b>110</b>. Tractor <b>100</b> may be any vehicle that is operable to drag or carry tool <b>110</b>. While tractor <b>100</b> is typically a tractor operating on farmland, any other vehicle that is not a tractor but is capable of dragging or carrying tool <b>110</b>, or being integrated with tool <b>110</b>, may be used wherever a tractor is mentioned herein (e.g., a self-propelled machine, where a tractor and tool are integrated such as a self-propelled sprayer). Tool <b>110</b> is a tool operated in conjunction with activity of a tractor that is capable of dispensing product. The term product, as used herein, may refer to any solid, fluid, or gas releasable by tool <b>110</b>. For example, tool <b>110</b> may be device for planting seeds, releasing fertilizer, releasing water, releasing pesticides, and for dispensing any other product, as well as tools that perform other functions unrelated to releasing product, such as tillage tools for preparing soil and/or indicating whether soil is at a working depth, where double tilling without referencing such an indicator could result in wasted fuel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;operably coupled&#x201d; as used herein with respect to tool <b>110</b> and tractor <b>100</b> may refer to either or both of a physical attachment and a data network attachment that enables data communications to occur between tool <b>110</b> and one or more controllers of tractor <b>100</b>. For example, the data communications may enable tool <b>110</b> to receive commands (e.g., dispense product) and/or sensor information (e.g., tractor is accelerating at X pace; tractor is traveling at Y speed, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of exemplary modules and databases used by a tractor controller. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, tractor controller <b>200</b> includes automation switching module <b>231</b>, tool readiness module <b>232</b>, timing module <b>233</b>, dispense module <b>234</b>, mechanical delay data <b>240</b>, and tractor area maps <b>241</b>. The modules and databases depicted in tractor controller <b>200</b> are merely exemplary; fewer or more modules and/or databases may be used to achieve the functionality described herein. Moreover, while the databases are depicted as part of tractor controller <b>200</b>, this is for convenience; the databases may be in whole or in part distributed on other devices and/or on a cloud implementation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;tractor controller,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to a controller that performs functionality associated with a tractor. A tractor controller may issue commands to components of a tractor (e.g., adjust speed, acceleration, heading, etc.). A tractor controller may issue commands to tools operably coupled to the tractor (e.g., planter, sprayer, etc.). The tractor controller may include a plurality of controllers, and some of those controllers need not be physically located on the tractor. For example, controllers within a tool and/or cloud controllers that issue commands associated with a tractor fall within the ambit of the term &#x201c;tractor controller.&#x201d; A tractor controller may receive inputs from any sensors, including those onboard a tractor, those on-board a tool, and other sensors.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Automation switching module <b>231</b> determines whether a command is received to switch automation of tractor <b>100</b> to or from an automated mode. The term automated mode as used herein may refer to a mode having partial or full automation (that is, some or no human intervention is required). Automated modes may be segmented into different types of modes, including a mode where control of activities of tractor <b>100</b> is automated for predetermined conditions (e.g., automate speed and acceleration where a tractor is to drive straight, automate speed and acceleration where the ground underneath the tractor is level within a tolerance of a threshold number of degrees, etc.). For such a semi-automated mode, automation switching module <b>200</b> may alert a driver (e.g., through an audio or haptic alert) to take over, where operation of the tractor may cease when the predetermined condition ends (e.g., a turn is required that breaks the straightaway). Other automated modes may include full automation modes (e.g., tractor automation occurs for all or most circumstances).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Automation switching module <b>231</b> switches between manual and one or more automation modes based on receipt of commands to do so and/or based on a condition being met. For example, where a user, such as a tractor operator, inputs a command to switch to or from an automated mode, automation switching module <b>231</b> switches the mode accordingly. As another example, where a condition is met to switch to an automated mode (e.g., a straight-away is reached), or to switch to a manual mode (e.g., a curve is reached), automation switching module <b>231</b> may switch the mode. Switching may occur seamlessly, or may occur subject to automation switching module <b>231</b> prompting an operator of tractor <b>100</b> for permission to switch modes, and doing so responsive to interaction by the operator indicating approval of the prompt.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Tool readiness module <b>232</b> determines whether a tool is ready to dispense product. Determining whether a tool is ready to dispense product amounts to determining whether one or more conditions are met that are prerequisite to a tool dispensing product. Tool readiness module <b>232</b> determines whether those prerequisite conditions are met, and based on that determination, outputs a state of the tool, the state being either that the tool is, or is not, ready to dispense product. As an example, a planter may be in a ready state when it is physically staked or lowered in the ground, and may not be ready unless that condition is met (e.g., because seeds would be caused to be released in the air which results in loss of seeds due to planting in unplantable area).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, tool readiness module <b>232</b> begins a determination (or a re-determination) of whether a given tool is ready to dispense product responsive to detecting a trigger. The term trigger, as used herein, may refer to a scenario where a tool is commanded to dispense product, either when received or at a time defined by the trigger. A trigger may be an express command to dispense product (e.g., an operator of a tractor commands a planter to dispense seeds). A trigger may be an implicit command determined by tractor controller <b>200</b> based on a predefined condition occurring (e.g., a map from tractor area maps <b>241</b> shows plantable area where seeds are to be dispensed, and identifies a trigger as the tractor approaches and/or reaches the plantable area).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, dispense module <b>234</b> detects the trigger responsive to determining that the tool will reach a site designated for dispensing the product in an amount of time corresponding to a mechanical delay by the tool in dispensing the product. To determine the mechanical delay, timing module <b>233</b> may access mechanical delay data <b>240</b>, which may include one or more data structures that map different tools to different mechanical delay times. For example, a planter that takes five seconds to lower into a planting site would indicate a mechanical delay of five seconds. As another example, a sprayer that takes half of one second to activate (e.g., to move a nozzle from a closed to an open position) would have an indication in the data structure of a mechanical delay of half of one second. In an embodiment, there may be many different mechanical delays (e.g., delays relating to raising or lowering a tool, delays relating to starting and stopping dispensing, etc.), and the delays in the aggregate may be accounted for in determining a mechanical delay time.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Dispense module <b>234</b> accesses information from tractor area maps <b>241</b> and calculates an estimated time that tractor <b>100</b> will arrive at a location where a given tool is to be used based on sensor data (e.g., speed, acceleration, yaw, etc.) For example, determining that the tractor will reach the site in the amount of time may include determining a speed of the tractor, determining an acceleration of the tractor, and calculating, based on the speed and acceleration of the tractor, a point from which the tractor is the amount of time away from the site. As another example, where a curved trajectory exists between a current position of the tractor and the site, determining that the tractor will reach the site in the amount of time further may include dispense module <b>234</b> determining a yaw of the curve, wherein the calculating of the point is further based on the yaw of the curve. In an embodiment, the speed and acceleration vary by predetermined amounts along the curved trajectory, and so the calculating is further based on the variance in the speed and the acceleration. Dispense module <b>234</b> compares the estimated time to the mechanical delay time, and when they are equal (e.g., within a threshold tolerance), dispense module <b>234</b> determines that the tool will reach the site designated for dispensing the product in the amount of time corresponding to the mechanical delay for that tool.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Responsive to detecting a trigger for a given tool, tool readiness module <b>232</b> determines whether the given tool is ready to dispense product. That is, is the tool physically in a ready position. For example, with reference to a planter, a planter is in a ready position if it is physically staked into the ground, such that seeds will arrive at a definitive location of where the planter is located. This is to be distinguished from non-ready positions, such as a planter being retracted from the ground and/or in a resting position, or being in a &#x201c;transport&#x201d; mode where the unit is generally straight behind the tractor, rather than perpendicular). Tool readiness module <b>232</b> determines whether the tool is ready for product by transmitting a communication to a controller of the tool, and receiving a response indicating a state of the tool, the state being either a ready state or not. Readiness may also depend on whether a dispensing system is ready, whether an ancillary system is ready (e.g., power generation, etc.), and the like. In some embodiments, tractor controller <b>200</b> may be required to determine a ready state for a tool before dispensing products. However, in other embodiments, tractor controller <b>200</b> may dispense product without a requirement of a ready state.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning for the moment to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a data flow for determining whether to dispense a product. Data flow <b>300</b> begins responsive to determining a trigger, at which time tool readiness module <b>232</b> determines whether a gateway condition is true. The term gateway condition, as used herein, may refer to a state of the tractor and/or tool that, if true, allows for further processing in a tool readiness determination, and if false is dispositive that the tool is not ready to dispense the product. Gateway conditions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> include conditions <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. Condition <b>310</b> asks whether a tool is ready for product, which is determined by tool readiness module <b>232</b>. Dispense module <b>234</b> may operate in parallel with tool readiness module <b>232</b>, and may, regardless of whether a tool is ready, analyze for condition <b>320</b>. Condition <b>320</b> asks whether a machine (e.g., tractor <b>100</b>) operating the tool is in a fully automated mode. For example, where a tool is a planter and the tractor is operating in a fully automated mode, with knowledge of every move the tractor will make in the next five seconds and with knowledge that the delay time of dispensing seeds is five seconds, seeds may be dispensed five seconds in advance of the tool being ready and still reach their desired destination. Where either of gateway conditions <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are true, process <b>300</b> continues; otherwise, process <b>300</b> ends or is repeated until either of gateway conditions <b>310</b> or <b>320</b> are true. Gateway conditions <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are merely exemplary. While they are depicted in the alternative, gateway conditions may be used in the conjunctive. Moreover, any condition and any number of conditions may be used as gateway conditions (e.g., depending on which tool is implicated by tool readiness module <b>232</b>). Gateway conditions other than <b>310</b> may be monitored using dispense module <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Process <b>300</b> goes on to dispense module <b>234</b> monitoring for triggers <b>330</b> and <b>340</b> where requisite gateway conditions are true. As depicted, trigger <b>330</b> corresponds to a condition corresponding to an implied trigger (e.g., an automated system is navigating to a place where product is to be dispensed at a known time or place). Trigger <b>340</b> corresponds to an express command. Where a trigger occurs and a gateway condition is true, then process <b>300</b> goes on to assign a tool a state <b>350</b> indicating that product can be dispensed. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, state <b>350</b> indicates that tractor controller <b>200</b> is to meter the dispensing of the product (e.g., product may be immediately dispensed, or may be held back until such a time that product should be dispensed, such as a time-distance from a plantable site corresponding to a time delay of a planter). Because condition <b>310</b> does not need to be true to reach state <b>350</b>, product can be dispensed regardless of whether a tool is ready to dispense the product (e.g., where condition <b>320</b> is true). This may be considered to be removal of a safeguard (e.g., of requiring a planter to be in the ground) given that the process itself ensures accurate dispensation of product without the safeguard. In an embodiment, rather than beginning the determination responsive to detecting a trigger, process <b>300</b> may continually (e.g., periodically, a-periodically, or responsive to a predefined condition) determine whether a trigger exists simultaneous with a gateway condition being true, and based on such a determination, tool readiness module <b>230</b> may determine that a state <b>350</b> is to be assigned for the tool.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Exemplary Data Flows</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate one embodiment of an end-to-end data flow for performing an operation. The data flow depicted across <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> is merely exemplary of one use case. The term machine, as used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, generally refers to a tractor (e.g., tractor <b>100</b>) operably coupled to a tool (e.g., tool <b>110</b>), but can be any other machine defined with respect to the scope of the term tractor above. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, for self-propelled machines (e.g., motorized machines that are fully automated), data used to predict location at any given time may be based on global positioning system (GPS) and/or inertial data assumed to be at tractor controller <b>200</b> of that machine. Moreover, in some embodiments, GPS and/or inertial data may be at a controller on-board tool <b>110</b> (also referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> as an &#x201c;implement&#x201d;); however, where no such controller is present, data at tractor controller <b>200</b> of the machine may be used instead.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Process <b>400</b> begins with the beginning of an operation <b>402</b> detected by tractor controller <b>200</b>. An operation as used herein may refer to a particular use of a tool or activity of a tractor. Tractor controller <b>200</b> determines <b>404</b> whether section control is enabled. The term section control, as used herein, refers to a semi-automated mode where tractor controller <b>200</b> assumes full control of the tractor in some conditions (e.g., on straight, flat land) and potentially with some limitations (e.g., speed is constant). The term &#x201c;section&#x201d; may refer to an area of a space where tool <b>110</b> is to be used (e.g., a section of a farm) in a consistent manner (e.g., in this section, drive the tractor forward at a constant speed and plant seed at a certain metered rate). Where section control is not enabled, automated operation does not occur, and the operation is manually performed</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Where section control is enabled, tractor controller <b>200</b> determines <b>406</b> whether speed automation is active. Speed automation refers to automation of a change in speed, rather than automation of maintenance of speed. For example, where tractor controller <b>200</b> is empowered to change speed based on sensor data (e.g., map data, obstacle sensors, camera input, etc.), tractor controller <b>200</b> may accelerate tractor <b>100</b> or decelerate tractor <b>100</b> accordingly where speed automation is active. Where speed automation is active, tractor controller determines <b>416</b> that it does not need to adjust a lookahead time, and instead use the target speed determined through speed automation (e.g., target speed <b>420</b>). The term lookahead time, as used herein, refers to a time ahead of a current time at which a tool may be operated (e.g., to dispense product). A lookahead time where speed automation is not active would be inaccurate if any change in speed were to occur between a current time and a lookahead time, because the lookahead time would not account for the change in speed. Thus, responsive to determining that speed automation is not active, tractor controller <b>200</b> performs activities (<b>408</b>-<b>414</b>) to determine an adjusted lookahead time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When calculating an adjusted lookahead time, tractor controller <b>200</b> calculates <b>410</b> a statistical representation (e.g., average) of acceleration (e.g., based on data from accelerometer sensor and/or speed sensor, such as using <b>408</b> a GPS-based speed based on a change of GPS coordinates of tractor <b>100</b> over time). Tractor controller <b>200</b> then calculates <b>414</b> the adjusted lookahead time for acceleration based on a current speed of a machine. The calculation may use <b>412</b> the mechanical delay time of a given tool to determine when to initiate operation of the tool (e.g., an offset of the mechanical delay time prior to the lookahead time). Where the tractor is turning, turn information may feed back into the calculation <b>410</b> of the average acceleration and/or the calculation <b>414</b> of the adjusted lookahead time (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Moving on to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, tractor determines <b>422</b> whether steering automation is active and if so, whether an error in steering automation is below a threshold. The term steering automation, as used herein, may refer to an automatic turning of wheels of tractor <b>100</b> to follow a path. The error and threshold may refer to a comparison of an expected position based on a predefined path or a path determined based on predefined parameters, and an actual path, where the threshold mandates a maximum deviation from that path. The term path information, as used herein, may refer to data that indicates a path of the tractor, or from which a path of the tractor may be derived. Where determination <b>422</b> is not satisfied, tractor controller calculates <b>428</b> a turn radius based on kinematics, which may be influenced based on an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)-based yaw rate <b>426</b>. Where determination <b>422</b> is satisfied, tractor controller determines <b>424</b> whether a path geometry is available (e.g., based on a path determined using steering automation and/or a path defined by a map). Where path geometry is available, tractor controller <b>200</b> uses the path geometry to calculate <b>450</b> position and heading (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, on the basis of path data <b>448</b> and guidance errors <b>452</b> (e.g., deviation from path, where current deviation is accounted for in determining what commands are to be issued for a future position). While position is described with respect to a position of a tractor, the term position may refer to the position of the tool. Otherwise, tractor controller <b>200</b> calculates <b>432</b> a turn radius based on the path curvature <b>430</b>. Path curvature is determined based on future points the tractor is instructed to navigate to. This differs from kinematics determination because the current motion is used to predict what the future curvature will be.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Tractor controller <b>200</b> determines <b>434</b> whether the equipment is turning, and if not, determines <b>436</b> that the equipment heading is unchanged, and goes on to calculate <b>440</b> the lookahead distance (that is, distance to a point where a tool is to be used, such as to dispense product) based on the lookahead time and the current and/or target speed. Where the equipment is turning, tractor controller <b>200</b> calculates <b>438</b> a new equipment heading based on yaw rate, turn radius, and adjusted lookahead time, and goes on to calculate <b>442</b> the lookahead distance based on the lookahead time, the turn radius, and the yaw rate. Regardless of how the lookahead time was calculated, tractor controller <b>200</b> calculates <b>446</b> the projected equipment position using the lookahead time. This may be based on information <b>444</b> including a GPS-based course on the basis of a point representative of the equipment center's north and east. Information <b>444</b> may be an input used to transform from tractor-centric coordinates (e.g., 0,0 is based on where the tractor is, and up is always up) to real-world coordinates (e.g., 0,0 is in a defined spot in the world, and north is up). In general, process <b>400</b> is calculated relative to a tractor's location, but may be translated using information <b>444</b> to real-world coordinates.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Where necessary (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>), tractor controller <b>200</b> normalizes <b>454</b> the equipment heading (e.g., to a value between 0 and 2*pi). The equipment heading is then used to determine the operation (e.g., to determine when to begin dispensing product, such as seed, and this can be regardless of whether a tool is in a ready position). For as long as the operation continues <b>456</b>, tractor controller <b>200</b> may repeat the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> (e.g., shown in line C), and then may determine <b>458</b> that the operation is complete (e.g., seed has been sufficiently dispensed over plantable area).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of an exemplary data flow for dispensing product by a tractor. Process <b>500</b> begins with a processor (e.g., processor <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> of tractor controller <b>200</b> of tractor <b>100</b>) detecting <b>502</b> a trigger to dispense a product using a tool operably coupled to a tractor (e.g., tool <b>110</b> of tractor <b>100</b>). The processor determines <b>504</b> whether the tractor is in an automated mode (e.g., using automation switching module <b>231</b>), the automated mode enabling autonomous speed and direction navigation of the tractor. Responsive to determining that the tractor is not in the automated mode, the tractor determines <b>506</b> whether the tool is in a ready state (e.g., using tool readiness module <b>232</b>), and, responsive to determining that the tool is in the ready state, the processor commands <b>508</b> the tool to dispense the product, where the tool is not commanded to dispense the product until the tool is in the ready state. Responsive to determining that the tractor is in the automated mode, the processor commands <b>510</b> the tool to dispense the product without regard to whether the tool is in the ready state.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of an exemplary data flow for pre-charging a tool. The term pre-charge, as used herein, may refer to the act of dispensing product prior to a tool being situated at a site designated for the product, such that by the time the product exits the tool, the product lands at the site designated for the product. Process <b>600</b> begins with a processor (e.g., processor <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> of tractor controller <b>200</b> of tractor <b>100</b>) detecting <b>602</b> a trigger to dispense a product at a dispense point using a tool operably coupled to a tractor (e.g., tool <b>110</b> of tractor <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The processor determines <b>604</b>, in response to detecting the trigger, a delay time between commanding the tool to dispense the product and the product actually being dispensed. The delay time may be a mechanical delay associated with the tool, such as a 5 second delay between a seed being released and a seed reaching the nozzle of a planter. The processor determines <b>606</b> a release point based on operating parameters of the tractor, where the release point is a point at which the tractor is predicted to be an amount of time away from the dispense point that is equal to the delay time. For example, the processor may determine various parameters such as acceleration, speed, turn radius, and so on (all described in the foregoing), and may use this information in conjunction with the delay time to determine at what point to dispense the product (e.g., following the planter-seed example, knowledge of the operating parameters of the tractor enables the processor to determine when the tractor is 5 seconds away from a dispense point).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The processor determines <b>608</b> that the tractor has reached the release point (e.g., the tractor is 5 seconds away), and commands <b>610</b> the tool to dispense the product, such that the product reaches the dispense point based on the delay time. Process <b>600</b> functions whether or not the tractor is in an automated mode or in a semi-automated or manual mode. Pre-defined maps and/or boundaries may be used, where a path plan (e.g., a plan as to where a tractor is to drive that optionally includes designations of operating parameters at any given point such as speed, acceleration, turns, etc., and any other relevant information such as dispense points) is indicated by the map/boundary information. Process <b>600</b> enables a safeguard to be disabled, the safeguard preventing loss of product by ensuring the tool is at a dispense site before enabling dispensing to occur, by factoring in mechanical delay and operating parameters to ensure product will not be wasted if released early (e.g., at a release point), and when the product reaches, e.g., the nozzle of a planter, the product will fall into a dispense point.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Computing Machine Architecture</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">FIG.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;hardware-implemented module&#x201d; refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times.

In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output.
