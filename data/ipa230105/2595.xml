id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to: copolymers of ethylene and &#x3b1;-olefins having intermediate branching; continuous polymerization processes to manufacture such copolymers; analytical methods to characterize such copolymers; and the utility of such copolymers in a myriad of manufactured articles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The polymer industry is in constant need of improved ethylene interpolymer products, e.g. in flexible film applications such as food packaging, shrink films and stretch films. As disclosed hereinafter, ethylene interpolymer products having intermediate branching have performance attributes that are advantageous in film applications. Relative to competitive ethylene interpolymer products of similar density and melt index, films produced from intermediately branched ethylene interpolymer products have, for example, higher dart impact, higher tensile strength and/or improved optical properties, such as higher film 45&#xb0; gloss and lower film haze. The polymer industry is also in need of improved ethylene interpolymer products for rigid applications, including, but not limited to containers, lids, caps and toys, etc. Ethylene interpolymer products having intermediate branching also have utility in such rigid applications. Ethylene interpolymer products having intermediate branching were produced in a continuous solution polymerization process. Solution polymerization processes are typically carried out at temperatures above the melting point of the ethylene interpolymer being synthesized. In a typical solution polymerization process, catalyst components, solvent, monomer(s) and hydrogen are fed under pressure to one or more reactors. A wide variety of vessels (e.g. polymerization reactors, etc.) and vessel arrangements can be used under a wide range of process conditions allowing the production of a wide variety of ethylene interpolymer products. Post reactor, the polymerization reaction is typically quenched by adding a catalyst deactivator and passivated by adding an acid scavenger. Once passivated, the polymer solution is forwarded to polymer recovery operations where the ethylene interpolymer product is separated from process solvent, unreacted residual ethylene and unreacted optional &#x3b1;-olefin(s).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this application, ethylene interpolymer products having intermediate branching are disclosed, as well as a process to manufacture such products and a method to measure the Non-Comonomer Index Distribution (NCID<sub>i</sub>) to quantify the amount of intermediate branching in such products. Intermediate branching was defined as branching that was longer than the branch length due to comonomer (e.g. C<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>6 </sub>branches from 1-hexene or 1-octene comonomers, respectively) and shorter than the entanglement molecular weight, M<sub>e </sub>(M<sub>e </sub>is a well-known concept in polymer physics). The amount of intermediate branching in the disclosed ethylene interpolymer products was characterized by the &#x2018;Non-Comonomer Index (NCI)&#x2019;, as well as the &#x2018;Non-Comonomer Index Distribution (NCID<sub>i</sub>), which was generated using triple detection cross fractionation chromatography (3D-CFC) techniques. Ethylene interpolymer products, having intermediate branching, may, or may not contain long chain branching as characterized by the Long Chain Branching Factor (LCBF).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Long chain branches were branches that were greater than or equal to M<sub>e</sub>; long chain branches were macromolecular in nature and were evident in rheological measurements. The advantages of ethylene interpolymer products having intermediate branching in films applications is disclosed and compared with comparative ethylene interpolymer product films that did not contain intermediate branching.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following embodiments are provided for the purpose of a specific disclosure for the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of this disclosure, hereinafter embodiment [<b>1</b>], is fully described immediately below.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">[I]-1.

In the polyethylene art, the one or more additional monomers are called &#x201c;comonomer(s)&#x201d; and often include &#x3b1;-olefins. The term &#x201c;homopolymer&#x201d; refers to a polymer that contains only one type of monomer. Common ethylene polymers include high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), ultralow density polyethylene (ULDPE), plastomer and elastomers. The term ethylene polymer includes polymers produced in high pressure polymerization processes; non-limiting examples include low density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and metal salts of ethylene acrylic acid (commonly referred to as ionomers). The term ethylene polymer includes block copolymers which may include 2 to 4 comonomers. The term ethylene polymer includes combinations of, or blends of, the ethylene polymers described in this paragraph.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0232">The term &#x201c;ethylene interpolymer&#x201d; refers to a subset of polymers within the &#x201c;ethylene polymer&#x201d; group that excludes polymers produced in high pressure polymerization processes; non-limiting examples of polymers produced in high pressure processes include LDPE and EVA.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0233">The term &#x201c;heterogeneous ethylene interpolymer&#x201d; refers to a subset of polymers in the ethylene interpolymer group that are produced using heterogeneous catalyst formulations; non-limiting examples of which include well-known Ziegler-Natta or chromium catalyst formulations. This disclosure introduces new heterogeneous ethylene interpolymers, characterized as having intermediate branching and synthesized with an intermediate branching catalyst formulation.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0234">The term &#x201c;homogeneous ethylene interpolymer&#x201d; refers to a subset of polymers in the ethylene interpolymer group that are produced using homogeneous catalyst formulations. Typically, homogeneous ethylene interpolymers have narrow molecular weight distributions, for example Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>values of less than 2.8; M<sub>w </sub>and M<sub>n </sub>refer to weight and number average molecular weights, respectively. In contrast, the M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>of heterogeneous ethylene interpolymers are typically greater than the M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>of homogeneous ethylene interpolymers. In general, homogeneous ethylene interpolymers also have a narrow comonomer distribution, i.e. each macromolecule within the molecular weight distribution has similar comonomer content. Frequently, the composition distribution breadth index &#x201c;CDBI&#x201d; is used to quantify how the comonomer is distributed within an ethylene interpolymer, as well as to differentiate ethylene interpolymers produced with different catalysts or processes. In this disclosure, &#x201c;CDBI<sub>50</sub>&#x201d; is defined as the percent of ethylene interpolymer whose composition is within 50% of the median comonomer composition; this definition is consistent with that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,075 assigned to Exxon Chemical Patents Inc. The CDBI<sub>50 </sub>of an ethylene interpolymer can be calculated from TREF curves (Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation); the TREF method is described in Wild, et al., J. Polym. Sci., Part B, Polym. Phys., Vol. 20 (3), pages 441-455. Typically, the CDBI<sub>50 </sub>of homogeneous ethylene interpolymers are greater than about 70%. In contrast, the CDBI<sub>50 </sub>of &#x3b1;-olefin containing heterogeneous ethylene interpolymers are generally lower than the CDBI<sub>50 </sub>of homogeneous ethylene interpolymers. A blend of two or more homogeneous ethylene interpolymers, that differ in comonomer content, may have a CDBI<sub>50 </sub>less than 70%; in this disclosure such a blend was defined as a homogeneous blend or homogeneous composition. Similarly, a blend of two or more homogeneous ethylene interpolymers, that differ in weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>), may have a M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>2.8; in this disclosure such a blend was defined as a homogeneous blend or homogeneous composition.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0235">In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;homogeneous ethylene interpolymer&#x201d; refers to both linear homogeneous ethylene interpolymers and substantially linear homogeneous ethylene interpolymers. In the art, linear homogeneous ethylene interpolymers are generally assumed to have no long chain branches or an undetectable amount of long chain branches; while substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are generally assumed to have greater than about 0.01 to about 3.0 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms. A long chain branch is macromolecular in nature, i.e. similar in length to the macromolecule that the long chain branch is attached to. In this disclosure the amount of long chain branching present in an ethylene interpolymer was characterized by the &#x2018;Long Chain Branching Factor (LCBF)&#x2019;. The measurement of LCBF was fully described in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0236">In this disclosure a new class of ethylene interpolymers are disclosed; specifically, ethylene interpolymers having &#x201c;intermediate branching&#x201d;. Intermediate branching was defined as branching that was longer than the branch length resulting from comonomer incorporation (e.g. C<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>6 </sub>branches resulting from the incorporation of 1-hexene or 1-octene comonomers into a propagating macromolecule, respectively) and shorter than the entanglement molecular weight, M<sub>e</sub>. M<sub>e </sub>is a well-known concept in polymer physics (for example reported to be about 1 kg/mol for polyethylenes, see Fetters et al., Macromolecules 1999, 32, 6847). The amount of intermediate branching in ethylene interpolymers was characterized by the &#x2018;Non-Comonomer Index (NCI)&#x2019;, as well as the &#x2018;Non-Comonomer Index Distribution (NCID<sub>i</sub>), which was determined by triple detection cross fractionation chromatography (3D-CFC) analysis, as fully described in this specification.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0237">In this disclosure the term &#x2018;ethylene interpolymer product&#x2019; refers to the final product produced by a polymerization process; wherein the ethylene interpolymer product has intermediate branching, as characterized by the Non-Comonomer Index Distribution (NCID<sub>i</sub>). The polymerization processes disclosed hereinafter include processes employing one or more polymerization reactor(s). In the case of one reactor employing one intermediate branching catalyst formulation, the final product is an ethylene interpolymer product containing one ethylene interpolymer containing intermediate branching. In the case of two reactors employing the same intermediate branching catalyst formulation, the final product is an ethylene interpolymer product containing two ethylene interpolymers both containing intermediate branching. In the case of two reactors, employing two catalyst formulations where one is an intermediate branching catalyst formulation, the final product is an ethylene interpolymer product containing two ethylene interpolymers; wherein one ethylene interpolymer contains intermediate branching.

However, both short chain branching (SCB) and long chain branching (LCB) make contribution to the intrinsic viscosity ([&#x3b7;]), effort was made to isolate the SCB contribution for ethylene/1-butene and ethylene/1-hexene copolymers but not ethylene/1-octene copolymers (see Lue et al., U.S. Pat.

In this disclosure, a systematical investigation was performed to look at the SCB impact on the Mark-Houwink constant K for three types of ethylene/1-olefin interpolymers, i.e. octene, hexene and butene interpolymers.

Several rheological methods to quantify LCB have been disclosed. One commonly-used method was based on zero-shear viscosity (&#x3b7;<sub>0</sub>) and weight average molar mass (M<sub>w</sub>) data. The 3.41 power dependence (&#x3b7;<sub>0</sub>=K&#xd7;M<sub>w</sub><sup>3.41</sup>) has been established for monodisperse polyethylene solely composed of linear chains, for example see R. L.

An ethylene polymer with a no exceeding what was expected for a linear ethylene polymer, with the same M<sub>w</sub>, was considered to contain long-chain branches. However, there is a debate in the field regarding the influence of polydispersity, e.g. M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>o</sub>. A dependence on polydispersity was observed in some cases (see M.

In this disclosure, the term &#x2018;a first heterogeneous catalyst assembly&#x2019;, defined by the conduits and flow controllers associated with streams <b>10</b><i>a </i>through <b>10</b><i>h</i>, was operated as described in this paragraph. The first heterogeneous catalyst assembly produced an in-line intermediate branching catalyst formulation by optimizing feed flow rates, temperatures and the following molar ratios: (aluminum alkyl)/(magnesium compound) or (ix)/(v); (chloride compound)/(magnesium compound) or (vi)/(v); (alkyl aluminum co-catalyst)/(metal compound) or (viii)/(vii), and; (aluminum alkyl)/(metal compound) or (ix)/(vii); as well as the time these compounds have to react and equilibrate.

Stream <b>10</b><i>b </i>(and associated solvent stream <b>10</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;) were combined with stream <b>10</b><i>a </i>(and associated solvent stream <b>10</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;) and the intermixing of these streams produced a magnesium chloride catalyst support. The in-line intermediate branching catalyst formulation was produced by optimizing the (chloride compound)/(magnesium compound) molar ratio. The upper limit on the (chloride compound)/(magnesium compound) molar ratio may be about 4, in some cases about 3.5 and is other cases about 3.0. The lower limit on the (chloride compound)/(magnesium compound) molar ratio may be about 1.0, in some cases about 1.5 and in other cases about 1.9. The time between the addition of the chloride compound and the addition of the metal compound (component (vii)) via stream <b>10</b><i>c </i>was controlled; hereafter HUT-1 (the first Hold-Up-Time). HUT-1 was the time for streams <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>to form a magnesium chloride support and equilibrate. The upper limit on HUT-1 may be about 70 seconds, in some cases about 60 seconds and is other cases about 50 seconds. The lower limit on HUT-1 may be about 5 seconds, in some cases about seconds and in other cases about 20 seconds.

The upper limit on HUT-2 may be about 50 seconds, in some cases about 35 seconds and is other cases about 25 seconds.

The quantity of the alkyl aluminum co-catalyst added was optimized to produce an efficient catalyst; this was accomplished by adjusting the (alkyl aluminum, co-catalyst)/(metal compound) molar ratio, or (viii)/(vii) molar ratio. The upper limit on the (alkyl aluminum co-catalyst)/(metal compound) molar ratio may be about 10, in some cases about 7.5 and is other cases about 6.0.

HUT-3 was the time for stream <b>10</b><i>d </i>to intermix and equilibrate to form the in-line intermediate branching catalyst formulation. Prior to reactor injection, additional process solvent may be added to stream <b>10</b><i>f </i>via stream <b>10</b><i>f</i>&#x2032;.

The lower limit on HUT-3 may be about 0.5 seconds, in some cases about 1 seconds and in other cases about 2 seconds. HUT-3 was controlled by adjusting the length of the conduit between stream <b>10</b><i>d </i>injection and the catalyst injection port on reactor <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and by controlling the flow rates of associated streams. The R2 catalyst inlet temperature was controlled, the upper limit on R2 catalyst inlet temperature may be about 70&#xb0; C., in some cases about 60&#xb0; C. and is other cases about 50&#xb0; C.; and the lower limit on R2 catalyst inlet temperature may be about 10&#xb0; C., in some cases about 20&#xb0; C. and in other cases about 30&#xb0; C.

Non-limiting examples include monolayer or multilayer films. Non-limiting examples of processes to prepare such films include blown film processes, double bubble processes, triple bubble processes, cast film processes, tenter frame processes and machine direction orientation (MDO) processes.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0436">In the blown film extrusion process an extruder heats, melts, mixes and conveys a thermoplastic, or a thermoplastic blend. Once molten, the thermoplastic is forced through an annular die to produce a thermoplastic tube. In the case of co-extrusion, multiple extruders are employed to produce a multilayer thermoplastic tube. The temperature of the extrusion process is primarily determined by the thermoplastic or thermoplastic blend being processed, for example the melting temperature or glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic and the desired viscosity of the melt. In the case of polyolefins, typical extrusion temperatures are from 330&#xb0; F. to 550&#xb0; F. (166&#xb0; C. to 288&#xb0; C.). Upon exit from the annular die, the thermoplastic tube is inflated with air, cooled, solidified and pulled through a pair of nip rollers. Due to air inflation, the tube increases in diameter forming a bubble of desired size. Due to the pulling action of the nip rollers the bubble is stretched in the machine direction. Thus, the bubble is stretched in two directions: the transverse direction (TD) where the inflating air increases the diameter of the bubble; and the machine direction (MD) where the nip rollers stretch the bubble. As a result, the physical properties of blown films are typically anisotropic, i.e. the physical properties differ in the MD and TD directions; for example, film tear strength and tensile properties typically differ in the MD and TD. In some prior art documents, the terms &#x201c;cross direction&#x201d; or &#x201c;CD&#x201d; is used; these terms are equivalent to the terms &#x201c;transverse direction&#x201d; or &#x201c;TD&#x201d; used in this disclosure. In the blown film process, air is also blown on the external bubble circumference to cool the thermoplastic as it exits the annular die. The final width of the film is determined by controlling the inflating air or the internal bubble pressure; in other words, increasing or decreasing bubble diameter. Film thickness is controlled primarily by increasing or decreasing the speed of the nip rollers to control the draw-down rate. After exiting the nip rollers, the bubble or tube is collapsed and may be slit in the machine direction thus creating sheeting. Each sheet may be wound into a roll of film. Each roll may be further slit to create film of the desired width. Each roll of film is further processed into a variety of consumer products as described below.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0437">The cast film process is similar in that a single or multiple extruder(s) may be used; however, the various thermoplastic materials are metered into a flat die and extruded into a monolayer or multilayer sheet, rather than a tube. In the cast film process the extruded sheet is solidified on a chill roll.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0438">In the double bubble process a first blown film bubble is formed and cooled, then the first bubble is heated and re-inflated forming a second blown film bubble, which is subsequently cooled. The ethylene interpolymer products, disclosed herein, are also suitable for the triple bubble blown process. Additional film converting processes, suitable for the disclosed ethylene interpolymer products, include processes that involve a Machine Direction Orientation (MDO) step; for example, blowing a film or casting a film, quenching the film and then subjecting the film tube or film sheet to a MDO process at any stretch ratio.

The re-constructed analytical TREF profile was obtained by simply replacing the original elution temperatures in analytical TREF analysis performed on a Polymer Char Crystaf-TREF instrument, hereafter CTREF, with the equivalents of 3D-CFC elution temperature. The conversion of the original elution temperatures to the equivalents of 3D-CFC elution temperature enables one to compensate for differences in flow during the elution stage, i.e. dynamic (with a flow) while heating in CTREF, in contrast with static elution (without a flow) while heating in 3D-CFC; as well as for any other difference between these instruments (if any). To do this conversion, a series of ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin interpolymers having different comonomer contents and randomly distributed comonomer units were analyzed with both CTREF (Polymer Char Crystaf-TREF unit) and 3D-CFC. In this calibration procedure, the range of elution temperature in 3D-CFC analysis for each TREF fraction was very narrow (e.g., 1 to 2 degrees whenever possible and not greater than 5 degrees) and the average of the low and high temperatures of the TREF fraction was used to define the elution temperature of the 3D-CFC TREF fraction, e.g. 42.5&#xb0; C. was the elution temperature for the 40&#xb0; C. to 45&#xb0; C. fraction. The weight average elution temperature of the entire ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin interpolymer was calculated from the weight fraction and the elution temperature of each 3D-CFC TREF fraction.

A polymer sample (80 to 100 mg) was placed into the reactor vessel of the CTREF. The reactor vessel was filled with 35 ml of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and the polymer was dissolved by heating the solution to 150&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. An aliquot (1.5 mL) of the solution was then loaded into the CTREF column which was packed with stainless steel beads.

One mL of solutions (elements of interest) were pipetted onto a 15 mm&#xd7;800 mm rectangular paper filter and air dried. The filter paper was then placed in a 1.4 mL polyethylene irradiation vial and analyzed by the N.A.A. system.

An ethylene interpolymer product sample was: a) first subjected to a carbon disulfide extraction to remove additives that may interfere with the analysis; b) the sample (pellet, film or granular form) was pressed into a plaque of uniform thickness (0.5 mm), and; c) the plaque was analyzed by FTIR.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0499">Comonomer Content: Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy</p><p id="p-0391" num="0500">The quantity (mol % (or wt %)) of comonomer in an ethylene interpolymer product was determined by FTIR and reported as the Short Chain Branching (SCB) content having dimensions of CH<sub>3</sub>#/1000C (number of methyl branches per 1000 carbon atoms). This test was completed according to ASTM D6645-01 (2001), employing a compression molded polymer plaque and a Thermo-Nicolet 750 Magna-IR Spectrophotometer.

In this experiment, a compression molded circular plaque with a thickness of 1.8 mm was placed between the pre-heated upper and lower measurement fixtures and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium. The upper plate was then lowered to 50 &#x3bc;m above the testing gap size of 1.5 mm. At this point, the excess material was trimmed off and the upper fixture was lowered to the measurement gap size. A waiting time of 10 min after sample loading and trimming was applied to avoid residual stresses causing the strain to drift. In the creep experiment, the shear stress was increased instantly from 0 to 20 Pa and the strain was recorded versus time. The sample continued to deform under the constant shear stress and eventually reached a steady rate of straining. Creep data was reported in terms of creep compliance (J(t)) which has the units of reciprocal modulus. The inverse of J(t) slope in the steady creeping regime was used to calculate the zero shear rate viscosity based on the linear regression of the data points in the last 10% time window of the creep experiment.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0503">In order to determine if the sample was degraded during the creep test, frequency sweep experiments under small strain amplitude (10%) were performed before and after creep stage over a frequency range of 0.1-100 rad/s. The difference between the magnitude of complex viscosity at 0.1 rad/s before and after the creep stage was used as an indicator of thermal degradation. The difference should be less than 5% to consider the creep determined zero shear rate viscosity acceptable.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0504">Creep experiments confirmed that Linear Reference Line (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>) for linear ethylene interpolymers was also valid if the creep determined &#x3b7;<sub>0 </sub>was used rather than the DMA determined &#x3b7;<sub>0</sub>.

The secant modulus is the slope of a line drawn between two points on the stress-strain curve, i.e. the secant line. The first point on the stress-strain curve is the origin, i.e. the point that corresponds to the origin (the point of zero percent strain and zero stress), and; the second point on the stress-strain curve is the point that corresponds to a strain of 1%; given these two points the 1% secant modulus is calculated and is expressed in terms of force per unit area (MPa). The 2% secant modulus is calculated similarly. This method is used to calculated film modulus because the stress-strain relationship of polyethylene does not follow Hook's law; i.e. the stress-strain behavior of polyethylene is non-linear due to its viscoelastic nature. Secant moduli were measured using a conventional Instron tensile tester equipped with a 200 lbf load cell. Strips of monolayer film samples were cut for testing with following dimensions: 14 inch long, 1 inch wide and 1 mil thick; ensuring that there were no nicks or cuts on the edges of the samples. Film samples were cut in both the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) and tested. ASTM conditions were used to condition the samples. The thickness of each film was accurately measured with a hand-held micrometer and entered along with the sample name into the Instron software. Samples were loaded in the Instron with a grip separation of 10 inch and pulled at a rate of 1 inch/min generating the strain-strain curve. The 1% and 2% secant modulus were calculated using the Instron software.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0513">Film Elmendorf Tear</p><p id="p-0405" num="0514">Film tear performance was determined by ASTM D1922-09 (May 1, 2009); an equivalent term for tear is &#x201c;Elmendorf tear&#x201d;.

Hot tack data was generated using a J&#x26;B Hot Tack Tester which is commercially available from Jbi Hot Tack, Geloeslaan 30, B-3630 Maamechelen, Belgium. In the hot tack test, the strength of a polyolefin to polyolefin seal is measured immediately after heat sealing two film samples together (the two film samples were cut from the same roll of 2.0 mil (51-&#x3bc;m) thick film), i.e. when the polyolefin macromolecules that comprise the film are in a semi-molten state. This test simulates the heat sealing of polyethylene films on high speed automatic packaging machines, e.g., vertical or horizontal form, fill and seal equipment.
