Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used herein in both the alternative and conjunctive sense, unless otherwise indicated.

Use of broader terms such as &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be understood to provide support for narrower terms such as &#x201c;consisting of,&#x201d; &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;be comprised substantially of&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;according to one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some examples,&#x201d; &#x201c;for example,&#x201d; and the like generally mean that the particular feature, structure, or characteristic following the phrase may be included in at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, and may be included in more than one embodiment of the present disclosure (importantly, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to dynamically duplicating data objects and/or dynamically converting data objects in a computer network environment (including, but not limited to, in a network service cloud). For example, various embodiments of the present disclosure generate one or more replica data objects based on one or more source data objects stored in an external-access-limited source data object repository, and store the one or more replica data objects in an external-service-accessible replica data object repository.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a cloud computing environment, system resources are interconnected with one another to handle one or more computing tasks such as, but not limited to, generating data, storing data, transmitting data, and/or the like. In some examples, one or more system resources in an example cloud computing environment may be in hardware forms such as, but not limited to, one or more central processing units (CPUs), one or more memory units (such as, but not limited to, random-access memories, hard disk drives), one or more servers, one or more relays, one or more routers, and/or the like. In some examples, one or more system resources in an example cloud computing environment may be in software forms, such as, but not limited to, one or more embedded software (such as, but not limited to, firmware), one or more web applications (such as, but not limited to, one or more application software that run on a server), and/or the like. In some embodiments, one or more system resources in an example cloud computing environment may be in the form of one or more computer networks. In some embodiments, one or more system resources in an example cloud computing environment may be in other forms.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Cloud computing environments provide various technical benefits, such as, but not limited to, on-demand availability of system resources that can be scaled based on the need and/or requirements for performing computing tasks. However, cloud computing environments are also faced with many technical challenges and difficulties.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, in an &#x201c;on-premises&#x201d; computing environment where system resources are located within servers owned, secured, and managed by an organization or a user, the organization or the user may be granted root access privileges to each database(s) in the on-premises computing environment. For example, a user with root access privileges may retrieve all data and/or information stored in the databases(s) in on-premises computing environment, enabling generating visualization reports based on data and/or information stored the database(s) (e.g., often through business intelligence (BI) tools), conducting automatic examinations on data and/or information stored in the database(s) to identify or &#x201c;flag&#x201d; issues and/or errors associated with data and/or information, implementing machine learning models and/or artificial intelligence algorithms to generate one or more predictions based on the data and/or information, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In contrast with &#x201c;on-premises&#x201d; computing environments, many cloud computing environments do not provide customer users with root access privileges of database(s) that support the cloud computing environments, and/or provide limited, restricted, and/or insufficient access that cannot handle a large amount of data queries. This lack of root access and/or sufficient access limits the ability of customer users to rapidly query and dynamically access organization data in the manner provided by &#x201c;on-premises&#x201d; computing environments. While some cloud computing environment may provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are configured to provide selected data access capabilities to customer users in a cloud computing environment, these APIs are restrictive in nature as the customer users do not have root access privileges to all data and/or information stored in the database(s). Such APIs are also limited in that they can be easily overrun or driven offline if they receive too much traffic or traffic that exceeds rate limit policies.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above referenced limitations of cloud computing environments (including those that provide APIs) reduce or eliminate the technical capability to enable customer users to use modern BI tools to generate visualization reports based on data and/or information stored the database(s), conduct automatic examinations on data and/or information stored in the database(s) to identify or &#x201c;flag&#x201d; issues and/or errors associated with the data and/or information, implement machine learning models and/or artificial intelligence algorithms to generate one or more predictions based on the data and/or information, and/or the like. The lack of direct, root access to database(s) in a cloud computing environment not only carries the above limitations but also causes many technical challenges and difficulties in network data communications.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, in a cloud computing environment where an API is provided, a large number of users may request access via the API at the same time, creating a significant level of data and/or information to be exchanged through the API. APIs in cloud computing environments are often designed for conducting simple transactions in a low latency and low data rate manner. Accordingly, such APIs are not configured to handle the demand and requirements of supporting modern BI tools and implementation of machine learning and artificial intelligence customer use cases. As such, many cloud computing environment APIs are plagued by technical issues such as, but not limited to, latency issues, slow responses, throttling, and timeouts.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As another example, data and/or information in a cloud computing environment may be stored in a distributed manner, such that multiple databases may be implemented to store data and/or information associated with a single user. In some examples, each database may have its own data formatting guidelines and protocols, causing data and/or information from different databases having different structures and/or formats that may not be compatible with one another. Due to incompatibility, such data and/or information may not be ingested by a downstream data analysis service. The lack of the direct, root access to database(s) further causes external users to the cloud computing environment incapable of converting data and/or information to a consistent format or structure.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Example embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome the above-referenced technical challenges, limitations, and difficulties while providing various technical benefits.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, various embodiments of the present disclosure may provide an external-service-accessible replica data object repository in a network service cloud that allows root access of data and/or information stored in the external-service-accessible replica data object repository. To overcome technical restrictions causing many cloud computing environments lacking the capability to generate visualization reports, various embodiments of the present disclosure may generate one or more replica data objects based on the source data objects stored in an external-access-limited source data object repository. Various embodiments of the present disclosure may store the replica data objects in the external-service-accessible replica data object repository, thereby allowing users who are external to the network service cloud to generate visualization reports based on data and/or information stored the external-service-accessible replica data object repository, conduct automatic examinations on data and/or information stored in the external-service-accessible replica data object repository to identify or &#x201c;flag&#x201d; issues and/or errors associated with the data and/or information, implement machine learning models and/or artificial intelligence algorithms to generate one or more predictions based on the data and/or information, and/or the like,</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, various embodiments of the present disclosure may dynamically replicate data objects so that the replica data objects capture not only the original source data objects, but also any changes that have been made to the original source data objects. For example, various embodiments of the present disclosure may utilize bootstrap task objects for replicating source data objects, as well as change data event (CDC) task objects to capture changes associated with the source data objects. Various embodiments of the present disclosure execute bootstrap task objects and CDC tasks objects to generate replication data objects and CDC data objects, respectively. Various embodiments of the present disclosure store the replication data objects and CDC data objects in a processing queue data object, and may generate replica data objects based on the processing queue data object. As such, various embodiments of the present disclosure may provide fast access to the latest data and/or information stored in the network service cloud to users who are external to the network service cloud, and may reduce the possibilities of latency, slow responses, throttling, and timeouts.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, various embodiments of the present disclosure may provide data object conversion schemes that define converting data objects to a consistent format and/or structure. Various embodiments of the present disclosure may dynamically convert the data objects based at least in part on a data object type associated with the data object. The resultant data objects from the data object conversion may be suitable for ingestion by a downstream data analysis service (for example, a machine learning model).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As such, example embodiments of the present disclosure overcome technical challenges and difficulties faced by the network computing environment, and provide various technical advantages and benefits, details of which are described herein.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;data,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d; &#x201c;digital content,&#x201d; &#x201c;digital content object,&#x201d; &#x201c;information,&#x201d; and similar terms may be used interchangeably to refer to data capable of being transmitted, received, and/or stored in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, a data object may be associated with one or more software (for example, one or more computer programs) and/or one or more hardware (for example, one or more servers and/or one or more client devices).

In some embodiments, the processing circuitry may receive the data object access request from a client device or a network server that is external to or outside of a network service cloud. For example, the client device or the network server may transmit the data object access request to the network service cloud, indicating an electronic request to access a tenant data object that is stored in an external-service-accessible replica data object repository (such as, but not limited to, the external-service-accessible replica data object repository <b>105</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0318" num="0317">In some embodiments, the data object access request is associated with a requestor identifier that uniquely identifies the sender of an electronic request. For example, if the data object access request is transmitted from a client device associated with a user John, the data object access request is associated with a requestor identifier corresponding to John's. Additionally, or alternatively, if the data object access request is transmitted from a network server that relays an electronic request from a client device associated with the user John, the data object access request is associated with a requestor identifier corresponding to John's.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0318">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, subsequent to step/operation <b>1505</b>, the method <b>1500</b> proceeds to step/operation <b>1507</b>.

For example, the network service cloud may only grant access to the tenant data object to computing devices that are associated with the tenant identifier, and/or computing devices that have been granted accesses to the tenant data object by the owner of the tenant data object.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0320">If, at step/operation <b>1507</b>, the processing circuitry determines that the requestor identifier is associated with the tenant identifier, the example method proceeds to step/operation <b>1509</b>.

Additionally, or alternatively, the processing circuitry may determine that the requestor identifier associated with the data object access request has been granted access to the tenant data object by the owner of the tenant data object. In response to determining that the requestor identifier is associated with the tenant identifier, the processing circuitry may retrieve the tenant data object from the external-service-accessible replica data object repository (for example, the external-service-accessible replica data object repository <b>105</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), and may transmit the tenant data object to a client device or a network server where the data object access request originates from.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0322">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, if, at step/operation <b>1507</b>, the processing circuitry determines that the requestor identifier is not associated with the tenant identifier, the example method proceeds to step/operation <b>1511</b>.

As such, in some embodiments, in response to determining that the requestor identifier is not associated with the tenant identifier, the processing circuitry generates a data object access denial message. For example, the data object access denial message may comprise an electronic indication that the data object access request cannot be handled due to lack of access privilege. In some embodiments, the processing circuitry may transmit the data object access denial message to a client device or a network server where the data object access request originates from.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, subsequent to step/operation <b>1509</b> and/or step/operation <b>1511</b>, the example method <b>1500</b> proceeds to step/operation <b>1513</b> and ends.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Additional Implementation Details</heading><p id="p-0326" num="0325">Although example processing systems have been described above, implementations of the subject matter and the functional operations described herein can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described herein can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
