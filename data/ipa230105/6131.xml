The phase change memory comprises a plurality of memory cells, each memory cell being configured to store data, for example, such as binary data. The memory cells are arranged in a cell array, comprising lines and columns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are in the plane of a line of the array, for example.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a device resulting from a step in one embodiment of a method for making a phase change memory.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this step, an insulating layer <b>10</b> is formed on a substrate <b>12</b>. The substrate <b>12</b> is a semiconductor substrate, for example, such as silicon, or a semiconductor on insulator (SOI) substrate. The insulating or dielectric layer <b>10</b> is a single insulating layer, for example, or corresponds to a stack of insulating layers. The insulating layer/s of the layer <b>10</b> is/are made of one or more dielectric materials, such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride. In the following description, it is assumed that the layer <b>10</b> comprises a single insulating layer, for example.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Conductive vias <b>14</b> are formed through the layer <b>10</b>. The vias <b>14</b> extend through the layer <b>10</b>. In other words, the vias <b>14</b> extend from an upper side of the layer <b>10</b> to a lower side of the layer <b>10</b>. The lower end of the vias is in contact with the substrate <b>12</b>, for example. The upper end of the vias is preferably flush with the upper side of the layer <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The vias <b>14</b> are located regularly, i.e., periodically, in the layer <b>10</b>. The vias <b>14</b> are located at the memory cell locations. The vias <b>14</b> thus form an array and form lines and columns. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one line of the array. Each via <b>14</b> is separated from neighboring vias belonging to the same line or column by the same distance. Thus, each line or column of the array comprises vias <b>14</b> separated in pairs by this same distance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Selection elements <b>13</b> are formed between the vias, for example. The selection elements are covered by an insulating layer <b>17</b>, for example. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the selection elements are transistors, formed in and on the substrate <b>12</b>. The transistors are illustrated by their gate <b>15</b>. Neighboring transistors in the same line have a common drain or source region, for example. Transistors in the same line are thus connected in series by their drain and source regions, for example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The lower end of each via <b>14</b> is in contact with a drain or source region of a transistor <b>13</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A layer <b>16</b> of a resistive material is formed on the layer <b>10</b> and on the upper ends of the vias <b>14</b>. For example, the layer <b>16</b> is of a conductive material, such as metal. For example, a layer <b>16</b> is formed on each line of the array. Each layer <b>16</b> is preferably separated from the layers <b>16</b> on the other lines by an insulating material, not shown. The assembly comprising the layers <b>16</b> and the insulating material separating them preferably forms a flat layer. Each layer <b>16</b> is in contact with the upper end of each via of the line. Each layer <b>16</b> is L-shaped, for example, in a plane such as a plane that is orthogonal to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A layer <b>18</b> of a phase change material is formed over the layer <b>16</b>, over the assembly comprising the layers <b>16</b> and the insulating material separating them, for example. The layer <b>18</b> is made of an alloy of germanium, antimony and tellurium (GeSbTe or GST), for example. The material of the layer <b>18</b> is doped, for example. In a variant, the material of layer layer <b>18</b> is undoped. The layer <b>18</b> preferably extends over all of the layers <b>16</b>. Preferably, the layer <b>18</b> extends continuously across the entire array.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A conductive layer <b>20</b>, of metal, for example, is formed on the layer <b>18</b>. The conductive layer <b>20</b> covers the entire layer <b>18</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a device resulting from another step of one embodiment of a method for making a phase change memory.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The step in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises an etching step, to delineate memory cells <b>22</b>. In this step, cavities <b>24</b> are formed through the layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> and, for example, in the layer <b>10</b>. The cavities <b>24</b> are located between the cells <b>22</b>. The cavities <b>24</b> extend in the direction of the lines of the memory cell array, for example, between the cells of different lines, and in the direction of the column of the memory cell array, between the cells of different columns. The cavities <b>24</b> thus form a grid or grid-like shape. The cavities are located opposite portions of the layer <b>10</b> that do not comprise a via <b>14</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each memory cell bounded by the cavities <b>24</b> is located opposite a via <b>14</b>. In other words, the cavities <b>24</b> bound portions of the layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b>. From a via <b>14</b>, each memory cell <b>22</b> thus comprises a stack comprising a portion of the layer <b>16</b>, forming a resistive element, a portion of the layer <b>18</b>, and a portion of the layer <b>20</b>, forming an upper electrode.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A memory cell array <b>22</b> is thus formed. In other words, cells arranged in lines and columns are formed. The cells <b>22</b> are substantially identical, i.e., the cell dimensions are substantially equal, two by two. More specifically, the memory cells are intended to be identical within manufacturing dispersions. The cells <b>22</b> are located regularly, i.e., periodically, in each line or column of the memory cell array. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows one line of the array. Each cell <b>22</b> is separated from each neighboring cell in the same line or column by the same distance. In other words, the distances separating the neighboring cells in the same line or column are substantially equal. Thus, each line or column of the array comprises cells <b>22</b> separated in pairs by this same distance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The resulting structure is covered accordingly by a protective layer <b>26</b>, of an insulating material, for example, such as silicon nitride. In particular, the layer <b>26</b> covers the walls and lower of the cavities <b>24</b> and the upper side of the memory cells. In other words, the layer <b>26</b> covers the layer <b>10</b>, the side faces of portions of the layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b>, and the upper side of portions of layer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The structure is covered with a protective layer <b>28</b>, for example, an insulating layer, for example, such as silicon oxide.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a device resulting from another step in one embodiment of a method for making a phase change memory.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">This step comprises a step of etching certain memory cells. In other words, the vias <b>14</b> corresponding to the memory cells etched in this step are uncovered by the etching step.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">More specifically, cavities <b>30</b> are formed at certain memory cells of the array. Each cavity <b>30</b> opens at the upper side of the layer <b>28</b> and extends to the via <b>14</b>. In particular, the portions of the layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the cells etched in this step are removed entirely. The etching is preferably stopped in the layer <b>10</b>. Thus, the layer <b>26</b> of each cell is separated from the layer <b>26</b> of the other cells by one of the cavities <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the vias <b>14</b> are not etched. In other words, the cavity uncovers the vias <b>14</b> without etching them. For example, the layer <b>10</b> surrounding the vias is not etched. For example, the vias <b>14</b> are still surrounded by a portion of material of the layer <b>10</b> after the etching step.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the cavity <b>30</b> does not extend the full height of the vias <b>14</b>. In other words, the cavity <b>30</b> extends partially over the height of the layer <b>10</b>, for example. The selection elements are not etched, for example. The cavity <b>30</b> does not reach the substrate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, one cell out of N is etched. The value N is equal to <b>5</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, every fifth memory cell is etched and replaced by a cavity <b>30</b>. In other words, each line, or column preferably comprises groups of N&#x2212;1 cells, i.e., four cells here. Thus, each line comprises a succession of N&#x2212;1 cells, a cavity <b>30</b>, N&#x2212;1 cells, a cavity <b>30</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The cells of a same group are separated, two by two, by the same distance L<b>1</b>. In other words, the distances between two neighboring cells in the same group, located in the same line or column, are substantially equal. The groups are separated from each other by the cavities <b>30</b>. The dimensions of the cavities <b>30</b> are less than the sum of twice the distance between two cells and the dimension of the cell in the same direction. Two neighboring cell groups are separated by the same distance L<b>2</b>. In other words, the cells closest to each other in two neighboring cell groups are separated by the distance L<b>2</b>.

In other words, one out of N cells is etched in each column, with the etched cells in each column being in a different line than the etched cells, for example, in at least one of the neighboring columns. For example, the etched cells in each column are offset from the etched cells in the neighboring column by one line, preferably in the same direction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to one embodiment, a memory cell array may comprise multiple regions, with at least some regions having different arrangements.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a device resulting from another step of one embodiment of a method for making a phase change memory.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this step, the cavities <b>30</b> are filled with an insulating material <b>40</b>, of the same material as the layer material <b>28</b> for example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">This step further comprises the formation of vias.

The step in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in that the cells are etched in groups of at least two cells, X cells, for example, where X is an integer at least equal to 2. In other words, the memory cells form groups of N&#x2212;X cells, the groups being separated by a cavity <b>50</b> resulting from the etching of X memory cells.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The next step, not shown, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, differs in that the via <b>44</b> is in contact with the two uncovered vias, for example. The two vias are thus short-circuited.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">One could have chosen to form only the cells that one wishes to keep and thus form the cavities separating the groups of cells during the formation of the memory cells.
