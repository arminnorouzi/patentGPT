It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art nor material to the presently described or claimed inventions, nor that any publication or document that is specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of headrests and neck supports of existing art and more specifically relates to massage table headrests.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Massage therapy is very popular. Usually, to start the massage the therapist has the patient lie face down on a massage therapy table with their face uncomfortably placed within a standard face cradle. While the massage may be beneficial, there are numerous problems with currently used face cradles, and these problems may even reduce the overall benefits of the massage. Ordinary face cradles usually have a semi-circular padding with an open area in the center. The face goes in that open area. The padding is applying direct pressure to the cheeks and sinuses of a user. This often causes sinus pressure. This sinus pressure can cause difficulty breathing, it can cause headaches, and some people feel it even causes stiffness of the neck and shoulder muscles. All of those negative effects are counter to the benefits of massage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another problem with traditional face cradles is they may prevent the natural alignment of the upper spine. Ordinary face cradles prevent the chin of the massage patient from moving forward, and this forward movement is needed to achieve the natural curvature of the neck. By preventing that natural curvature, proper spine alignment cannot be achieved. Without proper alignment, the muscles cannot be completely relaxed and that can lead to a rapid return of stiffness. A suitable solution is desired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,436 to John T. Lloyd relates to an adjustable headrest. The described adjustable headrest includes an adjustable headrest includes a base supporting a crescent-shaped pad. The bottom side of the base is equipped with two triangular support structures, each of which includes a long arm and a short arm pivotally attached to distal and proximal junction structures, respectively, on the bottom side of the base. The other end of the arms are commonly and pivotally connected to a horizontal rod, one end of which is equipped with a cam lever capable of jointly controlling the lock and release status of two clamps, each of which is associated with one of the support structures. In each triangular support structure, one of the arms has an adjustable effective length. The cam lever is movable between a lock-position and a release-position. When the lever is in the lock position, the clamp prevents all rotational movement of both rectangular support structures about the horizontal rod, and prevents any adjustment of the effective length of the arms. The headrest support assembly allows height and angle adjustment of the headrest relative to a stationary table or chair by manipulating only a single clamp.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known massage table headrest art, the present disclosure provides a novel face cradle system. The general purpose of the present disclosure, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a face cradle system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A face cradle system is disclosed herein. The face cradle system includes a face cradle configured to be used in combination with a host massage therapy table. The face cradle includes an adjustable frame comprising an open-ended oval shape. The adjustable frame includes a first-arm extension, a second-arm extension, and an oval portion. The oval portion of the adjustable frame further comprises a handle and a padded forehead hammock positioned at a closed end of the oval portion. The padded forehead hammock features a sinus relief nodule which makes contact upon, and applies pressure to, an area directly above a bridge of a nose. By applying pressure directly above the bridge of the nose, the sinus relief nodule of the face cradle system helps prevent sinus pressure from forming. The oval portion, the first-arm extension and the second-arm extension are connected at an adjustable pivot point. The oval portion is configured to pivot in relation to the first-arm extension and the second-arm extension in order to properly align and position a neck and spine of a user. The face cradle system promotes proper alignment of the spine, relieves and prevents a user's sinus pressure while in a prone position, and overall facilitates a more beneficial massage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for using a face cradle system may include the steps of: step one, providing a face cradle configured to be used in combination with a host massage therapy table; step two, inserting a first-arm extension and a second-arm extension within the host massage therapy table; step three, adjusting an angle of the face cradle; and step four, optionally removing the face cradle from the host massage therapy table.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein. The features of the invention which are believed to be novel are particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings and detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The figures which accompany the written portion of this specification illustrate embodiments and methods of use for the present disclosure, a face cradle system, constructed and operative according to the teachings of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the face cradle system during an &#x2018;in-use&#x2019; condition, according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom view of the face cradle system during an &#x2018;in-use&#x2019; condition, according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of the face cradle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for using a face cradle system, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The various embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings, wherein like designations denote like elements.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As discussed above, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a massage table headrest and more particularly to a face cradle system as used to improve the comfort and proper positioning of a head, neck, and spine of a user during a massage. The face cradle system supports the head in a position of natural curvature and alignment with the neck and spine.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, the face cradle system provides a novel and effective alternative to standard face cradles featured on massage therapy tables. The present face cradle system maintains a head, neck, and spine of a user in positions of natural curvature, effectively ensuring proper spinal alignment, and without need to interrupt a massage to readjust position. The face cradle system includes an adjustable frame comprising an open-ended oval shape including a first-arm extension, a second-arm extension, and an oval portion. The oval portion includes a handle and a padded forehead hammock positioned at a closed end of the oval portion. The padded forehead hammock is provided for suspending a head of a user and features a hemispherical-shaped sinus relief nodule to prevent facial and sinus pressure. The padded forehead hammock of the face cradle system does not apply pressure upon the chin or cheeks of the massage recipient, unlike standard face cradles. The padded forehead hammock allows the jaw of the massage recipient to remain in an ordinary, non-impacted position. The oval portion further includes a handle extending therefrom.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment, the adjustable frame preferably comprises an aluminum material. The oval portion extends beyond, and attaches to, the first-arm extension and second-arm extension at two adjustable pivot-points, connected by a screw and lever or other suitable pivoting mechanisms. The oval portion is of an approximate fourteen-inch (14&#x2033;) length and maximum ten-inch width. The oval portion of the adjustable frame may be lined with polyurethane (PU). The padded forehead hammock is filled with three (3) layers of low-resilience polyurethane foam (LRPU). Each layer of foam has a half-inch density, and with indentation force deflection rating of twelve (IFD12). The padding is encased within a tight-knit mesh lining of polyurethane (PU). The hammock is removably-attachable to the frame by a series of snap fasteners. The sinus relief nodule positioned on the padded forehead hammock may include a diameter of approximately 0.5 inches and a depth of approximately 0.5 inches.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The face cradle system may be made in variations for its application on massage tables, portable massage tables, and massage chairs. All components of the face cradle system can be made of various applicable materials that do not contain formaldehyde and carcinogens, as required by regulations of the California Air Resources Board (CARB).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A method of use may be as follows: the face cradle of the face cradle system may be attached to a host massage therapy table by insertion of a first-arm extension and a second-arm extension into axles of the host massage therapy table. A massage recipient may occupy the massage therapy table and face cradle system by laying in a face-down position. The padded forehead hammock can be adjusted in position to ensure that its sinus relief nodule contacts a point directly above a nose bridge of the massage recipient. The face cradle system will allow the massage recipient's head, neck, and spine to maintain natural curvature and proper alignment. Should the position of the face cradle system need to be adjusted in angle, a therapist may simply hold the handle, release the lever of the adjustable pivot point, and then lower or raise the adjustable frame. The therapist may then close the lever when a desired position is achieved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now more specifically to the drawings by numerals of reference, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, various views of a face cradle system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref> show a face cradle system <b>100</b> during an &#x2018;in-use&#x2019; condition <b>150</b>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
