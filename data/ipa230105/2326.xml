id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a small-molecule regulator of TLR8, which belongs to the field of medicinal chemistry.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is a class of highly conserved transmembrane proteins, which play a very important role in innate immunity and acquired immunity and are the first barrier of the body resisting the invasion of pathogen(s) and eliminating the waste of the body. Currently, 10 homologous receptors have been found in the human body, namely TLR1 to TLR10. Among them, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 are distributed on the surface of cell membrane, and TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are distributed in the endosomes of cells. TLRs recognize ligands via homodimerization or heterodimerization. For example, after TLR8 recognizes the single-stranded RNA of a virus or a bacterium, the downstream signaling pathways would be activated to produce pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1&#x3b2;, thereby regulating the immune response of the body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Researches have indicated that various types of diseases may be resulted from the dysregulation of TLR signaling pathway. For example, the dysregulation of Toll-like receptor 8 signaling pathway may cause rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Adult Still's disease, and the like. Therefore, Toll-like receptor 8 is an important target for the treatment of many diseases. The development of specific regulators of TLR8, especially small-molecule regulators, faces greater challenge due to the following reasons, i.e., TLR7 and TLR8 are both present in endosomes, belong to the same subfamily and have high degree of similarity in structure and function; both of them are capable of recognizing the single-stranded RNA of a virus or a bacterium, imidazoquinoline compounds and nucleotide analogs; and the interface for protein-protein interaction is relatively large and flexible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Prior art such as the patent application WO2019089648A1 of UNIV COLORADO REGENTS, the patent application WO2018089695A1 of DYNAVAX TECH CORPORATION, the patent application WO2018233648A1 of MEDSHINE DISCOVERY INC. the patent application AU2017202755C1 of GILEAD SCIENCES, the patent application US20180258045A1 of UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS all disclose a series of compounds that may act as regulators of TLR8. In view of the fact that the small-molecule regulators of TLR8 have great potential medicinal value, there is an urgent need to develop compounds capable of specifically regulating TLR8.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which may be used as a small-molecule regulator of TLR8,</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="28.36mm" wi="60.37mm" file="US20230002327A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">wherein,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">X is CH or N;
