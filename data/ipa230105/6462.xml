Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Nowadays, more and more fixtures are integrated with an emergency driver, which can provide an emergency lighting when there is a mains power outage. In order to ensure the reliability of the emergency power supply, it is required to perform a routine self-test operation on the emergency driver in normal times. A test device is widely used with an emergency driver, having a button switch used in a test device to trigger the self-test operation. LED indicator on the test device can be used to indicate a result of the self-test operation, so that issues tested from the emergency driver, such as a low battery level, a wiring fault or the like, can be caught and fixed before the mains power outage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There has been a concerted effort to develop intelligent lighting. However, conventional emergency drivers have their self-test operation performed by pressing the button of the test device at the scene. It cannot be triggered remotely. Further, the result of the self-test operation is also unknown to the remote site.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For intelligent lighting, there is a need to upgrade the emergency driver to be suitable for an intelligent system. Instead of attaching to a test device, the emergency driver is required to be connected to a network so that the emergency driver can be triggered remotely to perform the self-test operation and provide the result of the self-test operation to the remote site. There is a further need to achieve an unified management of multiple emergency drivers with less human efforts in order to collect valuable data and save labor cost of inspection tours.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the present disclosure provides an emergency driver.

Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the term &#x201c;circuitry&#x201d; may refer to, be part of, or include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and/or memory (shared, dedicated, or group) that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; may refer to for example a digital signal processor (DSP), a microcontroller, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or a microprocessor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An emergency driver described herein is applicable to a power supply system which may have a main power source configured to drive one or more electric loads. The emergency driver may be provided between the main power source and the one or more electric loads and is configured to provide a backup power supply when the main power source is down. The emergency driver may include a backup power source such as a battery package or the like. In order to ensure the reliability of the emergency driver, for example to ensure that no wiring fault will occur in an emergency lighting, or the remaining capacity of battery level sufficient for providing a backup power supply, or the like, the emergency driver may be configured to perform various preset operations, such as self-test operations or other actions. The self-test operations may be a quick self-test lasting for e.g. a few seconds or even shorter for some basic tests, or an overall self-test lasting for e.g. a few minutes, tens minutes or even a few hours for an overall test, etc. Other actions may include entering a maintenance mode where no backup power supply is output when the main power source is down, setting an interval of extended emergency mode where the backup power supply will be kept for an interval after the main power source is recovered, and entering an identification mode where the electric load will be activated so as to show which electric load is being controlled.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the emergency driver described herein can be used with an intelligent module. In particular, the emergency driver can be connected to an intelligent module via a common control bus. The control bus may have only two connection wires for triggering a preset operation of the emergency driver and communicating a status of the emergency driver. The status of the emergency driver may be obtained by performing the preset operations. In some embodiments, the status of the emergency driver may be a result of a self-test operation. In other embodiments, the status of the emergency driver may be results of other preset operations which are collected and stored in a non-volatile memory of the emergency driver.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the case of connecting to an intelligent module, the emergency driver may be connected to a remote device wirelessly via the intelligent module. With the intelligent module, a preset operation of the emergency driver can be triggered from the remote device remotely and the status of the emergency driver obtained by performing the triggered preset operation or other preset operations may be transmitted to the remote device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example emergency driver <b>10</b> in accordance with embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the emergency driver <b>10</b> includes a digital communication interface <b>12</b>, a DC power supply <b>14</b> and a controller <b>16</b>. The emergency driver <b>10</b> may also include a circuitry of performing a self-test operation and a backup power source such as a battery package or the like, which are not shown for the ease of illustration. The backup power source is used to provide emergency power supply, i.e. emergency power <b>47</b>, to a load such as one or more fixtures.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The digital communication interface <b>12</b> is coupled to a control bus <b>18</b> to receive an input signal <b>41</b> and transmit an output signal via the control bus <b>18</b>. The digital communication interface <b>12</b> is further coupled to the controller <b>16</b> to transfer the input signal <b>41</b> from the control bus <b>18</b> to the controller <b>16</b> and the output signal from the controller <b>16</b> to the control bus <b>18</b>. The output signal may include digital data <b>43</b> from the controller <b>16</b> or a DC output <b>45</b> from the DC power supply <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an example, the digital communication interface <b>12</b> may be DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface). It is an International Standard (IEC 62386) lighting control system, providing a single interface for all electronic control gear (light sources) and electronic control devices (lighting controllers). With use of DALI, the emergency driver <b>10</b> may be applied to a lighting system in a more effective way.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The DC power supply <b>14</b> is also coupled to the control bus <b>18</b> to provide the DC output <b>45</b> to the control bus <b>18</b> and is powered by the DC power supply <b>14</b> of the emergency driver <b>10</b>. The DC power supply <b>14</b> may be drawn from the main power source. The DC output <b>45</b> of the DC power supply <b>14</b> is controlled by the controller <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the controller <b>16</b> may be configured to turn on the DC power supply <b>14</b> constantly to provide a constant power supply. This turning on may be implemented when the emergency driver <b>10</b> is connected to an intelligent module described below. Alternatively, the controller <b>16</b> may be configured to on/off control the DC power supply <b>14</b> to provide a particular sequence of low levels and high levels in the output of the DC power supply <b>14</b>. This on/off controlling may be implemented when the emergency driver <b>10</b> is connected to a test device with an indicator such as an LED indicator, an audio beeper instead of the intelligent module. In this case, the indicator may flash or beeps in accordance with the particular sequence of the low and high levels in the DC output <b>45</b> of the DC power supply <b>14</b> to present the status of the emergency driver. In some embodiments, the controller <b>16</b> may be configured to control the DC output <b>45</b> of the DC power supply <b>14</b> based on a default resident in the controller <b>16</b>. In some other embodiments, the controller <b>16</b> may be configured to control the DC output <b>45</b> of the DC power supply <b>14</b> based on the input signal <b>41</b> received by the digital communication interface <b>12</b> via the control bus <b>18</b>. Details of the connection with the intelligent module and the test device will be illustrated in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In at least one embodiment, the control bus <b>18</b> may include two connection wires. The digital communication interface <b>12</b> and the DC power supply <b>14</b> may share the two connection wires of the control bus <b>18</b>. Thus, the number of the connection wires of the control bus <b>18</b> can be minimized.
