In a slot within a SL resource pool, part of the symbols or all of the symbols of the slot may be configured as a SL resource. In the frequency domain, the minimum resource unit is a sub-carrier. In some embodiments, each sub-carrier may contain 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHzz or 240 kHz. Multiple sub-carriers in a slot (for example, a slot including 12 sub-carriers, 24 sub-carriers or the like) may be referred to as a resource block (RB). In the frequency domain, part of the system bandwidth may be assigned as a SL resource.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The SL resource pool may include one or more slots in the time domain, and one or more RBs in the frequency domain. The slots contained in a SL resource pool may be continuous or discontinuous. The RBs contained in a SL resource pool may be continuous or discontinuous.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Two types of resource pools are defined for transmission and reception: a transmission (Tx) resource pool includes the candidate resources that may be used for UE's SL Tx, and a receiving (Rx) resource pool includes the candidate resources that UE may use to detect/receive other UE's SL signal. A SL resource pool includes resources used for at least one of the following: SL control, data, and feedback information. The resource pool may be configured by the network side through high layer signaling or system pre-configuration. UEs can support multiple resource pools interleaved in time domain.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A SL resource pool includes one or more types of the following resources: physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH), which may be used for SL control information, physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), which may be used for SL data transmission, and physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH), which may be used for SL feedback information transmission. The UE may use a PSCCH resource to send a first stage SL control information (1<sup>st </sup>stage SCI) message, which may be used to indicate a second stage SCI (2<sup>nd </sup>stage SCI) configuration and/or relevant PSSCH resource allocation and other associated control information. The UE may use a PSSCH resource to send SL data and/or the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage SCI. The UE may use a PSFCH resource to send SL ACK/NACK information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When UEs communicate on SL, transmitting UE (Tx UE) selects SL resources within a resource pool without any information from receiving UE (Rx UE). Tx UE may use SL resources within assigned resource pools according to the scheduling that the Tx UE determines, or that the network determines. In the situation where the Tx UE selects SL resources, Tx UE performs sensing within the SL resource pool to select resources with less conflict and higher quality. For example, if Tx UE needs to use two sub-channels as PSSCH resources to transmit its SL data, then Tx UE may use two sub-channels as candidate resource size to measure all the available sub-channels in a resource pool. Subsequently, Tx UE may select a suitable resource for its SL transmission. During the sending and resource selecting processes, Tx UE is limited to measuring the channel status that Tx UE senses; in other words, Tx UE does not consider the situation of Rx UE. Thus, the resources selected using traditional SL resource schemes may be less efficient.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure is concerned with the Rx UE creating a resource report, the resource report may be used by the Tx UE to assist its SL communication.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2.

The blacklist resources may include resources that are unavailable for the second UE's transmission on SL. According to the configuration of the blacklist criterion, the first UE may determine one or more blacklist resources within the assigned reported resource pool.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, more than one set of blacklist resource criterion may be configured in the Type B configuration. In these situations, the blacklist resource criterion set may be marked as a blacklist resource criterion set list. In a blacklist resource criterion set list, each blacklist resource criterion set has a unique index. By indicating the blacklist resource criterion set index, the UEs may identify the corresponding blacklist resource criterion set in the blacklist resource criterion set list. In some embodiments, the resource set index has a one-to-one relationship with the blacklist resource criterion set index. For example, the first UE may determine blacklist resources according to blacklist resource criterion set index #k, and composes the blacklist resources based on the blacklist resource criterion into the resource set index #k.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, the resource set index may be implicitly identified with the corresponding blacklist resource criterion set index. In other words, there is no resource set index. In these situations, the reported resource set may correspond with the blacklist resource criterion index.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">3.4 Exemplary Embodiment #5</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one example, a first UE obtains information to form a resource set report by pre-configuration. The information indicates the Type B configuration and includes one blacklist resource criterion set. According to the configuration, the time window=1000 ms. Subsequently, the first UE determines the blacklist resources according to the configuration and its own information or resource data usage. Within the assigned time window, the first UE has several transmitting resources on a resource pool. Thus, the first UE determines the transmitting resources may be blacklisted resources of the resource pool and creates a blacklist resource set.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">3.5 Exemplary Embodiment #6</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A first UE receives information to form a resource set report from a base station. The information indicates the Type B configuration and includes one blacklist resource criterion set. According to the configuration, the time window=1000 ms, priority=3.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Subsequently, the first UE determines blacklist resources according to the configuration and its own information resource usage. According to the configuration, the first UE has two transmitting resources on a resource pool within the time window, where the priority of the first transmitting resource=2 and the priority of the second transmitting resource=3. In this example, the second transmitting resource reaches the assigned priority threshold and may be marked as a blacklist resource. Subsequently, a blacklist resource set may be created with the second transmitting resource in the blacklist resource set.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">3.6 The Configuration of the Resource Set Report Format</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The Type B configuration may include the configuration of the resource set report format. A resource set report format may include at least one of the following: the required resource set and/or the transmission type of resource set report. The first UE may obtain the configuration of resource set report formats through RRC signals, SCI, and/or MAC layer signaling (e.g., MAC CE) which may trigger the resource set report process. In some embodiments, the first UE may receive the resource set report format indication in the 1<sup>st </sup>stage SCI. For example, using the reserved bit(s) in the first stage SCI to indicate the resource set report format index. In some embodiments, the first UE may receive the resource set report format indication in the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage SCI. For example, defining a new 2<sup>nd </sup>stage SCI format to indicate one or more resource set report format indices, or to indicate the required resource set and the type of resource set report.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, more than one resource set report formats may be configured. In these situations, the set report formats may be marked as a resource set report format list. In a resource set report format list, each resource set report format has a unique index. By indicating the resource set report format index, the UEs may identify the corresponding resource set format report in the resource set report format list. In some embodiments, multiple resource sets are indicated in a resource set report format and the type of the resource set report may be configured for each resource set respectively.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Where the resource set report format indicates a required resource set, the first UE may report the specified resource set. To indicate the required resource set, the resource set index may be used to identify the target resource set(s), or, a bitmap sequence may be used to indicate the target resource sets in a resource set list one-by-one. In some embodiments, the required resource set may use one bit to indicate whether or not that required resource set needs to be reported to the second UE, the Tx UE.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Where the resource set report format includes the transmission type of the resource set report, the first UE may send a resource set report periodically or by one-shot. In the situation where the resource set report is configured to be reported periodically, the first UE may send the assigned resource set report with the specified period. Between periods, the first UE may update the resource set report based on the first UE's own information of resource usage. In the situation where the resource set report is configured as one-shot reporting, the first UE may send the assigned resource set report for one time.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, multiple resource sets are indicated in a resource set report format, the type of resource set report may be configured for each resource set respectively.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">3.7 The Configuration of Resources for the Resource Set Report</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The Type B configuration may include the configuration of resources for the resource set report. The resources used for carrying the resource set report may be configured/pre-configured, configured by the base station, selected by the first UE itself, or indicated by a second UE. The first UE may send the blacklist resource set report on SL. In the situation where the resource to bear the resource set report is configured/pre-configured, the configuration of resources for the resource set report may indicate one or more SL resources for carrying the resource set report. In the situation where the first UE selects SL resource itself to transmit the resource set report, the resource selection scheme may be randomly selected within the transmitting resource pool, or sensing based resource selection. The indicated resources for the resource set report may be PSCCH and/or PSSCH resources.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, the configured resources for the resource set report may be one-shot resources which contain one or more resources for reporting resource set reports one time. In other embodiments, the configured resources for the resource set report may be periodical resource which contain resource with certain periods for periodical resource set reports.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The first UE may receive the configuration of the resources for the resource report through RRC signaling and/or SCI. By using RRC signaling, the configured grant may be used to assign the resource for the resource set report, including configured grant type 1 and/or type 2. By using SCI, the first UE may use the resources for the resource set report which is assigned in the 1<sup>st </sup>stage SCI and/or 2<sup>nd </sup>stage SCI. In some embodiments, by using SCI, the first UE may use a PSSCH retransmission resource of the second UE's data packet as the resource for the resource set report.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">While various embodiments of the present solution have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not by way of limitation.
