id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, care management has been introduced as a mechanism for securing integrated provision of a nursing care service suitable for mental and physical conditions of a user, and selection of a service by the user itself, at a job site level. The care management is performed in the order of an intake, an assessment, creation of a care plan, holding of a meeting of persons in charge of service, determination of a care plan, implementation of a service, monitoring, and evaluation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiple assessment items are set for each support content to be provided to the user. A care support specialist (care manager) engaged in care management assesses the multiple assessment items when determining support contents. However, the assessment items are not necessarily provided with information. For example, support contents for enabling water to be taken daily include an assessment item for evaluating whether necessary water is taken. To evaluate this assessment item, monitoring of how much the user takes water daily is required. However, it is difficult to monitor a state of water intake of the user when the user is at home, particularly when the user is alone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, an information processing device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 acquires behavior history information including time information on behavior performed by a user and information indicating a content of the behavior, and estimates a degree of life inactivity indicating a degree of inactivity in life of the user based on the behavior history information. When determining that the degree of life inactivity is inappropriate, the information processing device extracts information on behavior that is likely to be performed by the user, as proposal candidates, from life behavior information including the information on the behavior that is likely to be performed by the user, based on the behavior history information. The information processing device selects behavior that is highly likely to be performed by the user at the time of proposal as a proposal behavior to be proposed from among the proposal candidates. The information processing device generates a proposal message of proposing the proposal behavior to the user, and presents the proposal message to the user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, the conventional technique described above is less likely to sufficiently support life of a person, and thus further improvement is required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: JP 2015-49825 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure is made to solve the above problem, and an object thereof is to provide a technique capable of sufficiently supporting life of a person.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An information processing method according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes, by a computer: acquiring sensing information output from a sensor that senses a state of a person; executing first estimation processing of estimating a state of substance intake of the person based on the sensing information; executing second estimation processing of estimating a state of activity of the person, the state being correlated with the state of substance intake, based on the sensing information; generating life support information on the person based on an execution result of the first estimation processing and an execution result of the second estimation processing; and outputting the life support information generated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure enables life of a person to be sufficiently supported.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a life support system according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support processing in a life support device according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support information generation processing in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support information generation processing in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support information generation processing in a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support information generation processing in a modification of the third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart for illustrating life support information generation processing in a fourth embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(Underlying Knowledge of Present Disclosure)</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The conventional information processing device described above is configured such that when it is determined that an estimated degree of life inactivity is inappropriate, a proposal behavior to be proposed is selected, and a proposal message of proposing the proposal behavior to a care manager, a family, a nursing care service provider, or the user itself, is presented to the user. In contrast, when it is determined that a degree of life inactivity is appropriate, the conventional information processing device does not present a proposal message to the user. The conventional information processing device estimates behavior contents of the user based on momentum information and position information, but does not estimate a state of substance intake of the user and a state of activity of the user, correlated with the state of substance intake.
