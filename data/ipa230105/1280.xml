id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method optimizes an object tracking system that uses receivers to receive beacon signals, or pings, from tracking tags that are attached to objects. An optimizer receives locations of the tracking tags and groups identifiers of the tracking tags into two or more sets. The first set identifies tracking tags that are attached to objects involved in a situation of interest. The optimizer determines a first receiver group based on the locations of tracking tags in the first set and the locations of the receivers. The optimizer determines a center of a smallest three-dimensional polygon bounding the locations of tracking tags in the first set. An antenna of each receiver in the first receiver group is then steered to point towards the center of the polygon while a number of receiver events per second generated by the receiver for tracking tags in the first set increases.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="167.05mm" wi="158.75mm"

One of the major requirements for operating in these environments is an extended operating life. Extended operating life requires a large battery size, thereby resulting in a larger overall size of the tracking tag. Further, the tracking tag is enclosed within a waterproof protective casing that has an access door to allow replacement of the battery. To ensure that the case is waterproof, the access door typically includes a seal. The device includes a battery holder that allows the battery to be replaced. All these features result in a relatively large tracking tag. Large tracking tags are a distraction to, and have an influence on, the object being tracked.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Installation, configuration, and calibration of an RF tag based object tracking system for use in a sports environment is a labor intensive and iterative process that requires expert knowledge. Receivers are first installed around a perimeter of the sports environment and each receiver is manually aimed, by eye, at a predetermined location within the sporting environment such that uniform coverage of a specific region of the sports environment (e.g., a portion of a playing surface) is achieved. An initial system performance evaluation is completed by recording and manually analyzing location data determined by the object tracking system for an RF tag placed on a technician as he/she walks a predetermined path within the sports environment. The predetermined path is designed to establish receiver coverage of the sports environment by the object tracking system. The RF tag is placed in such a way that it is free of obstruction by the technician's body (e.g., the tag is on top of a hat worn by the technician).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This recording and manual analysis process is iteratively repeated, typically using three different paths of increasing granularity. After analyzing the location data from a current path, the technician will either manually adjust one or both of pan and tilt of one or more receivers and repeat the current path, or continue the process by performing the next path.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This approach requires that the technician has a system expert's intimate knowledge of receiver characteristics and associated skill to extract information from the location data recorded for each test path. The expert knowledge required is at a very high premium and the application of the knowledge varies from technician to technician.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, installation of an RF tag based object tracking system (a) requires highly specific expert knowledge, (b) is time intensive, (c) is a labor intensive incremental adjustment process, (d) may result in the RF tag based object tracking system operating at adequate but not optimal performance, and (e) result in inconsistent performance from installation to installation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Any given sports environment easily includes hundreds of athletes and other objects that are tracked by an object tracking system, where each athlete and/or object is configured with at least one tracking tag that transmits a wireless signal (ping) that is located by the object tracking system. While such tracking systems may be optimized for the sports environment during installation, such systems do not automatically monitor and/or optimize their performance during operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Receivers of an RF tag based object tracking system are positioned around an area of interest such that each receiver covers a portion of the area of interest and in combination the receivers cover all of the area of interest. For a sports environment, the tracked area is for example a field of play and may include sideline areas.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">During installation, each receiver is configured with a single, fixed, set of characteristics that are selected to enable the receiver to detect &#x201c;pings&#x201d; (i.e., low power signal transmissions) transmitted from one or more RF tags located within a defined portion of the area of interest that is assigned to that receiver based upon anticipated environmental conditions. For example, one receiver may be configured with a high gain antenna and matching analog conditioning circuitry that includes a 6.5 GHz band pass filter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In practice, the sports environment is subjected to continual change, both environmental and situational. Environmental changes within the sports environment include the introduction of powerful electromagnetic signals (e.g., Wi-Fi or wireless broadcast camera signal). Since the RF tag based object tracking system is based upon the receivers detecting pings from the RF tags, changes in the spectral content of the sports environment are often catastrophic upon the system's ability to locate the RF tags.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Situational changes (e.g., movement of the RF tags within the sports environment) result in changes of RF tag density (i.e., the number of tags within a certain area), and thereby changes in the amount and/or frequency of pings received by each receiver of the object tracking system. The static configuration of each receiver is selected to also adequately cover anticipated situational changes. Although situational changes are not usually catastrophic to locating the RF tags, tuning the object tracking system to handle worst case tag/ping densities comes at the expense of system performance in other areas. These changing situations and environmental conditions are problematic because the receivers are statically configured for optimal performance under specific conditions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since each receiver configuration is static, the object tracking system cannot perform optimally for all environmental and situational conditions. The dynamically changing environmental and situational conditions places constantly changing demands on each receiver. These demands make it impossible to consistently achieve optimal performance of the object tracking system since it is statically configured to meet only certain of these environmental and situational conditions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Exacerbating this problem, the likelihood of environmental and situational changes is greatest on &#x201c;Game Day&#x201d; when the integrity of the object tracking system is most crucial.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an attempt to have the object tracking system operate reliably on &#x201c;Game Day,&#x201d; all environmental and situational conditions likely to exist on &#x201c;Game Day&#x201d; are anticipated and receivers of the object tracking system are configured in anticipation of these conditions. The specialized configuration (e.g., additional circuitry) required to operate effectively with the anticipated conditions often have negative effects under different conditions. Therefore, when the object tracking system is statically configured to meet all anticipated &#x201c;worst case&#x201d; conditions, the object tracking system invariably has inherently sub-optimal performance when these anticipated conditions are not prevailing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, where &#x201c;game day&#x201d; conditions are not fully anticipated, a catastrophic failure to determine locations of the RF tags may still occur within the object tracking system when such unanticipated conditions occur. Such catastrophic failure typically terminates operation of the object tracking system and requires a team of technicians to visit the stadium to physically swap out the installed receivers for receivers configured to handle the unanticipated conditions&#x2014;if identified. Such receiver replacement is costly and time consuming and addresses the current environmental condition.

herein.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Object Tracking System: A system for real time tracking of the location of objects within an operational area, where the determined location is defined based upon axes relative to the operational area.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Ping: A single transmission from a single tag. For example, a single tag programmed with a 25 Hz ping rate generates twenty-five pings per second. Pings may preferably be lower power transmissions.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Receiver Event: When a receiver detects a ping, it generates a receiver event. For example, if one ping is detected by ten receivers, ten receiver events are generated within the object tracking system.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Locate: Successful position calculation of a ping. For example, a tag transmits a ping that is detected by some number of receivers, resulting in some number of receiver events. If the object tracking system is successful in calculating a position of the tag based upon these receiver events, then the calculated position is called a Locate.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">System Bandwidth: The maximum number of receiver events the object tracking system can handle per second.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Ping Budget: The total number of pings targeted for an environment based upon an anticipated average number of receiver events expected per ping and a total available system bandwidth of the object tracking system.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Locate-to-Ping Ratio: The ratio of successful locates to the number of pings.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Ping Rate Allocation System: A system providing an automated method for setting the ping rate of tags to achieve the highest possible accuracy of locates based upon the ping budget and prioritization of the object (e.g., athlete) to which the tag is attached.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Field Perimeter: The X, Y coordinates defining a field of play (e.g., an area of interest where location is tracked more accurately, such as an American football field, a soccer pitch, a running track, and so on) using the coordinate system of the object tracking system.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Max Athlete Speed: The maximum speed at which an athlete may move in an environment. Typically assumed to be 10 yards/second.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Receiver Event Allocation System: An automated method for allocating resources of the object tracking system to maximize performance based upon priority of tracked object while remaining within bandwidth limitations of the object tracking system.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Receiver Priority Group: Collections of receivers grouped together based on their priority to system performance.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">SBWT: System Bandwidth Target. The target operating bandwidth of the object tracking system; typically 85% of the system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">System Optimizer: An automated method for dynamically allocating resources (e.g., portions of the system bandwidth) of the object tracking system, in response to athlete behavior, event flow, and changing environmental conditions to maintain the very best performance of the object tracking system at all times.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Tag Set: A collection of tags sharing a common priority level within the object tracking system.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Tag Set Boundary: Minimum boundary, shaped as a rectangle or other shape, aligned to the operational axes of the object tracking system, that contains all tags of a defined group (Tag Set).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">TS1BT: Tag Set 1 Bandwidth Target. This defines the bandwidth allocated to the highest priority tag set and is used during automatic adjustment of receiver gain. TS1BT is typically set to 70% of SBWT (System Bandwidth Target).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Object Tracking System Overview</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">An Object Tracking System determines the location of objects in a defined area (e.g., to within inches) hundreds of times per second for each object.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one exemplary object tracking system <b>100</b> with automatic optimization. System <b>100</b> tracks the location of tags <b>101</b> within an operational area <b>102</b> (i.e., a tracking environment). System <b>100</b> has six receivers <b>104</b>, positioned at known locations around operational area <b>102</b>, and in communication with a processing hub <b>150</b>. System <b>100</b> may have three or more receivers without departing from the scope hereof. Tags <b>101</b> are attached to objects to be tracked (e.g., athletes, balls, officials, and other equipment of interest), and thereby these tags <b>101</b> move within operational area <b>102</b>. Each receiver <b>104</b> is receptive to ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless signals, called &#x201c;pings&#x201d; herein (see pings <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), from tags <b>101</b> and sends one receiver event <b>110</b> to processing hub <b>150</b> for each detected ping. Algorithms <b>152</b> within processing hub <b>150</b> processes receiver events <b>110</b> and generate locate data <b>120</b> for use by one or more applications <b>130</b> via an application interface <b>156</b> configured with hub <b>150</b>. Applications <b>130</b> may include a graphic display generator that generates a graphic display showing detected locations of players on a field of play <b>103</b> (e.g., an area in which the activity of interest occurs, such as an American football field, a soccer field, an athletic running track, and so on), for example.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows tag <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in further exemplary detail. Tag <b>101</b> includes a battery <b>202</b>, circuitry <b>204</b>, and an antenna <b>206</b>. Each tag <b>101</b> has a unique tag ID <b>208</b> for identification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows tag <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> attached to an object of interest (e.g., athlete).

Each ping <b>402</b> contains information (e.g., tag ID <b>208</b> and battery level) specific to the transmitting tag <b>101</b> and, in certain embodiments, ping <b>402</b> may include information (e.g., biometric data) about the object associated with the tag. A primary function of each tag <b>101</b> is to periodically generate ping <b>402</b>. However, tag <b>101</b> may also receive transmissions that configure properties, such as ping rate, dynamically. Tag <b>101</b> may include software <b>210</b> that includes machine readable instructions that are executed to implement this functionality within tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic showing one exemplary receiver <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for receiving pings <b>402</b> transmitted by tag <b>101</b>. Receiver <b>104</b> includes a transmit/receive antenna <b>602</b>, a programmable gain stage <b>604</b>, analog signal detection electronics <b>606</b> and a communication interface <b>608</b>. Analog signal detection electronics <b>606</b> operates to generate receiver events <b>110</b> that include information received from tag <b>101</b> and a time of detection by receiver <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an optimizer <b>160</b> may be communicatively coupled with processing hub <b>150</b> to process locate data <b>120</b> and to generate configuration data <b>170</b> for dynamically controlling system <b>100</b> to have optimal performance. For example, performance of system <b>100</b> may be optimized as weather and other environmental conditions change during a monitored game, where changes in environmental conditions affect range and detectability of pings <b>402</b> by receivers <b>104</b>. In another example, tags <b>101</b> are dynamically configured based upon and their location, such as when on field of play <b>103</b> (i.e., when the athlete is actively participating in a current play) as opposed to when off field of play <b>103</b> (i.e., when the athlete is not involved in a current play).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Processing hub <b>150</b> includes a communication interface <b>154</b> for communicating with receivers <b>104</b>, via communication interface <b>608</b>, to receive receiver events <b>110</b>. Algorithms <b>152</b> process receiver events <b>110</b> from multiple receivers <b>104</b> to locate tags <b>101</b> and generate locate data <b>120</b>. For example, based upon three or more receiver events <b>110</b> resulting from one ping <b>402</b> from one tag <b>101</b>, algorithms <b>152</b> generate locate data <b>120</b> to include tag ID <b>208</b> and a determined location of tag <b>101</b>. Application interface <b>156</b> communicates with one or more applications <b>130</b>. For example, each application <b>130</b> receives locate data <b>120</b> from hub <b>500</b> and may further process this information to generate displays indicative of the location within an operation environment of objects (e.g., athletes) associated with tags <b>101</b> based upon tag ID <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In one embodiment, optimizer <b>160</b> is a computer with at least one processor and memory containing machine readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, perform the functionality of optimizer <b>160</b> as described herein. In another embodiment, optimizer <b>160</b> is implemented within processing hub <b>150</b> and comprises machine readable instructions stored within a memory of hub <b>150</b> and executed by a processor of hub <b>150</b> to perform functionality of optimizer <b>160</b> as described herein. Optimizer <b>160</b> generates configuration data <b>170</b> that configures various properties of object tracking system <b>100</b>, such as for example ping rate of tags <b>101</b>, analog gain of each receiver <b>104</b>, and parameters used within algorithms <b>152</b> of hub <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Basic Location Operation:</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The process of locating an object associated with tag <b>101</b> begins when tag <b>101</b> generates ping <b>402</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, ping <b>402</b> propagates radially outward from antenna <b>206</b> of tag <b>101</b> toward receivers <b>104</b>, positioned around the perimeter of operational area <b>102</b>. Receivers <b>104</b> within a transmission range of tag <b>101</b>, and having a line of sight (LOS) to tag <b>101</b>, receive ping <b>402</b>. By &#x201c;LOS&#x201d;, as used herein, it is meant a straight line of wireless transmission that is not obstructed. LOS does not necessarily relate to visual line of sight. Signal strength of ping <b>402</b> at each receiver <b>104</b> depends upon a distance between tag <b>101</b> and that receiver <b>104</b>, and whether there were any obstructions, such as player bodies or other objects, between the tag and the receiver (i.e., preventing LOS). Whether, or not, receiver <b>104</b> is able to decode information (e.g., tag ID <b>208</b> and other information) of ping <b>402</b> depends upon the signal strength of ping <b>402</b> at the receiver and the gain setting of programmable gain stage <b>604</b> of the receiver. If the signal strength and gain setting are sufficient to allow analog signal detection electronics <b>606</b> to decode the information within ping <b>402</b>, analog signal detection electronics <b>606</b> time-stamps that information and passes it along as receiver event <b>110</b> to processing hub <b>150</b>. Where processing hub <b>150</b> receives at least three receive events <b>110</b> for ping <b>402</b> (i.e., at least three receivers <b>104</b> receive and decode the same ping <b>402</b> based upon tag ID <b>208</b> and time stamp within each receiver event <b>110</b>), algorithms <b>152</b> within processing hub <b>150</b> have a sufficient number of data points (time stamps) to attempt location of tag <b>101</b> using time difference of arrival (TDOA) techniques, as discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Since ping <b>402</b> travels outward at a constant speed in all directions, the time it takes to reach each receiver <b>104</b> depends directly upon the distance between tag <b>101</b> and that receiver. That is, ping <b>402</b> reaches receivers <b>104</b> in order based upon the distance of each receiver from tag <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows exemplary propagation of ping <b>402</b> from tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) to each of receivers <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>5</b>), and <b>104</b>(<b>6</b>) within operational area <b>102</b>. Concentric rings <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, and <b>708</b>, represent the position of ping <b>402</b> at times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, and t<b>4</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, ping <b>402</b> reaches first receiver <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>) (ring <b>702</b>) at time t<b>1</b>, then reaches receiver <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>) (ring <b>704</b>) at time t<b>2</b>, then reaches receiver <b>104</b>(<b>5</b>) (ring <b>706</b>) at time t<b>3</b>, and then reaches receiver <b>104</b>(<b>6</b>) (ring <b>708</b>) at time t<b>4</b>. Thus, receiver <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>) generates a receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) including tag ID <b>208</b> of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) and a time stamp of t<b>1</b>, receiver <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>) generates a receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) including tag ID <b>208</b> of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) and a time stamp of t<b>2</b>, receiver <b>104</b>(<b>5</b>) generates a receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>3</b>) including tag ID <b>208</b> of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) and a time stamp of t<b>3</b>, and receiver <b>104</b>(<b>6</b>) generates a receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) including tag ID <b>208</b> of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) and a time stamp of t<b>4</b>. Each receiver event <b>110</b> also identifies the generating receiver <b>410</b>. For example, receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) includes a receiver ID <b>714</b>(<b>2</b>) that identifies receiver <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) includes a receiver ID <b>714</b>(<b>3</b>) that identifies receiver <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>3</b>) includes a receiver ID <b>714</b>(<b>5</b>) that identifies receiver <b>104</b>(<b>5</b>), and receiver event <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) includes a receiver ID <b>714</b>(<b>6</b>) that identifies receiver <b>104</b>(<b>6</b>). Although the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, and t<b>4</b> having different values, t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, and t<b>4</b> need not be different.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">A TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) is t<b>2</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b>; a TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>3</b>) is t<b>3</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b>; a TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) is t<b>4</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b>; a TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>3</b>) is t<b>3</b>&#x2212;t<b>2</b>; a TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) is t<b>4</b>&#x2212;t<b>2</b>; and a TDOA for receiver events <b>110</b>(<b>3</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) is t<b>4</b>&#x2212;t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In one embodiment, receivers <b>104</b> are fixed at known (e.g., measured during installation) locations around operational area <b>102</b> such that the location of each receiver <b>104</b> relative to the operational area is known to algorithms <b>152</b>, allowing algorithms <b>152</b> to calculate the location of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) relative to receivers <b>104</b>, and thereby relative to operational area <b>102</b>, based upon TDOA times determined from receiver events <b>110</b>. Such algorithms are known in the art, and are therefore not described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">A successful calculation of a location of the tag <b>101</b> by processing hub <b>150</b> is called a Locate. Locate data <b>120</b> contains many such locates as determined for each tag <b>101</b> within operational area <b>102</b>. Locates, within locate data <b>120</b>, are made available to applications <b>130</b> in real-time (i.e., almost instantaneously). Thus, applications <b>130</b> have real-time identification and location information of each tag <b>101</b> and its associated object within operational area <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Not all pings <b>402</b> result in locates. During typical operation of object tracking system <b>100</b>, nearly 50% of all pings <b>402</b> generated by tags <b>101</b> fail to result in a locate. There are many reasons that locates cannot be successfully calculated. For example, where fewer than three receivers <b>104</b> successfully decode any one ping <b>402</b>, algorithms <b>152</b> cannot determine a location. In another example, where three receiver events <b>110</b> are received for one ping <b>402</b>, algorithms <b>152</b> may fail to converge on a single location and therefore fail to determine a location of tag <b>101</b>. Even when processing hub <b>150</b> fails to determine a valid locate for a particular ping <b>402</b>, the processing hub still makes information (e.g., the reason for failing to produce a locate and the specific receivers <b>104</b> that provided receiver events <b>110</b>) about ping <b>402</b> available in real-time. Although information of failed locates is not useful in most applications <b>130</b> since it does not provide tracking data, such information is extremely useful for monitoring the behavior and health of system <b>100</b> during operation and for optimizing performance of system <b>100</b> using optimizer <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Tag Modifications</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows tag <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> in further exemplary detail.

The primary concerns when mounting tags <b>101</b> in shoulders pads include (a) player safety, (b) range of motion, (c) horizontal mounting, and (d) physical protection of the tag.

Virtually all manufactured shoulder pads have a mounting location that meets these requirements to an acceptable level. With the player's safety and range of motion addressed and tag <b>101</b> adequately protected, the focus moves to optimizing performance of tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows tag <b>101</b> positioned on top of a player's head <b>1702</b> (e.g., configured within a helmet worn by the player) to provide a 360&#xb0; radial transmission pattern <b>1802</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, when the tag is horizontal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows two tags <b>101</b>, each positioned on a different shoulder of the player. The transmission of pings <b>402</b> from each tag <b>101</b> is partially obstructed by the player's neck and head <b>2002</b>. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. To minimize the impact of this line of sight obstruction between tag <b>101</b> and receivers <b>104</b>, tags <b>101</b> are placed on the shoulder as far away from the neck and head as possible while meeting the concerns described above. This reduces transmission blocking to the greatest extent possible.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0185">In an American Football game example, assume a player is standing with their shoulders facing an end zone and tag <b>101</b> has its line of site to a line of receiver <b>104</b> that are 300&#x2032; away blocked by the players head and neck.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a first scenario <b>2100</b> where tag <b>101</b> is mounted in the pads along the neck hole and positioned 2&#x2033; from the players head and neck. Given the proximity of tag <b>101</b> to the player's neck and head, a wide angle (e.g., 126&#xb0;) of transmission is blocked by the athlete's head and neck. At a range of 300&#x2032;, the length (d) of a transmission blockage is approximately 1176 feet, thus eliminating an entire side of operating area <b>102</b> and any receivers <b>104</b> positioned along that side.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a second scenario <b>2200</b> where tag <b>101</b> is mounted in the pads (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) and positioned 7&#x2033; from the players head and neck. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, this mounting position for tag <b>101</b> greatly reduces the portion of the transmission blocked by the neck and head by about 50% to approximately 60&#xb0;. In this example, at a range of 300&#x2032;, the length (d) of the transmission blockage is reduced to approximately 345 feet, thereby allowing a much greater line of site access for receivers <b>104</b> to receive pings <b>402</b> from tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0188">Shoulder Centerline Mounting</p><p id="p-0186" num="0189">Consideration is also given to how an athlete moves while playing their sport. Continuing with the American Football example, a player may be in a bent forward position while lining up for a play to start, and may be bent slightly forward while running during the play. In most football situations, other than walking around between plays, a player has some sort of bend in their hips, with his torso tilted forward. Therefore, to achieve optimum tag transmission the tag is mounted as far back from the centerline of the shoulders as possible while meeting the other concerns of positioning described above. This positions tag <b>101</b> substantially horizontal during game play and thereby optimizes propagation of pings <b>402</b> from the tag.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0190">Benefits of Mounting Tags on Shoulders</p><p id="p-0188" num="0191">A. Elimination of Single Point of Failure</p><p id="p-0189" num="0192">Mounting two tags <b>101</b>, each within a different shoulder pad of the same player, has certain advantages over using a single tag mounted in the player's helmet. For example, if a player is fitted with a single tag (e.g., configured in the helmet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref>) fails at any time during game play, positional information of that player would be lost for the remainder of the game. Such information loss for the player over an extended time during game play may misrepresent player participation and within tracking system <b>100</b>, automatic play start and stop detection malfunctions, and play type detection malfunctions may occur. By placing two tags <b>101</b> in both left and right shoulder pads of a single player, redundant player position data is achieved, thus eliminating a single point of failure within tracking system <b>100</b>. In American Football there are also many occurrences during play where a single tag <b>101</b> on one shoulder of a player may have no line of sight to a sufficient number of receivers <b>104</b> (a minimum of three receiver events <b>110</b> for a single ping <b>402</b> is required to determine a location) to calculate positional data. During these occurrences the opposing shoulder tag <b>101</b> is likely to still have line of sight to at least three receivers <b>104</b> resulting in continued determination of positional data for the tracked player.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0193">B. Centerline Constant</p><p id="p-0191" num="0194">When both left shoulder and right shoulder tags <b>101</b> are functioning normally, and have adequate line of site to receivers <b>104</b>, their positional data may be combined to form a single player object. This single player object combines positional data from both tags to create a center line representation of the player's position. This center line calculated position provides a more accurate representation of the center of a player's position on the playing field.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0195">C. Rotational Information</p><p id="p-0193" num="0196">Using the relative positional data from two tags <b>101</b> positioned on the left and right shoulders of a player, prior to creating the single player object as described above, allows system <b>100</b> to determine a direction (rotation) that the player is facing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>25</b></figref> show exemplary displays <b>2300</b>, <b>2400</b>, and <b>2500</b>, respectively, illustrating player objects <b>2302</b> that include an arrow to indicate the direction that the player is facing. Rotational data is a useful addition to locate data <b>120</b>, particularly for a coaching application <b>130</b>. Further, the inclusion of rotational data greatly eases the task of creating avatar representations from game data sets created by recording locate data <b>120</b> (e.g., within an application <b>130</b>) during a game.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0197">AcceloTag</p><p id="p-0195" num="0198">As discussed in further detail below, object tracking system <b>100</b> has a bandwidth limit for the number of receiver events <b>110</b> (and thereby a number of pings <b>402</b>) that it may continuously handle. To avoid saturation of system <b>100</b>, tags <b>101</b> may be configured with a ping rate (i.e., a rate at which tag <b>101</b> generates pings <b>402</b>, such as ten pings per second for example) based upon the (a) the bandwidth limit of system <b>100</b> and (b) the expected activity of each object (e.g., a player/athlete) to which the tags are configured. Objects that are expected to have greater movement and/or activity are of most interest to application <b>130</b>, and ultimately viewers thereof, connected to system <b>100</b>. Thus, tracking tags attached to these objects are typically configured with a higher ping rate such that system <b>100</b> determines the location of these objects more frequently. Where the expected activity of the object is accurately predicted, this method of operation works well. However, where the activity of the object does not occur as expected, the allocated ping rates may result in non-optimal tracking by system <b>100</b>. For example, where a player is expected to have a high level of activity, a high ping rate is allocated to one or more tags <b>101</b> attached to that player. When the player does not exhibit the expected activity, bandwidth of the tracking system is wasted. Where another player is not expected to have a high activity level, tags associated with that player are configured with a low ping rate. However, if that player does exhibit a high level of activity, system <b>100</b> may not track that player with the accuracy and reliability commensurate with the activity due to the lower ping rate.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows one exemplary tag <b>2601</b> that is similar to tag <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, including a battery <b>2602</b>, a microcontroller <b>2604</b>, an antenna <b>2606</b>, and an RF circuit <b>2616</b>, but is further configured with a movement sensor <b>2650</b>. Microcontroller <b>2604</b> includes a processor <b>2620</b> and memory <b>2622</b> shown storing a ping rate <b>2626</b> and an algorithm <b>2628</b>. RF circuit <b>2616</b> is for example a transceiver for receiving and transmitting radio signals via antenna <b>2606</b>. For example, RF circuit <b>2616</b>, under control of microcontroller <b>2604</b>, generates pings (e.g., ping <b>402</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), based upon ping rate <b>2626</b>, that are detected by receivers <b>104</b> of system <b>100</b>. Movement sensor <b>2650</b> is for example one or more of an accelerometer, a GPS receiver, and so on, that operates to determine movement of tag <b>2601</b>. In one embodiment, movement sensor <b>2650</b> includes three orthogonally orientated accelerometers that cooperate to detect acceleration of tag <b>2601</b> in three dimensions.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0200">Algorithm <b>2628</b> contains machine readable instructions (i.e., software) that are executed by processor <b>2620</b> to detect movement of tag <b>2601</b> using movement sensor <b>2650</b>. Algorithm <b>2628</b> thereby detects movement and/or activity of an athlete configured with tag <b>2601</b>. Algorithm <b>2628</b> may utilize acceleration information from movement sensor <b>2650</b> to determine activity as a speed of tracking tag <b>2601</b> in a horizontal plane. Based upon this determined activity, algorithm <b>2628</b> may increase and/or decrease ping rate <b>2626</b>, thereby adjusting the rate at which pings are transmitted from tracking tag <b>2601</b>. In one example of operation, when algorithm <b>2628</b> detects that tracking tag <b>2601</b> is stationary or moving very little, algorithm <b>2628</b> reduces the value of ping rate <b>2626</b>, thereby reducing the rate at which pings are transmitted from tracking tag <b>2601</b>. In another example of operation, when algorithm <b>2628</b> detects that determined activity (e.g., speed) of tracking tag <b>2601</b> has increased above a predefined threshold, algorithm <b>2628</b> increases the value of ping rate <b>2626</b>, thereby increasing the rate at which pings are transmitted from tracking tag <b>2601</b>.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0201">Tracking tag <b>2601</b> is optionally configured (e.g., predefined within memory <b>2622</b> or automatically set by system <b>100</b>) with ping rate limits, such as one or both of a maximum ping rate <b>2630</b> and a minimum ping rate <b>2632</b> that define a maximum and a minimum rate, respectively, that tag <b>2601</b> may transmit pings. For example, maximum ping rate <b>2630</b> and/or minimum ping rate <b>2632</b> may be set by the object tracking system based upon one or more of bandwidth limitations, a number of active tracking tags <b>2601</b>, and a type of expected activity (e.g., sport and event types). When configured with one or both ping rate limits, algorithm <b>2628</b> operates to adjust ping rate <b>2626</b> between minimum ping rate <b>2632</b> and maximum ping rate <b>2630</b>. Thus, automatic optimization of object tracking system <b>100</b>, as described above, may be used in combination with automatic ping rate adjustment of tracking tag <b>2601</b>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0202">Use of algorithm <b>2628</b> and movement sensor <b>2650</b> within tracking tag <b>2601</b> increases reliability of system <b>100</b> to track objects configured with tag <b>2601</b> as compared to tracking of objects configured with tag <b>101</b>, particularly when objects becomes more active than expected. In an American football example, a lineman is not expected to move very quickly and a ping rate of tags <b>2601</b> associated with the lineman is configured with a relatively low ping rate. However, if the lineman unexpectedly receives the ball and runs towards the end zone, ping rate <b>2626</b> of tracking tag <b>2601</b> is automatically increased by algorithm <b>2628</b>, based upon activity detected by movement sensor <b>2650</b> thereby enabling the tracking system to determine location (i.e., locates) for the lineman at an increased rate commensurate with the actual motion of the lineman.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0203">In one embodiment, algorithm <b>2628</b> compares detected motion from movement sensor <b>2650</b> to a predefined threshold <b>2634</b>, wherein algorithm <b>2628</b> increases ping rate <b>2626</b> when detected motion is greater than predefined threshold <b>2634</b> (e.g., until ping rate <b>2626</b> reaches maximum ping rate <b>2630</b>), and wherein algorithm <b>2628</b> decreases ping rate <b>2626</b> (e.g., until ping rate <b>2626</b> reaches a minimum ping rate <b>2632</b>) when detected motion is less than predefined threshold <b>2634</b>.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0204">Algorithm <b>2628</b> may be configured specifically to the type of activity (e.g., type of sporting event) being tracked. For example, algorithm <b>2628</b> may be configured to determine ping rate <b>2626</b> using a specific formula and detected motion, where the specific formula calculates ping rate <b>2626</b> proportional to the detected motion given the limitations of the type of activity. Examples of formulae that determine and/or change ping rate <b>2626</b> relative to sensed motion from movement sensor <b>2650</b> may include one or more of a simple linear relationship, a thresholded relationship, a weighted relationship, and a non-linear relationship.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0205">In one example of operation, microcontroller <b>2604</b> runs algorithm <b>2628</b> to set ping rate <b>2626</b> to a default or baseline rate that is predetermined by designers of the system and/or dynamically by system <b>100</b>. During a tracked event, microcontroller <b>2604</b> executes algorithm <b>2628</b> to read movement sensor <b>2650</b> (e.g., by either sampling analog outputs or reading digital outputs of movement sensor <b>2650</b>) and to adjust or change ping rate <b>2626</b> to control the rate at which pings are transmitted from tracking tag <b>2601</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0206">Since algorithm <b>2628</b> automatically controls ping rate <b>2626</b> in real-time based upon actual activity of the object being tracked (as opposed to predicted activity), bandwidth of the tracking system is automatically allocated to tags associated with the active objects. Least active objects automatically have a lower ping rate as compared to more active objects. For example, during a play in an American football game, players that are most involved in manipulating (e.g., throwing, catching and running with) the football, both for offensive and defensive teams, are the ones moving and changing directions at the highest rate. Players that have a brief interaction with the play may stop moving or slow down significantly. Thus, each tracking tag <b>2601</b> automatically configures itself such that players with the highest level of motion and change of direction have the highest ping rates and lesser active players have a correspondingly lower ping rate. The tracking system is therefore automatically optimized to track the more active (e.g., faster) players and is less burdened by tracking of slower players; equivocal location calculations are not required for all players. Further, since this technique is automatic and autonomous within each tag, no additional reconfiguration or reconfiguration overhead occurs within receivers or location processors of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0207">In an alternate embodiment, within each tracking tag <b>2601</b>, algorithm <b>2628</b> determines activity of tracking tag <b>2601</b> based upon movement sensor <b>2650</b> and sends (e.g., by including a value indicative of the activity and/or acceleration within each ping transmitted from tag <b>2601</b>) an indication of the activity to the object tracking system. The object tracking system may utilize an algorithm to determine an optimal ping rate for each tracking tag <b>2601</b>, and then automatically set (e.g., wirelessly) ping rate <b>2626</b> of each tracking tag <b>2601</b> individually and/or collectively (e.g., in groups).

The assignment of specific tags <b>101</b> to athletes, and the configuration of those tags, is technically straightforward for an individual tag. However, in the &#x201c;game day&#x201d; environment, managing a large number (i.e., hundreds) of tags in a relatively short period before the start of an event is challenging.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> shows one exemplary tag manager <b>2802</b> for managing and configuring tags <b>101</b>.

Tag manager <b>2802</b> includes software <b>2810</b> that has machine readable instructions stored within memory <b>2806</b> and executed by processor <b>2808</b> to provide functionality of tag manager <b>2802</b> as described below. In one embodiment, tag manager <b>2802</b> is a tablet PC and software <b>2810</b> is a standard Windows program.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0214">In the following example, two tags <b>101</b> are installed in the left and right shoulder pads of an American football player. However, the following procedure process applies to any number of sports where one or more tags are to be installed on each athlete.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0215">As described above, each tag <b>101</b> includes unique tag ID <b>208</b>.

Tag manager <b>2802</b> is also used to configure multiple tags <b>101</b> collectively, such as setting parameters <b>2801</b> for tags attached to all athletes in a locker room before and/or after a sporting event. Transceiver <b>2804</b> has low sensitivity and wireless range such that communication with tag <b>101</b> only occurs when tag is in close proximity to tag manager <b>2806</b> thus limiting the possibility of inadvertently programming tags installed in equipment of other players.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0216">A typical sporting event involves hundreds of tags, and without tag manager <b>2802</b>, alphanumeric tag ID <b>208</b> of each tag <b>101</b> would need to be manually entered into a tag assignment table together with identification of the athlete to which the tag is associated. Typically, these type of tag ID's are long strings of seemingly random alphanumeric characters (e.g., 8-digit hexadecimal numbers). Entering hundreds of these numbers manually almost inevitably leads to human error. With such a manual method, the first sign of a data entry error is typically when an athlete later walks out on the field and is his tags cannot be read. At that point, it is usually too late to find and correct the error resulting in data for that tag ID which is missing or, even worse, inaccurate for the entire event.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0217">Tag manager <b>2802</b> includes tag list <b>2814</b> (e.g., a file stored in memory <b>2806</b> and/or within a database <b>2812</b>) that includes a list of tag IDs <b>208</b> for a particular collection of tags <b>101</b>. Tag manager <b>2802</b> builds tag list <b>2814</b> by automatically reading tag ID <b>208</b> from each tag <b>101</b> within the collection (e.g., say a bag or a box of tags). Continuing with the American football example, to install two tags in each of 50 pairs of shoulder pads, the first step would be to create two tag lists <b>2814</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>2814</b>(<b>2</b>), each having 50 tags, one list for the left shoulders and one for the right shoulders, respectively.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0218">Tag manager <b>2802</b> also includes a roster list <b>2816</b> (e.g., a file stored within memory <b>2806</b> and/or within database <b>2812</b>) that contains information about each athlete on a single team. For each player, at a minimum, roster list <b>2816</b> contains a player number or name and a tag ID <b>208</b> for each tag that installed on or associated with the athlete, as well as the position of the tag on the athlete (e.g., left shoulder).

Where system <b>100</b> is operating without interference, locate data <b>120</b> defining the location of each tag <b>101</b> is regularly reported (many times a second) and is reliably and consistently accurate. However, various anomalous conditions may arise that degrade the accuracy of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0229">System <b>100</b> may include a continuous accuracy monitoring application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) that provides a continuous measure of location accuracy within system <b>100</b>. Where application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) determines that accuracy of system <b>100</b> is affected beyond a pre-set threshold, an operator is immediately notified and may take appropriate corrective action.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0230">System <b>100</b> uses the precise physical location (X,Y,Z) of each receiver <b>104</b>, as well as the location (e.g., X, Y, Z position relative to receivers <b>104</b>) of one or more test tags <b>101</b>. The calibration and accuracy of system <b>100</b> depends upon knowing these precise locations. The position measurements of all other tags <b>101</b> by system <b>100</b> are indirectly based on these test tags. Once installed, system <b>100</b> is robust and reliable by design, but there are various events and situations that may compromise accuracy of the position measurements for all tags by the system. Distinct from catastrophic system failures, compromised location accuracy may easily go unnoticed for an extended period, resulting in a data set for the event which, at best, is suspect or, at worst, is completely unusable.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0231">Application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) constantly monitors the system's overall accuracy of measurement and immediately alerts an operator of system <b>100</b> when measured accuracy is outside a pre-set threshold. When system <b>100</b> is installed, some number of test tags are physically mounted at fixed locations within or around operating area <b>102</b> (e.g., within the sports facility). In one embodiment, test tags <b>101</b> are permanently mounted with a continuous power supply in place of battery <b>202</b>. System <b>100</b> may include two or three test tags <b>101</b> on each side of operating area <b>102</b>, spaced at roughly even intervals. When system <b>100</b> is installed, the precise (X, Y, Z) positions of these test tags are measured (e.g., by a laser measurement device) to the same level of exactness as the determined location of receivers <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0232">When these test tags are installed there are a set of conditions that must be met for the continuous accuracy monitoring system to work:</p><p id="p-0230" num="0233">Each test tag <b>101</b> is triangulated upon using a subset of all receivers <b>104</b> of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0234">Each receiver <b>104</b> is involved in the triangulation of at least one test tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0235">Once system <b>100</b> is installed, the position of each test tag <b>101</b>, as determined by system <b>100</b>, is recorded. Ideally, the position of each test tag <b>101</b> determined by system <b>100</b> exactly matches the laser measured position of each test tag <b>101</b>. In reality, however, there is always a small discrepancy; the accepted error range is +/&#x2212;6 inches for example. The discrepancy is recorded upon the initial triangulation of each test tag. During the initial installation the only significance to those error measurements is that they should be less than the maximum allowed system error. If not, it indicates a problem with the installation that must be fixed before proceeding.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0236">Once installation is complete, continuous accuracy monitoring application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) continuously reads the reported position of each test tag <b>101</b>. Each reported position may vary slightly due to noise within system <b>100</b>. System <b>100</b> averages the incoming position measurements for each test tag <b>101</b> to reduce the system noise. Application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) then calculates the error using the averaged position measurement and the laser measured position of the test tag <b>101</b>. System <b>100</b> then compares this measured error to the acceptable error (e.g., +/&#x2212;six inches) for that tag. If the difference between these two errors is greater than the pre-determined threshold, or if the measured error itself is greater than the maximum acceptable error, then application <b>130</b>(<b>2</b>) generates an alert condition.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0237">The alert condition consists of popping up a message on the operator's PC, logging the condition in a log file and broadcasting the event on the PC's network to all connected system application programs that a system operator would use.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0238">One of the advantages of the design of system <b>100</b>, particularly as deployed for sporting venues, is that there is a great deal of redundancy built in. Even if many important individual components fail, system <b>100</b> continues to work with a reasonable level of smoothly decreased accuracy or throughput. While system <b>100</b> is still usable in that case, it is still very important to be aware of the fault.

Most sports, including American football, have a defined number of formations or situations. In American football, a team may line up in one of: a &#x201c;short yardage&#x201d; formation, a &#x201c;kick off&#x201d; formation, a &#x201c;running&#x201d; formation, and a &#x201c;passing&#x201d; formation, and so on. These formations are well known in the sport, together with expected player motion resulting from each specific formation. Ping rate allocator <b>3502</b> compares relative locations of tags <b>101</b> on field of play <b>103</b> against the relative positions of players within play formations <b>3516</b> to determine a type of play that is likely to occur next. Play formations <b>3516</b> is for example a database of predetermined formations that result in a predictive play. By matching the location of tags <b>101</b> of one or both teams on the field of play to formations within play formations <b>3516</b>, ping rate allocator <b>3502</b> determines likely motion of each player and configures the tag <b>101</b> of these players accordingly.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0284"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> shows one exemplary short yardage formation <b>4100</b> in an American football game. Short yardage formation <b>4100</b> is typically used when the offensive team needs a very small amount of yardage on the upcoming play. The teams typically line up in a tight formation, where all players are bounded by a bounding rectangle <b>4102</b> of a first size. Short yardage formation <b>4100</b> almost invariably results in low speed motion and very limited distances traveled by all players on field of play <b>103</b>. Therefore, ping rate allocator <b>3502</b>, upon matching short yardage formation <b>4100</b> within play formations <b>3516</b>, uses high low ping rate algorithm shown in method <b>3700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> (and detailed within Table 3 High/Low Prioritization Example and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>) to assign ping rates to each tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref> shows one exemplary passing formation <b>4200</b> in an American football game. Passing formation <b>4200</b> is very commonly used during a game when a team is hoping to make a passing play to advance the ball further up the field as compared to a short yardage play. As shown, players in passing formation <b>4200</b> are more spread out, having a bounding rectangle <b>4202</b> of a second size that is significantly larger than the first size of bounding rectangle <b>4102</b> of short yardage formation <b>4100</b>. In particular, within passing formation <b>4200</b>, skill players are positioned wide from the linemen. Passing formation <b>4200</b> has a much higher likelihood of differentiation in the speed, and distances traveled, by athletes based on their position, as compared to athlete movement with short yardage formation <b>4100</b>. Therefore, ping rate allocator <b>3502</b> uses the more complex High/Low and Position prioritization as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, and detailed in Table 4 High/Low &#x26; Position Prioritization Example.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0286">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b> and <b>42</b></figref>, the bounding rectangle is used to determine the type of play likely to occur.

Receiver <b>104</b> is tuned to receive at 6.55 GHz center frequency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> shows a graph <b>5400</b> illustrating one exemplary response curve of an &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver with unity gain at approximately 6.6 GHz.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0351">Absent other wireless signals within the operational environment (i.e., operational area <b>102</b>) of system <b>100</b>, detecting of pings <b>402</b> using the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receivers is relatively simple. In the typical environments where UWB tracking systems are deployed, such as hospitals and manufacturing plants, there is a high level of wireless signal coordination and interference from other wireless systems within the frequency range of 6-7 GHz does not occur. However, system <b>100</b> operates within a &#x201c;Game Day&#x201d; environment at a major sporting venue where there is a wide spectrum of other wireless systems including, but not limited to, venue WiFi at 5.8 GHz, coaching communication systems at varied frequencies, wireless broadcast camera systems at 2.4, 4.6, 5.8, and 7.1 GHz and transmission towers located outside the venue typically transmitting at 7.0 GHz or higher. Although, on paper, it seems that these other wireless systems do not transmit at the frequency range (6.35-6.75 GHz) used by system <b>100</b>, and would therefore not interfere, in the real world, other wireless systems of the Game Day environment may cause the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receivers to be unable to detect the low power pings <b>402</b> from tags <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0352">Many factors prevent the successful use of &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receivers within the Game Day environment. For example, tags <b>101</b> are tuned to transmit at approximately 6.55 GHz, whereas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, the response curve of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver has a center frequency (unity gain, or 0 dB attenuation) at 6.6 GHz. The attenuation of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver at 6.35 GHz is &#x2dc;14 dB and at 6.75 GHz is &#x2dc;9 dB. Also note that the response curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> shows that while attenuated, signals below 6.35 GHz and above 6.75 GHz are allowed to pass through the front end of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver. Since tags <b>101</b> transmit in the 6.35-6.75 GHz range, ping <b>402</b> passes through the front end of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver; however, since signal from tag <b>101</b> is transmitted at a power of 1 mW, these signals are not as strong as signals from other systems within the Game Day environment. For example, a wireless broadcast camera typically transmits signals at a power of 250 mW. Although the center frequency of these other wireless systems is outside the 6.35-6.75 GHz range, the higher output power at their center frequency typically results in harmonics and stray transmissions at frequencies close to the 6.35-6.75 GHz range.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0353">Since the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver front end attenuates, rather than rejects, signals outside the 6.35-6.75 GHz range, some portion of the energy from these other wireless systems passes through the front end of to reach the analog detection electronics <b>606</b>. Given the significantly stronger signals from these other transmission sources (250 times stronger from the wireless broad cast camera), the energy passing through the front end of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver may saturate the analog detection electronics <b>606</b> and prevent detection of ping <b>402</b> from tag <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0354">Band Pass Filtering</p><p id="p-0354" num="0355"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> is a composite graph <b>5500</b> showing the response curve of graph <b>5400</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, and a desired frequency range <b>5502</b> of 6.35-675 GHz. Frequencies outside desired frequency range <b>5502</b> (i.e., below 6.35 GHz and above 6.75 GHz) are not desired. As noted above, energy from a signal at a frequency close to the desired range may pass through the front end to be received by the analog detection circuitry of the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver. Since ping <b>402</b> is transmitted at 1 mW, it does not take very much stray energy from a signal at a frequency outside desired frequency range <b>5502</b> to disrupt detection of the ping.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0356">Receiver <b>104</b> is improved, as compared to the &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receivers described above, by inserting a band-pass filter <b>5320</b> immediately after antenna <b>602</b> and before programmable gain stage <b>604</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>. An ideal band-pass filter has unity gain in the pass band (i.e., 6.35-6.75 GHz) and 100% attenuation outside the pass band (i.e., frequencies below 6.35 GHz and above 6.75 GHz). Desired frequency range <b>5502</b> represents an ideal 6.35-6.75 GHz band-pass filter implementation. In practice, at UWB frequencies, the introduction of any circuit elements in the signal path introduces some level of attenuation, known as &#x201c;insertion loss&#x201d;. Insertion loss thereby degrades signals from tags <b>101</b>. Therefore, a critical design goal of band-pass filter <b>5320</b> is to minimize insertion loss. In practice, analog filters also do not have a vertical roll off (i.e., fast change in response) between the pass and the reject bands. However, the steeper the roll off between pass band and reject bands, the more effective the band-pass filter is in blocking undesired energy from passing through to the programmable gain stage <b>604</b> and detection electronics <b>606</b>. Thus, a second critical design goal of band-pass filter <b>5320</b> is to provide a very steep roll off between the pass band and the reject bands.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0357">Physical Implementation</p><p id="p-0357" num="0358"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> shows exemplary components that are used to upgrade an &#x201c;off-the-shelf&#x201d; receiver (i.e., a commercially available UWB receiver) to a band-pass filter enhanced UWB Receiver (i.e., receiver <b>104</b>) for use within a game day environment.

In normal operation of system <b>100</b>, reduced accuracy locates are filtered out of locate data <b>120</b> by post-locate filters such as data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, and receiver count filter <b>7516</b>. However, when system <b>100</b> fails to generate sufficient locates, a filter controller <b>7502</b> within optimizer <b>160</b> operates to automatically adjust controlling parameters (e.g., thresholds <b>7511</b>, <b>7513</b> and <b>7515</b>, and three locate enable <b>7517</b>) of one or more post locate filters (e.g., data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, and receiver count filter <b>7516</b>) to increase tolerance within these filters to allow more locates to be output within locate data <b>120</b> at the expense of accuracy of those generated locates.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0432">The reliability level of locates varies depending on a number of different factors. There are various methods of estimating the reliability level of locates, as discussed below. Within processing hub <b>150</b>, generated locates pass through an array of filtering algorithms. These filtering algorithms fall into two general categories: (a) signal processing and (b) identify &#x26; drop. Dynamic optimization is performed only for (b) identify &#x26; drop algorithms such as data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, and receiver count filter <b>7516</b>, which operate to evaluate several attributes of each locate to estimate its reliability. If the estimated reliability of the locate is below a specified threshold in any of these, then the locate is discarded to reduce the number of locates generated by system <b>100</b> in favor of higher reliability locates.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0433">Where all receivers <b>104</b> are operating at maximum gain and locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> of system <b>100</b> is still insufficient, filter controller <b>7502</b> within optimizer <b>160</b> automatically adjusts thresholds <b>7511</b>, <b>7513</b> and <b>7515</b>, and three locate enable <b>7517</b> of data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, and receiver count filter <b>7516</b>, respectively, to achieve an acceptable locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b>. These adjustments are made at the expense of generating locates with less reliable location information and of thereby potentially reducing overall accuracy of system <b>100</b>. The rationale for this is that once locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> falls below a certain level, gaps in locate data <b>120</b> represent a more serious problem than does a decrease in average system accuracy.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0434">Data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, and receiver count filter <b>7516</b> are examples of identify and drop algorithms.

The greater the convergence in (e.g., the smaller the average distance between) the calculated locations, the more likely the calculated location is accurate. Data convergence filter <b>7510</b> discards data when the data convergence estimate is above threshold <b>7511</b>. Filter controller <b>7502</b> operates to increase threshold <b>7511</b> when the locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> of system <b>100</b> is low, which increases the number of locates generated by system <b>100</b>, since fewer locates are discarded due to inaccuracy. Similarly, filter controller <b>7502</b> decreases threshold <b>7511</b> when locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> of system <b>100</b> is greater than a desired value (e.g., above fifty-five percent) to reduce the number of locates generated.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0437">Bounding Box Filter</p><p id="p-0437" num="0438">A bounding box is the smallest polygon that includes all receivers <b>104</b> involved in calculating a particular locate. For any locate calculation, a bounding box for that locate is formed by drawing a line between all receivers involved in the calculation. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows a three-receiver bounding box <b>7522</b> formed by receivers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>104</b>(<b>11</b>) that each generated one receiver event <b>110</b> used to calculate the location of tag <b>101</b>(<b>1</b>). Similarly, a four-receiver bounding box <b>7524</b> is formed by receivers <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>9</b>), and <b>104</b>(<b>10</b>) that each generated one receive event <b>110</b> used to calculate the location of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>). Similarly, again, a five-receiver bounding box <b>7526</b> is formed by receivers <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>5</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>6</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>7</b>), and <b>104</b>(<b>8</b>) that each generated one receiver event <b>110</b> used to calculate the location of tag <b>101</b>(<b>3</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b></figref>, the locate of tag <b>101</b>(<b>1</b>) is within bounding box <b>7522</b>, but is very close to the boundary; the locate of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) is outside the boundary of bounding box <b>7524</b>; and the locate of tag <b>101</b>(<b>3</b>) is well inside the boundary of bounding box <b>7526</b>.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0439">As the calculated location approaches the edge of the bounding box, the reliability of the calculated location (i.e., the locate) decreases. If the calculated location is outside the bounding box (e.g., locate of tag <b>101</b>(<b>2</b>) is outside bounding box <b>7524</b>), the reliability of the calculated location (i.e., the locate) decreases even further. The further the calculated location is outside the bounding box, the lower the reliability of that locate. Bounding box filter <b>7512</b> operates to discards locates where the calculated location is outside the boundary of the bounding box (e.g., one of bounding boxes <b>7522</b>, <b>7524</b>, <b>7526</b>). For example, locates having calculated locations within the bounding box (e.g., bounding boxes <b>7522</b>, <b>7524</b>, <b>7526</b>) defined by the receivers used to determine the locate are output within locate data <b>120</b>, whereas locates with calculated locations outside of the bounding boxes are discarded.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0440">The size of the bounding boxes may be adjusted by thresholds (e.g., three-receiver threshold <b>7513</b> and four receiver threshold <b>7515</b>) that increase the size of the bounding box when positive and decrease the size of the bounding box when negative. These thresholds are angular adjustments relative to the straight lines between receiver pairs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref> is a schematic showing one exemplary bounding box <b>7802</b> for three receivers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>) where three-receiver threshold <b>7513</b> is a positive value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref> is a schematic showing one exemplary bounding box <b>7902</b> for three receivers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>) where three-receiver threshold <b>7513</b> is negative. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref> is a schematic showing one exemplary bounding box <b>8002</b> for four receivers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>4</b>) where four-receiver threshold <b>7515</b> is a positive value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref> is a schematic showing one exemplary bounding box <b>8102</b> for four receivers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>3</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>4</b>) where four-receiver threshold <b>7515</b> is a negative value.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0441">Bounding box filter <b>7512</b> operates in two modes: a three-receiver locate mode and a four-receiver locate mode (which uses four or more receivers).

Data convergence filter <b>7510</b> is adjusted first since this allows more locates to be generated that are directly tied to a calculated reliability metric. Although the overall accuracy of system <b>100</b> is impacted by allowing generating locates with higher data convergence values, the potential inaccuracy of these locates are introduced in a controlled manner. Where adjustment to threshold <b>7511</b> of data convergence filter <b>7510</b> fails to increase locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> to a sufficient level, filter controller <b>7502</b> then incrementally makes positive adjustments to four-receiver threshold <b>7515</b> of bounding box filter <b>7512</b>, where each increase in the value of four-receiver threshold <b>7515</b> increases the area within which calculated locations are not discarded by bounding box filter <b>7512</b>. Although calculated locations of each locate may be outside their bounding box, and therefore have an inherently higher level of inaccuracy, these locates have not been discarded by data convergence filter <b>7510</b>, and therefore have a pre-defined acceptable data convergence measure.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0462">If a predefined maximum value for four-receiver threshold <b>7515</b> is reached and the locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> is still not at a sufficient level, filter controller <b>7502</b> then initiates more drastic measures to increase the locate-to-ping ratio by allowing locates to be generated from three receiver events (i.e., three different receivers). As noted above, when calculating location using only three receiver events <b>110</b>, a data convergence value cannot be used to estimate reliability and/or accuracy of the locate. Thus, for locates generated using only three receiver events, three-receiver threshold <b>7513</b> is set to have a smaller (i.e., tighter) area for accepting locates within bounding box filter <b>7512</b>. Therefore, the three-receiver threshold <b>7513</b> is initially set to its most negative value, corresponding to its smallest area (i.e., tightest setting). This area is then gradually increased until an acceptable locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b> is achieved.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0463">Where filter controller <b>7502</b> is still unable to achieve a satisfactory locate-to-ping ratio <b>4340</b>, a system warning is generated to indicate that the locate-to-ping ratio is low and that gaps in data may result.

Analysis tool <b>8208</b> may operate with any type of data within recorded data <b>8204</b>, but is particularly useful when recorded data <b>8204</b> contains information recorded from a test lap. For example, where recorded data <b>8204</b> contains a single test lap data set, analysis tool <b>8208</b> provides for analyzing a wide variety of different types of problems with the installation calibration and filter adjustments of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0470"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref> shows one exemplary static line plot <b>8300</b> generated by a static line plotter <b>8210</b> of analysis tool <b>8208</b>.

Although plot <b>8300</b> shows an area <b>8304</b> where tracking information appears to be missing, the majority of the display appears to be visually correct. For example, it's only when a large number of consecutive errors occur that a sudden jump in the reported position becomes visible. Even when such gaps are visible, there is no indication of what type of problem caused the gap in reported positions. In system <b>100</b>, processing hub <b>150</b> may implement many types of filters that condition the received data and that may indicate many distinct error conditions that may cause the determination of the location of tag <b>101</b> to fail.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0471"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref> shows one exemplary enhanced static line plot <b>8400</b> that further combines additional error and receiver information from recorded data <b>8204</b> with the plotted symbols <b>8302</b> that represent determined locates <b>8209</b>. Often, since test lap data is generated and collected under ideal conditions, what appears to be minor issues in test lap data may actually indicate bigger problems that will manifest at those same field locations during &#x201c;game day&#x201d; conditions.

Plotter <b>8210</b> visually displays these errors and other information on plot <b>8400</b> as symbols positioned to represent the location of tag <b>101</b> when the error and/or information occurred. Plot <b>8400</b> thereby provides a method of distinguishing between different types of error conditions and information that occurs within system <b>100</b>. Most importantly, plot <b>8400</b> relates error conditions to the position within tracking area <b>100</b> (i.e., on field of play <b>103</b>) where they occurred.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0473">Plotter <b>8210</b> displays a symbol even when no valid locate <b>8209</b> has been determined. In that case, plotter <b>8210</b> plots a symbol at the last known tag location and in a different color to represent the type of error. For example, each error condition (e.g., too few receivers, no convergence, etc.) is color coded, as represented by letters shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>, letters positioned on the symbols indicate a color corresponding to data type selections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b></figref>, described below.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0474">Where a single error occurs between two locates <b>8209</b> (i.e., valid location determinations), the plotted symbol is the same size as the symbol plotted for a locate.

Thus, the greater the number of consecutive, recurring errors of the same type, the more visibly noticeable the plotted symbol.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0475">Plot <b>8400</b> allows errors associated with a specific location within operational area <b>102</b> to be immediately apparent. For example, as tag <b>101</b> crosses the problem area within operational area <b>102</b>, that area within plot <b>8400</b> turns a color consistent with the error type, and where the error persists for consecutive pings <b>402</b>, that area within plot <b>8400</b> &#x201c;blooms&#x201d; into a large color coded visual representation <b>8402</b>.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0476">As shown in plot <b>8400</b>, a large number of errors occurred during replay of recorded data <b>8204</b> (i.e., the test lap data set).

For example, a user may select the type of error to be displayed within plot <b>8400</b>, wherein the symbol is displayed on plot <b>8400</b> in the associated color. Even where plot <b>8400</b> represents a short period, a large number of individual tags <b>101</b> and tens or hundreds of thousands of individual locates <b>8209</b> may be included. Plotter <b>8210</b> provides a very quick and simple way to visually identify a problem in a sea of data. However, when diagnosing a cause of the problem, it is nearly always necessary to look at a relatively small amount of data associated with a single tag <b>101</b>, immediately before and after the error occurred.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0479"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>86</b></figref> shows a portion <b>8600</b> of recorded data <b>8204</b> selected by a visual data selector <b>8212</b> within analysis tool <b>8208</b>. In particular, selector <b>8212</b> cooperates with plotter <b>8210</b> and plot <b>8400</b> to select the portion of recorded data <b>8204</b> based upon the user clicking with a mouse on plot <b>8400</b>. In one embodiment, analysis tool <b>8208</b> stores a copy of all information used to generate plot <b>8400</b>, together with an identifier (TagID) of tag <b>101</b>. Selector <b>8212</b> finds the nearest plotted point to the click location on plot <b>8400</b>, determines the TagID of that plotted point, and then retrieves n number of the underlying data samples for that TagID, from both immediately before/after the nearest plotted point.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0480">Thus, the combination of plotter <b>8210</b> and selector <b>8212</b> provides a powerful tool for quickly looking deeply into the lowest level data to ease identification of system problems and diagnosing their causes.

A coverage area, within operational area <b>102</b>, of each receiver <b>104</b> is defined by a combination of the receiver's antenna pattern, the receiver alignment, and distance. When installing system <b>100</b>, based upon learned experience, a first approximation for placement and alignment of receivers <b>104</b> is done visually. While this is a good start, the detailed coverage area is just a guess, and accuracy of predicting receiver coverage may be significantly degraded by various physical obstacles in the facility (e.g., the goal post).</p><p id="p-0481" num="0482"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b></figref> shows one exemplary static line plot <b>8700</b> illustrating a very detailed circular Test Lap data set.
