No. 6,082,083 to Stalpes et al., owned by The Toro Company, relates to a walk power mower for cutting grass. The mower has a deck that includes a traction drive which self-propels the deck at a variable ground speed during a grass cutting operation. An upwardly and rearwardly extending handle is attached to the deck to allow a user who walks behind the mower to guide the mower while cutting grass. The handle slidably mounts a handle grip that controls the ground speed of the mower in accordance with how far the handle grip is slid downwardly on the handle from a neutral position. Since the distance the handle grip slides downwardly is generally correlated to how fast the user walks, the traction drive self-propels the mower at a ground speed of the mower which generally matches the walking speed of the user. Thus, as the user walks faster or walks slower, the ground speed of the mower as provided by the traction drive similarly increases or decreases generally in concert with the walking pace of the user in a seemingly effortless and natural manner. Such a mower has long been sold by The Toro Company in its Personal Pace&#xae; line of walk power mowers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traction drive of the mower of Stalpes was unidirectional to self-propel the mower only in the forward direction. In this configuration, the neutral position of the slidable handle grip was an uppermost position of the handle grip on the handle. However, later Personal Pace&#xae; mower models of The Toro Company adapted the slidable handle grip to bidirectional traction drives in which the mower was self-propelled in both forward and reverse. Examples of such bidirectional Personal Pace&#xae; mowers are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 10,039,229 to Wadzinski et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 10,111,381 to Shaffer et al., both of which are owned by The Toro Company. In this configuration, the neural position of the slidable handle grip is located between an uppermost position and a lowermost position of the handle grip on the handle. Forward motion of the mower is selected by pushing the handle grip downwardly from the neutral position and reverse motion of the mower is selected by pulling the handle grip upwardly from the neutral position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The slidable handle grip of the mowers described above follows a straight, vertically inclined path during its upward and downward motions. Some users when pulling back on the handle grip, e.g. when reverse direction of a bidirectional mower is desired, may have a tendency to push down on the handle that mounts the handle grip. This lifts the front wheels of the mower off the ground with the front wheels in some mower configurations comprising the very wheels which are attempting to self-propel the mower rearwardly. This causes the mower to lose traction which is obviously a disadvantage. This invention is directed in part to overcoming this disadvantage.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of this invention relates to a walk power mower. The mower comprises a deck having at least one rotary cutting blade for cutting grass. The deck has a self-propel system to provide the deck with powered movement over the ground at a variable ground speed. A handle extends from the deck to allow an operator to walk behind the deck and hold the handle and thereby guide the deck during its movement over the ground. The handle includes a handle grip that slides up and down on the handle to control the ground speed of the deck. The slidable handle grip of the handle follows a curved path as it slides up and down on the handle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of this invention relates to a walk power mower. The mower comprises a deck having at least one rotary cutting blade for cutting grass. The deck has a self-propel system to provide the deck with powered movement over the ground at a variable ground speed. A handle extends from the deck to allow an operator to walk behind the deck and hold the handle and thereby guide the deck during its movement over the ground. A pair of laterally spaced handle tubes are connected at lower ends thereof to the deck, the handle tubes being joined to one another at upper ends thereof by a laterally extending cross member The handle tubes have curved upper portions located between lower portions of the handle tubes and the cross member. A handle grip having a pair of laterally spaced, curved legs is telescopically connected to the curved upper portions of the handle tubes to permit the curved legs of the handle grip to slide up and down on the curved upper portions of the handle tubes to control the ground speed of the deck.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the invention relates to walk power mower. The mower comprises a deck having at least one rotary cutting blade for cutting grass. The deck has a bidirectional self-propel system to provide the deck with powered forward and reverse movement over the ground at a variable ground speed. A handle extends from the deck to allow an operator to walk behind the deck and hold the handle and thereby guide the deck during its movement over the ground. The handle includes a handle grip that slides up and down on the handle to control the ground speed of the deck. The slidable handle grip of the handle follows a curved path as it slides up and down on the handle. The handle grip has a neutral position in which the self-propel system is disengaged, a fully forward position in which the handle grip has been pushed downwardly from the neutral position to propel the deck forwardly at a maximum forward ground speed, and a fully rearward position in which the handle grip has been pulled rearwardly from the neutral position to propel the deck rearwardly a maximum rearward ground speed. The handle grip in the fully rearward position has risen relative to the neutral position by a distance D<b>2</b> which is approximately 50% or less than a distance D<b>1</b> corresponding to how far the handle grip in the fully forward position has dropped relative to the neutral position.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention will be described more fully in the following Detailed Description, when taken in conjunction with the following drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. is a front perspective view of one embodiment of a walk power mower according to this invention;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a rear perspective view of the mower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a portion of the handle of the mower shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the slidable handle grip of the handle in an exploded form as well as illustrating the blade control bail in an open, blade disengaged position on the slidable handle grip of the handle;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side elevational view of a portion of the handle of the mower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the curved portion of the handle at the upper end of the handle;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side elevational view of an upper end of the handle of mower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the slidable handle grip in a neutral position relative to the handle in which a unidirectional or bidirectional traction drive carried on the mower is disengaged with the result that the mower is not being self-propelled;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side elevational view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the slidable handle grip in a fully forward position relative to the handle in which a unidirectional or bidirectional traction drive carried on the mower is engaged for forward motion with the result that the mower is being self-propelled forwardly at a maximum forward speed;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side elevational view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the slidable handle grip in a fully rearward position relative to the handle in which a bidirectional traction drive carried on the mower is engaged for rearward motion with the result that the mower is being self-propelled rearwardly at a maximum rearward speed; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side elevational view of a portion of the handle of the mower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, particularly illustrating the drop D<b>1</b> in the slidable handle grip relative to the neutral position thereof as the handle grip is pushed downwardly in a mower with a bidirectional traction drive system to its most forward position to propel the mower at a maximum forward ground speed and further illustrating the rise D<b>2</b> in the slidable handle grip relative to the neutral position as the handle grip is pulled rearwardly to its most rearward position to propel the mower at a maximum reverse ground speed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The walk power mower of this invention is a Personal Pace&#xae; mower having a handle which incorporates an improved traction drive control of the type taught in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,083 to Stalpes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 10,039,229 to Wadzinski et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 10,111,381 to Shaffer et al. All of these patents are incorporated by reference as to the variable speed traction drives used in such Personal Pace&#xae; mowers. In addition, all of these patents are further incorporated by reference as to the details of the structure of the handle and of the traction drive controls carried thereon, as to how the traction drive controls are connected or coupled to the traction drives, and as to how the movement of the traction drive controls on the mower handle engages and disengages the operation of the traction drives and how such movement selects or sets the speed of the mower over the ground once the traction drive is engaged. However, this incorporation by reference notwithstanding, a brief description of the underlying Personal Pace&#xae; mower and of a typical handle taught in the patents incorporated by reference will be set forth below for background purposes.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, one embodiment of a mower according to this invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> generally as 2. Mower <b>2</b> has a housing or deck <b>4</b> supported for movement over the ground by a plurality of wheels <b>6</b>. Preferably, there are four wheels <b>6</b> comprising a pair of front wheels <b>6</b><i>f </i>and a pair of rear wheels <b>6</b><i>r </i>arranged generally at or adjacent the corners of the deck. Other numbers, arrangements and/or placements of wheels <b>6</b> could be used. A full width rear roller could also be used in place of rear wheels <b>6</b><i>r. </i></p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Deck <b>4</b> mounts a prime mover <b>8</b>, such as but not limited to, an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, prime mover <b>8</b> powers at least one rotary cutting blade <b>10</b> contained within a cutting chamber <b>12</b> in the underside of deck <b>4</b> with cutting chamber <b>12</b> being generally open at the bottom. As blade <b>10</b> rotates in a substantially horizontal cutting plane, sharpened cutting surfaces on the leading edges of opposite sides of blade <b>10</b> sever uncut blades of grass at a height determined by the vertical adjustment of wheels <b>6</b> relative to deck <b>4</b>. Blade <b>10</b> typically includes airflow generating sails <b>14</b> on the trailing edges of opposite sides of blade <b>10</b> to create an airflow in which the grass clippings are entrained.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, deck <b>4</b> includes a rear discharge opening <b>16</b> through which the grass clippings may pass. A pivotal door <b>18</b> on deck <b>4</b> selectively covers or uncovers rear discharge opening <b>16</b>. When door <b>18</b> is pivoted upwardly on deck <b>4</b> to uncover rear discharge opening <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a rear bag (not shown) may be attached to deck <b>4</b> adjacent the opening <b>16</b> to collect the grass clippings within the bag with the rear bag when installed extending rearwardly into the space between lower portions of handle tubes <b>28</b>. Alternatively, a side discharge chute (not shown) may be inserted into opening <b>16</b> to cause the grass clippings to be thrown laterally to one side of deck <b>4</b>. As another option, if a mulching plug is inserted into the rear of the tunnel leading to opening <b>16</b> and door <b>18</b> is pivoted downwardly to cover rear discharge opening <b>16</b>, the grass clippings will then be mulched by being driven downwardly into the grass through the open bottom of deck <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A variable speed traction drive <b>20</b> is mounted in deck <b>4</b> and selectively powers at least one wheel <b>6</b> to self-propel deck <b>4</b> over the ground. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one embodiment of traction drive <b>20</b> comprises a transmission <b>22</b> mounted on an axle <b>24</b> that drives the pair of rear wheels <b>6</b><i>r. </i>Transmission <b>22</b> may be a mechanical transmission arranged to provide forward rotational movement of rear wheels <b>6</b><i>r </i>to self-propel deck <b>4</b> in a forward direction. Transmission <b>22</b> is belt driven from prime mover <b>8</b> and may be selectively rocked to produce a forward ground speed that is infinitely variable from zero ground speed when the belt is slack to a maximum ground speed when the belt is taut. Other variable speed traction drives <b>20</b> may be used, e.g. variable speed electric or hydraulic motors, CVT's, and the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Mower <b>2</b> includes an upwardly and rearwardly extending handle <b>26</b> comprising a pair of laterally spaced handle tubes <b>28</b> which are joined together by an upper cross member <b>30</b>. Handle tubes <b>28</b> have connections <b>50</b> to the rear of deck <b>4</b> to permit the inclination of handle <b>26</b> relative to deck <b>4</b> to be adjusted in a conventional manner to suit the height of the user. Once the angle of inclination is adjusted and locked in, handle tubes <b>28</b> incline upwardly as they extend rearwardly from connections <b>50</b> to terminate at cross member <b>30</b> which unites handle tubes <b>28</b>. In the embodiment shown herein, handle tubes <b>28</b> and cross member <b>30</b> are formed of a single piece of tubing material that is suitably bent into the generally U-shaped configuration that is illustrated in the figures. In other embodiments, handle tubes <b>28</b> may be split in the middle into upper and lower portions that may be selectively folded on top of one another to reduce the length of handle <b>26</b> to facilitate storage of mower <b>2</b> when mower <b>2</b> is not being used.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Handle <b>26</b> further includes a slidable handle grip <b>32</b> that forms the traction drive control operated by the user to vary the ground speed of mower <b>2</b>. Handle grip <b>32</b> is carried on the top of the handle <b>26</b> for controlling the operation of traction drive <b>20</b> either through one or more actuation cables (not shown) that extend between handle grip <b>32</b> and traction drive <b>20</b> or through an electronic fly by wire control system. Handle grip <b>32</b> has a transverse cross bar <b>34</b> that connects the upper ends of two downwardly extending legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> to provide a generally U-shaped handle grip. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, cross bar <b>34</b> extends upwardly from legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> and has a smooth, substantially continuous, downwardly facing curve from one end to the other such that a user is able to grip cross bar <b>34</b> with both hands much like the way the user would grip the upper portion of a steering wheel in an automobile. An escutcheon plate <b>40</b> positioned forwardly of cross bar <b>34</b> also extends between legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> and is used to mount and/or cover various pivotal linkages which link handle grip <b>32</b> to the traction drive actuation cable(s).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are telescopically received on the upper ends of handle tubes <b>28</b> for a sliding motion relative thereto. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this sliding motion is facilitated by plastic slides <b>42</b> fixed to the upper ends of handle tubes <b>28</b>. Slides <b>42</b> reduce friction to provide a smooth sliding motion for handle grip <b>32</b>. Slides <b>42</b> and legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> also have a keyhole slot interface <b>44</b> therebetween to maintain alignment of handle grip <b>32</b> on handle <b>26</b>. Legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> may be made in upper and lower halves, shown at <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with respect to leg <b>36</b>, which are clamped together by fasteners <b>46</b> to facilitate assembly of handle grip <b>32</b> around handle tubes <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Handle grip <b>32</b> also controls the operation of blade <b>10</b> through a pivotal blade control bail <b>48</b> mounted thereon. Operation of blade <b>10</b> is possible only when bail <b>48</b> is pivoted from the open, blade disengaged position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref> to a closed position in which bail <b>48</b> is held by the user against cross bar <b>34</b> of handle grip <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. When the user releases hail <b>48</b> from its closed position against cross bar <b>34</b>, a spring (not shown) will return bail <b>48</b> to its open position in which blade <b>10</b> is stopped. In some embodiments, bail <b>48</b> when released by the user operates a kill switch (not shown) on prime mover <b>8</b> to stop blade <b>10</b> by stopping prime mover <b>8</b>. In other embodiments, prime mover <b>8</b> continuously operates after being started while bail <b>48</b> when released stops blade <b>10</b> by disengaging a blade brake clutch (not shown) connecting prime mover <b>8</b> and blade <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional details of the operation of traction drive <b>20</b> and the manner in which handle grip <b>32</b> is constructed and operates to control traction drive <b>20</b> are set forth in the '083, '229 and '381 patents as incorporated by reference above.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this invention, handle grip <b>32</b> moves along a curved path as the user selectively slides handle grip <b>32</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b> to engage traction drive <b>20</b> and to vary the speed of traction drive <b>20</b> to thereby vary the ground speed of mower <b>2</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and in one embodiment of this invention, the curved path comprises a substantially circular arc <b>52</b> defined by a portion of the circumference of an imaginary circle <b>54</b> having a center C and a radius R. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, imaginary circle <b>54</b> has been projected onto a fore-and-aft extending plane lying adjacent one handle tube <b>28</b> to illustrate where circular arc <b>52</b> is located in relationship to the entirety of each handle tube <b>28</b>. Circular arc <b>52</b> and circle <b>54</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> slightly displaced below the actual curved portions of handle tubes <b>28</b> for the sake of not obscuring the depicted handle tube <b>28</b>. In practice, what is labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as circular arc <b>52</b> substantially overlies or is coincident with the fore-and-aft centerline of the curved portion of the depicted handle tube <b>28</b> without any gap between the two.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Circular arc <b>52</b> is positioned at the upper ends of handle tubes <b>28</b> substantially immediately forward of cross member <b>30</b>. Circular arc <b>52</b> has a first end <b>56</b> which is coaxial with a first radius line R<b>1</b> of circle <b>54</b> and a second end <b>58</b> which is coaxial with a second radius line R<b>2</b> of circle <b>54</b>. The length of circular arc <b>52</b> between radius lines R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> has been depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as L<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, handle tubes <b>28</b> preferably extend in a straight line downwardly away from second end <b>58</b> of circular arc <b>52</b> over a length L<b>2</b> measured from second end <b>58</b> of circular arc <b>52</b> to connections <b>50</b> which secure handle tubes <b>28</b> to deck <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is plotted to scale. By measuring the lengths L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, L<b>1</b> comprises approximately 25% (i.e., 21.65%) of the sum of L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> although L<b>1</b> could be in the range of from approximately 20% to approximately 30% of the sum of L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. Cross member <b>30</b> and the bends which join cross member <b>30</b> to first end <b>56</b> of circular arc add but a very short additional length L<b>3</b> to L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. L<b>3</b> comprises approximately 5% of the sum of L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an angle &#x3b1; of approximately 45&#xb0; is subtended by circular arc <b>52</b>. However, a small angle &#x3b2; of approximately 5&#xb0; separates angle &#x3b1; from the very top of circle <b>54</b>. Accordingly, if the top of circle <b>54</b> is assigned a value of 0&#xb0; and going clockwise around circle <b>54</b>, angle &#x3b2; extends from approximately 0&#xb0; to approximately 5&#xb0; and angle &#x3b1; extends from approximately 5&#xb0; to approximately 50&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Applicants have discovered that a radius R of approximately 12 inches for circle <b>54</b> positioned substantially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> works well for the purposes of this invention as will be described hereafter. Radius R should preferably be in the range of from approximately 10 to approximately 14 inches. With a radius in this range, the top of imaginary circle <b>54</b> will have a vertical elevation approximately at or slightly below the upper ends of handle tubes <b>54</b> while the bottom of imaginary circle <b>54</b> will have a vertical elevation approximately at or above connections <b>50</b> at the lower ends of handle tubes <b>28</b>. In effect, imaginary circle <b>54</b> is not so large as to extend above handle tubes <b>28</b> or below connections <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The use of an arcuate curve as described above provides slidable handle grip <b>32</b> with a much flatter and a generally horizontal travel that has been found to be more ergonomic and user friendly than the prior art slidable handle grips used in Personal Pace&#xae; mowers. This is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. As a preliminary matter, it should be noted that legs <b>36</b> and <b>28</b> of handle grip are obviously sized and curved to mate with and slide along circular arcs <b>52</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b>. This is apparent from the curved orientation of legs <b>36</b> and <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> of this application.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts slidable handle grip <b>32</b> in a neutral position thereof. Handle grip <b>32</b> is spring biased into this position when the user is not applying any force to cross bar <b>34</b> of handle grip <b>32</b> as is well known in Personal Pace&#xae; mowers. In this position, traction drive <b>20</b> is not engaged and mower <b>2</b> is correspondingly not being self-propelled. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, curved legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are mated with circular arcs <b>52</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b> with slidable handle grip <b>32</b> being at the very top of handle tubes <b>28</b>. In this position, legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> enclose most or all of the length of circular arcs <b>52</b>. Only a small portion of slides <b>42</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> poking out of the bottom of legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To engage traction drive <b>20</b> and self-propel mower <b>2</b> forwardly, the user need only grip cross bar <b>32</b> of handle grip <b>32</b> and walk forwardly at whatever pace the user desires. This will cause handle grip <b>32</b> to slide downwardly on circular arcs <b>52</b> a distance that is generally proportional to how fast the user walks forwardly. Thus, the ground speed of the mower generally matches the walking pace of the mower in a seamless and effortless manner. This is a characteristic of all Personal Pace&#xae; mowers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts slidable handle grip <b>32</b> in its fully forward position where traction drive <b>20</b> is propelling mower <b>2</b> forwardly at a maximum forward ground speed. In this position, legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> have moved forwardly along handle tubes <b>28</b> and now fully cover all of slides <b>42</b>. However, due to the arcuate path between handle tubes <b>28</b> and legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> of handle grip <b>32</b> as provided by circular arcs <b>52</b>, cross bar <b>34</b> has moved more horizontally than what would have been the case if circular arcs <b>52</b> had been absent and handle tubes <b>28</b> had been linear over their entire length as in prior art Personal Pace&#xae; mowers. This flattening of the path of travel of handle grip <b>32</b>, and particularly the flattening in the path of travel of the rearwardly located portion of handle grip <b>32</b> the user holds onto, i.e. cross bar <b>34</b>, provides an improved, more natural feel to a user who is operating mower <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> depict the path of travel of handle grip <b>32</b> in a mower <b>2</b> having a unidirectional traction drive <b>20</b> that self-propels mower <b>2</b> in a forward only direction. In such a mower, if the user pulls rearwardly on handle grip <b>32</b> in its neutral position, the force applied to handle grip <b>32</b> is the force that pulls mower <b>2</b> rearwardly since traction drive <b>20</b> remains disengaged. In such reverse motion, drive wheels <b>4</b><i>r </i>would free-wheel as axle <b>24</b> would type have one-way clutches at either end connecting drive wheels <b>4</b><i>r </i>to axle <b>24</b>. Such well known one way clutches would release when the user pulls mower <b>3</b> rearwardly so that the load from transmission <b>20</b> would be removed from drive wheels <b>4</b><i>r </i>during such reverse motion.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, as noted earlier, traction drive <b>20</b> could also be supplied in a bidirectional form to allow powered, self-propulsion of mower <b>2</b> in both forward and reverse. In this case, slidable handle grip <b>32</b> slides rearwardly along circular arc <b>52</b> from the neutral position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The amount of rearward sliding is again dependent upon the degree of force applied to handle grip <b>32</b> by the user as the user walks rearwardly. With a bi-directional traction drive <b>20</b>, the user no longer needs to manually pull mower <b>2</b> to the rear since traction drive <b>20</b> is propelling mower <b>2</b> to the rear at a speed that is determined by how far handle grip <b>32</b> has been slid rearwardly relative to the neutral position.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows handle grip <b>32</b> in its most rearward position corresponding to the maximum reverse ground speed of mower <b>2</b>. In this position, much more of slides <b>42</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b> are now uncovered since legs <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> have moved upwardly along circular arcs <b>52</b> on handle tubes <b>28</b>. However, the motion of handle grip <b>32</b> in reverse, and particularly the amount of rise of cross bar <b>34</b> which the user is gripping, is significantly smaller than the amount of drop of cross bar <b>34</b> in forward. This is due to the fact that circular arc <b>52</b> is offset from the top of circle <b>54</b> by the small angle &#x3b2; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Thus, as handle grip <b>52</b> moves rearwardly from neutral, handle grip <b>32</b> lifts slightly in a first portion of its travel until it has moved reversely through angle &#x3b2; and then handle grip <b>32</b> moves substantially horizontally or drops very slightly in a second portion of its travel. As can be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, handle grip <b>32</b> ends up in a vertical position at maximum reverse speed that is substantially the same as what handle grip <b>32</b> had in the neutral position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an illustration depicting the amount of drop D<b>1</b> of a reference point P on cross bar <b>34</b> relative to neutral when handle grip <b>32</b> has been pushed downwardly out of neutral to its most forward position corresponding to maximum forward ground speed of mower <b>2</b>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts the amount of rise D<b>2</b> of the same reference point P on cross bar <b>34</b> relative to neutral when handle grip <b>32</b> has been pulled rearwardly out of neutral to its most rearward position corresponding to the maximum reverse ground speed of mower <b>2</b>. In one embodiment of mower <b>2</b>, D<b>1</b> is equal to approximately 0.824 inches and D<b>2</b> is equal to approximately 0.407 inches. D<b>2</b> is approximately 50% of D<b>1</b> but mower <b>2</b> could be designed such that D<b>2</b> is even a smaller percentage of D<b>1</b> than approximately 50%. By contrast, in prior art Personal Pace&#xae; mowers of the Applicant in which the corresponding handle grip <b>32</b> rides on linear handle tubes without a curve therein, D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> are approximately the same as one another with D<b>1</b> comprising 0.993 inches and D<b>2</b> comprising 0.899 inches.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For all intents and purposes, the slight rise in handle grip <b>32</b> of a little more than three eighths of an inch when moving from the neutral position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to the maximum reverse speed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> will be generally undetectable to most users. Most users will perceive slidable handle grip <b>32</b> as having moved substantially linearly to the rear at a substantially constant vertical height when the user is pulling back on handle grip <b>32</b> to self-propel mower <b>2</b> rearwardly. As a result, the tendency of the user to unwittingly push down on handle grip <b>32</b> during reverse motion thereof and thus unwittingly raise front wheels of off the ground will be substantially lessened. In addition, the ergonomic and natural feel imparted by the substantially horizontal motion of handle grip <b>32</b> when it is being pulled rearwardly will provide an enhanced experience to an operator of mower <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various other modifications of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
