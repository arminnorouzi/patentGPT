If blood flow is blocked to the brain, the tissue that does not receive blood flow will become ischemic and begin to die. The result is either a deficit in cognition, function, or even death. The results are also irreversible if such an ischemia lasts too long. The period of time can vary from patient to patient, but typically if blood flow to the brain is not restored after approximately 4.5 hours, an ischemic stroke may occur. These ischemic strokes can happen in any of the cerebral arteries, but are most common in the middle cerebral artery. Traditionally, such middle cerebral artery acute ischemic strokes have been fatal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Around 1995, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a lytic agent, was introduced as the first treatment for ischemic stroke. The tPA brakes down unorganized acute clot. This procedure reduced mortality from near 100% to 80% and has been the main stay in acute ischemic stroke treatment until just recently. In 2015, a new approach was approved in the United States known as mechanical thrombectomy. In this approach, a stent retriever is deployed within a lesion, the stent struts spread into the clot, then the clot is drawn back into the catheter under suction and removed from the body. This mechanical thrombectomy approach has reduced the mortality rate to around 20% for patients who are treated within the critical time window.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While outcomes are significantly improved, the mechanical thrombectomy procedure is still labor intensive. The mechanical thrombectomy device is either introduced through a femoral or carotid access. If the device is introduced from a femoral access, the operator needs to navigate the aortic anatomy with a special focus on the aortic arch. Aortic arches can be difficult to navigate, especially with type three aortic arches. Once the lesion is reached and crossed, the lesion can be treated. However, reaching the lesion can be challenging due to the tortuous nature of various arteries, such as the cerebral and coronary arteries as examples. The guide catheter which is used to select the target artery is often too stiff and has too large of a diameter to pass the bends in the middle cerebral artery and/or coronary arteries, pulmonary arteries and venous system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides an intermediate catheter portion of a slide guide acute ischemic stroke thrombectomy catheter. The design of the provided intermediate catheter is unique in the neurovascular intervention space in a couple of ways. First, in conjunction with a guide catheter, the intermediate catheter acts as a clot aspiration catheter or a channel for thrombectomy devices. Second, the intermediate catheter is specifically tuned for varying flexibility down length of catheter. Third, the intermediate catheter has an atraumatic tip so as not to damage vasculature. As such, the proposed catheter design is an intermediate catheter uniquely designed to quickly navigate narrow vasculature of the brain and quickly address strokes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a catheter including a first end, a second end, and a lumen extending from the first end to the second end. The catheter has a first portion arranged at the first end, a second portion arranged adjacent to the first portion, and a third portion arranged adjacent to the second portion. The first portion of the catheter has a first cut pattern in an exterior surface of the catheter, and the second portion of the catheter has a second cut pattern in the exterior surface of the catheter that is different from the first cut pattern. The third portion of the catheter has a third cut pattern in the exterior surface of the catheter that is different from the first cut pattern and the second cut pattern.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second aspect, the present invention provides a device that includes (a) the catheter of the first aspect, and (b) a push wire coupled to the second end of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a third aspect, the present disclosure provides a method that includes (a) providing a catheter having a first end and a second end, wherein the catheter has a first portion arranged at the first end, a second portion arranged at the second end, and a third portion arranged between the first portion and the second portion, (b) cutting a first cut pattern in an exterior surface of the first portion of the catheter, (c) cutting a second cut pattern in an exterior surface of the second portion of the catheter, wherein the second cut pattern is different from the first cut pattern, and (d) cutting a third cut pattern in an exterior surface of the third portion of the catheter, wherein the third cut pattern is different from the first cut pattern and the second cut pattern.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a fourth aspect, the present disclosure provides a catheter system including (a) a first catheter according to the first aspect, wherein the first catheter has a first diameter, (b) a second catheter having a first end and a second end, wherein the second catheter has a second diameter that is greater than the first diameter of the first catheter, and wherein the first catheter is positioned at least partially within a lumen of the second catheter and is moveable relative to the second catheter, and (c) a push wire having a first end and a second end, wherein the first end of the push wire is coupled to the second end of the first catheter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a fifth aspect, the present disclosure provides a method comprising (a) introducing a guidewire into an arterial configuration via arterial access, (b) loading the catheter system of the fourth aspect onto the guidewire, (c) moving the catheter system along the guidewire and introducing the second catheter into a first arterial configuration, and (d) advancing, via the push wire of the catheter system, the first catheter with respect to the second catheter to move the first catheter into a second arterial configuration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These as well as other aspects, advantages, and alternatives, will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a catheter, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a zoomed in view of the second end of the catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a cut pattern, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a zoomed in view of the cut pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a device, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a catheter system, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting functions that can be carried out in accordance with example embodiments of the disclosed methods.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is another flow chart depicting functions that can be carried out in accordance with example embodiments of the disclosed methods.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Exemplary devices and methods are described herein.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the catheter <b>100</b> includes a first end <b>102</b> and a second end <b>104</b>. The catheter also includes a lumen <b>106</b> extending from the first end <b>102</b> to the second end <b>104</b>. The catheter <b>100</b> has a first portion <b>108</b> arranged at the first end <b>102</b>, a second portion <b>110</b> arranged adjacent to the first portion <b>108</b>, and a third portion <b>112</b> arranged adjacent to the second portion <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the second portion <b>110</b> is positioned between the first portion <b>108</b> and the third portion <b>112</b>. The catheter further includes a fourth portion <b>114</b> arranged at the second end <b>104</b> and adjacent to the third portion <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the third portion <b>112</b> is positioned between the second portion <b>110</b> and the fourth portion <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a zoomed in view of the second end <b>1043</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second end <b>104</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> may include a slot <b>116</b>. In one example, the slot <b>116</b> is about 0.018 inches long in a direction from the second end <b>104</b> towards the first end <b>102</b> and about 0.008 inches wide.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In use, the slot <b>116</b> may be used to couple the catheter <b>100</b> to a push wire <b>202</b>, as discussed in additional detail below. In one particular example, the push wire <b>202</b> is welded to the catheter <b>100</b> in the slot <b>116</b>. The slot <b>116</b> provides a removal of material at the second end <b>104</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> such that when the catheter <b>100</b> is coupled to the push wire <b>202</b> the inner diameter and the maximum outer diameter of the catheter <b>100</b> remains uniform along the length of the catheter <b>100</b> from the first end <b>102</b> to the second end. As such, when the catheter <b>100</b> is coupled to the push wire <b>202</b> in the slot <b>116</b>, there is not too much material on the inner diameter or the outer diameter of the catheter <b>100</b> which would interfere with the required space for a clot retriever or for the catheter <b>100</b> to fit inside a guide catheter, respectively. The catheter <b>100</b> may be configured to be housed inside of such a guide catheter, and the catheter <b>100</b> may be actuated in and out of the guide catheter via the push wire <b>202</b> coupled on to the second end <b>104</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The catheter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may comprise a stainless steel material, such as 304 stainless steel as a non-limiting example. Further, the catheter <b>100</b> may be cut with a specific pattern to achieve varying flexibility down the length of the catheter <b>100</b>. In particular, the first portion <b>108</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> has a first cut pattern in an exterior surface of the catheter <b>100</b>, the second portion <b>110</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> has a second cut pattern in the exterior surface of the catheter <b>100</b> that is different from the first cut pattern, and the third portion <b>112</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> has a third cut pattern in the exterior surface of the catheter <b>100</b> that is different from the first cut pattern and the second cut pattern. In one example, the fourth portion <b>114</b> does not include a cut pattern in the exterior surface of the catheter <b>100</b> (other than the slot <b>116</b> discussed above). As such, the fourth portion <b>114</b> is solid (aside from the slot <b>116</b>) to provide a gradual transition of flexibility to avoid creating a stress riser that would exist if the push wire <b>202</b> were coupled to a more flexible cut pattern.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, a &#x201c;cut pattern&#x201d; refers to a pattern in which material is removed from the exterior surface of the catheter <b>100</b> to thereby change the flexibility of the catheter <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates various parameters that make up a given cut pattern. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the cut pattern may include a pitch <b>118</b>, degrees cut <b>120</b>, degrees uncut <b>122</b>, a circumference <b>124</b>, and a cut width <b>126</b> (a zoomed in view of which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Another parameter that may be used to define a given cut pattern is cuts per rotation (CPR), which is calculated using the simple formula of CPR=360/(degrees cut+degrees uncut).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one example, a pitch <b>118</b> of the first cut pattern is constant (e.g., the pitch <b>118</b> of material removed from the exterior surface of the first portion <b>108</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> is constant), a pitch <b>118</b> of the second cut pattern transitions along a length of the second portion <b>110</b> (e.g., the pitch <b>118</b> of material is removed from the exterior surface of the second portion <b>110</b> varies), and a pitch <b>118</b> of the third cut pattern transitions along a length of the third portion <b>112</b> (e.g., the pitch <b>118</b> of material is removed from the exterior surface of the third portion <b>112</b> varies). In one particular example, the pitch <b>118</b> of the first cut pattern is about 0.004 inches along a length of the first portion <b>108</b>, the pitch <b>118</b> of the second cut pattern transitions from about 0.004 inches to about 0.010 inches in a direction from the first end <b>102</b> to the second end <b>104</b> (e.g., the pitch <b>118</b> of the second cut pattern is 0.004 inches where the first portion <b>108</b> and second portion <b>110</b> meet and the pitch <b>118</b> of the second cut pattern is 0.010 inches where the second portion <b>110</b> and third portion <b>112</b> meet), and the pitch <b>118</b> of the third portion <b>112</b> transitions from about 0.010 inches to about 0.016 inches in a direction from the first end <b>102</b> to the second end <b>104</b> (e.g., the pitch <b>118</b> of the third cut pattern is 0.010 inches where the second portion <b>110</b> and third portion <b>112</b> meet and the pitch <b>118</b> of the third cut pattern is 0.016 inches where the third portion <b>112</b> and fourth portion <b>114</b> meet). In general, all other factors remaining the same, as the pitch <b>118</b> of the cut pattern increases, the flexibility of the catheter <b>100</b> also increases as more material is removed when the pitch <b>118</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example, the pitch <b>118</b> of the second cut pattern transitions linearly from about 0.004 inches to about 0.010 inches in a direction from the first end <b>102</b> to the second end <b>104</b>.

In general, all other factors remaining the same, as the CPR of the cut pattern decreases, the flexibility of the catheter <b>100</b> increases as more material is removed when the CPR is less. Thus, when the CPR of the first cut pattern is about 1.5, and the CPR of the second cut pattern and the CPR of the third cut pattern is about 2.5, more material is removed from the first end <b>102</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>, therefore increasing flexibility.
