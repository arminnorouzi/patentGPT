The development of technology increasing the functionality of the phone and its components have led to the display has become the primary input/output device. The displays are generally liquid crystal displays mounted under a rigid layer of cover glass. While the cover glass protects the liquid crystal display from damage, the rigid nature of the cover glass and other display layers render the display inflexible.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Larger-sized displays have become more desirable as the use of mobile electronic devices has grown. Many people now use a smartphone for watching videos and viewing pictures instead of a laptop or PC. As displays have grown, the size of the housing has been reduced to attempt to increase the portability of the device. The display most often comprises an entire side of the housing. While the larger sized displays are appealing, the rigid layer on the display effectively renders the entire mobile device inflexible.
