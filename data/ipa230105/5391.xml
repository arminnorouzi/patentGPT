It would be desirable that a sliceform included in a foldable article be removably secured thereto so as to permit removal of the sliceform from the foldable article. Historically, sliceforms have been permanently affixed to foldable articles. It would also be desirable to have an alternate means of securing a sliceform to a foldable article with a minimum of wasted material and/or without the need for adhesives.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description section.

However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or a combination of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems comprising a foldable article having a sliceform removably secured to the foldable article and methods of removably securing a sliceform to a foldable article. For example, it may be desirable to secure a sliceform within a foldable article (e.g., a greeting card, book, etc.) in a manner such that the sliceform may be removed from the foldable article without damaging the sliceform and/or foldable article and/or without disassembling the sliceform. Aspects herein provide for securing a sliceform to a foldable article by threading tabs and retaining portions through openings in the sliceform. The retaining portions are sized to restrict movement of the tab through the opening and consequently restrict movement of the sliceform away from the foldable article. The sliceform may be removed from the foldable article by manipulating (e.g., folding, bending, etc.) the retaining portions to a size that allows them to pass back through the opening in the sliceform.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some aspects of the present invention may be described using relative location terminology. For example, the term &#x201c;proximate&#x201d; is intended to mean on, about, near, by, next to, at, and the like. Therefore, when a feature is proximate another feature, it is close in proximity but not necessarily exactly at the described location, in some aspects. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; when used in relation to angular orientation means within &#xb1;5 degrees of a designated value. Thus, when an element is substantially parallel to another element, it may be parallel, or nearly parallel but not exactly parallel. For example, when sliceforms such as those described herein are in a collapsed state, each of the planar elements may be oriented such that they extend in nearly parallel directions, but not necessarily in exact parallel alignment with one another or with a panel of the foldable article.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Sliceforms useful with the present invention generally include a plurality of cooperating panels that are configured to move between a first collapsed, substantially flat configuration and a second three-dimensional configuration. An example sliceform is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and is generally designated with reference number <b>10</b>. Sliceform <b>10</b> includes vertical panel <b>11</b>, vertical panel <b>12</b>, base panel <b>13</b>, base panel <b>14</b>, base panel <b>15</b>, base panel <b>16</b>, base panel <b>17</b>, base panel <b>18</b>, base panel <b>19</b>, and base panel <b>20</b>. The vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> cooperate to form a grid-like structure. Generally, the base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> provide a base above which the vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are supported. The vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may include decorative elements.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is envisioned that any number of the panels comprising a sliceform (e.g., the sliceform <b>10</b>) may be either vertical panels (e.g., vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) or base panels (e.g., base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b>). In other words, any ratio of vertical panels to base panels is contemplated within the scope of the present invention. In some aspects, all of the panels may be vertical panels (e.g., vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>). In other aspects, all of the panels may be base panels (e.g., base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The grid-like structure of the sliceform <b>10</b> formed when the sliceform <b>10</b> is in the second three-dimensional configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which illustrates a top-view of the sliceform <b>10</b>. A number of openings <b>22</b> in the grid-like structure of the sliceform <b>10</b> are apparent and are generally defined by adjacent and intersecting base panels (e.g., <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b>) and/or vertical panels (e.g., <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>). In other words, the openings <b>22</b> may comprise passageways through the sliceform <b>10</b> that are formed when the sliceform <b>10</b> is in the second, three-dimensional configuration. In alternative aspects, however, the openings may comprise slits or other shaped apertures formed in one or more of the base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> and/or the vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. In these aspects, the tabs and retaining portions described below are inserted through the slits or other shaped aperture to removably secure the sliceform <b>10</b> to the foldable article.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the sliceform <b>10</b> is in the second three-dimensional configuration, some of the panels extend in a first direction that is labeled as direction A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Some of the other panels extend in a second direction that is labeled as direction B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Direction A and direction B are illustrated as perpendicular to one another. In other aspects, however, direction A and direction B may not be perpendicular so long as such directions intersect (i.e., are not parallel) with each other.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> and the vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> include slots <b>24</b> formed therein. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the slots <b>24</b> of each of the base panels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> and the vertical panels <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the sliceform <b>10</b> are illustrated. These slots allow all of the panels to cooperate and permit the sliceform <b>10</b> to move between the first collapsed, substantially flat configuration and the second three-dimensional configuration.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sliceform <b>10</b> is shown removably secured to a foldable article <b>30</b>. In the illustrated aspect, the foldable article <b>30</b> is a greeting card. It is envisioned, however, that any type of foldable article is suitable for the present invention. For example, the concepts of the present invention could equally be applied to other products that contain two hinged planes that move toward and away from one another, for example, books, invitations, boxes, and other objects with flaps.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The foldable article <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a panel <b>32</b> having a first subpanel <b>34</b> separated from a second subpanel <b>36</b> by a fold <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a third subpanel <b>40</b> is affixed to the first subpanel <b>34</b>. A fourth subpanel <b>42</b> is shown lifted away from the second subpanel <b>36</b>, but may likewise be affixed thereto. In the illustrated aspect, the third subpanel <b>40</b> and the fourth subpanel <b>42</b> are discrete pieces affixed to the first subpanel <b>34</b> and the second subpanel <b>36</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, however, the panel <b>132</b> has a third subpanel <b>140</b> joined to the first subpanel <b>134</b> opposite the second subpanel <b>136</b>. Likewise, the panel <b>132</b> has a fourth subpanel <b>142</b> joined to the second subpanel <b>136</b> opposite the first subpanel <b>134</b>. In the alternative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the third subpanel <b>140</b> is separated from the first subpanel <b>134</b> by a second fold <b>144</b> and the fourth subpanel <b>142</b> is separated from the second subpanel <b>136</b> by a third fold <b>146</b>. The panel <b>132</b> may be assembled by first folding the third subpanel <b>140</b> over the second fold <b>144</b> and then affixing the third subpanel <b>140</b> to the first subpanel <b>134</b>. Similarly, the fourth subpanel <b>142</b> may be first folded over the third fold <b>146</b> before then affixing the fourth subpanel <b>142</b> to the second subpanel <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a detailed view of the third subpanel <b>40</b> of the panel <b>32</b> is illustrated. For the sake of brevity, the following description will only discuss aspects of the third subpanel <b>40</b>. This discussion, however, applies equally to the fourth subpanel <b>42</b> unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the third subpanel <b>40</b>, includes a first tab <b>50</b> having a first retaining portion <b>52</b>. In the illustrated aspect, the first retaining portion <b>52</b> is integrally formed with the first tab <b>50</b>. The first retaining portion <b>52</b> is wider than the first tab <b>50</b>. In some aspects, the third subpanel <b>40</b> may be die cut from a larger article. The die cutting may result in the removal of excess material and also in the cuts between the first tab <b>50</b> and the edges <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>.
