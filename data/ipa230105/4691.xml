These threats include radiated and conducted energy due to lightning and other threats, as well as electrostatics. These threats are a concern of many industries such as the aircraft, power generation and petrochemical industries. Certain structural products in these industries are susceptible to lightning strikes and other electromagnetic threats.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each EME threat requires a specific model of the same structural-product design, and these models often take months to build. Existing approaches to building EME models typically include a modeler requesting design data from design engineers via email, and manually converting their interpretation of the data into an EME model. Existing techniques often require multiple iterations to optimize system routing of system wiring, and appropriate computer models can take months to develop. There is also no defined method for balancing EME requirements for system routing wiring and other system elements, and additional &#x201c;keep-out&#x201d; zones are only described relative to other features. As a result, the only way to verify that routing meets requirements is through visual inspection, and any detailed analysis for exceptions or revised requirements can take a long time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable to have a system and method that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Example implementations of the present disclosure are directed to designing and manufacturing a structural product, and in particular, to electromagnetic effects (EME) analysis on a structural section of an aircraft. In accordance with example implementations, through development of system routing requirements, voltage requirements and dimension guidelines for keep-out zones may be generated. Model-based engineering tools may be used to create an EME model with information that may be linked to the aircraft design.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Densely-packed probes may be used throughout a computer-aided design (CAD) model or other computer model of the structural section such as a wing. These may be aggregated into requirements that may be tailored by a user, and from which a visual representation may be generated that indicates locations that exceed requirements (&#x201c;keep-out zones&#x201d;). The process may be iterated quickly to find the optimal systems routing, by varying voltage requirements values, and visualizing the effect on each location. The keep-out zones may be generated in geometry such as 3D geometry that identifies systems routing violating these requirements, and simulation data may be tied back to the aircraft design.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure thus includes, without limitation, the following example implementations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some example implementations provide an apparatus for analysis of electromagnetic effects (EME) on a structural section of an aircraft, the apparatus comprising a memory configured to store computer-readable program code; and processing circuitry configured to access the memory, and execute the computer-readable program code to cause the apparatus to at least: produce a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the structural section of the aircraft including a plurality of ribs defining bays, with apertures in one or more of the bays and identifiers of designated routing of system wiring through the one or more of the bays; perform an engineering analysis of the structural section based on the CAD model to determine electrical threshold values for locations for the one or more of the bays, which are related to an effect of electromagnetic radiation associated with an impact of an EME threat on the system wiring; identify any of the locations at which an electrical threshold value exceeds a predetermined threshold associated with a keep-out distance relative to the system wiring; and generate an output including information of those of the locations that are identified, and indicia for indicating a recommended modification to at least one of the designated routing, the system wiring or the one or more of the bays in order to address the EME threat.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some example implementations provide a method of analysis of electromagnetic effects (EME) on a structural section of an aircraft, the method comprising producing a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the structural section of the aircraft including a plurality of ribs defining bays, with apertures in one or more of the bays and identifiers of designated routing of system wiring through the one or more of the bays; performing an engineering analysis of the structural section based on the CAD model to determine electrical threshold values for locations for the one or more of the bays, which are related to an effect of electromagnetic radiation associated with an impact of an EME threat on the system wiring; identifying any of the locations at which an electrical threshold value exceeds a predetermined threshold associated with a keep-out distance relative to the system wiring; and generating an output including information of those of the locations that are identified, and indicia for indicating a recommended modification to at least one of the designated routing, the system wiring or the one or more of the bays in order to address the EME threat.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some example implementations provide a computer-readable storage medium for analysis of electromagnetic effects (EME) on a structural section of an aircraft, the computer-readable storage medium being non-transitory and having computer-readable program code stored therein that, in response to execution by processing circuitry, causes an apparatus to at least produce a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the structural section of the aircraft including a plurality of ribs defining bays, with apertures in one or more of the bays and identifiers of designated routing of system wiring through the one or more of the bays; perform an engineering analysis of the structural section based on the CAD model to determine electrical threshold values for locations for the one or more of the bays, which are related to an effect of electromagnetic radiation associated with an impact of an EME threat on the system wiring; identify any of the locations at which an electrical threshold value exceeds a predetermined threshold associated with a keep-out distance relative to the system wiring; and generate an output including information of those of the locations that are identified, and indicia for indicating a recommended modification to at least one of the designated routing, the system wiring or the one or more of the bays in order to address the EME threat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description together with the accompanying figures, which are briefly described below.
