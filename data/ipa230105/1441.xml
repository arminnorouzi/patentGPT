One typical type of die coating configuration is to apply coating material on a moving web by coating against a back-up roll.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a desire to improve coating uniformity when applying a coating on a moving web via a coating die against a back-up roll. For example, as the thickness of coated material decreases (e.g., 50 micrometers or less), the gap between a coating die and the back-up roll needs to become smaller (e.g., a gap less than 100 micrometers). Also, the gap needs to be more uniform (e.g. a gap that varies by less than 5 micrometers both spatially and temporally during coating). This increased precision requirement places a practical limit on the ability to produce thin coatings (e.g., 50 micrometers or less). The present disclosure provides methods and apparatuses of applying a uniform coating on a web via a coating die over a back-up roll having an air supported shell. Some embodiments of the present disclosure are specifically efficient to apply uniform thin coating of liquids with low viscosity on webs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Briefly, in one aspect, the disclosure describes a method of applying a coating onto a web. The method includes providing a roll comprising a shell rotatably supported by at least one pressurized air layer between the shell and a core; providing a coating die including one or more die lips being positioned adjacent an outer surface of the shell of the roll; and dispensing one or more coating materials from the one or more die lips of the coating die onto the web to form a coating, while translating the web in contact with the shell of the roll to rotate the shell. Fluid pressure can be generated in the coating bead due to the confinement of the fluid and the motion of the web. An air flow rate supplied to the core to form the at least one pressurized air layer can be adjusted such that the shell can deform and/or translate in space to balance forces from the pressurized air layer and the coating bead.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another aspect, this disclosure describes a coating apparatus including a roll comprising a shell rotatably supported by at least one pressurized air layer between the shell and a core; a coating die comprising one or more die lips being positioned adjacent an outer surface of the shell of the roll; a flexible web disposed between the roll and the coating die; and a web path to translate the web in contact with the outer surface of the shell of the roll to rotate the shell. One or more coating materials are disposed from the one or more die lips of the coating die onto the flexible web to form a coating, while the web is being translated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various unexpected results and advantages are obtained in exemplary embodiments of the disclosure. One such advantage of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is that a shell is supported by at least one pressurized air layer where the air pressure is controlled such that the shell can deform and/or translate in space to balance forces from the air layer and the coating bead to obtain coatings of lower viscosities with lower coat weights.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various aspects and advantages of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure have been summarized. The above Summary is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the present certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.

In all cases, this disclosure describes the presently disclosed disclosure by way of representation of exemplary embodiments and not by express limitations. It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For the following Glossary of defined terms, these definitions shall be applied for the entire application, unless a different definition is provided in the claims or elsewhere in the specification.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Glossary</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Certain terms are used throughout the description and the claims that, while for the most part are well known, may require some explanation. It should be understood that:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this application, the term &#x201c;coating die&#x201d; or &#x201c;die coating&#x201d; refers to a system or a method of dispensing a fluid coating material (e.g., a liquid coating material) from a die body thereof to a web. The die coating described herein is a pre-metered coating process in which the amount of coating material applied to the web per unit area is substantially predetermined by a metering device upstream, such as, for example, a precision gear pump. Typical die coating methods and systems are described in, e.g., Ian D. Gates, Slot Coating Flows: Feasibility, Quality, PhD Thesis, 1999, University of Minnesota.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;air layer&#x201d; refers to a pressurized gas (e.g., air) layer that creates an air gap between two surfaces to provide a low or no friction interface between a static element, such as a rigid core, and a rotating element, such as a thin metal shell.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The terms &#x201c;coating material,&#x201d; &#x201c;liquid,&#x201d; &#x201c;liquid material,&#x201d; or &#x201c;liquid coating material&#x201d; refer to any materials flowable at coating operation conditions described herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this application, the terms &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; or &#x201c;polymers&#x201d; includes homopolymers and copolymers, as well as homopolymers or copolymers that may be formed in a miscible blend, e.g., by coextrusion or by reaction, including, e.g., transesterification. The term &#x201c;copolymer&#x201d; includes random, block and star (e.g. dendritic) copolymers.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this application, by using terms of orientation such as &#x201c;atop&#x201d;, &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;covering&#x201d;, &#x201c;uppermost&#x201d;, &#x201c;underlying&#x201d; and the like for the location of various elements in the disclosed coated articles, we refer to the relative position of an element with respect to a horizontally-disposed, upwardly-facing substrate (e.g., web). However, unless otherwise indicated, it is not intended that the substrate (e.g., web) or articles should have any particular orientation in space during or after manufacture.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this application, by using the term &#x201c;overcoated&#x201d; to describe the position of a layer with respect to a substrate (e.g., web) or other element of an article of the present disclosure, we refer to the layer as being atop the substrate (e.g., web) or other element, but not necessarily contiguous to either the substrate (e.g., web) or the other element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this application, the term &#x201c;machine direction&#x201d; refers to the direction in which the web travels. Similarly, the term &#x201c;cross-web&#x201d; refers to the direction perpendicular to the machine direction (i.e. perpendicular to the direction of travel for the web), and in the plane of the top surface of the web.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this application, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; with reference to a numerical value or a shape means+/&#x2212;five percent of the numerical value or property or characteristic, but expressly includes the exact numerical value. For example, a viscosity of &#x201c;about&#x201d; 1 Pa-sec refers to a viscosity from 0.95 to 1.05 Pa-sec, but also expressly includes a viscosity of exactly 1 Pa-sec. Similarly, a perimeter that is &#x201c;substantially square&#x201d; is intended to describe a geometric shape having four lateral edges in which each lateral edge has a length which is from 95% to 105% of the length of any other lateral edge, but which also includes a geometric shape in which each lateral edge has exactly the same length.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this application, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; with reference to a property or characteristic means that the property or characteristic is exhibited to a greater extent than the opposite of that property or characteristic is exhibited. For example, a substrate (e.g., web) that is &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; transparent refers to a substrate (e.g., web) that transmits more radiation (e.g. visible light) than it fails to transmit (e.g. absorbs and reflects). Thus, a substrate (e.g., web) that transmits more than 50% of the visible light incident upon its surface is substantially transparent, but a substrate (e.g., web) that transmits 50% or less of the visible light incident upon its surface is not substantially transparent.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this application, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to fine fibers containing &#x201c;a compound&#x201d; includes a mixture of two or more compounds. As used in this specification and the appended embodiments, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is generally employed in its sense including &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used in this application, the recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers subsumed within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.8, 4, and 5).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities or ingredients, measurement of properties and so forth used in the specification and embodiments are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and more particularly the Listing of Exemplary Embodiments and the claims can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the teachings of the present disclosure. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claimed embodiments, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may take on various modifications and alterations without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the present disclosure are not to be limited to the following described exemplary embodiments, but are to be controlled by the limitations set forth in the claims and any equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Methods and apparatuses are described herein for die coating on a moving substrate. In a coating process described herein, a flexible web is disposed between a back-up roll and a slot die. The back-up roll includes an outer shell rotatably supported by at least one pressurized air layer, which is provided between the outer shell and an air core. The outer shell can float on the layer of pressurized air, deform and/or translate in space with respect to the core. The flexible web can wrap around the back-up roll and move to rotate the outer shell of the back-up roll.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The uniformity of a liquid coating may be impacted by a combination of many sources of imperfections and may result in variations in the appearance and amount of the coating that adheres to a substrate. The present disclosure addresses some issues that might impact the coating uniformity. In some embodiments, the average amount of the applied liquid coating can be metered by a solution handling system, which can be proportioned to the speed and width of the flexible web that is to be coated. The thickness variation in the cross-web direction of the applied liquid coating can be controlled by the performance of the die cavity, which shapes flow from a feed pipe into a sheet that emerges from a die slot. The thickness uniformity in the cross-web direction is referred to as the cross-web coating profile. A substantially flat profile means a substantially uniform coating thickness. The cross-web coating profile can also be a function of the pressure in the coating bead and the gap between the coating die and the back-up roll. In some embodiments, the thickness uniformity in the down-web direction can be controlled by solution handling (e.g., to control a down-web coating thickness variation due to the variation in the flowrate delivered by a pumping system) and web handling (e.g., to control a down-web coating thickness variation due to variation in the speed of a substrate). The thickness uniformity in the down-web direction is referred to as the down-web coating profile. In the present disclosure, the coating profile can be controlled such that both the cross-web coating profile and the down-web coating file are substantially uniform or flat over time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some cases, factors other than the performance of the solution handling, the die cavity and/or the web handling, may also affect the uniformity or flatness of the coating profile. For example, nonuniformities in the coating bead may create visible localized defects in the applied coating such as those brought on by entrainment of air between the coating and the web, break-up of the continuous coating bead into rivulets or repeating cross web bands, and/or surface roughness in the coated substrate. These discontinuities and nonuniformities in the coating are generally referred to as coating defects.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, coating defects may be produced by imperfections in a back-up roll. For example, when a coating die is positioned against a back-up roll, the back-up roll may deviate significantly from an ideal cylinder, as indicated by a total indicated runout (TIR). A TIR refers to the difference between the largest and smallest values of the radius on the roll. The requirement for a low TIR (e.g., less than 1 micrometer) back-up roll can significantly increase the cost and complexity of a slot die coating system with a back-up roll. When a coating die is positioned against a free-span of the web, it also might have problems. For example, in that case, baggy lanes in the substrate may lead to coating defects as the web bagginess can lead to low bead pressure in the area of web bagginess, resulting in non-uniform liquid flow out of the coating die.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some cases, producing coatings with a wet thickness of about 50 micrometers or less can be challenging when using a coating die. To produce such a thin coating against a rigid back-up roll such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>&#x2032;, a slot die <b>20</b> may be positioned at a very close proximity to the rigid back-up roll <b>10</b>&#x2032; (e.g., with a gap between the die lip and the roll surface less than 100 micrometers), and therefore requires increasing precision not just in the positioning system, but also in the uniformity of the die and roll surfaces, and this quickly becomes impractical.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">PCT Application No. PCT/IB2019/060411 (Attorney docket No. 80494WO003, Dodds et al.) describes slot die coating over deformable back-up roll, which is incorporated herein by reference. As the viscosity of the coating material decreases, softer and softer back-up roll surfaces are required for the system to be effective to apply a thin (e.g., 50 micrometers or less) and uniform coating material onto a moving web. The increased softness of the back-up roll surface may limit the range of viscosity and thicknesses of coating that can be uniformly applied onto a moving web.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A free-span coating does not use a back-up roll, and in theory one may be able to position the web arbitrarily closely to the slot die, and so produce arbitrarily thin coatings. In practice, a free-span coating may require increasingly accurate control of the tension and thickness of the substrate upon which the coating is applied, as these parameters and web bagginess can lead to changes in the pressure in the coating bead, and therefore variations in the local thickness of the coating.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For a die coating process, it is often possible to define a coating window, i.e. a range of parameters in which it is possible to achieve an acceptable coating. This window may in general be a function of the properties of the liquid coating solution (viscosity, surface tension, etc.), as well as the mechanical configuration of the coating system (line speed, die geometry, etc.). An example of a limit to the coating window may be defined as the low-flow limit. In this configuration the flowrate of the liquid coating solution may not match the rate of liquid uptake by the web, and so the upstream coating bead becomes unstable. When coating in free span this defect may be eliminated by increasing the tension in the web, though there are typically machine limitations to increasing the tension beyond a certain value (e.g., 2 lbs per inch of cross-web width). When coating with a slot die against a back-up roll, the low-flow limit may be eliminated by decreasing the distance between the slot die and the web, though there are again machine limitations to this approach, such as the precision with which that distance can be maintained, both temporally and spatially.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Methods and apparatuses are described herein for a die coating apparatus and method which can address the above described issues. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a coating apparatus including a back-up roll comprising a shell rotatably supported by at least one pressurized air layer can be used, which allows the web to lay against the back-up roll, diminishing the impact of web bag as compared to free-span coating, while also allowing the back-up roll to deflect under the pressure in the coating bead, diminishing the impact of any nonuniformities in the back-up roll as compared to coating against a rigid back-up roll.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While not to be bound by theory, by using a shell that is rotatably supported on a layer of pressurized air between the shell and the core, the position of the shell relative to the coating die and the core may adjust to balance the force applied by the coating bead with the force applied by the air layer. Therefore, the elimination of coating defects such as the low-flow limit may be possible by simply adjusting the flow of air into the core, and thus the pressure of the pressurized air layer. Coating defects such as the low-flow limit may therefore be addressed without needing to alter the position of the coating die relative to the fixed axis of the backup roll (as would be the case when coating against a backup roll), or without adjusting the web tension (as would be the case when coating in free-span). The overall uniformity of the coating may be set by, for example, the mechanical uniformity of the core and the shell, and the consistency of the flowrate of air supplied to form the pressurized air layer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some embodiments of the present disclosure can further address variation of coating thickness due to a splice. When changing from a first input roll of substrate to a second input roll of substrate, it is common to tape the trailing end of the first input roll of substrate to the leading edge of the second input roll of substrate, producing what is commonly referred to as a splice. In practice, this produces a significant thickness variation in the substrate at the location of the splice, due to the thickness of any tape used to hold the two substrates together, as well as due to any overlap between the two layers of substrate. When coating with a slot die against a rigid back-up roll, this may force the coating practitioner to temporarily increase the gap between the slot die and the rigid back-up roll so that the splice does not get stuck at the slot die, which typically may result in the web breaking and would therefore lead to a significant interruption in the coating operation. This may not typically be a problem when coating in free span, since there is no back-up roll to trap the splice. In the present disclosure, a rigid back-up roll is replaced with a back-up roll including a shell that is rotatably supported on a layer of pressurized air, and the splice can pass through the gap between the coating die and the back-up roll shell without tearing the splice due to translation of the shell and self-adjustment of the pressurized air layer supporting the shell.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various exemplary embodiments of the disclosure will now be described with particular reference to the Drawings.

The shell <b>14</b> can be built out of metals, combination of layers of metals, from composite materials that include PAN carbon fibers, pitch carbon fibers, para-aramid fibers, Kevlar fibers, and glass fibers, or from combination of layers of metals and polymeric materials, for example elastomers like rubbers. These fiber-based materials are impregnated with polymeric materials that could include epoxies, polyesters, and vinylesters. Examples of metals suitable for building shells include nickel, copper, nickel/cobalt, titanium, and aluminum. A thin shell of carbon composite is also believed to be suitable for use as a shell.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the shell <b>14</b> can be composed primarily of nickel. For example, a shell composed of nickel having a thickness of between about 3 mils (0.076 mm) and 15 mils (0.381 mm), or even between about 4 mils (0.102 mm) to 6 mils (0.152 mm), has been found to be suitable.

Rotational moment of inertia is linearly proportional to the length of the shell, linearly proportional to the thickness of the shell when thickness of the shell is generally less than 1/100th of the radius of the shell, and proportional to the cube of the radius of the shell when thickens of the shell is generally less than 1/100th of the radius of the shell.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Shells with lower rotational moment of inertia may be advantageous where the rotational inertia of the shell is affecting acceleration and deacceleration of the sleeve driven by a substrate, e.g., the moving web <b>3</b> The shell <b>14</b> is not connected to a drive and freely rotates about its axis.

The radial displacement D is measured as a distance between the resting position and the coating position of the shell <b>4</b> along the radial direction for a central point where the die lip <b>22</b> engages the shell <b>4</b>. When the die lip <b>22</b> and the shell <b>4</b> engage with each other, the air gap adjacent to the coating zone <b>120</b> decreases by the amount of the radial displacement D. An effective physical gap G can be measured as the radial distance between the die lip <b>22</b> and the outer surface of the core <b>12</b> for the central point where the die lip <b>22</b> engages the shell <b>4</b>, after subtracting the thickness of the shell <b>4</b>.

The die lip <b>22</b> is typically in contact with the coating liquid and can take on various shapes. The die lip will have a length both upstream and downstream from the opening(s), and this length may be about 0.01 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 5 mm, or any other suitable number.

The predetermined flow rate, along with other factors such as, for example, the web speed, can largely define the thickness of the coating layer. The pump can be, for example, a high bandwidth precision pump that is in fluid communication with an input port of the die body. The pump is configured to supply the coating material into the internal manifold <b>24</b> at an adjustable flow rate such that the coating material can be dispensed onto the moving web <b>3</b> through the die lip <b>22</b> to form a coating <b>9</b> with a desired thickness.

The maximum tension achieved was about 24 lbs on the 12 inch PET.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">A slot die with a 20-mil shim was used. Adhesive liquid material commercially available from 3M Company (St. Paul, Minn.) was used, which has a viscosity of about 10,000 cP at a shear rate of 10 l/s and a viscosity of about 3,000 cP at a shear rate of 2,000 l/s. The adhesive was fed to the die via a gear pump. The die lips include a downstream lip with radius of 0.05&#x2033; And a length of 0.02&#x2033;, and an upstream lip with a radius of 1.0&#x2033; And a length of 0.2&#x2033;. The target wet coat weight was about 9 mils (approximately 0.23 mm). Line speed was varied from 5 FPM to 20 FPM.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the minimum air shell core pressure required to establish a uniform coating. For these conditions the underbite was set to 2 mils and the die was not moved between conditions. As the wet coating thickness decreases the gap between the roll and the die required to achieve a uniform coating also decreases. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows that as coating weight/thickness decreases, the minimum air pressure required increases. This implies that the position of the nickel shell relative to the die lip is controllable to some degree through adjustments in air pressure.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">Minimum coating thickness was also investigated. The die position was adjusted closer to the air sleeve to provide the greatest restoring force to the coating bead. Minimum wet coating thickness achieved (calculated from flow rate) was 0.35 mils (0.009 mm). The coating was not streak free.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">Table 1 shows results obtained by reducing the coating liquid flowrate while the air supplied to the core was held constant. As the coating thickness is decreased it is generally expected that the coating gap decreases to maintain a uniform coating. The data shows the position of the air sleeve adjusts dynamically in response to changes in the coat weight, enabling uniform coating at the three flow rates.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Minimum Thickness Screening</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Line Speed</entry><entry>Flow Rate</entry><entry>Air Pressure</entry><entry>Wet thickness</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(FPM)</entry><entry>(cc/min)</entry><entry>(inches H<sub>2</sub>O)</entry><entry>(mils)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>115</entry><entry>0.69</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>115</entry><entry>0.46</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>115</entry><entry>0.46</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>115</entry><entry>0.35</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">In a second experiment, the wet coating thickness was held constant and the line speed varied, with the die position held constant.
