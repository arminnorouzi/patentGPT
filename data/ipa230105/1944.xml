Visual field detection apparatus <b>10</b> detects information on the visual field range (for example, visual field range R illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of a driver by detecting the body motion of the driver during the driving. The visual line detection by visual field detection apparatus <b>10</b> can be performed by a known technique other than the above configuration.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Attention target detection apparatus <b>20</b> is, for example, a camera or a radar, and detects an attention target located around vehicle <b>1</b>. The attention target is a target that the driver of vehicle <b>1</b> should pay attention to during the driving operation, and is, for example, at least one of a pedestrian, a bicycle, another vehicle, and a traffic light.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Notification apparatus <b>30</b> is an in-vehicle apparatus such as a car navigation device or an infotainment device, and notifies the driver of a visual field abnormality by performing display output or voice output based on a notification command from notification section (herein also referred to as &#x201c;notifier&#x201d;) <b>140</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Vehicle control unit <b>100</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU), read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), and input-output circuitry, which are not illustrated. Vehicle control unit <b>100</b> includes travel controller <b>110</b>, determination section (herein also referred to as &#x201c;determiner&#x201d;) <b>120</b>, estimation section (herein also referred to as &#x201c;estimator&#x201d;) <b>130</b>, and notifier <b>140</b>. Vehicle control unit <b>100</b> corresponds to an &#x201c;estimation apparatus&#x201d; of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Travel controller <b>110</b> controls the travelling of vehicle <b>1</b> based on the information related to the driving operation of a driver. Examples of the driving operation of a driver include operations of gas pedal, brake pedal, and steering wheel, and other operations related to the driving operation of vehicle <b>1</b>, as well as operations of other in-vehicle apparatuses such as a turn signal and a horn. Travel controller <b>110</b> corresponds to a &#x201c;controller&#x201d; of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Determiner <b>120</b> determines whether or not an attention target is visually recognizable from a driver based on the information on the visual field range of the driver. The information on the visual field range corresponds to information on the visual field range of the driver detected by visual field detection apparatus <b>10</b>. An attention target around vehicle <b>1</b> corresponds to information on the attention target detected by attention target detection apparatus <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;An attention target is visually recognizable from a driver&#x201d; means that, for example, there is an attention target in the visual field range of the driver. &#x201c;An attention target is not visually recognizable from a driver&#x201d; means that, for example, there is no attention target in the visual field range of the driver.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When there is an attention target outside the visual field range of a driver, determiner <b>120</b> determines that the attention target is not visually recognizable from the driver. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, when pedestrian A<b>1</b> located on the sidewalk in the opposite lane is outside visual field range R, determiner <b>120</b> determines that the attention target (i.e., pedestrian A<b>1</b>) is not visually recognizable from the driver. Drawings such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrate windshield <b>1</b>A as seen from the driver side.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Even in the case where determiner <b>120</b> determines that the attention target is not visually recognizable from a driver, the following case may occur: the attention target approaches visual field range R toward the inside of the range; or the attention target is located relatively close to vehicle <b>1</b> even when the location of the attention target is outside visual field range R. In this case, from the viewpoint of safe driving, vehicle control unit <b>100</b> performs the control of the traveling of vehicle <b>1</b> or the control related to alerting the driver by, for example, a known method.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, when there is an attention target inside the visual field range of a driver, determiner <b>120</b> determines that the attention target is visually recognizable from the driver. For example, when another vehicle A<b>2</b> located in front of vehicle <b>1</b> is inside visual field range R, the determiner determines that the attention target (i.e., another vehicle A<b>2</b>) is visually recognizable from the driver.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Estimator <b>130</b> estimates the visual field abnormality of a driver based on the driving operation of the driver in the case where determiner <b>120</b> determines that the attention target is visually recognizable from the driver. Specifically, when a driver does not perform a paying attention operation for an attention target (operation in which the driver pays attention to the attention target) within a predetermined time after the attention target is determined to be visually recognizable from the driver until the driver approaches the attention target, estimator <b>130</b> add this time to the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed. Estimator <b>130</b> determines whether or not the driver performs the paying attention operation based on the information&#x2014;related to the driving operation&#x2014;input to travel controller <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Examples of the paying attention operation include, when the attention target is a pedestrian, a bicycle, or another vehicle, driving operations for avoiding contact between vehicle <b>1</b> and the attention target, such as lowering the running speed of vehicle <b>1</b>, stopping vehicle <b>1</b>, slowing down vehicle <b>1</b>, driving vehicle <b>1</b> so as to move away from the attention target, and honking a horn.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Examples of the paying attention operation include, when the attention target is a traffic light, driving operations related to safe driving of vehicle <b>1</b> according to traffic lights, such as stopping vehicle <b>1</b> when the traffic light displays the red light.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The predetermined time can be appropriately changed according to, for example, the type of attention target, the time during which the attention target is in the visual field range, the relative speed of vehicle <b>1</b> until the vehicle approaches the attention target, and the distance between the attention target and vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, when vehicle <b>1</b> is traveling while maintaining an appropriate inter-vehicle distance from another vehicle A<b>2</b> located inside visual field range R, estimator <b>130</b> determines that the driver is performing the paying attention operation, and does not increase the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when vehicle <b>1</b> travels without lowering the running speed for a predetermined time after pedestrian A<b>3</b>, who is trying to cross in front of the vehicle, is determined to be visually recognizable from the driver, estimator <b>130</b> determines that the driver is not performing the paying attention operation, and adds this time to the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when vehicle <b>1</b> travels without lowering the running speed for a predetermined time after traffic light A<b>4</b>, which displays the red light, is determined to be visually recognizable from the driver, estimator <b>130</b> determines that the driver is not performing the paying attention operation, and adds this time to the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, estimator <b>130</b> estimates the visual field abnormality according to the number of times where driver does not perform paying attention operation. When the number of times the driver does not perform the paying attention operation reaches a predetermined number of times, estimator <b>130</b> estimates that the driver has a visual field abnormality. At the predetermined number of times, the possibility of visual field abnormality can be determined to be relatively high.

After step S<b>107</b>, this control ends.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The present embodiment configured as described above estimates the visual field abnormality of a driver based on the driver's driving operation. Specifically, the visual field abnormality of a driver is estimated according to the number of times the paying attention operation for an attention target is not performed after the attention target is determined to be visually recognizable from the driver until a predetermined time passes. As a result, the presence or absence of the visual field abnormality can be estimated at a timing where the possibility of the visual field abnormality can be determined to be high to some extent, thereby enabling accurate estimation of the visual field abnormality of a driver.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, the drivers are notified of the visual field abnormality, and thus the drivers can recognize that they has the visual field abnormality. The driver therefore can focus on more careful driving, and urging the driver to go to the hospital for visual field abnormality is also possible.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the above embodiment, the visual field abnormality is estimated for the entire visual field range; however, there are some drivers who have difficulty in seeing only in a specific part in the visual field range. Therefore, estimator <b>130</b> may divide visual field range R into a plurality of regions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Estimator <b>130</b> then may count the number of times the paying attention operation for an attention target is not performed in each region, and may estimate the visual field abnormality for each region.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The plurality of regions include first region R<b>1</b>, which is an upper right region with respect to the center of visual field range R, second region R<b>2</b>, which is a lower right region with respect to the center, third region R<b>3</b>, which is a lower left region with respect to the center, and fourth region R<b>4</b>, which is an upper left region with respect to the center.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, when the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed for an attention target (for example, traffic light A<b>5</b>) in fourth region R<b>4</b> is significantly higher than that in the other regions, estimator <b>130</b> estimates that the driver has a visual field abnormality in fourth region R<b>4</b>, and estimates that the driver has no visual field abnormality in the other regions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">This configuration allows the identification of a region where a driver particularly difficult to see, thereby enabling accurate estimation of the visual field abnormality of the driver.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, estimating a visual field abnormality for each region in this manner allows, for example, notifier <b>140</b> to output the command related to the alerting as describe above only for the region where the driver has the visual field abnormality. As a result, it is possible to improve the accuracy of alerting for a region where the driver has the visual field abnormality.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, in the above embodiment, the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed is counted every time vehicle <b>1</b> travels; however, some drivers often follow the same traveling route. For example, it is assumed that traffic light A<b>5</b> is located on the left side (fourth region R<b>4</b>) at point A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and traffic light A<b>6</b> is located on the right side (first region R<b>1</b>) at point B on the traveling route (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For such a route, in the case of a driver who is still not estimated to have a visual field abnormality by estimator <b>130</b> but the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed increases in the region on the right side, the following may occur: the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed for traffic light A<b>5</b> is almost zero at point A, whereas the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed for traffic light A<b>6</b> increases at point B. In other words, in the case of a driver who often follows the same traveling route, the increase of this number of times at point B may be used to determine at an early stage that the driver has a visual field abnormality in the right region (for example, first region R<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For this purpose, estimator <b>130</b> adjusts the estimation result of the visual field abnormality based on the traveling route of vehicle <b>1</b> for the driver.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The information on a traveling route can be obtained, for example, from map information stored in a storage section (not illustrated) mounted on the vehicle, or vehicle position information from a car navigation device or a global positioning system (GPS) module.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, estimator <b>130</b> weights the count number (the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed) when vehicle <b>1</b> travels on the same traveling route. Specifically, for example, when the paying attention operation is not performed for the attention target at point B, estimator <b>130</b> doubles the number to be added. This configuration enables estimation of the visual field abnormality at an early stage based on the position of an attention target, for which the driver does not perform the paying attention operation, at the same point.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, for some drivers, how easily the driver can see may change within the visual field range depending on the weather condition and the driving time zone. The information on the weather condition and the time zone can be obtained from, for example, a car navigation device or the like.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, the following case is assumed: a driver has difficulty in seeing the region on the right side of the visual field range when the weather condition is cloudy. In the case of the driver who has a visual field abnormality in the right region, the following may occur: when the weather condition is sunny, the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed is almost zero, whereas when the weather condition is cloudy, the number of times the paying attention operation is not performed for the attention target in the region on the right side of the visual field range increases. In other words, in the case of the driver who has difficulty in seeing the region on the right side of the visual field range when the weather condition is cloudy, the increase of this number of times when the weather condition is cloudy may be used to determine at an early stage that the driver has a visual field abnormality in the right region.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For this purpose, estimator <b>130</b> adjusts the estimation result of the visual field abnormality based on the traveling environment of vehicle <b>1</b>. For example, estimator <b>130</b> weights the count number when the weather condition is cloudy. Specifically, when the paying attention operation is not performed for the attention target in the region on the right side of the visual field range under the cloudy weather condition, the number to be added is doubled. This configuration enables estimation of the visual field abnormality at an early stage based on changes in the traveling environment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, for example, when the time zone is near the evening, a driver may find difficult to see the front due to afternoon sunlight slanted through the window. In this case, even when there is an attention target in the visual field range, the attention target may become difficult for the driver to see. Even though there is no visual field abnormality, this case may be mistakenly estimated as a visual field abnormality.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, in this case, estimator <b>130</b> does not add this time even when the driver does not perform a paying attention operation for the attention target. This configuration can improve the estimation accuracy of the visual field abnormality.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, in the above embodiment, the estimation result of the visual field abnormality may be adjusted according to the driving time of a driver. As the driving time increases, the number of times (count number) determined such that the paying attention operation is not performed also increases accordingly. The count number include the times that are not caused by a visual field abnormality, but caused by, for example, a mere carelessness; therefore, when the count number increases as the driving time increases, the number may exceed the threshold value for determining the visual field abnormality. Then, estimator <b>130</b> may estimate that the visual field is abnormal even if that is not the case.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Therefore, estimator <b>130</b> adjusts the estimation result of the visual field abnormality according to the driving time of a driver.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, estimator <b>130</b> reduces the count number by one when the driving time by a driver reaches a predetermined driving time. This configuration can prevent estimation of a visual field abnormality mistakenly made because of the increased driving time, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of the visual field abnormality.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Such a count number would increase simply as the driver's visual field abnormality progresses. Estimator <b>130</b> thus may determine whether or not to reduce the count number based on the increase rate or the like in the count number for each predetermined driving time. Specifically, estimator <b>130</b> determines that the visual field abnormality may be progressing, thus determines not to reduce the count number in the following case: when the increase rate in the count number in the latest first predetermined driving time is equal to or higher than the increase rate in the count number in the previous second predetermined driving time.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, estimator <b>130</b> may adjust the estimation result of the visual field abnormality according to map information. The map information is stored in a storage section (not illustrated) mounted on the vehicle or obtained from the outside.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The number of traffic lights changes depending on the area where vehicle <b>1</b> travels (for example, in the city or the countryside). Thus, the frequency of the increase of the count number inevitably decreases in the area where the number of traffic lights is small. Therefore, for some drivers having a visual field abnormality, the timing that the driver is estimated to have a visual field abnormality may be delayed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore, estimator <b>130</b> adjusts the estimation result of the visual field abnormality according to map information. For example, estimator <b>130</b> doubles the number to be added in the area where the number of traffic lights is small. This configuration can prevent estimation that the driver has a visual field abnormality from being delayed depending on the area where vehicle <b>1</b> travels.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">No mention is made of data of vehicle <b>1</b> in the above embodiment, but the following can be, for example, considered. The visual field range changes between a large vehicle and a small vehicle as the driver's view changes depending on the size of the vehicle. When the data of a visual field range obtained for a medium-sized vehicle is applied to a large or small vehicle, the direction of the driver's visual line changes and the visual field range related to the data may deviate from the actual visual field range of the driver.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Therefore, determiner <b>120</b> may adjust the visual field range based on the data of vehicle <b>1</b>. For example, in a large vehicle, the driver's visual line is lower than that of a medium-sized vehicle, and thus determiner <b>120</b> shifts visual field range R downward to perform a determination as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, in a small vehicle, the driver's visual line is higher than that of a medium-sized vehicle, and thus determiner <b>120</b> shifts visual field range R upward to perform a determination as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">This configuration can prevent estimation of a visual field abnormality mistakenly made because of the deviation of a visual field range due to the type of vehicle <b>1</b>, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of the visual field abnormality.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the above description, it is assumed that the drivers were the same. However, the visual field range changes depending on who drives the vehicle, and a region where each driver particularly difficult to see also changes. In vehicle <b>1</b> driven by a plurality of drivers, it is thus necessary to distinguish the visual field ranges from each other for different drivers, as well as the numbers of times the paying attention operation is not performed.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For this purpose, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, vehicle control unit <b>100</b> includes identification section (herein also referred to as &#x201c;identifier&#x201d;) <b>150</b> in addition to the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
