num="0000">The present invention relates to a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system and provides a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system, which is manufactured with a sensor module assembled inside an applicator, thereby minimizing additional work by a user for attaching the sensor module to the body and allowing the sensor module to be attached to the body simply by operating the applicator, and thus can be used more conveniently. A battery is built in the sensor module and a separate transmitter is connected to the sensor module so as to receive power supply from the sensor module and be continuously used semi-permanently, thereby making the assembly economical. The sensor module and the applicator are used as disposables, thereby allowing accurate and safe use and convenient maintenance.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system, in which the sensor applicator assembly is fabricated, with a sensor module being preinstalled in an applicator, so that a user can attach the sensor module to the skin by simply operating the applicator. Additional tasks of the user for attaching the sensor module to the skin can be minimized, thereby allowing the sensor applicator assembly to be more conveniently used. In addition, a battery is provided as a built-in component of the sensor module and a separate transmitter is connected to the sensor module to receive power from the sensor module, so that the transmitter can be used semi-permanently, which is economical. In addition, the sensor module and the applicator are provided to be disposable so as to be used accurately and safely, thereby allowing safe use and convenient maintenance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Diabetes or diabetes mellitus is a chronic medical condition that is common in modern people. In the Republic of Korea, it affects 2 million people, about 5% of the total population.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diabetes is caused from the absolute deficiency or relative insufficiency of insulin produced by the pancreas, due to various causes such as obesity, stress, poor eating habits, inherited hereditary factors, in which glucose balance in the blood may be disturbed, thereby resulting in a high blood sugar level.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The blood usually contains a certain concentration of glucose, and tissue cells gain energy from the glucose.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the content of glucose is increased excessively, it is not properly stored in the liver, muscle, or adipose tissue and accumulates in the blood. As a result, patients with diabetes maintain a much higher blood glucose level than other people. Excessive blood glucose passes through the tissues and is discharged into the urine, resulting in deficiency of glucose, which is absolutely necessary for all tissues of the body, thereby causing abnormalities in respective body tissues.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Diabetes mellitus is characterized by substantial absence of subjective symptoms at the beginning of the condition. When diabetes mellitus progresses, diabetes-specific symptoms such as diarrhea, polyuria, weight loss, general anxiety, skin itchiness, and scarring of the hands and feet are present. Further progression of diabetes leads to complications such as visual disturbances, hypertension, kidney disease, paralysis, periodontal disease, muscle spasms and neuralgia, as well as gangrene.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systematic blood glucose measurement and treatment should be performed to diagnose diabetes beforehand and manage the condition to prevent the progression of diabetes into complications associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For people with diabetes or people having higher than normal blood glucose, even though diabetes has not yet developed, medical device manufacturers offer a variety of blood glucose meters to measure blood glucose levels at home.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Glucose monitoring systems are categorized on the basis of a method of measuring a blood glucose level once by a user collecting blood from a fingertip and a method of continuously measuring blood glucose levels by attaching a glucose monitoring system to the belly or an arm of a user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Diabetics generally traverse between hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. An emergency may occur in hypoglycemic conditions, in which diabetics may become unconscious or die if a hypoglycemic condition lasts for an extended period of time without the supply of sugar. Accordingly, rapid discovery of a hypoglycemic condition is critically important for diabetics. However, invasive glucose monitoring systems intermittently measuring glucose by collecting blood have limited ability to accurately measure blood glucose levels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Recently, to overcome such a drawback, continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMSs) have been developed. Such a CGMS is inserted into the body to measure a blood glucose level every few minutes. In this manner, the treatment of diabetics and measures in response to an emergency can be easily undertaken.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, in an invasive glucose monitoring system, a diabetic performs glucose measurement by collecting blood by pricking a pain-sensitive fingertip with a needle. Therefore, a blood collecting process may cause pain and aversion to measurement. To minimize such pain and aversion to measurement, research and development of CGMSs have been undertaken. In such a CGMS, glucose is continuously measured by inserting a needle-shaped sensor into a portion of the human body, such as the belly or an arm, which is less pain sensitive. Furthermore, research and development of non-invasive glucose monitoring systems for measuring glucose without collecting blood have been actively undertaken.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Regarding non-invasive glucose monitoring systems, a variety of methods of measuring glucose without collecting blood have been studied over the past 40 years. Such methods may include electrical methods, exhalation measurement methods, and the like. Cygnus (Redwoo City, Ca, USA) has developed and launched the Glucowatch&#xae; G2 Biographer, a watch-shaped glucose monitoring device, using reverse iontophoresis. However, the distribution of this device was stopped in 2007, because of problems, such as skin irritation, measurement approval, and a device malfunctioning caused by excessive sweating. Although a variety of non-invasive glucose monitoring techniques have been introduced and reported to date, there have been no practical uses due to low levels of accuracy thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A continuous glucose monitoring system includes: a sensor module attached to the skin of a human body to measure a blood glucose level by extracting body fluid, a transmitter transmitting the blood glucose level measured by the sensor module to a terminal, the terminal outputting the received blood glucose level, and the like. The sensor module includes, for example, a needle-shaped sensor probe for insertion into subcutaneous fat to extract interstitial fluid. A separate applicator for attaching the sensor module to the body is used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such continuous glucose monitoring systems are fabricated to have a wide variety of shapes depending on the manufacturer thereof, and are used in a variety of methods. However, in majority continuous glucose monitoring systems fabricated and distributed, a disposable sensor module is attached to the body using an applicator. A user should perform a multistage process to operate an applicator to attach a disposable sensor module to the body. After the sensor module is attached to the skin, the user should perform a variety of follow-up procedures by him or herself, such as a procedure of withdrawing a needle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, a variety of procedures that the user should perform may include: unpacking the disposable sensor module, accurately inserting the disposable sensor module into the applicator, operating and inserting the applicator into the skin, with the sensor module being inserted into the applicator, withdrawing the needle of the sensor module from the skin using a separate device by him or herself after the insertion of the sensor module into the skin, and the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, the process for measuring glucose using a continuous glucose monitoring system is significantly difficult and inconvenient, which are problematic. In addition, a transmitter used to transmit information regarding the sensor module is disposable together with the sensor module, although the transmitter is relatively expensive. Accordingly, there is another problem in that this solution is significantly inefficient in economic and environmental aspects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, the present disclosure has been made in consideration of the above-described problems occurring in the related art, and the present disclosure proposes a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system, in which the sensor applicator assembly is fabricated, with a sensor module being preinstalled in an applicator, so that a user can attach the sensor module to the skin by simply operating the applicator. Additional tasks of the user for attaching the sensor module to the skin can be minimized, thereby allowing the sensor applicator assembly to be more conveniently used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also proposed is a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system, in which a battery is provided as a built-in component of the sensor module and a separate transmitter is connected to the sensor module to receive power from the sensor module, so that the transmitter can be used semi-permanently, which is economical. In addition, the sensor module and the applicator are provided to be disposable so as to be used accurately and safely, thereby allowing safe use and convenient maintenance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure provides a sensor applicator assembly for a continuous glucose monitoring system, including: a sensor module configured to be attachable to a human body to extract body fluid and periodically measure a blood glucose level; an applicator allowing the sensor module to be coupled and fixed to an inner portion thereof, and being operable to eject the sensor module in response to a user's manipulation, so that the sensor module is attached to the human body. The applicator may be fixedly coupled to the sensor module when the sensor module is preinstalled therein and is decoupled from the sensor module when the sensor module is ejected.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Here, the applicator may include: a main container having an accommodation space therein and an open side, with a press button being mounted on a portion of the main container to be press-manipulated by a user; and a plunger body disposed in a first position within the main container to move linearly from the first position to a second position in an ejecting direction in response to the press button being manipulated, wherein the sensor module is coupled to the plunger body to move from the first position to the second position, integrally with the plunger body.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a sensor receptacle may be provided on one end portion of the plunger body to accommodate the sensor module inserted into the sensor receptacle. A sensor fixing hook may be provided on a peripheral portion of the sensor receptacle. The sensor fixing hook may engage with the sensor module inserted into the sensor receptacle to fix the sensor module. The sensor fixing hook may be configured to be disengaged from the sensor module in response to the plunger body being ejected to the second position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, the sensor fixing hook may be configured to be pivotable about a hinge shaft so that one end portion of the sensor fixing hook is engaged with or disengaged from the sensor module.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, a hook guide may be provided on an inner surface of the main container. The hook guide may be configured to press the sensor fixing hook so that the sensor fixing hook is engaged with the sensor module when the plunger body is in the first position and to release the sensor fixing hook from being pressed so that the sensor fixing hook is disengaged from the sensor module when the plunger body is in the second position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the sensor module may be provided with an engagement recess conforming to the sensor fixing hook, such that the sensor fixing hook is engaged with the engagement recess.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the present disclosure, the sensor applicator assembly is fabricated, with the sensor module being preinstalled in the applicator, so that a user can attach the sensor module to the skin by simply operating the applicator. Additional tasks of the user for attaching the sensor module to the skin can be minimized, thereby allowing the sensor applicator assembly to be more conveniently used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, a battery is provided as a built-in component of the sensor module and the separate transmitter is connected to the sensor module to receive power from the sensor module, so that the transmitter can be used semi-permanently, which is economical. In addition, the sensor module and the applicator are provided to be disposable so as to be used accurately and safely, thereby allowing safe use and convenient maintenance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, at the moment that the sensor module is attached to the human body by the operation of the applicator, the needle is automatically removed. Accordingly, it is possible to rapidly remove the needle without pain without causing the human body to be injured during the removal of the needle, thereby further improving the convenience of use.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, a release paper is removed from the sensor module while a protective cap is being detached, so that the sensor module can be attached to the human body with no other additional tasks, except for the operation of detaching the protective cap.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, since the applicator cannot be reused after having been operated, it is possible to prevent a user from using the applicator improperly, thereby enabling the applicator to be used more safely.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

The sensor applicator assembly <b>1</b> has a structure to be use thereof to be very simple, thereby minimizing additional tasks of a user to use the continuous glucose monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sensor module <b>20</b> is configured to be attachable to a portion of the human body to extract body fluid and periodically measure a blood glucose level, and allows a separate transmitter <b>30</b> to be connected thereto to transmit a glucose measurement result to an external device, such as a mobile device (not shown).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The applicator <b>10</b> is configured such that the sensor module <b>20</b> is fixedly coupled to an inner portion thereof, and operates to eject the sensor module <b>20</b> in response to a user's manipulation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, fabrication and assembly processes are performed, with the sensor module <b>20</b> being preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b>. When the applicator <b>10</b> is operated by the user's manipulation, the sensor module <b>20</b> is moved in an ejecting direction to be attached to the portion of the human body.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">That is, the sensor applicator assembly <b>1</b> according to embodiments of the disclosure is assembled and fabricated in a fabrication process, with the sensor module <b>20</b> being preinstalled in the applicator, such that the sensor module <b>20</b> is attachable to the skin only by the operation of the applicator <b>10</b>. The sensor applicator assembly <b>1</b> is provided to a user in this state. Accordingly, the user can attach the sensor module <b>20</b> to the skin by simply operating the applicator <b>10</b> without an additional operation for attaching the sensor module <b>20</b> to the skin. After the sensor module <b>20</b> is attached to the skin, the separate transmitter <b>30</b> is connected to the sensor module <b>20</b>, so that a glucose measurement result can be periodically output from a terminal of the continuous glucose monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the lifetime of the sensor module <b>20</b> has ended after having been used for about one (1) week while attached to the human body, a new sensor module <b>20</b> must be attached to the human body. Here, the sensor module <b>20</b> and the applicator <b>10</b> are fabricated and used to be disposable, while the transmitter <b>30</b> is continuously used as a separate product. That is, since the sensor module <b>20</b> is distributed as being preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b> and attachable to the human body, an additional operation of, for example, inserting the sensor module <b>20</b> into the applicator <b>10</b> by the user is unnecessary. The user attaches the sensor module <b>20</b> to the body by simply operating the applicator <b>10</b>. After the sensor module <b>20</b> and the applicator <b>10</b> have been used in this manner, the sensor module <b>20</b> and the applicator <b>10</b> cannot be reused. A new sensor module <b>20</b> is attached to the body using a new sensor applicator assembly <b>1</b>. Here, the transmitter <b>30</b> may be configured to be reusable as a separate product instead of being disposable.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a typical continuous glucose monitoring system of the related art, a sensor module separately packed is unpacked and then is accurately inserted into an applicator. After the insertion, the applicator is operated to attach the sensor module to the skin. The operation of accurately insert the sensor module into the applicator is bothering and difficult. Children or older persons may contaminate the sensor module during this operation, thereby lowering the accuracy of measurement, which is problematic.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to embodiments of the disclosure, the sensor module <b>20</b> is preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b> in the fabrication process, so that the applicator <b>10</b> is distributed with the sensor module <b>20</b> preinstalled therein. The user's operations of, for example, unpacking the sensor module <b>20</b> and inserting the sensor module <b>20</b> into the applicator <b>10</b> may be omitted. It is possible to attach the sensor module <b>20</b> to the skin by simply manipulating the applicator <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the usability of the sensor module <b>20</b> can be significantly improved, and in particular, the contamination of the sensor module <b>20</b> or the like can be prevented, thereby improving the accuracy of glucose measurement.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Since the sensor module <b>20</b> is preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b> in the fabrication process as described above, the sensor module <b>20</b> and the applicator <b>10</b> may be provided to be disposable so as not to be reusable. To provide such a disposable structure, the applicator <b>10</b> according to embodiments of the disclosure is configured such that the sensor module <b>20</b> cannot be reinserted into the applicator <b>10</b> after the applicator <b>10</b> is operated once to eject the sensor module <b>20</b> therefrom.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">That is, the applicator <b>10</b> is configured to have one open side, through which the sensor module <b>20</b> is ejected to the outside. The applicator <b>10</b> may be configured such that, once the applicator <b>10</b> has ejected the sensor module <b>20</b> by an initial single operation, another sensor module <b>20</b> is prevented from being inserted into the applicator <b>10</b>, so that the user cannot insert the sensor module <b>20</b> into the applicator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, a separate protective cap <b>200</b> may be detachably coupled to the applicator <b>10</b> to prevent the sensor module <b>20</b>, preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b>, from being exposed externally. The protective cap <b>200</b> may be configured such that the user cannot attach the sensor module <b>20</b> to the human body by operating the applicator <b>10</b> unless the protective cap <b>200</b> is detached.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Here, adhesive tape <b>560</b> is attached to a body contact surface of the sensor module <b>20</b>, such that sensor module <b>20</b> can be attached to the human body. A release paper <b>561</b> is attached to the body contact surface of the adhesive tape <b>560</b> to protect the adhesive tape <b>560</b>. The release paper <b>561</b> of the adhesive tape <b>560</b> may be detached and removed from the adhesive tape <b>560</b> while the protective cap <b>200</b> is being detached from the applicator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the release paper <b>561</b> may be configured such that one portion thereof is bonded to the protective cap <b>200</b>. Thus, when the user detaches the protective cap <b>200</b> from the applicator <b>10</b>, the release paper <b>561</b> can be detached and removed from the adhesive tape <b>560</b> along with the protective cap <b>200</b>. Accordingly, when the user detaches the protective cap <b>200</b>, the release paper <b>561</b> is removed from the adhesive tape <b>560</b>. In this state, it is possible to attach the sensor module <b>20</b> to the human body by operating the applicator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, the applicator <b>10</b> may be configured such that, in a state in which the sensor module <b>20</b> is preinstalled in the applicator <b>10</b>, the sensor module <b>20</b> is fixedly coupled to the applicator <b>10</b>, and in a state in which the sensor module <b>20</b> is ejected (i.e. is moved outwardly by ejection), the sensor module <b>20</b> is decoupled from the applicator <b>10</b>. Thus, in a state in which the sensor module <b>20</b> is inserted into and coupled to the applicator <b>10</b>, the sensor module <b>20</b> remains in a fixed position. In a state in which the sensor module <b>20</b> is ejected to be attached to the skin by operating the applicator <b>10</b>, the sensor module <b>20</b> is decoupled from the applicator <b>10</b>.

The concave surface <b>142</b> is configured to release the sensor fixing hooks <b>330</b> from the pressed state when the sensor fixing hooks <b>330</b> have moved to the second position together with the plunger body <b>300</b>. That is, the protruding surface <b>141</b> protrudes relatively inward to press the sensor fixing hooks <b>330</b> during the movement along a path between the first position and directly before the second position.
