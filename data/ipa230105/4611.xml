For example, an electronic moisture sensor <b>46</b> and an electronic temperature sensor <b>48</b> provide their respective sensory data <b>28</b> to help collectively determine when irrigation should occur. The electronic temperature sensor <b>26</b> has a transducer <b>50</b> that generates an output signal in response to an ambient temperature. The electronic temperature sensor <b>26</b> wirelessly sends its sensory data <b>28</b> into the communications network <b>34</b> for receipt by the electronic flow meter <b>40</b>, the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b>, and/or the electronic moisture sensor <b>26</b>. Similarly, the electronic moisture sensor <b>26</b> may, likewise, wirelessly send its output signal to the electronic flow meter <b>40</b>, the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b>, and/or the electronic temperature sensor <b>26</b>. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus intelligently collaborate to irrigate a lawn and plants.

The allegiancy server <b>72</b> stores the electronic allegiancy database <b>70</b>, thus providing a central repository for the different allegiancies <b>60</b>. Exemplary embodiments may thus query the electronic allegiancy database <b>70</b> for a query or search parameter and retrieve the corresponding allegiance <b>60</b>.

The colony <b>20</b> of sensors identifies the passing smartphone <b>64</b>, queries the electronic allegiancy database <b>70</b>, and retrieves the corresponding allegiance <b>60</b>. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus dynamically synchronize and personalize to the traits, strengths, or even fears associated with the passing smartphone <b>64</b>.

Each sensor <b>26</b> in the colony <b>20</b> of sensors collaborates with its sensory mates to develop a high level knowledge of a user's desires, based on the allegiance <b>60</b>. As any sensor <b>26</b> in the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may instantaneously detect the user (via her mobile device <b>62</b>), the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may synchronize to the electronic allegiancy database <b>70</b> and execute a personalized service tailored to the individual user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> further illustrates the allegiance <b>60</b>. Here the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may include a position sensor <b>80</b> and a global positioning system (&#x201c;GPS&#x201d;) receiver <b>82</b>. The position sensor <b>80</b> may sense or monitor one, two, or three dimensional angular and/or radial orientation and generate an output signal.

The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus receive an output signal produced or generated by the position sensor <b>26</b> and/or by the GPS receiver <b>82</b>. The position sensor <b>26</b> may utilize any physical, mechanical, electrical, and/or chemical means to determine the position <b>84</b> associated with any sensor <b>26</b> of the colony <b>20</b> of sensors.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates positional allegiance <b>60</b>. Here the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may determine its allegiance <b>60</b> based on the position <b>84</b> determined from the output signal generated by the position sensor (illustrated as reference numeral <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). For simplicity, assume the position sensor <b>80</b> determines an angular orientation <b>90</b> associated with the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b>, based on its discharge stream <b>92</b>. As the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> rotates or spins, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may switch its allegiance <b>60</b>, based on the angular orientation <b>90</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates, also assume the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> may be installed at or near a corner intersection <b>93</b> of four (4) different yards (illustrated, respectively, as reference numerals <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, and <b>100</b>). As the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> rotates, its discharge stream <b>92</b> may water or irrigate one (1) of the four different yards. That is, from zero (0) degrees to ninety (90) degrees, the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> irrigates &#x201c;Yard <b>1</b>&#x201d; (illustrated as reference numeral <b>94</b>). The electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> irrigates &#x201c;Yard <b>2</b>&#x201d; (illustrated as reference numeral <b>96</b>) from 90 degrees to 180 degrees, &#x201c;Yard <b>3</b>&#x201d; (illustrated as reference numeral <b>989</b>) from 180 degrees to 270 degrees, and &#x201c;Yard <b>4</b>&#x201d; (illustrated as reference numeral <b>100</b>) from 270 degrees back to zero degrees. The position sensor <b>80</b> measures or determines the angular orientation <b>90</b> associated with the discharge stream <b>92</b>. So, as the electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> irrigates one of the different yards, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may change its ownership allegiance <b>60</b> based on the angular orientation <b>90</b> of the discharge stream <b>92</b> with respect to zero degrees. That is, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may query the electronic allegiancy database (illustrated as reference numeral <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>) for the angular orientation <b>90</b> and retrieve the corresponding allegiance <b>60</b>. So, when watering &#x201c;Yard <b>1</b>,&#x201d; the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may adopt the allegiance <b>60</b> associated with the owner of &#x201c;Yard <b>1</b>&#x201d; and discharge according to the needs established for that quadrant or yard. However, when the angular orientation <b>90</b> causes a change in the allegiance <b>60</b>, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may change its allegiance <b>60</b> and irrigate to the different owner's desires. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may monitor the water consumption associated each different owner (using the electronic flow meter <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), perhaps also based on the angular orientation <b>90</b>. The single, shared electronic water sprinkler <b>42</b> may thus irrigate multiple properties, thus reducing the costs of installation and service. Moreover, the electronic flow meter <b>40</b> may allocate consumption to each different owner, thus fairly tracking each owner's water usage.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> also illustrates positional allegiance <b>60</b>. Here the colony <b>20</b> of sensors provides shared security services to multiple homes. That is, suppose the colony <b>20</b> of sensors includes a single camera <b>110</b> that monitors the entry doors of different homes in a cul de sac. The camera <b>110</b> has a motorized base <b>112</b> that allows the camera <b>110</b> to change its field <b>114</b> of view. As the camera <b>110</b> moves or sweeps, the camera <b>110</b> generates video data of the different homes (illustrated, respectively, as reference numerals <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b>). The position sensor <b>26</b> again determines the radial or angular orientation <b>90</b> associated with the motorized base <b>112</b> and/or the corresponding field <b>114</b> of view. As the camera <b>110</b> aims its lens, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may change its allegiance <b>60</b> based on the orientation <b>90</b> with respect to a nominal or reference position (such as zero degrees). Different homes, in other words, may be associated with different orientations <b>90</b> of the camera <b>110</b>. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus again query the electronic allegiancy database (illustrated as reference numeral <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>) for the orientation <b>90</b> and retrieve the corresponding allegiance <b>60</b>. As the camera <b>110</b> rotates and changes its field <b>114</b> of view, exemplary embodiments may adopt the allegiance <b>60</b> associated with the corresponding orientation <b>90</b>. The single, shared camera <b>110</b> may thus monitor multiple homes, thus reducing the costs of installation and service.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> further illustrates security allegiance <b>60</b>. Here the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may provide additional, shared security services to the different homes (illustrated, respectively, as reference numerals <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b>) in the cul de sac. For example, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may also include a directional microphone <b>130</b>. If the directional microphone <b>130</b> shares the motorized base <b>112</b>, then the directional microphone <b>130</b> may also be aimed or trained to each individual home in the cul de sac. As the motorized base <b>112</b> turns or rotates, the directional microphone <b>130</b> sweeps the homes and generates audible data along a corresponding audible field <b>132</b>. Exemplary embodiments may thus generate video data (output by the video camera <b>110</b>) and audio data (output by the microphone <b>130</b>) that corresponds to the radial or angular orientation <b>90</b> associated with the motorized base <b>112</b>. Exemplary embodiments may thus attribute the video data and the audio data to the positional allegiance <b>60</b> based on the orientation <b>90</b>. Different homes, in other words, may be associated with different orientations <b>90</b> associated with the colony <b>20</b> of sensors. Once the orientation <b>90</b> is determined (perhaps with respect to a reference position zero or final degrees), the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus again query the electronic allegiancy database (illustrated as reference numeral <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>) for the orientation <b>90</b> and retrieve the corresponding allegiance <b>60</b>. The shared colony <b>20</b> of sensors thus monitors multiple properties, thus reducing the costs of installation and service.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Exemplary embodiments thus present an elegant and cost-effective solution. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors collaborates to provide security and automation services. However, the colony <b>20</b> of sensors may also dynamically switch its allegiance <b>60</b> to service different users. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors, in simple words, may be transferrable. Any sensory functions may thus be transiently allied to different users, based on wireless detection and/or the orientation <b>90</b>. Whenever the colony <b>20</b> of sensors changes its allegiance <b>60</b>, billing mechanisms may accurately monitor the sensory functions to ensure fair billing structures according to the allegiance <b>60</b>.

The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus be installed and rented according to the allegiance <b>60</b>. That is, a billing structure may be developed based on the sensory services, according to the allegiance <b>60</b>. Even micro-payments may be easily implemented in relation to the allegiance <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may be easily adapted. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may be integrated with the single motorized base <b>112</b>.

Different allegiance <b>60</b> may also be assumed, based on the unique identity of a passing mobile device and/or the different orientations <b>90</b> of the motorized base <b>112</b>. The colony <b>20</b> of sensors may thus be installed or mounted as a single unit to a mounting pole to provide shared surveillance.
