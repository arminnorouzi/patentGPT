A multi-mode user equipment (UE) can support several RATs in one device such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, global system for mobiles (GSM), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), or long-term evolution (LTE). In addition, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has developed a new RAT known as fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) RAT. A multi-mode UE supporting several RATs can provide flexibility and conveniences to the users. However, it is desired to improve the operational efficiency for a multi-mode UE.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some aspects of this disclosure relate to apparatuses and methods for implementing mechanisms to support communication using multiple radio access technology (RAT) for a multi-mode user equipment (UE). A multi-mode UE can wirelessly communicate using at least a first RAT and a second RAT, such as a RAT different from a fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) RAT and the NR RAT. The NR RAT can provide more services to the user, but NR networks may not be available all of the time and in all situations. In some systems, 5G NR are deployed using non-standalone (NSA) option. In a NSA setup, the NR radio links are anchored onto at least one long-term evolution (LTE) carrier with signaling radio bearer (SRB) being setup on LTE. The SRB is used to transfer the control information to configure the NR RAT for NSA operations performed by the UE. Efficient setup of the NR RAT is desired.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some aspects of this disclosure relate to a UE. The UE can include a transceiver, a memory, and a processor communicatively coupled to the transceiver and the memory. The transceiver can be configured to enable wireless communication with a first base station as a primary node using a first RAT and with a second base station as a secondary node using a second RAT. The first RAT can include universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), global system for mobiles (GSM) edge radio access network (GERAN), or long-term evolution (LTE) evolved utran (E-UTRAN), while the second RAT can include NR next generation radio access network (NG-RAN). The first base station can include an evolved NodeB (eNB), and the second base station can include a next generation NodeB (gNB). There can be other kinds of first RAT and second RAT for some other embodiments. In some examples, the UE can have NR Dual Connectivity using a NR link in Master Cell Group (MCG) and a second NR link in Secondary Cell Group (SCG). Furthermore, the NR MCG can operate in frequency range 1 (FR1) (sub 6 GHz) and NR SCG can operate in mmWave (&#x3e;24 GHz). The descriptions provided herein can be equally applicable to the UE having NR dual connectivity, or any other first RAT and second RAT.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some aspects, the memory can be configured to store first configuration information for the UE to communicate with the second base station using the second RAT. In some embodiments, the first configuration information can include data radio bearer configuration information, physical layer (PHY) configuration information, measurement configuration information, a physical cell identifier (PCI), or a UE identifier. In some embodiments, the first configuration information can include default configuration information received in a radio resource control (RRC) message from the first base station using the first RAT. The default configuration information can include shared parameters for the UE to communicate across multiple base stations including the second base station using the second RAT. In some embodiments, the UE can further include a timer, where the first configuration information stored in the memory becomes invalid based on expiration of the timer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some aspects, the processor of the UE can be configured to receive, from the first base station using the first RAT, a downlink message to enable a communication link between the UE and the second base station via the second RAT. The downlink message can include second configuration information for the UE to communicate with the second base station via the second RAT. The downlink message can be received when the UE enters a cell managed by the second base station, the UE is handed over from an other cell to the cell managed by the second base station, or the UE re-enters the cell managed by the second base station after leaving the cell. In some embodiments, the downlink message can include a RRC message for the first RAT, a medium access control (MAC)-control element (MAC-CE) for the first RAT, or a downlink control information (DCI) for the first RAT.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some aspects, the processor can be further configured to establish the communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT based on a link configuration obtained from the first configuration information and the second configuration information. In some embodiments, the link configuration can be based entirely on the first configuration information. The first configuration information can include a link configuration for a previous communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT that is stored in the memory when the previous communication link is released. In detail, the processor can be further configured to receive a downlink release message using the first RAT from the first base station to release the previous communication link using the second RAT; store in the memory the link configuration for the previous communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT; and release the previous communication link between the UE and the second base station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some aspects, the processor can be further configured to perform a measurement to detect whether a service in the second RAT is available to the UE; generate, based on the performed measurement, a measurement report including an indication that the first configuration information is stored in the UE; and send the measurement report to the first base station. The communication link between the UE and the second base station in the second RAT can be established based on the measurement report.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some aspects of this disclosure relate to a method performed by a UE. The method includes receiving, from a first base station using a first radio access technology (RAT), first configuration information for the UE to communicate with a second base station via a second RAT; and receiving, from the first base station using the first RAT, a downlink message to enable a communication link between the UE and the second base station via the second RAT. The downlink message includes second configuration information for the UE to communicate with the second base station via the second RAT. The method further includes establishing the communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT based on a link configuration obtained from the first configuration information and the second configuration information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some aspects of this disclosure relate to non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions. When executed by a processor of a UE, the instructions stored in the non-transitory computer-readable medium cause the UE to perform various operations. The operations include receiving, from a first base station using a first RAT, first configuration information for the UE to communicate with a second base station via a second RAT; and receiving, from the first base station using the first RAT, a downlink message to enable a communication link between the UE and the second base station via the second RAT. The downlink message includes second configuration information for the UE to communicate with the second base station via the second RAT. The operations further include establishing the communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT based on a link configuration obtained from the first configuration information and the second configuration information.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This Summary is provided merely for purposes of illustrating some aspects to provide an understanding of the subject matter described herein.

In the drawings, generally, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally, generally, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A multi-mode user equipment (UE) can wirelessly communicate using at least a first radio access technology (RAT) and a second RAT, such as a RAT different from a fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) RAT and the NR RAT. In some systems, the 5G NR RAT are deployed using non-standalone (NSA) option where the NR radio links are anchored onto at least one long-term evolution (LTE) carrier. Such a network or system can be referred to as having LTE evolved NodeB (eNB)-5G next generation NodeB (gNB) dual connectivity (EN-DC), where the UE operates in the EN-DC mode. In addition, the UE can operate in LTE standalone (SA) mode without using the NR RAT. In the EN-DC mode, signaling radio bearer (SRB) can be setup on LTE to transfer control information to configure the UE for the NR RAT operations. Efficient setup of the NR RAT is desired. LTE-NR interworking (EN-DC) in NSA is only one possibility for a multi-mode UE. Techniques disclosed herein can be applicable to other RATs as well.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The setup, activation, or addition of NR branch or service can usually be based on the UE' s event measurement report message to a base station, e.g., B1 event measurement report message. B1 event measurement report message can be used by the UE to report the presence of NR coverage, and NR neighbor cell measurements. The network can use B1 event measurement report message as a trigger to setup the NR branch or service. In detail, the base station can send a LTE radio resource control (RRC) connection reconfiguration message to the UE to provide the full configuration of the NR cell and the data radio bearer so that user data can be transferred over the NR link. As a result, in a NSA system, the activation and deactivation of the NR service or branch can be controlled by the network and signaled to UE using LTE RRC connection reconfiguration messages over the LTE RAT. Such LTE RRC connection reconfiguration messages are usually long RRC over the air (OTA) messages causing a lot of data traffic.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, when the UE goes out of a NR coverage area and needs to switch to LTE only connection, control signaling between the UE and the network is required. The UE can report the NR radio link failure status to the base station, and the base station or the network can reconfigure the UE for LTE only connection. The NR link can be released and data radio bearer can be reconfigured for LTE only operations. According to the solution defined by 3GPP standard, when the NR link is released, the UE deletes the complete NR configuration.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the NR branch addition or removal can become frequent in daily usage. For example, when a user wonders around a building, or walks between spots with good and bad coverage, the NR branch addition or removal can happen frequently. Similarly, when a UE moves in slow traffic with blocking line-of-sight (LOS), or the UE experiences bursty data, the NR branch addition or removal can happen frequently as well. Frequent NR secondary cell group (SCG) setup and release procedures can cause high signaling load in LTE networks jamming LTE devices. Signaling between the UE and the network and between network notes can also cause delays for setting up the NR branch. In such cases, the signaling traffic from 5G users can cause a heavy load on the control channels and may jam the anchor LTE network. In addition to the signaling between UE and network, each setup or release of the NR RAT can also require signaling and handshaking between master LTE network node (MN) and slave NR network node (SN).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, to avoid congestion in the anchor LTE network with RRC reconfiguration messages from 5G NSA users, RRC reconfiguration messages to activate or deactivate the NR branch are redesigned so that the message size is reduced if cannot be removed completely. NR configuration content received from the base station may be the same or almost the same in a certain situations. When the UE stays in the same LTE anchor cell and NR cell, the configuration for the NR cell can be identical for each setup or release of the NR branch, e.g., SCG addition and SCG release. Hence, it may not be needed to send a large amount of signaling data to carry the same content for the NR configuration.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In embodiments, the UE can store first configuration information for the UE to communicate with the second base station using the second RAT. The first configuration information can be default configuration information including shared parameters for the UE to communicate across multiple base stations using the second RAT. The default configuration information can be received in a RRC message from the first base station using the first RAT. Additionally and alternatively, the first configuration information can include a link configuration for a previous communication link between the UE and the base station using the second RAT. The UE can also receive some additional configuration information from the first base station using the first RAT. The UE can then determine a link configuration obtained from the first configuration information and the additional configuration information. The UE can establish the communication link between the UE and the second base station using the second RAT based on the link configuration. The additional configuration information from the first base station can be of smaller size since the additional configuration information only needs to carry the difference between the intended configuration and the default configuration or between the intended configuration and the link configuration for a previous communication link.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In embodiments, a UE can autonomously maintain the used NR configuration context when releasing the NR link and reuse it whenever adding the NR link again. In addition, a UE can receive default NR configuration that can be reused at each and every NR link addition. Network may only signal configuration parts that have changed, such as a different Physical Cell ID (PCI) in case a different NR cell is accessed. Furthermore, the base station or the network can use medium access control (MAC) Control Element signaling or downlink control information (DCI) signaling to quickly enable or disable the 5G link (based on preserved NR context of NR default configuration) to avoid costly RRC signaling. Moreover, the UE can use enhancement of LTE measurement report message to signal that UE has some NR configuration context preserved or an NR default configuration stored that can be reused.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless system <b>100</b> including a UE, e.g., UE <b>101</b>, configured to communicate with a first base station using a first RAT and with a second base station using a second RAT, according to some aspects of the disclosure.

Multiple NR measurement configurations can be signaled once in earlier RRC messages (when UE first camped/handover to the current cell), but activate/deactivate using MAC-CE/DCI or higher layer signaling. UE only measure/report based on activated measurement/report configurations.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0090">Data Radio Bearer setups/configuration on different RATs can be designed similarly with two configurations signaled to UE using a single RRC Reconfiguration message. At any time, only one RAT, either LTE or NR, has data bearers active, while the other RAT has data bearers in configured but not activated state or mode. When NR link is active the user data will make use of NR Data Radio Bearer (alternatively also a split radio bearer can be used in this case transferring the user data using NR and LTE data path). When the NR link is deactivated all user data will flow over the LTE Data Radio Bearer configured. MAC Control Element Signaling can be used to enable one and disable the other configuration when NR branch is added or removed. Multiple radio bearer can be configured at the same time. Embodiments herein can employ enhanced RRC signaling to carry the information which Radio Bearer Configuration is activated and which Radio Bearer Configuration is deactivated. MAC-CE signaling is enhanced to carry the information which Radio Bearer can be deactivated and which Radio Bearer can be activated.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">When UE moves out of NR coverage and does not return after some time, it is not useful to maintain the NR configuration context forever. Hence, the link configuration for a previous communication link can be maintained for a certain time, such as within 10 or 20 seconds. A timer can be used to monitor the validity of the NR Context. The network can keep a timer for NR link deactivation to maintain the RRC Reconfiguration parameters. The UE can maintain the NR Context only for a certain duration until it deletes the old context. The duration can be network configured. Upon timer expiration, the UE and network can delete the preserved NR Configuration context. Accordingly, any subsequent NR link addition would then require a full configuration.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">At <b>1001</b>, UE <b>101</b> is in the LTE SA mode.
