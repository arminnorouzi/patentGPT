level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086656, filed on Jul. 1, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an air conditioning apparatus for electric motor vehicles, which improves heating efficiency, and to an air conditioning system for electric motor vehicles using the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electric motor vehicles are driven using a motor configured to receive electricity from a battery and then to output driving power. Therefore, electric motor vehicles have advantages, such as no carbon dioxide emissions, very small noises and high motor energy efficiency compared to engine energy efficiency, and are thus being spotlighted as eco-friendly vehicles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Technology relating to battery modules is used as core technology in implementation of such electric motor vehicles, and research on the weight reduction, miniaturization and reduced charging time of batteries is vigorously underway now. Battery modules may maintain optimum performance and long lifespan only when the battery modules are used in the optimum temperature environment. However, we have discovered that it is difficult to use the battery modules in the optimum temperature environment due to heat generated from the battery modules during driving and changes in outdoor temperature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, because there is no waste heat occurring when fuel is combusted in a separate engine, such as an internal combustion engine, an electric motor vehicle performs heating of the interior of the vehicle using an electric heating device, and requires warm-up so as to improve charge and discharge performance of a battery in cold weather and thus uses a separate coolant-type electric heater. That is, technology that operates a cooling and heating system configured to adjust the temperature of a battery module so as to maintain the optimum temperature environment of the battery module is used separately from a cooling and heating system configured to condition air of the interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, such an air conditioning system configured to condition air of the interior of the vehicle employs heat pump technology that minimizes consumption of heating energy so as to increase the driving range of the vehicle, thereby being capable of minimizing energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Particularly, in order to apply the heat pump technology, an indoor condenser and an electric heater are provided in the air conditioning system, but heating efficiency may be reduced using only the indoor condenser or the electric heater.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, in order to increase heating performance, the temperature of a refrigerant circulated to the indoor condenser is increased by increasing the driving amount of a compressor or the heating value of the electric heater is increased, but in this case, energy efficiency may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above information disclosed in the Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the present disclosure and should not be interpreted as conventional technology that is already known to those having ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012"
