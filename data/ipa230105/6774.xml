level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sidelink (SL) communication is a communication scheme in which a direct link is established between User Equipments (UEs) and the UEs exchange voice and data directly with each other without intervention of an evolved Node B (eNB). SL communication is under consideration as a solution to the overhead of an eNB caused by rapidly increasing data traffic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to a communication technology through which a vehicle exchanges information with another vehicle, a pedestrian, an object having an infrastructure (or infra) established therein, and so on. The V2X may be divided into 4 types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P). The V2X communication may be provided via a PC5 interface and/or Uu interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a wider range of communication devices require larger communication capacities, the need for mobile broadband communication that is more enhanced than the existing Radio Access Technology (RAT) is rising. Accordingly, discussions are made on services and user equipment (UE) that are sensitive to reliability and latency. And, a next generation radio access technology that is based on the enhanced mobile broadband communication, massive Machine Type Communication (MTC), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and so on, may be referred to as a new radio access technology (RAT) or new radio (NR). Herein, the NR may also support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing for describing V2X communication based on NR, compared to V2X communication based on RAT used before NR. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding V2X communication, a scheme of providing a safety service, based on a V2X message such as Basic Safety Message (BSM), Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM), and Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) is focused in the discussion on the RAT used before the NR. The V2X message may include position information, dynamic information, attribute information, or the like. For example, a UE may transmit a periodic message type CAM and/or an event triggered message type DENM to another UE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the CAM may include dynamic state information of the vehicle such as direction and speed, static data of the vehicle such as a size, and basic vehicle information such as an exterior illumination state, route details, or the like. For example, the UE may broadcast the CAM, and latency of the CAM may be less than 100 ms. For example, the UE may generate the DENM and transmit it to another UE in an unexpected situation such as a vehicle breakdown, accident, or the like. For example, all vehicles within a transmission range of the UE may receive the CAM and/or the DENM. In this case, the DENM may have a higher priority than the CAM.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereafter, regarding V2X communication, various V2X scenarios are proposed in NR. For example, the various V2X scenarios may include vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, based on the vehicle platooning, vehicles may move together by dynamically forming a group. For example, in order to perform platoon operations based on the vehicle platooning, the vehicles belonging to the group may receive periodic data from a leading vehicle. For example, the vehicles belonging to the group may decrease or increase an interval between the vehicles by using the periodic data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, based on the advanced driving, the vehicle may be semi-automated or fully automated. For example, each vehicle may adjust trajectories or maneuvers, based on data obtained from a local sensor of a proximity vehicle and/or a proximity logical entity. In addition, for example, each vehicle may share driving intention with proximity vehicles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, based on the extended sensors, raw data, processed data, or live video data obtained through the local sensors may be exchanged between a vehicle, a logical entity, a UE of pedestrians, and/or a V2X application server. Therefore, for example, the vehicle may recognize a more improved environment than an environment in which a self-sensor is used for detection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, based on the remote driving, for a person who cannot drive or a remote vehicle in a dangerous environment, a remote driver or a V2X application may operate or control the remote vehicle. For example, if a route is predictable such as public transportation, cloud computing based driving may be used for the operation or control of the remote vehicle. In addition, for example, an access for a cloud-based back-end service platform may be considered for the remote driving.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, a scheme of specifying service requirements for various V2X scenarios such as vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like is discussed in NR-based V2X communication.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Objects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Meanwhile, if a MODE 1 TX UE does not transmit a PSSCH and/or a PSCCH to an RX UE, there may be an ambiguous problem of which information the MODE 1 TX UE should report to a base station through a (pre-configured) PUCCH resource. Hereinafter, in order to solve the above problem, a method for determining, by the MODE 1 TX UE, information transmitted to the base station through a PUCCH resource and an apparatus supporting the same are proposed.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, a method for performing wireless communication by a first device is provided.

The first device may comprise: one or more memories storing instructions; one or more transceivers; and one or more processors connected to the one or more memories and the one or more transceivers. For example, the one or more processors may execute the instructions to: receive, from a base station, information related to a sidelink (SL) bandwidth part (BWP); receive, from the base station,

In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the L1 layer may imply a physical layer. In addition, for example, the L2 layer may imply at least one of a MAC layer, an RLC layer, a PDCP layer, and an SDAP layer. In addition, for example, the L3 layer may imply an RRC layer.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">Hereinafter, a bandwidth part (BWP) and a carrier will be described.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122">The BWP may be a set of consecutive physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a given numerology.

For example, a network/BS may inform the UE of bandwidth adjustment. For example, the UE receive information/configuration for bandwidth adjustment from the network/BS. In this case, the UE may perform bandwidth adjustment based on the received information/configuration. For example, the bandwidth adjustment may include an increase/decrease of the bandwidth, a position change of the bandwidth, or a change in subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124">For example, the bandwidth may be decreased during a period in which activity is low to save power. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in a frequency domain. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in the frequency domain to increase scheduling flexibility. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed to allow a different service. A subset of a total cell bandwidth of a cell may be called a bandwidth part (BWP). The BA may be performed when the BS/network configures the BWP to the UE and the BS/network informs the UE of the BWP currently in an active state among the configured BWPs.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">For example, the BWP may be at least any one of an active BWP, an initial BWP, and/or a default BWP. For example, the UE may not monitor downlink radio link quality in a DL BWP other than an active DL BWP on a primary cell (PCell). For example, the UE may not receive PDCCH, physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), or channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS) (excluding RRM) outside the active DL BWP. For example, the UE may not trigger a channel state information (CSI) report for the inactive DL BWP. For example, the UE may not transmit physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) or physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) outside an active UL BWP. For example, in a downlink case, the initial BWP may be given as a consecutive RB set for a remaining minimum system information (RMSI) control resource set (CORESET) (configured by physical broadcast channel (PBCH)). For example, in an uplink case, the initial BWP may be given by system information block (SIB) for a random access procedure. For example, the default BWP may be configured by a higher layer. For example, an initial value of the default BWP may be an initial DL BWP. For energy saving, if the UE fails to detect downlink control information (DCI) during a specific period, the UE may switch the active BWP of the UE to the default BWP.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0126">Meanwhile, the BWP may be defined for SL. The same SL BWP may be used in transmission and reception. For example, a transmitting UE may transmit an SL channel or an SL signal on a specific BWP, and a receiving UE may receive the SL channel or the SL signal on the specific BWP. In a licensed carrier, the SL BWP may be defined separately from a Uu BWP, and the SL BWP may have configuration signaling separate from the Uu BWP. For example, the UE may receive a configuration for the SL BWP from the BS/network. The SL BWP may be (pre-)configured in a carrier with respect to an out-of-coverage NR V2X UE and an RRC_IDLE UE.

For example, length-127 M-sequences may be used for the S-PSS, and length-127 gold sequences may be used for the S-SSS.

For example, the UE may use the S-PSS and the S-SSS for acquisition of detailed synchronization and for detection of a synchronization signal ID.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0134">A physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) may be a (broadcast) channel for transmitting default (system) information which must be first known by the UE before SL signal transmission/reception.

For example, the S-SSB may have a bandwidth of 11 resource blocks (RBs). For example, the PSBCH may exist across 11 RBs. In addition, a frequency position of the S-SSB may be (pre-)configured.

In the HARQ scheme, it is determined whether an unrecoverable error is included in data received by a physical layer, and retransmission is requested upon detecting the error, thereby improving performance.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0151">In case of SL unicast and groupcast, HARQ feedback and HARQ combining in the physical layer may be supported. For example, when a receiving UE operates in a resource allocation mode 1 or 2, the receiving UE may receive the PSSCH from a transmitting UE, and the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE by using a sidelink feedback control information (SFCI) format through a physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0152">For example, the SL HARQ feedback may be enabled for unicast. In this case, in a non-code block group (non-CBG) operation, if the receiving UE decodes a PSCCH of which a target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes a transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may generate HARQ-ACK. In addition, the receiving UE may transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE. Otherwise, if the receiving UE cannot successfully decode the transport block after decoding the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, the receiving UE may generate the HARQ-NACK. In addition, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0153">For example, the SL HARQ feedback may be enabled for groupcast. For example, in the non-CBG operation, two HARQ feedback options may be supported for groupcast.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">(1) Groupcast option 1: After the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, if the receiving UE fails in decoding of a transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE through a PSFCH. Otherwise, if the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may not transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0155">(2) Groupcast option 2: After the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, if the receiving UE fails in decoding of the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE through the PSFCH. In addition, if the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE through the PSFCH.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0156">For example, if the groupcast option 1 is used in the SL HARQ feedback, all UEs performing groupcast communication may share a PSFCH resource. For example, UEs belonging to the same group may transmit HARQ feedback by using the same PSFCH resource.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0157">For example, if the groupcast option 2 is used in the SL HARQ feedback, each UE performing groupcast communication may use a different PSFCH resource for HARQ feedback transmission. For example, UEs belonging to the same group may transmit HARQ feedback by using different PSFCH resources.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0158">For example, when the SL HARQ feedback is enabled for groupcast, the receiving UE may determine whether to transmit the HARQ feedback to the transmitting UE based on a transmission-reception (TX-RX) distance and/or reference signals received power (RSRP).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">For example, in the groupcast option 1, in case of the TX-RX distance-based HARQ feedback, if the TX-RX distance is less than or equal to a communication range requirement, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE. Otherwise, if the TX-RX distance is greater than the communication range requirement, the receiving UE may not transmit the HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE. For example, the transmitting UE may inform the receiving UE of a location of the transmitting UE through SCI related to the PSSCH. For example, the SCI related to the PSSCH may be second SCI. For example, the receiving UE may estimate or obtain the TX-RX distance based on a location of the receiving UE and the location of the transmitting UE. For example, the receiving UE may decode the SCI related to the PSSCH and thus may know the communication range requirement used in the PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">For example, in case of the resource allocation mode 1, a time (offset) between the PSFCH and the PSSCH may be configured or pre-configured. In case of unicast and groupcast, if retransmission is necessary on SL, this may be indicated to a BS by an in-coverage UE which uses the PUCCH. The transmitting UE may transmit an indication to a serving BS of the transmitting UE in a form of scheduling request (SR)/buffer status report (BSR), not a form of HARQ ACK/NACK. In addition, even if the BS does not receive the indication, the BS may schedule an SL retransmission resource to the UE. For example, in case of the resource allocation mode 2, a time (offset) between the PSFCH and the PSSCH may be configured or pre-configured.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">For example, from a perspective of UE transmission in a carrier, TDM between the PSCCH/PSSCH and the PSFCH may be allowed for a PSFCH format for SL in a slot. For example, a sequence-based PSFCH format having a single symbol may be supported. Herein, the single symbol may not an AGC duration. For example, the sequence-based PSFCH format may be applied to unicast and groupcast.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">For example, in a slot related to a resource pool, a PSFCH resource may be configured periodically as N slot durations, or may be pre-configured. For example, N may be configured as one or more values greater than or equal to 1. For example, N may be 1, 2, or 4. For example, HARQ feedback for transmission in a specific resource pool may be transmitted only through a PSFCH on the specific resource pool.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0163">For example, if the transmitting UE transmits the PSSCH to the receiving UE across a slot #X to a slot #N, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE in a slot #(N+A). For example, the slot #(N+A) may include a PSFCH resource. Herein, for example, A may be a smallest integer greater than or equal to K. For example, K may be the number of logical slots. In this case, K may be the number of slots in a resource pool. Alternatively, for example, K may be the number of physical slots. In this case, K may be the number of slots inside or outside the resource pool.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0164">For example, if the receiving UE transmits HARQ feedback on a PSFCH resource in response to one PSSCH transmitted by the transmitting UE to the receiving UE, the receiving UE may determine a frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource based on an implicit mechanism in a configured resource pool. For example, the receiving UE may determine the frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource, based on at least one of a slot index related to PSCCH/PSSCH/PSFCH, a sub-channel related to PSCCH/PSSCH, and/or an identifier for identifying each receiving UE in a group for HARQ feedback based on the groupcast option 2. Additionally/alternatively, for example, the receiving UE may determine the frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource, based on at least one of SL RSRP, SINR, L1 source ID, and/or location information.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0165">For example, if HARQ feedback transmission through the PSFCH of the UE and HARQ feedback reception through the PSFCH overlap, the UE may select any one of HARQ feedback transmission through the PSFCH and HARQ feedback reception through the PSFCH based on a priority rule. For example, the priority rule may be based on at least priority indication of the related PSCCH/PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0166">For example, if HARQ feedback transmission of a UE through a PSFCH for a plurality of UEs overlaps, the UE may select specific HARQ feedback transmission based on the priority rule. For example, the priority rule may be based on at least priority indication of the related PSCCH/PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0167">Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, for example, a transmitting UE (TX UE) may be a UE which transmits data to a (target) receiving UE (RX UE). For example, the TX UE may be a UE which performs PSCCH transmission and/or PSSCH transmission. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits SL CSI-RS(s) and/or a SL CSI report request indicator to the (target) RX UE. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits (pre-defined) reference signal(s) (e.g., PSSCH demodulation reference signal (DM-RS)) and/or a SL (L1) RSRP report request indicator, to the (target) RX UE, to be used for SL (L1) RSRP measurement. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits a (control) channel (e.g., PSCCH, PSSCH, etc.) and/or reference signal(s) on the (control) channel (e.g., DM-RS, CSI-RS, etc.), to be used for a SL RLM operation and/or a SL RLF operation of the (target) RX UE.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0168">Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, for example, a receiving UE (RX UE) may be a UE which transmits SL HARQ feedback to a transmitting UE (TX UE) based on whether decoding of data received from the TX UE is successful and/or whether detection/decoding of a PSCCH (related to PSSCH scheduling) transmitted by the TX UE is successful. For example, the RX UE may be a UE which performs SL CSI transmission to the TX UE based on SL CSI-RS(s) and/or a SL CSI report request indicator received from the TX UE. For example, the RX UE is a UE which transmits a SL (L1) RSRP measurement value, to the TX UE, measured based on (pre-defined) reference signal(s) and/or a SL (L1) RSRP report request indicator received from the TX UE. For example, the RX UE may be a UE which transmits data of the RX UE to the TX UE.
