They allow generating or correcting in a dynamic and controlled manner optical aberrations in an incident wavefront. Multiple applications exist for such adaptive optical systems. It is known in particular to use, in order to correct a disturbed wavefront, a closed-loop adaptive optical system that usually includes a wavefront analyser, a calculator and a wavefront corrector that is for example in the form of a deformable mirror. Such a closed-loop adaptive optical system is for example particularly useful in astronomy, to compensate for the disturbances that the light has undergone, in particular when passing through the atmosphere. In this particular example, the deformable mirror is subjected to a light flow coming from a telescope pointed at the area to be observed (which includes for example a star). The incident light flow reflects on the deformable mirror and is sent back, as a reflected light flow, to a splitter plate that splits the reflected light beam into, on the one hand, an observation beam that is directed towards an image acquisition means and, on the other hand, a feedback light beam that illuminates the wavefront analyser, which makes it possible to identify the wavefront shape and provides this information to the calculator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0015">In response, the calculator itself commands an array of actuators controlling the deformation of the deformable mirror.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0016">These known adaptive optical systems are generally satisfactory but have nevertheless various drawbacks relating in particular to their relative slowness, their less than optimal degree of reliability, their cost and their bulk.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0017">These drawbacks come in particular from the fact that the known wavefront analysers generally used in the adaptive optical systems include an image array sensor (CCD or CMOS, for example) associated with optical elements (micro-lens array, pyramid, etc.) coding the wavefront phase into intensity variations measurable by the image array sensor (spots, fringes, etc.). Now, the image array sensors are expensive and complex, especially when they need to be fast and sensitive.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0018">These image array sensors further include a high number of pixels. The time required to convert the photons into a digital signal, to transfer the signal to the calculator and to process the pixels in the calculator is long. On fast systems, this latency is the main factor limiting the performance. In particular, in sectors of activity such as astronomy, it is possible that the atmospheric disturbances that disturbe the wavefront occur at a speed that exceeds the speeds of calculation of the conventional adaptive optical systems implementing a conventional wavefront analyser. In such a case, an optimum processing of the image is impossible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0019">Moreover, the image array sensors implemented in the known systems do not measure directly the wavefront, but the gradient thereof. The calculator must therefore perform a large number of operations in order to create the command signal required by the wavefront corrector (deformable mirror). This is again a source of cost and loss of time. This relative slowness of the known devices may be extremely damaging in applications in which the speed of correction is critical (satellite or debris imaging, for example).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0020">Moreover, in such conventional adaptive optical systems, a significant part of the photons is redundant, lost or underused at the wavefront analyser, precisely because of the use of image array sensors, in such a way that part of the information contained in the light signal is itself redundant, lost or underused, which constitutes a serious drawback, in particular when the useful signal is weak.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0021">Finally, the wavefront analysers implemented in the known adaptive optical systems prove to be in practice relatively bulky and fragile.</p><heading

In a particular embodiment, which corresponds to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the adaptive optical system <b>1</b> is designed to correct in real time, in a dynamic and controlled manner, the evolutive and unpredictable deformations of a wavefront <b>4</b>, said deformations resulting for example from atmospheric disturbances and/or turbulences. Such a system is particularly suitable for applications such as, for example:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0050">astronomical observation,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0051">near space observation,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0052">satellite imaging,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0053">satellite telecommunications,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0054">communications using FSO (Free Space Optics) equipment,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0055">certain military applications,<br/>for which the speed of correction is a critical parameter.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0039" num="0056">The invention is however not limited to the above-mentioned specific applications and the adaptive optical system <b>1</b> according to the invention may be used for multiple applications or be, for example, included into, or form, a microscopic observation system, or an image enlargement or reduction system, or a zoom system, or an image deformation system, or an ophthalmological imaging system, or a terrestrial telecommunication system, or a fiber-optics injection system . . . this list being not limitative.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0057">The adaptive optical system <b>1</b> includes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an adaptive optical device <b>2</b> comprising an optical processing surface <b>3</b> intended to deform an incident wavefront <b>4</b>. The incident wavefront <b>4</b> is for example a disturbed wavefront, which is deformed due to disturbances caused by the passing through the Earth's atmosphere. The adaptive optical device <b>2</b> is advantageously an active device that aims to compensate, preferably exactly, in real time and in a dynamic and continuous manner, for the disturbance that deforms the incident wavefront <b>4</b>. The adaptive optical device <b>2</b> also comprises a driving device <b>5</b> connected to the optical processing surface <b>3</b> to controllably modify the optical behaviour of said optical processing surface, preferably in a dynamic (modifiable) manner and advantageously in real time. The adaptive optical device <b>2</b> is thus an active device, which acts preferably permanently, in a continuous and controlled manner, to deform the incident wavefront <b>4</b> in order to advantageously correct the latter.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0058">Advantageously, the adaptive optical device <b>2</b> is an active wavefront correction device designed to ensure a phase correction (for example in the form of phase delay introduction) in order to modify the shape of the wavefront <b>4</b> (for example to restore the flatness thereof).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0059">For that purpose, the adaptive optical device <b>2</b> is for example designed to dynamically modify the spatial distribution of the refractive index of the optical processing surface <b>3</b>. In this case, the optical processing surface <b>3</b> is for example consisted of a liquid crystal panel such as an LCD screen. The driving device <b>5</b> is advantageously formed in this case by a microcontroller that drives the liquid crystal array forming the optical processing surface <b>3</b>, in such a way as to modify dynamically the spatial distribution of the refractive index within the liquid crystal array (by colour change). The incident wavefront <b>4</b> thus passes through the liquid crystal array forming in this case the optical processing surface <b>3</b>, which causes the deformation of the wavefront due to phase delays introduced locally by the liquid crystal array. In this embodiment, the modification of the optical behaviour of the optical processing surface <b>3</b> consists in a modification of the spatial distribution of the refractive index of the material forming the optical processing surface <b>3</b>, to introduce locally an optical path difference.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0060">As an alternative (and as illustrated in the Figures), the adaptive optical device <b>2</b> is for example designed to dynamically modify the geometry of the optical processing surface <b>3</b>. In this case, the optical processing surface <b>3</b> is for example consisted by a deformable surface as illustrated in the Figures. The driving device <b>5</b> is advantageously formed in this case by one or several actuators (preferably an array of actuators) connected to the deformable surface forming the optical processing surface <b>3</b>, to controllably deform the latter.

The beam splitter <b>13</b> may be advantageously formed by a semi-reflective plate, which splits the modified light beam <b>14</b> into two light flows, a reflected one (corresponding to the first beam <b>15</b> in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and a refracted one (corresponding, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to the second beam <b>16</b> to be exploited). The invention is however absolutely not limited to this particular embodiment and any other arrangement of adaptive optics may be implemented, without thereby departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0067">The first beam <b>15</b> forms the input light beam <b>7</b>, either directly or indirectly, by processing using for example an optical device.

In the specific embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lenses <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> are arranged in a telescope-like series arrangement, with for example the lens <b>17</b> that ensures a convergence of the first beam <b>15</b>, whereas the lens <b>18</b> is a collimation lens that allows obtaining as an output a collimated light beam forming the input light beam <b>7</b>. The invention is however not limited to this particular embodiment, and any other means for processing or transforming the first beam <b>15</b> may be implemented, or conversely no means at all if the optical analyser <b>6</b> is directly subjected to the first beam <b>15</b> that then forms directly the input light beam <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0068">The second beam <b>16</b> constitutes for its part a second beam <b>16</b> to be exploited by the user of the adaptive optical system <b>1</b>. This second beam <b>16</b>, whose wavefront <b>19</b> has been rectified by the adaptive optical device <b>2</b>, is for example captured by an imaging device <b>20</b>, which then benefits from a clear image since the untimely deformations of the incident wavefront <b>4</b> have been compensated for by the deformation of the deformable reflective surface advantageously forming the optical processing surface <b>3</b> of the adaptive optical device <b>2</b> (consisted in the example illustrated by a deformable mirror). In the embodiment illustrated in the Figures, the second beam <b>16</b> passes for example through a lens <b>21</b> that makes it converge to the sensor(s) of the imaging device <b>20</b>. This arrangement is obviously a purely illustrative and non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0069">Advantageously, the beam splitter <b>13</b> is chromatic, in such a way that said first beam <b>15</b> is formed by a radiation whose spectral band is different from that of the radiation forming the second beam <b>16</b>. This makes it possible to use for the optical analyser <b>6</b> a spectral band that is less useful for the application concerned.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0070">According to an important characteristic of the invention, the optical analyser <b>6</b> is designed to spatially demultiplex, by multi-plane light conversion, the input light beam <b>7</b> into a plurality of elementary output light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>, each corresponding to an isolated spatial mode or to a group of isolated spatial modes, said output signals <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> being formed by, or from, said elementary light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>. Therefore, the optical analyser <b>6</b> does not rely on a sampling of the wavefront, for example by means of a micro-lens frame and an CCD camera, as in the prior art, but on a decomposition of the input light beam <b>7</b> (whose wavefront is potentially disturbed according to a plurality of different modes of deformation) into a plurality of elementary output light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>, distinct and separated from each other, each output light beam <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b> corresponding to a single modal mode, or possibly to a group of spatial modes, for example groups of spatial modes of the same radial or azimuthal order.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0071">In other words, the invention is based on a perfectly original principle of wavefront analysis advantageously consisting in physically decomposing the input light beam, which is affected by different aberrations (or deformation modes, or Zernike modes) into a series of elementary light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b> each corresponding to an elementary aberration (or Zernike mode), or a group of aberrations (or Zernike modes) of the same order.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0072">This spatial demultiplexing is performed by a multi-plane light conversion method, which is known as such and described for example in the article entitled &#x201c;Programmable unitary spatial mode manipulation&#x201d; (Morizur et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. A/vol. 27, No. 11/November 2010: 2524-2531), or for example in the patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,250,454 and 10,324,286, the content of which is incorporated by way of reference. The multi-plane light conversion method, also called &#x201c;MPLC&#x201d;, is a technique based on the decomposition of a unitary spatial transformation into a succession of primary transformations affecting the transverse phase profile of the light radiation. Based on this principle, it is possible to spatially multiplex or demultiplex a light beam. Within the framework of the invention, the multi-plane light conversion technique is advantageously used to demultiplex the light beam in order to thus provide a command signal to the control device <b>11</b>. One of the major interests in using an optical analyser <b>6</b> implementing a spatial demultiplexing by multi-plane light conversion lies in the fact that such a multi-plane light conversion may be implemented using fully passive components, which provides the optical analyser <b>6</b> with a particularly reliable and robust nature, as well as a particularly short response time.<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0073">The spatial demultiplexing by multi-plane light conversion implemented within the framework of the invention may be performed using any known means, and in particular using means described in the following documents, whose content is incorporated herein by way of reference:</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0074">WO-2012/085046,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0075">WO-2017/158262,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0076">WO-2017/158261,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0077">WO-2019/155085,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0078">WO-2019/129954,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0079">WO-2019/129949,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0080">WO-2019/162637,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0009" num="0081">Damien Gatinel thesis paper &#x201c;Une nouvelle m&#xe9;thode de d&#xe9;composition polynomiale d'un front d'onde oculaire&#x201d;, Organes des sens.

Such a modal deformable mirror makes it possible to correct or generate, in an extremely simple and rapid manner, the most common optical aberrations. Each control channel of a modal deformable mirror thus advantageously corresponds to a predetermined spatial mode (for example, a Zernike mode).

A modal deformable mirror is thus advantageously based on a modal control, according to which the wavefront is expressed as a combination of elementary modes (Zernike modes) which corresponds as closely as possible to the wavefront deformation introduced by the atmospheric disturbances. The invention is however not limited to the implementation of a modal deformable mirror, and excellent results are obtained for example with a very short response time deformable mirror that allows taking best advantage of the modal demultiplexing performed by the analyser <b>6</b>, as for example the deformable mirror sold under the name &#x201c;DM 97-15&#x201d; by the above-mentioned ALPAO company.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0106">Particularly advantageously, the Zernike modes of said modal deformable mirror forming preferentially the adaptive optical device <b>2</b> correspond to said isolated modes of said elementary light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b> produced by the optical analyser <b>6</b>. In this preferential embodiment, the control device <b>11</b> may be extremely simple and fast, or even consist simply of a single analog amplifier per mode. It is thus possible to completely dispense with a calculator and to carry out a wavefront reconstruction that is purely analog.

The implementation of such a central actuator to deform the deformable plate <b>30</b> directly at the centre thereof, in conjunction with the other actuators <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> arranged on the movable part of each tab <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, makes it possible to carry out a particularly efficient modal control to obtain simply and rapidly a multitude of Zernike modes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0116">Therefore, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, the adaptive optical system <b>1</b> uses the &#x201c;multiplexing division mode&#x201d; principles to decompose a wavefront into deformation modes (for example, Zernike modes), and to therefore translate each light deformation mode into a light signal <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> that is used to command the controlled modification of the optical behaviour of a modal adaptive optical device <b>2</b>, such as a modal deformable mirror as mentioned hereinabove. The invention thus corresponds in a way to the application to adaptive optics of technical principles up to now related to fiber-optics, to free from the response times associated with the conventionally used wavefront detectors, such as the Shack-Hartmann detectors.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0117">The invention moreover also relates, according to a second aspect, to the new use of an optical analyser <b>6</b> designed to spatially demultiplex, by multi-plane light conversion, an input light beam <b>7</b> into a plurality of elementary output light beams <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>, each corresponding to an isolated spatial mode or to a group of isolated spatial modes, to provide signals <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> for driving the modification of optical behaviour of an optical processing surface <b>3</b> of an adaptive optical device <b>2</b> intended to controllably deform an incident wavefront <b>4</b>. The signals <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> serve for example to drive the deformation of a deformable reflective surface of a deformable mirror, which may be a modal deformable mirror. For example, the optical analyser <b>6</b> may be designed on the basis of the PROTEUS-S device, or the PROTEUS-C device, or the TILBA-R device, all marketed by the French-law company CAILABS&#x2014;38, Boulevard Albert 1er, 35200 Rennes&#x2014;France. The invention is however not limited to the implementation of a specific design of optical analyser, and any other MPLC demultiplexing device may be used without thereby departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0118">Finally, the invention also relates as such to a method of driving an adaptive optical device <b>2</b>, which device <b>2</b> advantageously corresponds to that described hereinabove and therefore comprises an optical processing surface <b>3</b> (which is advantageously a deformable surface) intended to deform an incident wavefront <b>4</b> and a driving device <b>5</b> connected to said optical processing surface <b>3</b> to controllably modify the optical behaviour of said optical processing surface <b>3</b>.

The driving method is hence advantageously implemented by the adaptive optical system <b>1</b> described hereinabove, in such a way that the above-mentioned adaptive optical system <b>1</b> also applies to the driving method. Conversely, the following description of the driving method also advantageously applies to the above-described adaptive optical system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0119">The method according to the invention comprises a step of subjecting an optical analyser <b>6</b> to an input light beam <b>7</b> in order to produce, in response, output signals <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. The method also comprises a step of commanding the driving device <b>5</b> as a function of the output signals <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>.
