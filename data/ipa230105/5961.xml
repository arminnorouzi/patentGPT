For example, in the case of a liquid crystal display device, since a sealant needs to be used to seal liquid crystals and bond upper and lower substrates, there is a limit to reducing the size of the bezel area. In addition, in the case of an organic light emitting display device, since an organic light emitting element is formed of an organic material and is very vulnerable to moisture or oxygen, it is beneficial to dispose an encapsulation for protecting the organic light emitting element, so there is a limit to reducing the size of the bezel area. In particular, since there are challenges in implementing an extra-large screen as a single panel, when a plurality of liquid crystal display panels or a plurality of organic light emitting display panels are disposed in a type of tile shape to thereby implement an extra-large screen, a problem in which bezel areas between adjacent panels are visible by a user can be caused.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an alternative to the above approach in the related art, a display device including light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been proposed. Since the LED is formed of an inorganic material rather than an organic material, it has excellent reliability and has a longer lifespan compared to a liquid crystal display device or an organic light emitting display device. In addition, the LED is an element that is suitable for being applied to an extra-large screen because it has not only a fast-lighting speed, but also has low power consumption and excellent stability due to strong impact resistance, and can display high luminance images.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, LED elements may be used in a display device for providing an extra-large screen capable of reducing or minimizing a bezel area in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors of the present disclosure have further recognized that since LEDs have better luminous efficiency compared to organic light emitting elements, in the case of a display device including LEDs compared to a display device using organic light emitting elements, a size of one pixel, that is, a size of a light emitting area to emit light of the same luminance is very small. Accordingly, the inventors of the present disclosure have recognized that, when a display device is implemented using LEDs, a distance between light emitting areas of adjacent pixels is much greater than a distance between light emitting areas of adjacent pixels in an organic display device having the same resolution. Accordingly, the inventors of the present disclosure have recognized that, when a tiling display is implemented by disposing a plurality of display panels in the form of tiles, since an interval between LEDs disposed at an outermost portion of a display panel and LEDs disposed at an outermost portion of the other display panel adjacent thereto can be implemented to be identical to an interval between LEDs disposed in one display panel, it is possible to implement a zero bezel in which there is substantially no bezel area. However, as described above, in order to implement an interval between LEDs disposed at an outermost portion of a display panel and LEDs disposed at an outermost portion of the other display panel adjacent thereto to be identical to an interval between LEDs disposed in one display panel, it is beneficial to position various drivers such as a gate driver and a data driver, which were previously positioned on an upper surface of the display panel, on a lower surface instead of the upper surface of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the inventors of the present disclosure have invented a display device having a new structure in which elements such as a thin film transistor and LEDs are disposed on an upper surface of the display panel and drivers such as a gate driver and a data driver are disposed on a lower surface of the display panel. In addition, the inventors of the present disclosure have invented a manufacturing technique of forming side lines on a side surface of the display panel to connect the elements disposed on the upper surface of the display panel and the drivers disposed on the lower surface of the display panel. Specifically, the side lines were formed on the display panel using a printing pad. Accordingly, by performing printing a plurality of times using a small-sized printing pad, side lines can be formed on a large-area display panel without limiting a size of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the inventors of the present disclosure have recognized that a line design space became a problem in display devices having the structure as described above. A technology of forming side lines using a printing pad as described above, is a method of printing side lines using a printing pad, after forming intaglio patterns etched in a metal plate mold, filling a conductive paste in the intaglio patterns, and after the filled conductive paste is applied on the printing pad, the side lines are printed using the printing pad. However, in performing an etching process using a photoresist to form the intaglio patterns, there was a problem in that a gap between the intaglio patterns may not be excessively narrowed due to a process margin of the etching process. In addition, when the gap between the intaglio patterns is reduced to several micrometers using a maximum margin, there could be a problem in which the conductive paste may not be properly filled in the intaglio patterns or the conductive paste may remain in the intaglio patterns. Accordingly, it is beneficial to secure a gap between the intaglio patterns for process stability, for example, to secure a gap of about 50 &#x3bc;m or more.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the number of light emitting elements that are disposed per unit area of a display device has increased as a need for a high resolution display panel. Accordingly, the number of lines for transmitting a signal to the light emitting elements has also increased. Accordingly, whereas the number of lines to be disposed in a predetermined space increases, there is a limit in reducing an interval between side lines.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, the inventors of the present disclosure have recognized a problem that a migration phenomenon may occur between side lines adjacent to each other. The migration phenomenon is a phenomenon in which when moisture is present and a potential difference exists between two adjacent electrodes or lines, metallic ions move from one electrode or line to another electrode or line by an electrochemical reaction, so that two electrodes or lines adjacent to each other are electrically connected. That is, when a potential difference is formed between side lines adjacent to each other for a long period of time in a process of driving a display device, there may occur a problem in which metallic ions constituting the side lines move from one side line to the other side line, and the side lines adjacent to each other are electrically connected to each other. In particular, as the resolution of the display device is higher, since the number of side lines to be disposed increases and an interval between the side lines also decreases, the migration problem as described above may be severed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the inventors of the present disclosure have invented a display device having a new structure capable of increasing the number of side lines that can be disposed in a predetermined space and securing an interval between the side lines.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display device capable of increasing the number of side lines disposed in a limited space by disposing side lines in a two-layer structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display device in which side lines are disposed on different layers, so that an interval between the lines can be increased.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display device capable of extending a line width of side lines disposed on a display device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The technical benefits of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned benefits, and other benefits, which are not mentioned above, can be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following descriptions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A display device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a substrate on which a plurality of light emitting elements are disposed;

In previous display devices, side lines were formed on a side surface of a display panel to connect elements such as thin film transistors and LEDs or the like, which are disposed on an upper surface of the display panel, and drivers such as gate drivers and data drivers or the like, which are disposed on a lower surface of the display panel. Specifically, by performing printing a plurality of times using a printing pad, side lines could be formed on a large-area display panel without limiting a size of the display panel. A technology of forming side lines using a printing pad as described above, is a method of printing side lines using a printing pad, after forming intaglio patterns etched in a metal plate mold, filling a conductive paste in the intaglio patterns, and after the filled conductive paste is applied on the printing pad, the side lines are printed using the printing pad. However, in performing an etching process using a photoresist to form the intaglio patterns, there was a problem in that a gap between the intaglio patterns may not be excessively narrowed due to a process margin of the etching process. In addition, when the gap between the intaglio patterns is reduced to several micrometers using a maximum margin, there could be a problem in which the conductive paste may not be properly filled in the intaglio patterns or the conductive paste may remain in the intaglio patterns. Accordingly, there was a problem in that a gap between the intaglio patterns for process stability, for example, to secure a gap of about 50 &#x3bc;m or more should be secured.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, the number of light emitting elements that are disposed per unit area of a display device has increased as a need for a high resolution display panel. Accordingly, the number of lines for transmitting a signal to the light emitting elements has also increased. Accordingly, there occurred a problem in which whereas the number of lines to be disposed in a predetermined space increases, there is a limit in reducing an interval between side lines.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Accordingly, in the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, limitation of a design space may be alleviated by disposing the plurality of side lines <b>150</b> on different layers. For example, while six side lines per unit area are disposed in an existing display device, in the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, six side lines <b>150</b> can be additionally placed again on the six side lines <b>150</b>. Thus, it is possible to increase the number of side lines <b>150</b> to be disposed per unit area while not reducing the interval between the side lines <b>150</b>. Accordingly, there is no need to reduce a gap between intaglio patterns of a metal plate used to form the side lines <b>150</b>, and the gap between the intaglio patterns can be sufficiently ensured, so that a problem in which a conductive paste is not properly filled in the intaglio patterns, or the conductive paste remains in the intaglio patterns can be resolved. Accordingly, in the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, process stability of a manufacturing process of the side lines <b>150</b> may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, in the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the number of the side lines <b>150</b> to be disposed in a predetermined space may be increased by disposing the plurality of side lines <b>150</b> on different layers.
