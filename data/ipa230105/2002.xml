The structure includes an axle receiving feature on a first leg of a fork assembly and a retaining sleeve within a clamping member on a second leg of the fork assembly. An axle is inserted through the clamping member, the wheel hub and coupled with the axle receiving feature. A component of the axle is tightened thereby moving the retaining sleeve partially out of the clamping member and toward the wheel hub until the wheel hub is in contact with both the retaining sleeve and the axle receiving feature, wherein the moving of the retaining sleeve allows the axle to radially couple the wheel hub with the fork assembly without modifying a preestablished geometry of the fork assembly.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="234.95mm" wi="92.71mm" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="206.16mm" wi="135.64mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="250.19mm" wi="126.41mm" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="252.39mm" wi="126.41mm" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="239.78mm" wi="145.12mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="245.96mm" wi="152.06mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="245.96mm" wi="163.15mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="242.23mm" wi="163.15mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="245.36mm" wi="147.57mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002003A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and benefit of U.S. patent application Ser.

Each embodiment described in this disclosure is provided merely as an example or illustration of the present invention, and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. In some instances, well known methods, procedures, and objects have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments described herein provide an interface width between a fork and a wheel hub that is adjustable to compensate for differing mounting widths between the fork and the hub. The fork width adjustment is done in a way that does not put the fork in bending, hence preserving the axial alignment between the two sides of the fork after the wheel hub is installed. In one embodiment, once this width adjustment is made for a given wheel hub, it is set so it does not need to be adjusted again for that specific wheel hub, regardless of the removal and reinstallation of the wheel hub.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following discussion, and for purposes of clarity, a bicycle is utilized as the example vehicle for showing the adjustable axle retaining structure. However, in one embodiment, the adjustable axle retaining structure is applicable to motorcycles, bicycles, e-bikes, scooters, tricycles, and the like. Moreover, in one embodiment, the adjustable axle retaining structure is applicable in traditional forks, upside down (or inverted) forks, and hybrid forks.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment the adjustable axle retaining structure uses a sleeve (or other geometrically shaped component) in an axle retaining portion a lower fork tube. The sleeve is able to receive and retain a portion of an axle. In one embodiment, the sleeve is free to translate and/or rotate with respect to the axle retaining portion of the lower fork tube during initial setup to establish an acceptable geometry between the wheel and the lower fork tubes. After the initial setup, the sleeve is translationally and rotationally fixed to the lower fork tube such that the acceptable geometry is maintained when the wheel is removed and then replaced (such as for a flat tire, disassembly for travel, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiments the adjustable axle retaining structure uses two sleeves (or other geometrically shaped component), one sleeve in each axle retaining portion of each lower fork tube. Each sleeve is able to receive and retain a portion of an axle. In one embodiment, during initial setup, each sleeve is free to translate and/or rotate with respect to its axle retaining portion of its lower fork tube to establish an acceptable geometry between the wheel and the lower fork tubes. After the initial setup, the sleeves are translationally and rotationally fixed to the lower fork tubes such that the acceptable geometry is maintained when the wheel is removed and then replaced (such as for a flat tire, disassembly for travel, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, in one embodiment the disclosed adjustable axle retaining structure allows width compensation to be performed only at initial setup for a given fork/wheel hub combination. Additional width adjustment is not required, for example at each wheel removal/reinstall. Moreover, the disclosed adjustable axle retaining structure has the advantages of floating axle designs, e.g., one or both of the lower fork tubes is not put in bending due to axial loads through the front axle. In one embodiment, the adjustable axle retaining structure uses a tool-free quick release style axle retaining configuration. In one embodiment, the adjustable axle retaining structure uses a tool style axle retaining configuration such as a torque (e.g., Kabolt style), or the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a perspective view of a bicycle <b>50</b> having an adjustable axle retaining structure <b>300</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment.

In one embodiment, adjustable axle retaining structure <b>300</b> is used to position axle <b>150</b> and thus wheel hub <b>114</b>, such that the front wheel assembly <b>28</b> is correctly aligned between the fork tubes and that rotor <b>93</b> is properly aligned with caliper <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the upper portion of fork assembly <b>100</b> includes a steerer tube <b>101</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) which is inserted through a head tube in frame <b>22</b> (or main frame <b>24</b>) and is coupled to a handlebar assembly <b>36</b> via a stem (or the like). In one embodiment, the head tube contains a headset to act as an interface between the steerer tube <b>101</b> and the frame <b>22</b>. In general, once the lower portion of fork assembly <b>100</b> is coupled with the front wheel assembly <b>28</b>, and the upper portion of fork assembly <b>100</b> is passed through the head tube of frame <b>22</b> and coupled with handlebar assembly <b>36</b>; an embodiment of a front end of bicycle <b>50</b> is basically configured.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A number of the components of rear wheel assembly <b>30</b> are the same, or similar, to the components of front wheel assembly <b>28</b> described herein.
