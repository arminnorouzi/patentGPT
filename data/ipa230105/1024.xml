id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to microbubbles for biomedical applications, specifically for use as ultrasonic contrast agents. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a gas-filled microbubble and to a method for fabricating such a gas-filled microbubble.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known to use gas-filled microbubbles as ultrasonic contrast agents (UCAs). Such microbubbles are, for example, functionalized with targeting ligands that bind to specific receptors in a patient's body. The microbubbles provide a distinctive acoustic response, which can be read out by an ultrasound imaging device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For some applications, it would be desirable to generate detectable changes in the acoustic response of microbubbles, e.g. to directly monitor a medical procedure in a patient's body. In principle, such changes in the acoustic response of microbubbles can be caused by a change of size of the microbubbles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it is ambiguous to use changes in size as a parameter to study acoustic property changes of microbubbles, because the stability of the microbubbles is essential, and the microbubbles are prone to change in size when the gas diffuses out. Thus, it is desirable to have microbubbles which can undergo detectable changes, especially in their acoustic response, and are, at the same time, stable in size.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need to provide an improved gas-filled microbubble, and to provide an improved method for fabricating a gas-filled microbubble. In particular, the above-mentioned disadvantages should be avoided.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This is achieved by the embodiments provided in the enclosed independent claims. Advantageous implementations of the embodiments of the present disclosure are further defined in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to a gas-filled microbubble, comprising: a shell encapsulating a gas volume; wherein the shell comprises a gas impermeable molecular layer; and wherein the shell is functionalized with a plurality of polymerizable molecules, wherein the polymerizable molecules comprise pentacosadienoic acid (PCDA) derivatives, in particular polyethylene glycol PCDA (PCDA-PEG). The polymerizable molecules are configured to undergo polymerization when being irradiated with UV radiation in a determined wavelength range; wherein the polymerization of the polymerizable molecules changes physicochemical properties, such as viscoelastic properties, of the microbubble.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This achieves the advantage that a microbubble can be provided that is highly stable, radiation sensitive and biocompatible. In particular, the functionalization of the microbubble with the plurality of polymerizable molecules enhances its mechanical stability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The microbubble can be used as ultrasonic contrast agent (UCA). For instance, the gas-filled microbubble comprises functional groups which allow targeting specific tissues, e.g. tumor tissue. The functional groups can comprise targeting ligands.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gas-filled microbubble can have a size between 0.5 and 20 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 1 and 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The gas, which is encapsulated by the shell of the microbubble, can be perfluorobutane. Alternatively, the gas can also be air or an air perfluorobutane mixture.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The determined wavelength range depends on the polymerizable molecules and is, for instance, between 200 and 280 nm for the PCDA-PEG.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The physicochemical properties of the gas-filled microbubble can be mechanical properties of the microbubble, such as elastic or viscoelastic properties of the microbubble.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The change of the physicochemical properties of the microbubble can be caused by the crosslinking of the polymerizable molecules upon polymerization. In particular, the polymerizable molecules are configured to exhibit a change in their physiochemical and/or viscoelastic properties upon irradiation with the UV radiation, e.g. they become rigid after crosslinking. This change in the physio-chemical/or viscoelastic properties of the polymerizable molecules causes the changes in the physicochemical and/or elastic properties of the microbubble.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the microbubble is configured to exhibit a change in its acoustic properties due to the change of its physicochemical properties caused by the polymerization of the polymerizable molecules.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular, the change in the acoustic properties of the microbubble is caused by a change of the viscoelastic properties of the microbubble upon polymerization of the polymerizable molecules. For instance, the polymerization causes crosslinking of the polymerizable molecules which increases their rigidity, and which, in turn, changes the acoustic properties of the microbubble (e.g, the resonance frequency of the microbubble).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The change in the acoustic properties can comprise a change in the resonance frequency of the microbubble and/or a change in the attenuation of an ultrasound signal by the microbubble. At the same time, the polymerization of said molecules causes no or only a minimal change of the size of the microbubble.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, this change in the acoustic properties of the microbubble can be read out with a suitable measurement instrument, e.g. a medical imaging tool, and can be used to generate a 2D or 3D image.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the PCDA derivatives comprise PEG monosubstituted with PCDA (monoPCDA-PEG) and PEG disubstituted with PCDA (biPCDA-PEG).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By functionalizing the shell with both monoPCDA-PEG and biPCDA-PEG, the stability of the microbubble can be further enhanced. In particular, the microbubble is stable in size before and after polymerization.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the biPCDA-PEG molecules provide between 60% and 90%, preferably between 70% and 80%, more preferably around 75%, of the total PCDA derivatives.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In particular, the ratio of biPCDA-PEG molecules to monoPCDA-PEG molecules is between 3:2 and 9:1, preferably between 7:3 and 4:1, more preferably around 3:1.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the gas impermeable molecular layer is formed from a phospholipid layer. In particular, the phospholipid layer can be a monolayer, which is impermeable to the encapsulated gas.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the microbubble shell can comprise 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and/or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG maleimide) molecules. In particular, the gas impermeable molecular layer is formed from a DSPC layer, which is functionalized with the DSPE-PEG maleimide molecules.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The molar ratios of DSPC:DSPE-PEG maleimide:monoPCDA-PEG:biPCDA-PEG, especially when forming the microbubble, can be: 26:1:1.3:3.2. However, other composition ratios are possible. For example, the proportion of each component of the composition can be increased or decreased by up to 25%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the gas-filled microbubble further comprises a plurality of scintillating nanoparticles; wherein said scintillating nanoparticles are configured to convert X-ray radiation into UV radiation in the determined wavelength range.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This achieves the advantage that the microbubbles can be used as UCAs for radiation therapy, in particular for radiation dose monitoring. For instance, the microbubbles can translate an imparted radiation dosage into a modulation of their viscoelastic properties. This can lead to a detectable change in the acoustic repose of the microbubbles upon ultrasound interrogation. Based on said acoustic response after a radiation treatment, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional dose distribution map can be generated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the scintillating nanoparticles are arranged to irradiate the polymerizable molecules with the UV radiation in the determined wavelength range, when being irradiated with the X-ray radiation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In particular, the scintillating nanoparticles carry out an in-situ down-conversion of the X-ray radiation into the UV radiation in the determined wavelength range. In this way, the polymerization the PCDA-PEG molecules can be triggered by the X-ray radiation due to the in-situ down-conversion of said X-ray radiation into UV light in the suitable wavelength range.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embedment, the scintillating nanoparticles comprise any one of the following materials: Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CeF<sub>3</sub>, LiLuF<sub>4</sub>Pr<sup>3+</sup>, LiLuF<sub>4</sub>Ce<sup>3+</sup>, LiYF<sub>4</sub>Ce<sup>3+</sup>, or LuPO<sub>4</sub>Pr<sup>3+</sup>Nd<sup>3+</sup>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the scintillating nanoparticles comprise a silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>, coating with functional groups.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The functional groups can be attached to the SiO<sub>2 </sub>surface coating on the nanoparticles.

For instance, the gas-filled microbubble <b>10</b> comprise functional groups, e.g. targeting ligands, which allow targeting specific tissues, such as tumor tissue.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In particular, the use of PCDA derivatives, such as 10,12-pentacosadienoic acid, for the polymerizable molecules makes the microbubbles very stable and, at the same time, sensitive to crosslinking by UV irradiation. A change in size of the microbubble <b>10</b> after polymerization is thereby mostly prevented.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The PCDA derivatives can comprise monoPCDA-PEG <b>13</b>-<b>1</b> and biPCDA-PEG <b>13</b>-<b>2</b>. In particular, the biPCDA-PEG molecules <b>13</b>-<b>2</b> provide between 60% and 90%, preferably between 70% and 80%, more preferably around 75%, of the total PCDA derivatives. By functionalizing the shell with both monoPCDA-PEG <b>13</b>-<b>1</b> and biPCDA-PEG <b>13</b>-<b>2</b>, the stability of the microbubble <b>10</b> can be further enhanced. In particular, the microbubble <b>10</b> is stable in size before and after polymerization.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The gas impermeable molecular layer of the shell <b>11</b> can be formed from a phospholipid layer. For example, the gas impermeable molecular layer can be formed from 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) 11-1, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000]) (DSPE-PEG maleimide) 11-2. The shell can further be functionalized with PCDA or PCDA derivatives. In particular, the maleimide groups are introduced into the microbubble <b>10</b> formulation in order to be a platform for a conjugation with targeting ligands and/or other functional groups or sensitizing agents, e.g. scintillating nanoparticles (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> below).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The molar ratios of DSPC:DSPE-PEG maleimide:monoPCDA-PEG:biPCDA-PEG, especially when forming the microbubble, can be: 26:1:1.3:3.2.

The scintillating nanoparticles <b>15</b> are preferably arranged at the vicinity of the polymerizable groups and generate UV radiation in the determined wavelength range for polymerization, e.g. 200-280 nm. This is also advantageous because the UV irradiation necessary for inducing the polymerization generally cannot spread within a body, but the X-ray radiation can.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, by functionalizing the gas-filled microbubble <b>10</b> with the scintillating nanoparticles <b>15</b>, the microbubble <b>10</b> can be used as radiation sensitive ultrasound contrast agent that changes its acoustic response upon irradiation with X-ray radiation. The scintillating nanoparticles <b>15</b> thereby act as sensitizing agents.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A plurality of such microbubbles <b>10</b> can be used as UCAs in a non-invasive in-situ dosimetry system for radiation therapy with the potential of in vivo radiation dose assessment.

This size-stability is important because the echogenic properties are sensitive to size variation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, a hybrid microbubble concept can be provided, where a microbubble shell property can be changed after irradiation by clinical beams. Thereby, a mechanism for the acoustic property change can be elucidated.

The gas-filled microbubbles <b>10</b> could further be used as theranostic agents, i.e. for therapy and diagnostics. As ultrasound readouts are a commonly used medical imaging tool in the hospitals, the UCAs could be used to directly image diseased tissues during a treatment of said tissue. For example, UV irradiation of cancer cells could be monitored directly via the microbubble UCAs. Alternatively, the down-conversion of X-ray to UV using scintillating nanoparticles <b>15</b> at a diseased tissue could be used to damage affected tissues locally. This can lead to the synergistic effect that the X-ray dose can be reduced which might improve patient compliance. On the other hand, the cost of the therapy could be reduced.
