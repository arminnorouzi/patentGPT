functions are widely used across many applications, such as childcare tracking, etc. These applications require periodic positions that, without supporting idle/inactive mode positioning, requires User Equipment (UE) to switch between connected and idle modes continuously, which leads to a higher amount of signaling overhead. Moreover, in some scenarios where the flow of people needs to be counted or there are a greater number of user locations to be obtained, all related UEs must return to connected mode in order to perform positioning, which would lead to overly large UE power consumption. Therefore, if positioning is able to be performed without entering connected mode, both the UE power consumption and the signaling overhead could be reduced. As such, idle/inactive positioning benefits at least UE-assisted positioning,NG RAN node assisted positioning, and UE-based positioning.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The example embodiments disclosed herein are directed to solving the issues relating to one or more of the problems presented in the prior art, as well as providing additional features that will become readily apparent by reference to the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompany drawings.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there are 5 entities involved in the method <b>100</b>: UE <b>101</b>, Next Generation-Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) Node (e.g., BS or wireless communication node) <b>102</b>, Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) <b>103</b>, Location Management Function (LMF) 104, and 5G system (5GS) Location Services (LCS) Entities <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, the LMF <b>104</b> is performed by a core network. At step <b>111</b>, the 5G LCS Entities <b>105</b> transmits a location service request to the AMF <b>103</b>. At step <b>112</b>, the AMF <b>103</b> processes the location service request. At step <b>113</b>, the UE <b>101</b> transmits a location service request to the AMF <b>103</b>, which then transmits a location services request to the LMF <b>104</b> at step <b>120</b>. Next, the NG-RAN Node procedures are performed at step <b>130</b>, which include an information request being sent from the LMF <b>104</b> to the NG-RAN Node <b>102</b> at step <b>132</b> and an information response being returned from the NG-RAN Node <b>102</b> to the LMF <b>104</b> at step <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Then, the UE procedure is performed at step <b>140</b>, which begins with the LMF <b>104</b> requesting the capabilities of the UE <b>101</b> at step <b>141</b>. At step <b>142</b>, the UE <b>101</b> provides its capabilities to and, at step <b>143</b>, requests assistance data from the LMF <b>104</b>. The LMF <b>104</b> provides assistance data at step <b>144</b> and requests location information from the UE <b>101</b> at step <b>145</b>. At step <b>146</b>, the UE <b>101</b> measure a transmission time between the UE <b>101</b> and the BS <b>102</b>, a transmission time between different BSs, a distance between the UE <b>101</b> and the BS <b>102</b>, and/or a distance between different BSs, which the UE <b>101</b> provides to the LMF <b>104</b> at step <b>147</b>. Finally, at step <b>148</b>, the LMF <b>104</b> calculates the location. It should be noted that the UE <b>101</b> may perform step <b>146</b> in response to (or otherwise triggered by) the UE <b>101</b> receiving a reference signal (e.g., a Downlink Positioning References Signal (DL PRS) from the BS <b>102</b>, which will be discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At step <b>150</b>, the LMF <b>104</b> responds to the location service request from step <b>120</b>. Then, at step <b>161</b>, the AMF <b>103</b> provides a location services response to the 5G LCS Entitiets <b>105</b>, processes the location services response at step <b>162</b>, and provides the location services response to the UE <b>101</b> at step <b>163</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to step <b>140</b>, the positioning of the UE <b>101</b> can be determined even when the UE <b>101</b> is not in a RRC_connected mode (i.e., either RRC_idle or RRC_inactive). The communication from the BS (via the LMF <b>104</b>) to the UE <b>101</b> takes the form of a downlink control message (e.g., a paging DCI), which may include one or more bits configured to trigger transmission of a first reference signal (e.g., a Sounding Reference Signal (SRS)), transmission of a preamble, or reception of a second reference signal (e.g., a Downlink Positioning References Signal (DL PRS) or a synchronization signal).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, this downlink control message may include a paging message scheduled by the downlink control message, and may include one or more bits to indicate whether the downlink control message includes scheduling information for positioning. For example in Table 1, the one or more bits can indicate that the scheduling information is configured for positioning only, or configured for both paging and positioning. Scheduling information for positioning may refer to the downlink control message or the paging message being configured to trigger/activate uplink signal and/or downlink signal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Bit field</entry><entry>Short Message indicator</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>00</entry><entry>Reserved</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>01</entry><entry>Only scheduling information for </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Paging is present in the DCI</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>Only short message is present in the DCI</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>11</entry><entry>Both scheduling information for Paging </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>and short message are present in the DCI</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In various embodiments, the UE <b>101</b> is configured to send an uplink signal back to the BS as triggered/activated by downlink control message or a paging message in order to assist the BS in positioning the UE <b>101</b>. Alternatively, the UE <b>101</b> is configured to receive an downlink from the BS as triggered/activated by downlink control message or a paging message in order to assist the UE in positioning measurement. The uplink signal may include at least one of a SRS or a preamble. The downlink signal may include at least one of a DL PRS or a synchronization signal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">The uplink signal and downlink signal may be configured when the UE was last in an RRC_connected state (which is sometimes referred to as an RRC_active state) or as one of a plurality of common uplink/downlink signals, such as uplink signal and downlink signals configured by a System Information Block (SIB). Further, the uplink signal and/or downlink signal may be dedicated for the UE <b>101</b> such that the BS is able to use the dedicated uplink signal in order to differentiate UEs from each other. For example, a sequence of the uplink signal and/or a sequence of the downlink signal may be associated with the UE <b>101</b>. In another example, a time allocation of the uplink signal and/or a time allocation of the downlink signal may be associated with the UE <b>101</b>. In yet another example, a frequency allocation of the uplink signal and/or a frequency allocation of the downlink signal may be associated with the UE <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">The preconfigured uplink signal and/or downlink signal may be updated by the downlink control message or the paging message. At least one of the following may be updated: the sequence of uplink signal and/or downlink signal, the time allocation of uplink signal and/or downlink signal, or the frequency allocation of uplink signal and/or downlink signal. Furthermore, the update may be according to (or associated with) a ID contained in the paging message, where the ID is used to uniquely identify a UE.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The downlink control message may activate the uplink transmission differently depending on whether the UE is RRC_idle or RRC_inactive. When the UE <b>101</b> is in an RRC_inactive state, the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) is contention free, and SRS may be configured when the UE <b>101</b> is in RRC_connected state. While the UE <b>101</b> is in an RRC_idle state, the PRACH is contention-based and the group common SRS is used for positioning purposes. The contention-based PRACH may be changed to contention free if, for example, the DCI/paging message (i.e., PDSCH) reconfigures the sequence or frequency domain of the triggered/activated reference signals.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">In addition to the downlink control message, the UE <b>101</b> may also receive assistance data (see step <b>144</b>) that configures the UE <b>101</b> to transmit a first reference signal (e.g., uplink signal) either periodically, aperiodically, or semi-persistently. For example, a time-domain behavior of the uplink signal can be configured by the assistance date as a parameter (e.g., resource Type) to be as one of aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. The assistance data can be included in at least one of three transmissions: in a SIB, in previous assistance data received when the UE was in RRC_connected state, or in scheduling information in the downlink control message. The assistance data may also include a PRS configuration.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In some embodiments, upon receiving the downlink message and/or assistance data, the UE <b>101</b> selects a resource from a plurality of resources that are pre-configured for positioning, and sends the preamble (i.e., the uplink signal) using the selected resource. Alternatively, the UE <b>101</b> sends the uplink signal as a Msg3 (i.e., the message sent by the UE <b>101</b> during step <b>3</b> of PRACH) carrying at least one of a User Equipment Identifier (UEID) and/or a Positioning Identifier.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Because the UE <b>101</b> is not in RRC_connected state, certain assumptions may be made about a Timing Advance (TA) for transmitting the uplink message. In some embodiments, the UE <b>101</b> receives a TA that was configured when the UE <b>101</b> was last in an RRC_connected state. In other embodiments, the UE <b>101</b> sends a first random access message to the BS and receives, in response, a second random access message that indicates a TA calculated based on the first random access message. If in a 4-step random access process, the first random access message could be Msg1 while the second random access message could be Msg2. Alternatively, if in a 2-step random access process, the first random access message could be MsgA while the second random access message could be MsgB.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In some embodiments, the UE <b>101</b> transmits the uplink signal using a spatial parameter that corresponds to a beam used by the UE <b>101</b> to receive messages from the BS (or send massages to the BS) and is selected according to information corresponding to the PRACH. Such a spatial parameter, which include a spatial domain receive filter and a spatial domain transmission filter, may sometimes be referred to as a spatial relations or spatial Rx parameter. This information includes a Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), a Channel State/Status Information Reference Signal (CSI-RS), or a Control Resource Set (CORESET). In some embodiments, the UE <b>101</b> can send the uplink signal using the spatial parameter, which may be selected according to a monitor occasion in which the downlink control message is received. For example, the monitoring occasion may include one or more occasions where the UE <b>101</b> can receive a paging message.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In addition, an Early Data Transmission (EDT) can transmit part of the uplink signal. Here, the uplink signal includes K Reference Signal Time Difference (RSTD), where K is the smallest number of RSTDs, and the cell ID.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In some embodiments, if the PRACH fails and if the Msg3 transmission fails, the assistance data still uses the current value and re-transmits the Msg3 with Hybrid Automatic Repeat ReQuest (HARQ). If the PRACH fails and if there is PRACH competition failure, the assistance data may need to recalculate a new value and to start the competition again. Alternatively, if the PRACH fails, it may be due to the reported measurement result falling within the T time window.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">For NG-RAN node assisted positioning, in order to use positioning SRS for a position of the UE, the terminal transmitting the SRS must be known. If PRACH is completed, the UE may be in RRC_CONNECTED (or RRC_active) state, so the UE does not need to be changed from the RRC_inactive or RRC_idle states. However, if PRACH is not completed, the NodeB can determine which user transmits the SRS by one of two ways. By dividing the preamble resources into at least two sets, at least one of which is used for positioning, the NG-RAN node can know which UE transmits the SRS if the preamble for positioning is sent by the UE. Alternatively, the NG-RAN node relies on the Msg3 carrying the UE-ID and/or the positioning identifier. As such, the UE that has accessed successfully (e.g., after receiving the Msg4) can directly transmit SRS but does not change to the connected state (i.e., stays as RRC_inactive).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In some embodiments, reserved bits are designed by reserved code point in a Short Message indicator that can be used in one of two ways: for scheduling information for positioning, or for scheduling information for paging and positioning. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a table showing bit field values with related Short Message indicator, according to various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">When the reserved code point in a Short Message indicator is used for positioning, the 6 reserved bits of the paging message are used to trigger the SRS similarly to the above.
