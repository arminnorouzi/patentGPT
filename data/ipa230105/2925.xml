In modern deep submicron integrated circuits, the trenches and vias are typically formed by a damascene or dual damascene process. Copper is currently used in ultra large scale integration (ULSI) metallization as a replacement for aluminum due to its lower resistivity and better electromigration resistance. Electrochemical copper deposition (ECD) has been adopted as the standard damascene or dual damascene process because of larger grain size (good electromigration) and higher deposition rates. More particularly, electrochemical plating (ECP) is well suited for the formation of small embedded damascene feature metallization due to its ability to readily control growth of the electroplated film for bottom-up filling, and the superior electrical conductivity characteristics of the electroplated film.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

The analyzer <b>150</b> receives the measured chemical concentration from the prober <b>140</b>. Thereafter, the FDC server <b>160</b> receives the measured chemical concentration from the analyzer <b>150</b> to form a concentration-time relationship chart, and sends the measured chemical concentration to the CIM system <b>130</b>. The CIM system <b>130</b> determines an exhausting parameter value based on the volume flow rate of the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> and the measured chemical concentration through computation. The CIM system <b>130</b> combines the exhausting parameter value and a process recipe and sends them to the semiconductor apparatus <b>120</b> to control the exhaust assembly <b>110</b> based on the exhausting parameter value and the process recipe. In some embodiments, the exhausting parameter value includes the opening area of the exhaust pipe <b>122</b>. For example, if the measured chemical concentration (e.g., copper concentration) is too low, the opening area of the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> is increased by the exhaust assembly <b>110</b> to increase the rate of piping the vapor out of the tank <b>124</b> and to lower the pressure in the tank <b>124</b>. As a result, the speed of solvent evaporation from the electrolyte S is accelerated, such that the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S increases. On the other hand, if the measured chemical concentration is high enough or too high, the opening area of the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> is decreased by the exhaust assembly <b>110</b> to retain the vapor in the tank <b>124</b>. As a result, the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S will not continuously increase for the reason of solvent evaporation from the electrolyte S.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The exhaust assembly <b>110</b> may operate in a mechanical manner, an electrical manner, an electromagnetic manner, or combinations thereof.

The electroplating cells <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, and <b>126</b><i>c </i>are configured to electrofill metal (e.g., copper) on semiconductor substrates (e.g., silicon wafers W).

In other words, the electrolyte S in the tank <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is supplied to the electroplating cell <b>126</b><i>a</i>. One electrode (the anode) in the electrolyte S will undergo oxidation and the other (the cathode) will undergo reduction. In some embodiments, a copper anode CA is the anode, and the wafer W is the cathode. The metal of the copper anode CA will oxidize, going from an oxidation state (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the wafer W, the metal ion in the electrolyte S will accept one or more electrons from the wafer W and the ion's oxidation state is reduced. This forms a solid metal (i.e., copper) that electrodeposits on the wafer W. As a result, the wafer W disposed in the electroplating cell <b>126</b><i>a </i>is electroplated to form interconnect features on the wafer W. The two electrodes are electrically connected to a power source PS, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the copper anode CA and flow through this connection to the ions at the surface of the wafer W (cathode).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, after the wafer W is electroplated, the wafer W is rinsed by de-ionized (DI) water F. The water F falls into the electrolyte S after rinsing the wafer W, thereby diluting the electrolyte S. The diluted electrolyte S is then recycled to the tank <b>124</b>.

The exhaust assembly <b>110</b> is configured to adjustably exhaust the vapor above the electrolyte S in the tank <b>124</b> to maintain the chemical concentration (e.g., copper concentration) in the electrolyte S. In some embodiments, the chemical concentration (e.g., copper concentration) in the electrolyte S can be maintained in a suitable range by controlling the exhaust assembly <b>110</b>, instead of dumping a fresh electrolyte solution into the tank <b>124</b> during preventive maintenance (PM). Since the chemical concentration (e.g., copper concentration) in the electrolyte S is maintained in a suitable range for the ECP process, the efficiency of filling holes with metal is stable, and voids are not formed in the metal.

In some alternative embodiments, the controller C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> may be configured to directly determine the exhausting parameter value (e.g. the pumping rate of the exhaust source Pu) and use the exhausting parameter value to control the exhaust source Pu.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the measured chemical concentration is higher than a control upper limit value, the pumping rate of the exhaust source Pu can be decreased to retain the vapor in the tank <b>124</b>. As a result, the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S will not be continuously increased for the reason of solvent evaporation from the electrolyte S. On the other hand, when the measured chemical concentration is lower than a control lower limit value, the pumping rate of the exhaust source Pu can be increased to increase the rate of piping the vapor out of the tank <b>124</b> and to lower the pressure in the tank <b>124</b>. As a result, the rate of solvent evaporation from the electrolyte S is accelerated so as to increase the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the exhaust assembly <b>110</b> controls the vapor flux through the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> to be in a range from about 10 m<sup>3</sup>/hr to about 5000 m<sup>3</sup>/hr. If the vapor flux through the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> is smaller than about 10 m<sup>3</sup>/hr, the efficiency of the exhaust assembly <b>110</b> is bad and thus the desired effect of controlling the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S is difficultly achieved. If the vapor flux through the exhaust pipe <b>122</b> is greater than about 5000 m<sup>3</sup>/hr, the chemical concentration in the electrolyte S is difficultly controlled.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the exhaust assembly is configured to increase or decrease a vapor flux through the exhaust pipe based on the measured chemical concentration. When the measured chemical concentration is too low, the vapor flux through the exhaust pipe is increased to increase the chemical concentration in the electrolyte. When the measured chemical concentration is high enough or too high, the vapor flux through the exhaust pipe is decreased to decrease the chemical concentration in the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to some embodiments, a method of controlling chemical concentration in electrolyte includes measuring a chemical concentration in an electrolyte, wherein the electrolyte is contained in a tank; and increasing a vapor flux through an exhaust pipe connected to the tank when the measured chemical concentration is lower than a control lower limit value.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to some embodiments, a method of controlling chemical concentration in electrolyte includes electroplating a wafer using an electrolyte, recycling the electrolyte to a tank, measuring a chemical concentration in the electrolyte, determining an exhausting parameter value based on the measured chemical concentration, and evacuating a vapor in the tank using the determined exhausting parameter value.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to some embodiments, a semiconductor apparatus includes a tank, an exhaust assembly, a prober, and a controller. The tank is configured to contain an electrolyte. The exhaust assembly is connected to the tank. The prober is configured to measure a chemical concentration in the electrolyte. The controller is configured to control the exhaust assembly based on the measured chemical concentration.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The foregoing outlines features of several embodiments so that those skilled in the art may better understand the aspects of the present disclosure.
