Thus, recently, many studies on secondary batteries are being carried out. As technology development and demands for mobile devices increase, the demands for secondary batteries as energy sources are rapidly increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rechargeable batteries are classified into coin type batteries, cylindrical type batteries, prismatic type batteries, and pouch type batteries according to a shape of a battery case. In such a secondary battery, an electrode assembly mounted in a battery case is a chargeable and dischargeable power generating device having a structure in which an electrode and a separator are stacked.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electrode assembly may be approximately classified into a jelly-roll type electrode assembly in which a separator is interposed between a positive electrode and a negative electrode, each of which is provided as the form of a sheet coated with an active material, and then, the positive electrode, the separator, and the negative electrode are wound, a stacked type electrode assembly in which a plurality of positive and negative electrodes with a separator therebetween are sequentially stacked, and a stack/folding type electrode assembly in which stacked type unit cells are wound together with a separation film having a long length.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the electrode assembly according to the related art is manufactured, after the electrode is moved to the cutting part, the cut electrode and the separator are alternately stacked to manufacture the electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, when a gripper holds the electrode to be cut, tension of the electrode may not be secured to cause twisting of the electrode. In addition, there has been a problem in that the electrode is warped due to resistance even when the twisted electrode is put in a nip roll.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, even when the gripper holds the electrode, there has been a problem that the twisting occurs due to an electrode swell and a gap of the gripper.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2014-0015647</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One aspect of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for manufacturing an electrode assembly, which is capable of preventing an electrode from being twisted when the electrode is moved while and after cutting the electrode, an electrode assembly manufactured through the apparatus, and a secondary battery.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An apparatus for manufacturing an electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises a cutting part configured to cut an electrode to a predetermined size, a supply part disposed in front of the cutting part with respect to a traveling direction of the electrode to move and supply the electrode to the cutting part, and a moving part disposed behind the cutting part with respect to the traveling direction of the electrode to move the electrode cut through the cutting part, wherein the moving part comprises a moving suction belt configured to vacuum-suction and move the electrode, and the moving suction belt fixes an end of the electrode when the electrode is cut in the cutting part.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention may be an electrode assembly manufactured through the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A secondary battery according to an embodiment of the present invention may be a secondary battery comprising the electrode assembly manufactured through the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, when the electrode is vacuum-suctioned onto the moving part so as to be cut, the electrode may be fixed to be prevented from being twisted. Thereafter, when the electrode cut in the moving part is vacuum-suctioned and moved, the electrode may be prevented from being twisted during the movement.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, when the electrode is cut, the electrode may be vacuum-suctioned onto the supply part and the moving part to firmly fix the electrode, thereby preventing the electrode from being twisted.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, when the electrode is cut, and then is moved after being cut, the moving speed of the moving part may be quicker than the moving speed of the supply part that moves the electrode to the cutting part to maintain and improve the tension of the electrode. Therefore, the twisting of the electrode may be more effectively prevented.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating an apparatus for manufacturing an electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a state before an electrode is cut in the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a state in which the electrode is cut in the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a state in which the electrode is cut in the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which an electrode is cut in an apparatus for manufacturing an electrode assembly according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a state before an electrode is cut in the apparatus for manufacturing the electrode assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a state in which an electrode is cut in an apparatus for manufacturing an electrode assembly according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The objectives, specific advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
