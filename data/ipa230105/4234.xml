Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a technique for detecting the tilt of a lever by using a variable resistor is used for an operating device that is used as a gaming machine's controller or the like. With such an operating device, cases might occur in which, when the lever tries to return to its neutral position, the lever's return fails physically (that is, the lever is unable to resume its neutral position completely).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In relationship to this, Patent Document 1 below relates to an operating device that detects the tilt of an operating shaft by using a variable resistor. Patent Document 1 discloses a technique for making the slope of variation of output in the neutral position region more moderate than the slope of variation of output outside the neutral position region by means of processing using an analog amplifier circuit or a digital circuit. This technique generally assumes that the apparent precision of the lever's return can be improved.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">RELATED-ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">[Patent Document 1] Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2014-2595</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Now, there is a conventional operating device that is known for using a resistor and a slider as a variable resistor. In this variable resistor, the flat, strip-shaped resistor is provided on the surface of a substrate, and the slider changes the output voltage value by sliding on the surface of the resistor in accordance with the tilting operation of the lever.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the lever in this conventional operating device using such a variable resistor fails to return to its neutral position physically, it is difficult to improve the accuracy of the lever's return to its neutral position, considering the output voltage values output from the operating device, without relying on signal processing. If the accuracy of return of the lever to its neutral position is low in output voltage values, it is necessary to set the range of the dead band of output voltage values large, which in turn narrows the range of output voltage values that are available for use.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An operating device according to one embodiment includes: a lever configured to be operated by tilting; a resistor having a flat strip shape and provided on a surface of a substrate; and a slider configured to change an output voltage value by sliding on a surface of the resistor in accordance with tilting operation of the lever. In this operating device, the resistor has a low-resistance portion that has a lower resistance value than other portions of the resistor, and that is a portion in contact with the slider when the lever is in a neutral position.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment, an operating device uses a flat, strip-shaped resistor provided on the surface of a substrate, and a slider, configured to change the output voltage value by sliding on the surface of the resistor in accordance with the tilting operation of the lever, as a variable resistor.

As a result of this, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the resistance value of the low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Aa is half the resistance value of the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>A.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example, the linear portion <b>118</b>B of the resistor <b>118</b> has a low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba. The low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba has a lower resistance value than the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>B. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba is a portion that is in contact with the contact portion <b>105</b>Ab of the slider <b>105</b>A when the lever <b>120</b> is in its neutral position. In this modified example, the resistance value of the low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba is lower than that of the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>B because the width of the resistor <b>118</b> is larger than that of the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>B. For example, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the width of the resistor <b>118</b> in the low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba is twice the width of the resistor <b>118</b> in the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>B. As a result of this, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the resistance value of the low-resistance portion <b>118</b>Ba is half the resistance value of the other portions of the linear portion <b>118</b>B.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, in the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example, output characteristics that are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> can be obtained by lowering the resistance value of the low-resistance portions <b>118</b>Aa and <b>118</b>Ba. That is, the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example can moderate the slope of output voltage values near the neutral position of the lever <b>120</b>, and narrow the range width of output voltage values near the neutral position of the lever <b>120</b>. By this means, even when the lever <b>120</b> physically fails to return to its neutral position, the operating device <b>100</b> according to one embodiment can bring the output voltage values closer to a predetermined output voltage value corresponding to the neutral position of the lever <b>120</b>. Therefore, the operating device <b>100</b> according to one embodiment can increase the accuracy of return of the lever <b>120</b> to its neutral position in the output voltage values output by the operating device <b>100</b>, without relying on signal processing.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Note that the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example employs a configuration in which the engaging portions <b>104</b>C and <b>106</b>C of the actuators <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> engage with the protrusions <b>105</b>B and <b>107</b>B provided at the center portions of the holders <b>105</b> and <b>107</b>, thereby allowing the holders <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> to slide. Therefore, there is a risk, with the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example, the holders <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> might rotate about the central portion due to rattling between the protrusions <b>105</b>B and <b>107</b>B and the engaging portions <b>104</b>C and <b>106</b>C. In this case, the contact portions <b>105</b>Ab and <b>107</b>Ab of the sliders <b>105</b>A and <b>107</b>A might rotate in the width direction of the resistor <b>118</b>. However, in the operating device <b>100</b> according to one modified example, the width of the resistor <b>118</b> in the low-resistance portions <b>118</b>Aa and <b>118</b>Ba is widened, so that, even when the contact portions <b>105</b>Ab and <b>107</b>Ab of the sliders <b>105</b>A and <b>107</b>A rotate in the width direction of the resistor <b>118</b>, it is possible to prevent the contact portions <b>105</b>Ab and <b>107</b>Ab of the sliders <b>105</b>A and <b>107</b>A from deviating from the resistor <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail above, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and a variety of alterations or changes can be made.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the low-resistance portion may be configured such that its resistance value decreases gradually from other portions. For example, the low-resistance portion may be configured such that the thickness of the resistor gradually increases from other portions, so that its resistance value decreases gradually from other portions. Furthermore, for example, the low-resistance portion may be configured such that the width of the resistor gradually increases from other portions, so that its resistance value decreases gradually from other portions.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
