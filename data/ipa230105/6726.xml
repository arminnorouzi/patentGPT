As such, 5G or pre-5G communication systems are also called &#x201c;beyond 4G network system&#x201d; or &#x201c;post LTE system&#x201d;. The 5G communication system defined by 3GPP is called the New Radio (NR) system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To achieve high data rates, 5G communication systems are being considered for implementation in the extremely high frequency (mmWave) band (e.g., 60 GHz band). To decrease path loss of radio waves and increase the transmission distance in the mmWave band, various technologies including beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antennas, analog beamforming, and large scale antennas have been considered for 5G communication systems and have been applied to NR systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, to improve system networks in 5G communication systems, technology development is under way regarding evolved small cells, advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (cloud RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving networks, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), interference cancellation, and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides, advanced coding and modulation (ACM) schemes such as hybrid frequency shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC), and advanced access technologies such as filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) are also under development for 5G systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, the Internet is evolving from a human centered network where humans create and consume information into the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed elements such as things exchange and process information. There has also emerged the Internet of Everything (IoE) technology that combines IoT technology with big data processing technology through connection with cloud servers. To realize IoT, technology elements related to sensing, wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure, service interfacing, and security are needed, and technologies interconnecting things such as sensor networks, machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine type communication (MTC) are under research in recent years. In IoT environments, it is possible to provide intelligent Internet technology services, which collect and analyze data created by interconnected things to add new values to human life. Through convergence and combination between existing information technologies and various industries, IoT technology may be applied to various areas such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, smart or connected cars, smart grids, health-care, smart consumer electronics, and advanced medical services.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, various attempts are being made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as sensor networks and machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine type communication (MTC) are being realized by use of 5G communication technologies including beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of cloud RANs as a big data processing technique described above may be an instance of convergence of 5G technology and IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, with recent advances in communication systems, various studies have been made to improve the beam failure recovery procedure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the disclosure are to provide a method and apparatus that can flexibly and efficiently perform beam failure recovery (BFR) operation in a wireless communication system, particularly, in a network cooperative communication situation.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the disclosure for solving the above problem, a method of a terminal in a wireless communication system is provided.

In the description of the disclosure, descriptions of well-known functions and structures incorporated herein may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the disclosure. The terms described below are defined in consideration of their functions in the disclosure, and these may vary depending on the intention of the user, the operator, or the custom. Hence, their meanings should be determined based on the overall contents of this specification.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the following description, the term &#x201c;base station (BS)&#x201d; refers to a main agent allocating resources to terminals and may be at least one of gNode B, eNode B, Node B, radio access unit, base station controller, network node, or transmission and reception point (TRP). The term &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; may refer to at least one of user equipment (UE), mobile station (MS), cellular phone, smartphone, computer, or multimedia system with a communication function. However, it is not limited to the above example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, the disclosure describes a technique for a terminal to receive broadcast information from a base station in a wireless communication system. The disclosure relates to a communication technique that combines 5G communication systems with IoT technology to support a higher data rate after 4G systems, and a system thereof. Based on 5G communication technology and IoT-related technology, the disclosure may be applied to intelligent services (e.g., services related to smart home, smart building, smart city, smart or connected car, health care, digital education, retail business, security, and safety).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Those terms used in the following description for indicating broadcast information, indicating control information, being related to communication coverage, indicating a state transition (e.g., event), indicating a network entity, indicating a message, indicating a component of a device, or the like are taken as illustration for ease of description. Accordingly, the disclosure is not limited by the terms to be described later, and other terms having an equivalent technical meaning may be used.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For convenience of description below, some terms and names defined in 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) or 3GPP new radio (NR) standards may be used. However, the disclosure is not limited by the above terms and names, and may be equally applied to systems conforming to other standards.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Wireless communication systems are evolving from early systems that provided voice-oriented services only to broadband wireless communication system that provide high-speed and high-quality packet data services, such as systems based on communication standards including 3GPP high speed packet access (HSPA), long term evolution (LTE) or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA), LTE-advanced (LTE-A), LTE-Pro, 3GPP2 high rate packet data (HRPD), ultra-mobile broadband (UMB), and IEEE 802.16e.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a representative example of the broadband wireless communication system, the LTE system employs orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in the downlink (DL) and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in the uplink (UL). The uplink refers to a radio link through which a terminal (user equipment (UE) or mobile station (MS)) sends a data or control signal to a base station (BS or eNode B), and the downlink refers to a radio link through which a base station sends a data or control signal to a terminal. In such a multiple access scheme, time-frequency resources used to carry user data or control information are allocated so as not to overlap each other (i.e., maintain orthogonality) to thereby identify the data or control information of a specific user.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As a post-LTE communication system, namely, the 5G communication system must be able to freely reflect various requirements of users and service providers and need to support services satisfying various requirements. Services considered for the 5G communication system include enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to some embodiments, eMBB aims to provide a data transmission rate that is more improved in comparison to the data transmission rate supported by existing LTE, LTE-A, or LTE-Pro. For example, in the 5G communication system, eMBB must be able to provide a peak data rate of 20 Gbps in the downlink and a peak data rate of 10 Gbps in the uplink from the viewpoint of one base station. At the same time, it has to provide an increased user perceived data rate for the terminal. To meet such a requirement, it is required to improve the transmission and reception technology including more advanced multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission. In addition, it is possible to satisfy the data transmission rate required by the 5G communication system by using a frequency bandwidth wider than 20 MHz in a frequency band of 3 to 6 GHz or 6 GHz or higher instead of the 2 GHz band currently used by LTE.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At the same time, in the 5G communication system, mMTC is considered to support application services such as the Internet of Things (IoT). For efficient support of IoT services, mMTC is required to support access of a massive number of terminals in a cell, extend the coverage for the terminal, lengthen the battery time for the terminal, and reduce the cost of the terminal. The Internet of Things must be able to support a massive number of terminals (e.g., 1,000,000 terminals/km<sup>2</sup>) in a cell to provide a communication service to sensors and components attached to various devices. In addition, since a terminal supporting mMTC is highly likely to be located in a shadow area not covered by a cell, such as the basement of a building, due to the nature of the service, it may require wider coverage compared to other services provided by the 5G communication system. A terminal supporting mMTC should be configured as a low-cost terminal, and since it is difficult to frequently replace the battery of a terminal, a very long battery life time may be required.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Finally, URLLC, as cellular-based mission-critical wireless communication for a specific purpose, is a service usable for remote control of robots or machinery, industrial automation, unmanned aerial vehicles, remote health care, and emergency alert, and should provide ultra-reliable and low-latency communication. For example, a URLLC service may have to support both an air interface latency of less than 0.5 ms and a packet error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or less as a requirement. Hence, for a service supporting URLLC, the 5G system must provide a transmission time interval (TTI) shorter than that of other services, and at the same time, a design requirement for allocating a wide resource in a frequency band is required. However, mMTC, URLLC, and eMBB described above are only an example of different service types, and the service types to which the disclosure is applied are not limited to the above-described examples.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The services considered in the above-mentioned 5G communication system should be provided in a form of convergence with each other based on a single framework. That is, for efficient resource management and control, it is preferable that individual services are integrated, controlled, and transmitted as a single system rather than being independently operated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, embodiments of the disclosure will be described by using LTE, LTE-A, LTE Pro or NR systems as an example, but the embodiments of the disclosure may be applied to other communication systems having similar technical backgrounds or channel configurations. Also, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the embodiments of the disclosure can be applied to other communication systems without significant modifications departing from the scope of the disclosure. Next, frame structures of LTE, LTE-A, and 5G systems are described with reference to the drawings, and the design direction of the 5G system will be described.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a time-frequency domain structure for transmission in a LTE, LTE-A, NR (5G), or similar wireless communication system according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the basic structure of a time-frequency resource region, which is a radio resource region in which data or control channels of a LTE, LTE-A, or NR system, based on a cyclic prefix (CP) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) (CP-OFDM) or single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) waveform, are transmitted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the horizontal axis indicates the time domain, and the vertical axis indicates the frequency domain. Uplink (UL) may mean a radio link through which a terminal transmits data or a control signal to a base station, and downlink (DL) may refer to a radio link through which a base station transmits data or a control signal to a terminal.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the time domain of LTE, LTE-A, and NR systems, the minimum transmission unit is an OFDM symbol or SC-FDMA symbol, and N<sub>symb </sub>symbols <b>1</b>-<b>05</b> may be gathered to constitute one slot <b>1</b>-<b>15</b>. In the case of LTE and LTE-A, two slots consisting of N<sub>symb</sub>=7 symbols may be gathered to constitute one subframe <b>1</b>-<b>40</b>. Also, according to some embodiments, in the case of 5G, two types of slot structures, a slot and a mini-slot (or non-slot) may be supported. N<sub>symb </sub>may have a value of 14 in the case of a 5G slot, and N<sub>symb </sub>may be set to one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in the case of a 5G mini-slot. In LTE and LTE-A, the length of a slot is fixed to 0.5 ms, and the length of a subframe is fixed to 1.0 ms; in the case of the NR system, the length of the slot or mini-slot may be flexibly changed according to the subcarrier spacing. In LTE and LTE-A, a radio frame <b>1</b>-<b>35</b> is a time domain unit consisting of 10 subframes. In LTE and LTE-A, the minimum transmission unit of the frequency domain is subcarriers in units of 15 kHz (subcarrier spacing=15 kHz), and the bandwidth of the total system transmission band is composed of a total of NBW subcarriers <b>1</b>-<b>10</b>. The flexible extended frame structure of the NR system will be described later.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the time-frequency domain, the basic resource unit is a resource element (RE) <b>1</b>-<b>30</b>, which may be represented by an OFDM or SC-FDMA symbol index and a subcarrier index. A resource block (RB) <b>1</b>-<b>20</b> (or, physical resource block (PRB)) is defined by N<sub>symb </sub>successive OFDM or SC-FDMA symbols <b>1</b>-<b>05</b> in the time domain and N<sub>RB </sub>successive subcarriers <b>1</b>-<b>25</b> in the frequency domain. Hence, one RB <b>1</b>-<b>20</b> is composed of N<sub>symb</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>RB </sub>REs <b>1</b>-<b>30</b>. In LTE and LTE-A systems, data is mapped in units of RBs, and the base station performs scheduling in units of RB-pairs constituting one subframe for a specific terminal. The number of SC-FDMA or OFDM symbols, N<sub>symb</sub>, is determined according to the length of a cyclic prefix (CP) inserted into each symbol for preventing inter-symbol interference; for example, N<sub>symb </sub>is set to 7 when a normal CP is applied, and N<sub>symb </sub>is set to 6 when an extended CP is applied. Compared with the normal CP, the extended CP can be applied to a system having a relatively large radio transmission distance to maintain orthogonality between symbols.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to some embodiments, the subcarrier spacing, CP length, and the other are essential information for OFDM transmission and reception, and smooth transmission/reception may be possible only when the base station and the terminal recognize them mutually as common values.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The frame structure of LTE and LTE-A systems described above are designed in consideration of typical voice/data communication, and are limited in scalability for satisfying various services and requirements like the NR system. Therefore, in the NR system, it is necessary to define and operate the frame structure flexibly in consideration of various services and requirements.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref> are diagrams illustrating an extended frame structure according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref> may include a subcarrier spacing, a CP length, a slot length, or the like as an essential parameter set defining the extended frame structure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At the initial stage of introduction, 5G systems are expected to coexist at least with existing LTE/LTE-A systems or to operate in dual mode. Thereby, existing LTE/LTE-A may provide stable system operation, and the 5G system may serve to provide an improved service. Hence, the extended frame structure of the 5G system may include at least an LTE/LTE-A frame structure or an essential parameter set. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a 5G frame structure, which is the same as an LTE/LTE-A frame structure, or an essential parameter set. In frame structure type A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz, 14 symbols form a slot of 1 ms, and 12 subcarriers (=180 kHz=12&#xd7;15 kHz) form a physical resource block (PRB).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in frame structure type B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz, 14 symbols form a slot of 0.5 ms, and 12 subcarriers (=360 kHz=12&#xd7;30 kHz) form a PRB. That is, compared to frame structure type A, the subcarrier spacing and the size of the PRB are increased by two times, and the slot length and the symbol length are reduced by two times.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in frame structure type C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the subcarrier spacing is 60 kHz, 14 symbols form a subframe of 0.25 ms, and 12 subcarriers (=720 kHz=12&#xd7;60 kHz) form a PRB. That is, compared to frame structure type A, the subcarrier spacing and the size of the PRB are increased by four times, and the slot length and the symbol length are reduced by four times.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">That is, the frame structure type may be generalized such that the subcarrier spacing, CP length, slot length, and the like of an essential parameter set in one frame structure type may be integer times those in another frame structure type, thereby providing high scalability. In addition, a subframe having a fixed length of 1 ms may be defined to indicate a reference time unit regardless of the above frame structure types. Hence, one subframe includes one slot in frame structure type A, one subframe includes two slots in frame structure type B, and one subframe includes four slots in frame structure type C. However, the extended frame structure is not limited to frame structure type A, B or C described above, may be applied to other subcarrier spacings such as 120 kHz and 240 kHz, and may have a different structure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to some embodiments, the above frame structure types may be applied in correspondence to various scenarios. In terms of a cell size, since a longer CP length can support a larger cell, frame structure type A may support a relatively larger cell in comparison to frame structure types B and C. In terms of an operating frequency band, since a larger subcarrier spacing is favorable to recover phase noise in a high frequency band, frame structure type C may support a relatively high operating frequency compared to frame structure types A and B. In terms of a service, since a shorter subframe length is favorable to support an ultra-low latency service such as URLLC, frame structure type C is more suitable for a URLLC service compared to frame structure types A and B.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, a plurality of frame structure types may be multiplexed in one system and may be operated in an integrated manner.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In NR, one component carrier (CC) or serving cell can be composed of up to 250 or more RBs. Hence, if the terminal always receives a full serving cell bandwidth like LTE, power consumption of the terminal may be extreme; to solve this problem, the base station can support the terminal to change the reception region within the cell by configuring one or more bandwidth parts (BWPs) to the terminal. In NR, the base station may configure an &#x201c;initial BWP&#x201d;, which is the bandwidth of control resource set (CORESET) #0 (or, common search space (CSS)), to the terminal by using a master information block (MIB). Then, the base station may configure a first BWP of the terminal through RRC signaling, and may notify one or more pieces of BWP configuration information, which may be indicated by downlink control information (DCI) in the future. Thereafter, the base station may indicate which band the terminal will use by notifying a BWP ID through DCI. If the terminal fails to receive DCI on the currently allocated BWP for a specific time or longer, the terminal returns to a &#x201c;default BWP&#x201d; and attempts to receive DCI.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of configuring BWPs in an NR (5G) communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the UE bandwidth <b>5</b>-<b>00</b> may be configured as two BWPs, that is, BWP #1 (<b>5</b>-<b>05</b>) and BWP #2 (<b>5</b>-<b>10</b>). The base station may configure one or multiple BWPs to the terminal, and may configure the following information for each BWP.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Configuration information 1: bandwidth of BWP </entry></row><row><entry>(number of PRBs constituting BWP)</entry></row><row><entry>Configuration information 2: frequency location of BWP </entry></row><row><entry>(such as an offset value with respect to a reference point, </entry></row><row><entry>where the reference point may be the center frequency of a </entry></row><row><entry>carrier, synchronization signal, or synchronization signal raster)</entry></row><row><entry>Configuration information 3: Numerology of BWP </entry></row><row><entry>(e.g., subcarrier spacing, cyclic prefix (CP) length, etc.)</entry></row><row><entry>Other information</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In addition to the configuration information in Table 1, various parameters related to the BWP may be configured in the terminal. The configuration information may be delivered from the base station to the terminal through higher layer signaling, for example, RRC signaling. At least one BWP among the configured one or multiple BWPs may be activated. Whether to activate a configured BWP may be semi-statically delivered from the base station to the terminal through RRC signaling, or may be dynamically delivered through a MAC control element (MAC CE) or DCI.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The configuration about a BWP supported in a 5G system may be used for various purposes. For example, when the bandwidth supported by the terminal is smaller than the system bandwidth, this can be supported through a BWP configuration. For example, a frequency location of the BWP (configuration information 1) in Table 1 may be configured to the terminal, so that the terminal may transmit and receive data at a specific frequency location within the system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">As another example, the base station may configure multiple BWPs to the terminal to support different numerologies. For example, to support a specific terminal in data transmission and reception using both a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz and a subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz, two BWPs may be configured to as to use subcarrier spacings of 15 kHz and 30 kHz, respectively. Different BWPs may be frequency division multiplexed (FDM); if data is to be transmitted and received at a specific subcarrier spacing, the BWP configured with the corresponding subcarrier spacing may be activated.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">As another example, for the purpose of reducing power consumption of the terminal, the base station may configure BWPs having different bandwidth sizes to the terminal. For example, when the terminal supports a very large bandwidth, for example, a bandwidth of 100 MHz and always transmits and receives data using the corresponding bandwidth, very large power consumption may be caused. Particularly in a situation where there is no traffic, it is very inefficient in terms of power consumption for the terminal to unnecessarily monitor the downlink control channel for the large bandwidth of 100 MHz. Hence, for the purpose of reducing power consumption of the terminal, the base station may configure a BWP with a relatively small bandwidth, for example, a BWP of 20 MHz to the terminal. In a situation where there is no traffic, the terminal may perform monitoring on the 20 MHz BWP; when data is generated, the terminal can transmit and receive data by using the BWP of 100 MHz according to an indication of the base station.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for indicating and switching BWPs according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">As in the above description of Table 1, the base station may configure one or multiple BWPs to the terminal, and may notify, as a configuration for each BWP, information about the bandwidth of the BWP, the frequency location of the BWP, the numerology of the BWP. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, two BWPs, BWP #1 (BWP #1, <b>6</b>-<b>05</b>) and BWP #2 (BWP #2, <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>) may be configured within the UE bandwidth <b>6</b>-<b>00</b> for one terminal.

The control region in which the terminal receives the PDCCH may be different depending on which BWP is activated among the configured BWPs, and the bandwidth through which the terminal monitors the PDCCH may vary correspondingly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The base station may additionally transmit an indicator for changing the configuration of the BWP to the terminal. Here, changing the configuration for the BWP may be considered the same as activating a specific BWP (e.g., switching activation from BWP A to BWP B). The base station may transmit a configuration switching indicator to the terminal in a specific slot; the terminal may apply, from a specific time point after receiving the configuration switching indicator from the base station, the configuration changed according to the configuration switching indicator to determine the BWP to be activated, and perform monitoring of the PDCCH in the control region configured on the activated BWP.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the base station may transmit a configuration switching indication <b>6</b>-<b>15</b>, which instructs to switch the active BWP from existing BWP #1 (<b>6</b>-<b>05</b>) to BWP #2 (<b>6</b>-<b>10</b>), to the terminal in slot #1 (<b>6</b>-<b>30</b>). After receiving the corresponding indicator, the terminal may activate BWP #2 (<b>6</b>-<b>10</b>) according to the contents of the indicator. Here, a transition time <b>6</b>-<b>20</b> for switching the BWP may be required, and the time point for switching and applying the active BWP may be determined accordingly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a case in which a transition time <b>6</b>-<b>20</b> of one slot is required after receiving the configuration switching indication <b>6</b>-<b>15</b>. Data transmission and reception may be not performed during the corresponding transition time <b>6</b>-<b>20</b> (<b>6</b>-<b>60</b>). Hence, BWP #2 (<b>6</b>-<b>10</b>) may be activated in slot #2 (<b>6</b>-<b>35</b>), and transmission and reception of a control channel and data may be performed on the corresponding BWP.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The base station may configure in advance one or plural BWPs to the terminal through higher layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling), and activation may be indicated in a manner of mapping the configuration switching indicator <b>6</b>-<b>15</b> with one of the BWP configurations preconfigured by the base station.

In a wireless communication network including multiple cells, transmission and reception points (TRPs), or beams, coordinated transmission between cells, TRPs, and/or beams is one of the element technologies that can increase the strength of a signal received by the terminal, or efficiently perform interference control between cells, TRPs, and/or beams to satisfy the various service requirements.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0168">Joint transmission (JT) is a representative transmission technology for the coordinated communication described above, and it is possible to increase the strength of a signal received by a terminal by supporting the terminal by use of different cells, TRPs, and/or beams through this technology. Meanwhile, as the characteristics of channels between a terminal and a cell, TRP, and/or beam can be significantly different from each other, it is necessary to apply different precoding, MCS, and resource allocation to links between a terminal and a cell, TRP, and/or beam. In particular, in the case of non-coherent joint transmission (NC-JT) supporting non-coherent precoding between cells, TRPs, and/or beams, it becomes important to configure individual downlink transmission information for each cell, TRP, and/or beam.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating examples of a radio resource allocation process for each TRP depending upon joint transmission (JT) techniques and situations according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0170">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, indicia <b>9</b>-<b>00</b> illustrates coherent joint transmission (C-JT) supporting coherent precoding between cells, TRPs, and/or beams.

If the terminal is unable to normally receive a PDCCH, this may imply that a beam failure has occurred between the terminal and the base station. The criterion and method for determining whether a terminal is able to normally receive a PDCCH will be described later. The NR system supports a beam failure recovery (BFR) procedure for coping with a dynamic beam failure between the base station and the terminal to enable smooth downlink transmission.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0176">The BFR procedure in an NR system may be divided into four main processes. The first process is a process of detecting a beam failure, and may be called a beam failure detection (BFD) process and will be described later. In the BFD process, the terminal determines whether to receive a PDCCH normally, and if determining to be unable to normally receive a PDCCH, the terminal reports a beam failure to a higher layer. The higher layer of the terminal may detect a beam failure through the reporting, and may determine whether to perform the next process of BFR. The criterion of determining whether a terminal can normally receive a PDCCH is a hypothetical PDCCH reception block error rate (BLER) of the terminal, and the terminal may determine the same by comparing this with a preset threshold. To calculate the hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER of the terminal, a reference signal (RS) set is required for BFD, and this will be referenced later as a BFD RS set. The BFD RS set may include up to two RSs, and the corresponding RS may be a periodic CSI-RS transmitted through a single port, or a synchronization/broadcast channel block (SS/PBCH block, SSB). A BFD RS set may be configured through higher layer signaling of the base station. If a BFD RS set is not configured through higher layer signaling, a part or all of RSs referenced in an activated TCI state of CORESET(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring of the UE may be included in the BFD RS set. If there are two or more RSs referenced in a TCI state, an RS referencing &#x2018;QCL-typeD&#x2019; including beam information may be included in the BFD RS set. The terminal may calculate a hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER based on only an RS referenced in an activated TCI state of CORESET(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring among the RSs belonging to the BFD RS set. The terminal may calculate a hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER with reference to Table 11 below.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00011" num="00011"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 11</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Attribute</entry><entry>Value for BLER</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>DCI format</entry><entry>1-0</entry></row><row><entry>Number of control OFDM symbols</entry><entry>Same as the number of symbols </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of CORESET QCLed with </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>respective CSI-RS for BFD</entry></row><row><entry>Aggregation level (CCE)</entry><entry>8</entry></row><row><entry>Ratio of hypothetical PDCCH RE</entry><entry>0 dB</entry></row><row><entry>energy to average CSI-RS RE energy</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Ratio of hypothetical PDCCH DMRS</entry><entry>0 dB</entry></row><row><entry>energy to average CSI-RS RE energy</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Bandwidth (MHz)</entry><entry>Same as the number of PRBs </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of CORESET QCLed with </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>respective CSI-RS for BFD</entry></row><row><entry>Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)</entry><entry>Same as the SCS of CORESET </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>QCLed with respective </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CSI-RS for BFD</entry></row><row><entry>DMRS precoder granularity</entry><entry>REG bundle size</entry></row><row><entry>REG bundle size</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry>CP length</entry><entry>Same as the CP length of </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CORESET QCLed with </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>respective CSI-RS for BFD</entry></row><row><entry>Mapping from REG to CCE</entry><entry>Distributed</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0131" num="0177">Table 11 provides a configuration about a hypothetical PDCCH referenced by the terminal when calculating a hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER.

The terminal calculates a hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER for each CORESET having an activated TCI state referring to an RS included in the BFD RS set; if the hypothetical PDCCH reception BLERs for all CORESETs exceed the preset threshold, a beam failure indication is reported to a higher layer. When the higher layer of the terminal receives a beam failure indication report, it increments the beam failure instance count; when the count value reaches a set maximum value, it can determine whether to perform the next process of BFR; and it can refer to the following parameters configured for a higher layer operation process.<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0178">beamFailureInstanceMaxCount: the maxim number of times of beam failure indication reporting from a lower layer of the terminal, required for performing the next process of BFR</li>        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0179">beamFailureDetectionTimer: a timer setting for initializing the number of times of beam failure reporting of the terminal</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0132" num="0180">The second process in the BFR procedure of the NR system is a process for finding a new beam having a good channel state, and it will be called a new candidate beam identification process and described later. When the higher layer of the terminal detects a beam failure and determines to initiate a process for searching for a new beam, it may request the terminal to report information about a new candidate beam, for example, L1-reference signal received power (RSRP). For the terminal to calculate information about a new candidate beam, the base station may configure a candidate beam RS set to the terminal through higher layer signaling. The candidate beam RS set may include up to 16 RSs, and each RS may be a periodic CSI-RS or an SSB. When the higher layer of the terminal requests the terminal to report information about a new candidate beam, the terminal reports index information and L1-RSRP measurement values for RSs having an L1-RSRP value greater than an RSRP threshold set through higher layer signaling, among the RSs belonging to the candidate beam RS set. The higher layer of the terminal may obtain information about new beams having a good channel state through reporting.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0181">When the higher layer of the terminal obtains information about new beams having a good channel state, it selects one of them and notifies the physical layer of the selected one, and the terminal transmits a request signal for BFR to the base station. This corresponds to the third process of the BFR procedure, and will be described later as a BFR request process. The higher layer of the terminal selects, from the candidate beam RS set, a new RS to be referenced by the terminal for a BFR request based on information about the new beam, and notifies the physical layer of the selected new RS. The terminal may obtain configuration information on transmission of a physical random access channel (PRACH) through which the BFR request is to be transmitted, based on new RS information for the BFR request and BFR request resource information configured through higher layer signaling. For example, the base station and the terminal may exchange higher layer signaling information as described in Table 12 below to deliver configuration information about PRACH transmission through which a BFR request is to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 12</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>BeamFailureRecoveryConfig information element</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>-- ASN1START</entry></row><row><entry>-- TAG-BEAMFAILURERECOVERYCONFIG-START</entry></row><row><entry>BeamFailureRecoveryConfig ::= SEQUENCE {</entry></row><row><entry>rootSequenceIndex-BFR INTEGER (0..137) OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>rach-ConfigBFR RACH-ConfigGeneric OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>rsrp-ThresholdSSB RSRP-Range OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>candidateBeamRSList SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..maxNrofCandidateBeams)) OF PRACH-</entry></row><row><entry>ResourceDedicatedBFR OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>ssb-perRACH-Occasion ENUMERATED {oneEighth, oneFourth, oneHalf, one, two,</entry></row><row><entry>four, eight, sixteen} OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex INTEGER (0..15) OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>recoverySearchSpaceId SearchSpaceId OPTIONAL, -- Need R</entry></row><row><entry>ra-Prioritization RA-Prioritization OPTIONAL, -- Need R</entry></row><row><entry>beamFailureRecoveryTimer ENUMERATED {ms10, ms20, ms40, ms60, ms80,</entry></row><row><entry>ms100, ms150, ms200} OPTIONAL, -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>...,</entry></row><row><entry>[[</entry></row><row><entry>msg1-SubcarrierSpacing-v1530 SubcarrierSpacing OPTIONAL -- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>]]</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry>PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR ::= CHOICE {</entry></row><row><entry>ssb BFR-SSB-Resource,</entry></row><row><entry>csi-RS BFR-CSIRS-Resource</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry>BFR-SSB-Resource ::= SEQUENCE {</entry></row><row><entry>ssb SSB-Index,</entry></row><row><entry>ra-PreambleIndex INTEGER (0..63),</entry></row><row><entry>...</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry>BFR-CSIRS-Resource ::= SEQUENCE {</entry></row><row><entry>csi-RS NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId,</entry></row><row><entry>ra-OccasionList SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..maxRA-OccasionsPerCSIRS)) OF INTEGER</entry></row><row><entry>(0..maxRA-Occasions-1) OPTIONAL, -- Need R</entry></row><row><entry>ra-PreambleIndex INTEGER (0..63) OPTIONAL, -- Need R</entry></row><row><entry>...</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry>-- TAG-BEAMFAILURERECOVERYCONFIG-STOP</entry></row><row><entry>-- ASN1STOP</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0135" num="0182">The higher layer signaling information BeamFailureRecoveryConfig includes information about PRACH transmission through which a BFR request is to be transmitted.

The signaling information BeamFailureRecoveryConfig among the configuration parameters for BFR includes a search space index for receiving a PDCCH used by the base station to transmit a random access response signal in response to a BFR request. The base station may transmit a PDCCH by using resources of a search space configured for a response. When the terminal receives a PDCCH through a search space for receiving the PDCCH, the terminal determines that the BFR procedure is ended. When the terminal receives a PDCCH through a search space for receiving the PDCCH, the base station may indicate, to the terminal, a new beam configuration for PDCCH or PUCCH transmission.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0195">The disclosure provides a BFR method and process in terms of a simplified procedure in an NR system considering network cooperative communication, and the corresponding method and process will be described later as partial BFR. Partial BFR may be defined as performing BFR by using only some of the existing BFR procedures of the NR system according to various embodiments of the disclosure as described below, or as partially performing existing BFR by simplifying some of all processes.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0196">In the current NR system, a BFD RS set may include up to two RSs, and the terminal may be configured with information on an RS belonging to the BFD RS set via higher layer signaling from the base station; if the BFD RS set is not configured through higher layer signaling, the terminal may include, in the BFD RS set, up to two of some or all of the RSs referenced in an activated TCI state of CORESET(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring. In this case, since the base station cannot obtain information about the BFD RS set determined by the terminal, it may have low understanding of a BFR request signal from the terminal.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0197">As another problem, while the BFD RS set can include up to two RSs, up to three CORESETs may be configured for PDCCH monitoring of the terminal in the current NR system. Further, in the Release 16 NR system, in the case of multiple PDCCH-based multi-TRP transmission, the maximum number of CORESETs per BWP has been increased to 5; in Release 16 NR-UE also, there has been a discussion about increasing the maximum number of CORESETs per BWP to support wideband operation. Hence, like existing BFD operation, if hypothetical PDCCH reception BLERs are calculated for all RSs in the BFD RS set with reference to Table 11 above, and if beam failure indication reporting to a higher layer is performed only when all the BLER values exceed the threshold, the delay time to proceed to the rest of the BFR process may be increased, and a situation in which only a BLER value for a specific RS in the BFD RS set exceeds the threshold cannot be detected. Therefore, if the BFD RS set is not configured to the terminal through higher layer signaling, it is possible to perform the BFR procedure with a low delay time by increasing the efficiency of the BFD process for determining whether smooth downlink transmission between the base station and the terminal is possible, in a manner of making a configuration permitting a beam failure indication to be issued even with some of RSs in the BFD RS set selected among RSs referenced in an activated TCI state of the CORESET(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring of the terminal, configuring plural BFD RS sets to the terminal via higher layer signaling, or indicating a scheme for arbitrarily selecting plural BFD RS sets to the terminal by the base station.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0198">Further, in the current NR system, if the base station configures a BFD RS set to the terminal via higher layer signaling, the RS in the corresponding configuration cannot be changed. The terminal may detect a beam failure based on only a RS referenced in an activated TCI state of the CORESET configured for PDCCH monitoring among RSs included in the BFD RS set. Hence, according to the foregoing description, when a BFD RS set is configured through higher layer signaling, if a specific RS among the RSs belonging to the BFD RS set configured through higher layer signaling does not correspond to an RS referenced in the activated TCI state of the CORESET configured for PDCCH monitoring of the terminal, the specific RS is not used by the terminal to detect a beam failure. As a result, when there is a mismatch between the BFD RS set configured through higher layer signaling and the RSs referenced in the activated TCI state of the CORESET configured for PDCCH monitoring of the terminal, stable beam failure detection of the terminal is not expected, which may result in degradation of downlink reception performance. For example, because the base station can configure a BFD RS set to the terminal through RRC signaling while activating a TCI state of the CORESET through MAC CE signaling, a mismatch may occur between the two due to a difference in delay time according to the signaling schemes. To solve the above-mentioned problems, a scheme for selecting some of RSs referenced in an activated TCI state of the CORESET(s) configured for PDCCH monitoring of the terminal may be indicated to the terminal, so that the base station may recognize information on the BFD RS set selected by the terminal. Thereby, it is possible to increase the understanding of the base station for a BFR request signal from the terminal. Or, it is possible to perform the BFR procedure with a low delay time by increasing the efficiency of the BFD process for determining whether smooth downlink transmission between the base station and the terminal is possible. Or, it is possible to perform the BFD process for effectively identifying a beam failure between the base station and the terminal by instructing to include a suitable RS in the BFD RS set. Such an issue can be equally applied to the candidate beam RS set used in the new candidate beam identification process.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0199">In addition, as the BFR procedure of the current NR system is designed without considering an operation like the multi-TRP/panel operation of the base station, in the case of the multi-TRP/panel operation of the base station, the BFR procedure can be efficiently performed if individual links between the multi-TRPs/panels of the base station and the terminal are used, rather than following the existing BFR procedure. For example, among multi-TRPs/panels connected to the terminal, if a link between the terminal and a TRP or panel that does not undergo a beam failure is used, BFR for the link between the TRP or panel experiencing a beam failure and the terminal can be achieved in a low delay time. Simplification of the BFR procedure in consideration of multiple links of the multi-TRPs/panels in embodiments of the disclosure is not limited to multi-TRPs/panels, and can be equally applied to a single-TRP/panel situation in an environment where plural BFD RS sets are defined and BFR is performed for each BFD RS set.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0200">Next, embodiments of the disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

However, this is given as an example for convenience of description, and the disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0211">When the base station configures one BFD RS set <b>10</b>-<b>25</b> {CSI-RS #0, CSI-RS #1, CSI-RS #2, CSI-RS #3, CSI-RS #4} to the terminal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, two BFD RS groups may be formed in the BFD RS set as BFD RS group #0 (<b>10</b>-<b>30</b>) {CSI-RS #0, CSI-RS #1, CSI-RS #2}, and BFD RS group #1 (<b>10</b>-<b>35</b>) {CSI-RS #3, CSI-RS #4}, where the determining criterion of the BFD RS set is the same CORESETPoolIndex value. That is, among RSs belonging to the BFD RS set, RSs belonging to CORESETs having the same CORESETPoolIndex may belong to the same BFD RS group. As another example, when the base station configures the terminal with two BFD RS sets as BFD RS set #0 (<b>10</b>-<b>40</b>) {CSI-RS #0, CSI-RS #1, CSI-RS #2} and BFD RS set #1 (<b>10</b>-<b>45</b>) {CSI-RS #3, CSI-RS #4}, BFD RS set #0 can be grouped into BFD RS group #0-0 (<b>10</b>-<b>45</b>) {CSI-RS #0, CSI-RS #1} and BFD RS group #0-1 (<b>10</b>-<b>50</b>) {CSI-RS #2}, and BFD RS set #1 may be grouped into BFD RS group #1-0 (<b>10</b>-<b>60</b>) {CSI-RS #3} and BFD RS group #1-1 (<b>10</b>-<b>65</b>) {CSI-RS #4}. In this case, the criterion for dividing BFD RS group #0-0 and BFD RS group #0-1 may be QCL-Type. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, RSs set to QCL-TypeD are grouped first. Hence, CSI-RS #0 set as referenced RS of QCL-TypeA and QCL-TypeD in CORESET #0 (<b>10</b>-<b>00</b>), and CSI-RS #1 set as referenced RS of QCL-TypeA and QCL-TypeD in CORESET #1 (<b>10</b>-<b>05</b>) may be grouped first into BFD RS group #0-0, and remaining CSI-RS #2 may be grouped into BFD RS group #0-1. Further, the criterion for dividing BFD RS group #1-0 and BFD RS group #1-1 may be a CORESET index value. As an example, among CORESET #3 and CORESET #4 configured to have an activated TCI state referencing RSs belonging to BFD RS set #1, CSI-RS #3 set as QCL referenced RS of CORESET #3 having a lower index value may be assigned first to BFD RS group #1-0, and then CSI-RS #4 set as QCL referenced RS of CORESET #4 having a next lower index value may be assigned to BFD RS group #1-1. Besides the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the criteria listed above or a combination thereof may be used by the base station that configures information on the BFD RS set or BFD RS group to the terminal via higher layer signaling, or by the terminal that composes a BFD RS set or BFD RS group when there is no configuration information about the BFD RS set or BFD RS group from the base station.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Second Embodiment: BFD Process Configuration and Method According to Partial BFR</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0212">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the terminal may be configured with a BFD RS set and BFD RS group through higher layer signaling by the base station, and may be configured with information required in the BFD process according to the configured BFD RS set and BFD RS group information. The information required in the BFD process may include information such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount indicating the maximum indication value of the beam failure indication, and beamFailureDetectionTimer indicating a value at which the beam failure detection timer is reset. For instance, as shown by indicia <b>10</b>-<b>25</b> to <b>10</b>-<b>35</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, if the terminal has been configured with one BFD RS set and two BFD RS groups, it may be configured with information such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount and beamFailureDetectionTimer required in the BFD process for each BFD RS group. As another example, as shown by indicia <b>10</b>-<b>40</b> to <b>10</b>-<b>65</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the terminal has been configured with two BFD RS sets and two BFD RS groups per BFD RS set, it may be configured with information such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount and beamFailureDetectionTimer required in the BFD process for each BFD RS group per BFD RS set, or it may be configured with the same information such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount and beamFailureDetectionTimer required in the BFD process for all BFD RS groups in each BFD RS set. As another example, when the terminal composes a BFD RS set and BFD RS group as it has not been configured with a BFD RS set and BFD RS group through higher layer signaling by the base station, the base station may configure information required in the BFD process through higher layer signaling for each BFD RS group per BFD RS set.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example where plural pieces of information required in the BFD process, such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount and beamFailureDetectionTimer, are configured according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0214">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, MaxCount1 and MaxCount2 mean different instances of beamFailureInstanceMaxCount, and have values of 2 and 3, respectively. In addition, Timer1 and Timer2 mean different instances of beamFailureDetectionTimer, and have values of 6 and 4, respectively. Each configuration information in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may be applied when information required in the BFD process, such as beamFailureInstanceMaxCount and beamFailureDetectionTimer, is configured for two BFD RS groups in a single BFD RS set, for two BFD RS sets without a BFD RS group, or for each of two BFD RS sets each having two or more BFD RS groups.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0215">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, beamFailureDetectionTimer1 is incremented by 1 every beam failure indication periodicity and is reset when reaching 6, and beamFailureDetectionTimer2 is incremented by 1 every beam failure indication periodicity and is reset when reaching 4. BFI_COUNTER1 is a counter that is incremented when a beam failure indication occurs in the BFD process in which MaxCount1 and beamFailureDetectionTimer1 are configured, where when a beam failure occurs for all BFD RSs belonging to the corresponding group or set according to which group or set is applied as described above, the corresponding BFD procedure regards this as a beam failure indication. BFI_COUNTER2 is a counter that is incremented when a beam failure indication occurs in the BFD process in which MaxCount2 and beamFailureDetectionTimer2 are configured, where the same description as for BFI_COUNTER1 may be applied to the corresponding BFD process. BFI_COUNTER1 and BFI_COUNTER2 are reset when beamFailureDetectionTimer1 and beamFailureDetectionTimer2 respectively reach their maximum values. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, it can be seen that the beam failure indication corresponding to BFI_COUNTER1 occurs when beamFailureDetectionTimer1 is 2 and 6, and BFI_COUNTER1 increases by 1 at each beam failure indication. At this time, as the value of MaxCount1 is 2, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, when BFI_COUNTER1 reaches MaxCount, the next step of BFR is initiated. Further, it can be seen that the beam failure indication corresponding to BFI_COUNTER2 occurs when beamFailureDetectionTimer2 is 4, and BFI_COUNTER2 increases by 1 at occurrence of this beam failure indication. However, since BFI_COUNTER2 did not reach MaxCount2 until beamFailureDetectionTimer2 reaches 4, beamFailureDetectionTimer2 is reset to 1 after 4, and BFI_COUNTER2 is also reset to 0 at this time. Thereafter, when beamFailureDetectionTimer2 is 4, a beam failure indication occurs and BFI_COUNTER2 increases by 1, but as beamFailureDetectionTimer2 has already reached 4, beamFailureDetectionTimer2 is reset to 1 again at the next periodicity and BFI_COUNTER2 is also reset to 0. On the other hand, the above-described example is provided only for the convenience of description of an embodiment of the disclosure, and the disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0216">Third embodiment: new candidate beam indication process configuration and method according to partial BFR</p><p id="p-0156" num="0217">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the terminal may perform a process of replacing a beam with a new beam to overcome a beam failure occurring in the BFR process. A method of indicating a new candidate beam determined in this process may be defined as new candidate beam indication. The terminal may be configured with one or plural candidateBeamRSLists through higher layer signaling by the base station. One or plural candidateBeamRSLists correspond respectively to the BFD RS set or plural BFD RS groups in the BFD RS set, and are defined as a list of new candidate beams to become a replacement due to beam failure. To derive a new candidate beam for each BFD RS set or BFD RS group connected to one or plural configured candidateBeamRSLists, the terminal measures L1-RSRP for new candidate beams in candidateBeamRSList and compares it with a reference value. Here, as the reference value, separate values or the same value may be set for one or plural candidateBeamRSLists. A higher layer of the terminal selects one of the new candidate beams having L1-RSRP higher than the reference value (threshold) and delivers it to the physical layer of the terminal, and the physical layer of the terminal delivers information on the new candidate beam to the base station through a physical uplink channel connected to the received new candidate beam.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0218">For example, candidateBeamRSList may include a plurality of new candidate beams; each new candidate beam may have an SSB index or a CSI-RS resource index; and one of PRACH, SRS, and PUCCH resources is included as a physical uplink channel connected to the corresponding new candidate beam. One new candidate beam may be connected (or, associated) with one physical uplink channel. As another example, candidateBeamRSList may include a plurality of physical uplink channels, and each physical uplink channel may be associated with an SSB index or CSI-RS resource index indicating a new candidate beam. Here, candidateBeamRSList may include physical uplink channels of only one type among PRACH, SRS, and PUCCH, or may include physical uplink channels of two or more types.

As an example, when the base station has configured a BFD RS set or group to the terminal through higher layer signaling, if the number of times that the hypothetical PDCCH reception BLER calculated for a specific BFD RS in the configured BFD RS set or group exceeds a reference value becomes greater than a specific number of times, the terminal may request the base station to change the specific BFD RS. Here, as a request method from the terminal to the base station, an explicit scheme such as a PUCCH-based scheduling request method or PUSCH-based MAC-CE activation may be used. the PUCCH-based scheduling request scheme may be performed in a manner where the terminal requests PDSCH scheduling to the base station and performs activation of a new BFD RS through downlink MAC-CE reception from the base station or in a manner where the terminal requests PUSCH scheduling to the base station and transmits a PUSCH including a MAC-CE indicating activation of a new BFD RS. PUSCH-based MAC-CE activation is a method in which the terminal transmits information on the BFD RS to be changed to the base station by including it in an uplink MAC-CE of the PUSCH payload.

Here, the TRP group refers to a case in which BFD RSs corresponding to multiple TRPs belong to one BFD RS set or belong to a BFD RS group defined in the BFD RS set.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0237">For example, a case where BFD RS #1 and BFD RS #2 are present in one BFD RS set, and BFD RS #1 corresponds to TRP #1 and BFD RS #2 corresponds to TRP #2 can be considered. Here, the correspondence between BFD RS and TRP may be a case where the BFD RS exists as an RS referenced in the TCI state of the CORESET transmitted by the TRP, in which case the CORESET may be configured with a specific CORESETPoolIndex value. Further, the correspondence between BFD RS and TRP may also be a case where the QCL assumption of a specific CORESET has plural TCI states, and the BFD RS exists as an RS referenced in one of the plural TCI states. For example, the terminal may be configured with BFD RS set 1, composed of RSs referenced in the TCI states of CORESETs whose CORESETPoolIndex values are 0 and 1, and BFD RS set 2, composed of RSs referenced in the TCI states of CORESETs whose CORESETPoolIndex values are 2 and 3, through higher layer signaling, or may at its discretion configure them if they are not configured through higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0238">In this case, the terminal may perform partial BFR operation for BFD RS sets 1 and 2, respectively. The terminal calculates hypothetical PDCCH BLER values for all BFD RSs in BFD RS set 1, and if all the hypothetical PDCCH BLER values are smaller than the reference value, BFD may be indicated by the physical layer of the terminal to a higher layer. The BFD process for partial BFR operation per TRP group may be performed similarly to the second embodiment described above.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0239">Similar to the third embodiment, the terminal may perform a process of replacing a beam with a new beam to overcome beam failure in partial BFR operation per TRP group. A method of indicating a new candidate beam determined in this process may be defined as new candidate beam indication.

One or plural candidateBeamRSLists correspond respectively to the BFD RS set or plural BFD RS groups in the BFD RS set, and are defined as a list of new candidate beams to become a replacement due to beam failure. Similar to the BFD RS set or group for partial BFR operation per TRP group, for each candidateBeamRSList, there can be new candidate beams corresponding to TRPs connected to the BFD RSs included in the corresponding BFD RS set or BFD RS group.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0240">For instance, as in the example above, when the terminal is configured with BFD RS set 1, composed of RSs referenced in the TCI states of CORESETs whose CORESETPoolIndex values are 0 and 1, and BFD RS set 2, composed of RSs referenced in the TCI states of CORESETs whose CORESETPoolIndex values are 2 and 3, through higher layer signaling by the base station, or when the terminal configures them at its discretion if no such configuration, candidateBeamRSList #1 corresponding to BFD RS set 1 may include new candidate beams connected respectively to TRPs that transmit CORESETs having CORESEToolIndex values of 0 and 1, and candidateBeamRSList #2 corresponding to BFD RS set 2 may include new candidate beams connected respectively to TRPs that transmit CORESETs having CORESEToolIndex values of 2 and 3.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0241">The terminal measures L1-RSRPs for new candidate beams in candidateBeamRSList and compares them with a reference value, and a higher layer of the terminal selects some of the new candidate beams having L1-RSRP higher than the reference value and delivers them to the physical layer of the terminal.

For example, when there are 4 new candidate beams in candidateBeamRSList, new candidate beams #1 and #2 correspond to TRP #1 and new candidate beams #3 and #4 correspond to TRP #2, and new candidate beams #1, #3 and #4 have L1-RSRP greater than the reference value among them, the terminal may select only new candidate beam #1 at its discretion among the three or may select new candidate beams #1 and #3 in order to select at least one new candidate beam corresponding respectively to TRP #1 and TRP #2. The new candidate beams selected at the upper layer of the terminal are delivered to the physical layer, and the terminal transmits information about the new candidate beams to the base station through a physical uplink channel connected to the delivered new candidate beams.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0242">Similarly to the fourth embodiment, when the maximum value of the beam failure indication is reached as described above for one of plural BFD RS sets or groups, the terminal notifies the base station of a beam failure situation and perform a beam failure recovery request (BFRQ) process for requesting beam failure recovery by delivering the determined new candidate beam to the base station. The terminal may determine a new candidate beam in candidateBeamRSList connected to the BFD RS set or group that has reached the maximum value of the beam failure indication, and perform BFRQ by using a physical uplink channel connected to the determined new candidate beam.

After PRACH transmission, the base station configures a recovery search space set, and the terminal monitors PDCCHs in the recovery search space set to be scheduled with a PDSCH including a MAC-CE that changes the TCI state of a CORESET in which a beam failure has occurred. In this case, the base station may configure one recovery search space set to the terminal, and the terminal may assume that plural PDCCHs monitored in the corresponding recovery search space set are QCLed with plural new candidate beams. For example, when new candidate beam #1 and new candidate beam #2 are selected and one recovery search space set is configured, the terminal may assume, for the PDCCHs monitored in the recovery search space set, that the first PDCCH is QCLed with new candidate beam #1 and the second PDCCH is QCLed with new candidate beam #2 in transmission order.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0246">As another example, the base station may configure plural recovery search space sets to the terminal, and the recovery search space sets may be connected respectively to new candidate beams through higher layer signaling.

Further, it can also be assumed that the PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH has the same QCL relationship as the new candidate beam in the QCL relationship with the PDCCH.
