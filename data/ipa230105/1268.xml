A standardized operation during climbing is directly related to the personal safety of an operator and the operation safety of an electric power system. Injury and death accidents frequently happen to pole-climbing operators especially in recent years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the related art, pole climbers are the most commonly used pole-climbing tool.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. A pole-climbing person must be professionally trained before using pole climbers formally. Since the operator has to keep balance during force conversion, the pole-climbing person climbs completely based on the balance of force to change the feet in an up-down direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Whether pole climbers can fasten the pole depends completely on the operator and is determined completely by the personal experience of the operator, so the security and the reliability of the operation are low.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">3. Climbing with pole climbers needs a high labor intensity, leads to a short standing time, wastes a lot of energy and tires the operator easily. Therefore, the operator feels heavy and panic during the operation, so the operator is easy to lose his concentration during the operation and causes an accident.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the related art, various pole-climbing devices in place of humans climbing poles to perform dangerous work are provided. The pole-climbing devices are divided into inchworm-type pole-climbing devices and roller-type pole-climbing devices according to their ways of climbing. The main feature of a roller-type pole-climbing device is to positively impose a positive pressure on a columnar pole through a roller to generate a friction to overcome the gravity. The main feature of an inchworm-type pole-climbing device is that the upper end and the lower end of the device grip and release a pole by turns, and climbing is implemented by movement or rotation of a connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For complex working conditions, manual pole climbing is still needed. Compared with non-manual climbing, in the manual climbing, a large load needs to be borne and the requirements for safety and reliability are high.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure provides a pole-gripping mechanism, for a manned pole-climbing work platform.
