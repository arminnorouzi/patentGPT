Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been demonstrated that 100% oxygen administration increased mental and physical performance, including decreased reaction times and improved fatigue recovery. The delivery of 100% oxygen is difficult without sealed masks, making it impractical during athletic events. Recent studies have shown that a relatively low percentage, 30-40% hyperoxic air may deliver a similar decrease in reaction time and increased cognitive performance. Therefore, it is desirable to have a system for the delivery of hyperoxic air to athletes in an easy-to-use fashion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Studies have demonstrated aerobic fitness to be higher in users who integrated aromatherapy into exercise and other athletic activities. For example, cardamom has demonstrable effects on the autonomic nervous system as measured by a decrease in heart rate variability during exercise. Odors have been shown to have physiological effects on athletes during physical tasks such as conditioning, weight training, etc. For example, peppermint has been associated with subjects easing physical workload and temporal demand incurred during physical activity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The effects on exercisers from aromatherapy have been shown to include reduced fatigue during exercise, improved feeling during exercise, and positively impact exercise satisfaction and persistence. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a system to integrate both supplemental oxygen and aromatherapy into an athlete's training regime as a mechanism to improve performance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed herein is an apparatus, a system, a kit and/or a method of delivering both aromatherapy and supplemental oxygen to a user.
