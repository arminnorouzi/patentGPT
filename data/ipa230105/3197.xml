An execution subject of the embodiment of the present disclosure may be a computer device, which refers to an electronic device with computing and processing capabilities. For example, the computer device may be a server. The method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>101</b>, characteristic data and actual temperature of a first wind turbine of n wind turbines are acquired.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Wind turbines are electrical equipment that convert wind energy into mechanical energy, which drives a rotor to rotate, and finally outputs alternating current. The first wind turbine may be any wind turbine among the n wind turbines. The characteristic data of the first wind turbine is intended to characterize a working state of the first wind turbine. For example, the characteristic data of the first wind turbine may include at least one of the following: wind speed, wind mill speed, blade angle, yaw angle, active power, turbine speed, and gearbox oil temperature. The embodiment of the present disclosure does not limit the type and number of the characteristic data. In a possible implementation, the characteristic data of the first wind turbine needs to include active power and turbine speed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>102</b>, a predicted temperature set is acquired by inputting the characteristic data of the first wind turbine into a temperature prediction model corresponding to each of the n wind turbines.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The temperature prediction model is used to obtain predicted temperature based on the characteristic data. The predicted temperature may represent healthy temperature (normal temperature) of the first wind turbine under current operating conditions. In the embodiment of the present disclosure, n temperature prediction models include the temperature prediction model corresponding to the first wind turbine, and the temperature prediction models respectively corresponding to n&#x2212;1 second wind turbines. Exemplarily, the n wind turbines are adjacent wind turbines of the same model. That is, the second wind turbine refers to an adjacent wind turbine of the same model in the same wind farm as the first wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step <b>103</b>, whether the first wind turbine encounters a fault is detected based on the predicted temperature set and the actual temperature of the first wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The predicted temperature set includes n predicted temperatures. When the first wind turbine encounters a fault, the actual temperature of the first wind turbine will be higher than the predicted temperature. Exemplarily, when the actual temperature is higher than multiple predicted temperatures, the first wind turbine encounters a fault, and an early warning may be given at this time.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that, in view of the situation that there are few training data of wind turbines in a newly-built wind farm and thus the temperature prediction model cannot be trained, the embodiment of the present disclosure can apply the temperature prediction model of the second wind turbine of the same model as the first the wind turbine in other wind farms to the normal operation data of the first wind turbine to evaluate the prediction effect of the model. If the regression effect of the temperature prediction model meets the requirements for use, the temperature prediction model of the second wind turbine is used to give an alarm. If the regression effect of the temperature prediction model does not meet the requirements for use, a warning strategy of horizontal comparison of full generation temperature data of the same model in the wind farm is adopted. The full generation temperature comparison scheme can effectively overcome the problem of inaccurate machine learning predictions caused by insufficient history data, and realize fault warning with zero history data.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To sum up, in the technical solution according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a predicted temperature is obtained by a temperature prediction model, and whether a wind turbine encounters a fault is detected based on the predicted temperature and actual temperature. Compared with the related art which depends on the working experience of the staff, the technical solution according to the embodiment of the present disclosure can more accurately detect whether a wind turbine encounters a fault, and provide early warning in time, so as to reduce the failure rate of the wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, in view of the problem that the related art relies heavily on the normal history data of the first wind turbine, the embodiment of the present disclosure provides a horizontal comparison and cross validation method. If the first wind turbine encounters a fault, its history data will also be affected, while the second wind turbine will not be affected by the fault. The data of the second wind turbine is normal under a high probability. Detecting the first wind turbine based on the predicted temperature obtained by the temperature prediction models corresponding to multiple second wind turbines avoids the problem of false alarms caused by detecting the first wind turbine based only on the predicted temperature obtained by the temperature prediction model corresponding to the first wind turbine, and improves the early warning recall rate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the n wind turbines includes m components. The temperature prediction model corresponding to each wind turbine includes a component temperature prediction model corresponding to each of the m components of each wind turbine, where m is a positive integer. Optionally, whether the component included in the first wind turbine encounters a fault is detected in the following manner.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">1. Component characteristic data of each of the m components of the first wind turbine and actual temperature of each of the m components of the first wind turbine are acquired.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">2. For the i<sup>th </sup>component of the m components of the first wind turbine, a predicted temperature set of the i<sup>th </sup>component is acquired by inputting component characteristic data of the i<sup>th </sup>component t into a component temperature prediction model of the i<sup>th </sup>component of each of the n wind turbines, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to m.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Exemplarily, the wind turbine includes at least one of the following components: turbine drive end bearing, turbine non-drive end bearing, gearbox high speed shaft drive end bearing, gearbox high speed shaft non-drive end bearing, gearbox intermediate shaft drive end bearing, gearbox intermediate shaft non-driving end bearing, spindle front bearing, and spindle rear bearing. Of course, in other possible implementations, the wind turbine further includes other components, and the embodiment of the present disclosure does not limit the types of components. Optionally, each component has its corresponding component temperature prediction model.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the component temperature prediction model of the i<sup>th </sup>component of each wind turbine outputs a predicted temperature. That is, the predicted temperature set includes n predicted temperatures.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">3. Whether the i<sup>th </sup>component encounters a fault is detected based on the predicted temperature set of the i<sup>th </sup>component and the actual temperature of the i<sup>th </sup>component.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, whether the i<sup>th </sup>component encounters a fault is detected in the following manner.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">3.1. A residual value set of the i<sup>th </sup>component is acquired by calculating a residual value between each predicted temperature of the predicted temperature set of the i<sup>th </sup>component and the actual temperature of the i<sup>th </sup>component respectively.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Assuming that there are 3 wind turbines, the component characteristic data of the i<sup>th </sup>component is input into the component temperature prediction model of the i<sup>th </sup>component of each of the above three wind turbines, and 3 predicted temperatures are acquired, respectively 30&#xb0; C. and 31&#xb0; C. and 32&#xb0; C., and the actual temperature of the i<sup>th </sup>component is 38&#xb0; C., then residual values between the 3 predicted temperatures and the actual temperature are calculated and 3 residual values are acquired, which are 8, 7, and 6 respectively.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">3.2. The number of residual values greater than a threshold in the residual value set of the i<sup>th </sup>component is acquired.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The threshold may be set according to history experience. Assuming that the threshold is 5, the above example is still taken as an example, then the number of residual values greater than 5 is 3.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">3.3. Whether the number is greater than a preset number is detected.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The preset number may be proportional to n. For example, the preset number may be &#xbd; of n.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">3.4.

The component is a core component of a wind turbine, and the operation and maintenance cost caused by component failure is as high as 40% of all the operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, by identifying whether there are component failures in the wind turbine and giving an early warning in time, it is possible to carry out targeted wind turbine operation and maintenance in advance, saving component maintenance costs, and reducing power generation loss caused by unplanned shutdowns due to component failures.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, when the number of residual values greater than the threshold among the n residual values is greater than the preset number, it is determined that the component encounters a fault, and the fault detection of the component takes a short time.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the number of times that the target wind turbine detects that the component has an abnormality is greater than the preset number of times, the target wind turbine is determined as an early warning wind turbine.

An execution subject of the above method may be a computer device, which refers to an electronic device with computing and processing capabilities. For example, the computer device may be a server. The method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In step <b>301</b>, training data of the temperature prediction model is acquired.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the training data includes training samples. Illustratively, the training data includes at least 3000 training samples. The training samples include history temperature of a target wind turbine and characteristic data corresponding to the history temperature. The characteristic data corresponding to the history temperature is intended to characterize a working state of the target wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In step <b>302</b>, training data after data cleaning is acquired by performing data cleaning on the training data.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the training data after data cleaning is used to train the temperature prediction model. Before training the temperature prediction model, the training data is cleaned first, which can improve the accuracy of the temperature prediction model.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>303</b>, a predicted temperature corresponding to the characteristic data is calculated by the temperature prediction model.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A predicted temperature corresponding to the characteristic data is acquired by inputting the characteristic data into the temperature prediction model.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step <b>304</b>, the temperature prediction model is trained based on the predicted temperature and the history temperature.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When a difference between the predicted temperature and the history temperature is less than a preset difference, the training of the temperature prediction model is stopped. Of course, in other possible implementations, when the number of training times is greater than a preset number of times, the training of the temperature prediction model is stopped.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The temperature prediction model may be trained using feature engineering methods to add characteristic data within a few hours of history, for example, the rotor speed within a few hours of history, to improve the accuracy of the temperature prediction model.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Optionally, the temperature prediction model may be a LightGBM model, a random forest model, or a support vector regression (SVR) model.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">It should be noted that the present disclosure needs to establish temperature prediction models for all wind turbines in the same wind farm. The temperature prediction model may be updated every preset duration. For example, the temperature prediction model is updated every three months.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In summary, in the technical solution according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a temperature prediction model is trained by a predicted temperature corresponding to characteristic data and a history temperature corresponding to the characteristic data, and the temperature prediction model that is finally trained is used to detect whether a wind turbine encounters a fault, which can reduce the failure rate of the wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one example, data cleaning may include at least one of the following: cleaning dead numbers (dead numbers refer to continuous and constant values), cleaning out-of-limit data (out-of-limit data refers to data that exceeds a preset range), cleaning data that does not correspond to history environmental conditions (for example, history temperature data that does not correspond to history environmental temperature, history power data that does not correspond to history wind power).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In another example, the training data may be preprocessed based on density: taking the history temperature and the characteristic data corresponding to the history temperature as a data point; and removing data points which do not belong mass distribution based on the distribution density of the data points.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In still another example, the training data may be preprocessed based on the history data of the wind turbines of the same model in the wind farm: acquiring a history temperature of a wind turbine of the same model as the target wind turbine in the wind farm and a history temperature corresponding to the characteristic data; and based on the characteristic data of the same size, a history temperature after cleaning by buckets is acquired by cleaning the history temperature by buckets.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The training data of the temperature prediction model needs to use normal data. If the temperature prediction model contains a large amount of abnormally high temperature training data, it will make the prediction temperature very high, resulting in failure to report. Compared with the related art in which the out-of-limit data is simply cleaned up, resulting in that the training data includes certain abnormally high temperature data, and that when the temperature of the wind turbine is detected by the trained temperature prediction model, the predicted temperature may be higher, and thus the residual value is small and the incidence of underreporting is high, the embodiment of the present disclosure can effectively ensure that the abnormal data is cleaned up by deeper data cleaning, thereby reducing the incidence of underreporting.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an architecture diagram of a temperature prediction model according to an embodiment of the present disclosure after being trained for application.
