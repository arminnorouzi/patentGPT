In order to meet various application requirements with different bus voltages, the range of the input voltage of the modular power supply is getting wider and wider, and the output current of the modular power supply is also increasing. Therefore, the demand for the DC/DC modular power supply with high efficiency, high power density and low cost increases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, in the application of the isolated power converter with wide input voltage range, a flyback topology or an active clamp forward topology may be adopted. However, the primary switch in the conventional flyback topology requires high withstand voltage, and the secondary switch in the conventional active clamp forward topology requires high withstand voltage. When the switch with high withstand voltage is adopted to meet the requirement, the on-resistance would be too high, which causes large conduction loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the conventional flyback topology works in the continuous conduction mode (CCM) when the output power increases, and the secondary switch has a reverse recovery loss. Therefore, even if the resonant elements are disposed in the primary circuit, the complete soft switching can't be realized. Further, the primary switch of the conventional active clamp forward topology is unable to realize the complete soft switching. Since the soft switching can't be realized, the overall energy efficiency is low, and more heat energy would be generated, resulting in higher heat dissipation requirements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need of providing a power conversion circuit in order to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional technologies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a power conversion circuit. All the switches of the power conversion circuit can realize the soft switching, thereby reducing the loss. In addition, the resonant elements are provided in the power conversion circuit. Due to the resonance, the switches with lower withstand voltage can be adopted, thus the on-resistance of the switch decreases, and the loss is further reduced. Therefore, under the wide input voltage range, the power conversion circuit of the present disclosure still has high energy efficiency.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, a power conversion circuit is provided. The power conversion circuit includes a positive input terminal, a negative input terminal, a clamping branch circuit, a first primary switch, a transformer, a rectifier circuit, a resonant inductor, a resonant capacitor, a positive output terminal, and a negative output terminal. The positive input terminal and the negative input terminal are configured to receive an input voltage. The clamping branch circuit and the first primary switch are electrically connected in series. The clamping branch circuit has a first terminal and a second terminal and includes a clamping capacitor and a second primary switch electrically connected in series between the first terminal and the second terminal. The first terminal is coupled to the positive input terminal. The first primary switch is electrically connected between the second terminal and the negative input terminal. The transformer includes a primary winding and a secondary winding coupled to each other, and the primary winding and the clamping branch circuit are electrically connected in parallel. The rectifier circuit includes a first bridge arm and a second bridge arm electrically connected to each other in parallel. The first bridge arm includes two switch elements electrically connected in series, and the second bridge arm includes two electronic elements electrically connected in series. A first connection terminal between the two switch elements and a second connection terminal between the two electronic elements are coupled to two terminals of the secondary winding correspondingly. The resonant inductor and the resonant capacitor are configured to resonate in the power conversion circuit. The positive output terminal and the negative output terminal are configured to provide an output voltage.
