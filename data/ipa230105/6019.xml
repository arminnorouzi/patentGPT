Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The importance of a display device has increased with the development of multimedia. Accordingly, various types (kinds) of display devices, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) and an organic light emitting display (OLED), have been used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A display device is applied to various suitable electronic appliances such as smart phones, tablet PCs, notebook computers, monitors, and televisions (TVs). Recently, due to the development of mobile communication technology, the use of portable electronic appliances such as smart phones, tablets, and notebook computers has greatly increased. Privacy information such as contacts, call history, messages, photos, memos, user's web surfing information, user's location information, and financial information are stored in portable electronic appliances. Therefore, in order to protect personal information stored in portable electronic appliances, fingerprint authentication for authenticating a fingerprint, which is a user's biometric information, is used. The display device may include a fingerprint sensor for fingerprint authentication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, when the fingerprint sensor is disposed in the bezel area or the non-display area of the display device, there is a limit in widening the display area of the display device. In other words, the display area may be reduced.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of example embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward a display device capable of blocking or substantially blocking ambient light incident on sensor pixels of a fingerprint sensor when the fingerprint sensor is disposed in a display area of the display device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of example embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward a fingerprint sensor in the display area of the display device where a light blocking layer may be formed in the display area of the display device to block or substantially block ambient light incident on or directed toward the sensor pixels of the fingerprint sensor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, example embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to those set forth herein. The above and other example embodiments of the present disclosure will become more apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure pertains by referencing the detailed description of the present disclosure given below.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to some example embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a display device including: a substrate; a thin film transistor layer on a first surface of the substrate and including a first hole; a light emitting element layer on the thin film transistor layer and including a light emitting element; a first light blocking layer between the substrate and the thin film transistor layer and including a second hole overlapping the first hole in a thickness direction of the substrate; and a second light blocking layer between the thin film transistor layer and the light emitting element layer and including a third hole overlapping the first hole and the second hole in the thickness direction of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to some example embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a display device including: a substrate; a thin film transistor layer on a first surface of the substrate and including a first hole; a light emitting element layer on the thin film transistor layer and including a light emitting element; an encapsulation layer on the light emitting element layer; and a sensor electrode layer on the encapsulation layer and including sensor electrodes. The sensor electrodes do not overlap the first hole in a thickness direction of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the aforementioned and other example embodiments of the present disclosure, a first hole of a thin film transistor layer, a second hole of a first light blocking layer disposed under the thin film transistor, and a third hole of a second light blocking layer on the thin film transistor may be disposed to overlap each other in a thickness direction of a substrate, thereby forming a pinhole through which light reflected from a user's fingerprint passes through a sub-pixel and proceeds. Therefore, even when a fingerprint sensor is disposed under the substrate, each of sensor pixels of the fingerprint sensor may detect the light reflected from the user's fingerprint through the pinhole.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, a part of a k-th scan line, a part of a j-th data line, a part of a second connection electrode, and a part of a (k&#x2212;1)-th scan line may not overlap the first light blocking layer in the thickness of the substrate. Therefore, an overlapping area between the scan lines and the first light blocking layer, an overlapping area between the initialization voltage line and the first light blocking layer, and an overlapping area between the data lines and the first light blocking layer may be reduced, so that load of the scan lines, load of the initialization voltage line, and load of the data lines may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, a driving electrode, a sensing electrode, and a part of a second connection portion, which are disposed in an area overlapping the pinhole of the sub-pixel in the thickness direction of the substrate may be reduced, so that the light reflected from the user's fingerprint may proceed to the pinhole of the sub-pixel without being blocked or substantially blocked by the second connection portion. Therefore, the light reflected from the user's fingerprint may be incident on the sensor pixel of the fingerprint sensor overlapping the pinhole of the sub-pixel in the thickness direction through the pinhole of the sub-pixel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other aspects and example embodiments may be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims and equivalents thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above and other example embodiments and features of the present disclosure will become more apparent by describing example embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a display device according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of a display device according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of a display device according to another embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of a display device according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exemplary view illustrating sub-pixels of a display panel and sensor pixels of a fingerprint sensor according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a fingerprint recognition area of a display device according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is an enlarged view of area AA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating an example of a sub-pixel of the display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating an example of a sensor pixel of the fingerprint sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a layout view of a thin film transistor of a sub-pixel according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a layout illustrating an example of the thin film transistor layer and first light blocking layer of the sub-pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a layout illustrating an example of the thin film transistor layer and second light blocking layer of the sub-pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line I-I&#x2032;
