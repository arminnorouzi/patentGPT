The applications of this phenomenon are numerous, but it has proven particularly advantageous for treating wounds. Regardless of the etiology of a wound, whether trauma, surgery, or another cause, proper care of the wound is important to the outcome. Treatment of wounds or other tissue with reduced pressure may be commonly referred to as &#x201c;negative-pressure therapy,&#x201d; but is also known by other names, including &#x201c;negative-pressure wound therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;reduced-pressure therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;vacuum therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;vacuum-assisted closure,&#x201d; and &#x201c;topical negative-pressure,&#x201d; for example. Negative-pressure therapy may provide a number of benefits, including migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissues, improved blood flow, and micro-deformation of tissue at a wound site. Together, these benefits can increase development of granulation tissue and reduce healing times.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is also widespread acceptance that cleansing a tissue site can be highly beneficial for new tissue growth. For example, a wound or a cavity can be washed out with a liquid solution for therapeutic purposes. These practices are commonly referred to as &#x201c;irrigation&#x201d; and &#x201c;lavage&#x201d; respectively. &#x201c;Instillation&#x201d; is another practice that generally refers to a process of slowly introducing fluid to a tissue site and leaving the fluid for a prescribed period of time before removing the fluid. For example, instillation of topical treatment solutions over a wound bed can be combined with negative-pressure therapy to further promote wound healing by loosening soluble contaminants in a wound bed and removing infectious material. As a result, soluble bacterial burden can be decreased, contaminants removed, and the wound cleansed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the clinical benefits of negative-pressure therapy and/or instillation therapy are widely known, improvements to therapy systems, components, and processes may benefit healthcare providers and patients.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">New and useful systems, apparatuses, and methods for disposition of a negative-pressure dressing in a negative-pressure therapy environment are set forth in the appended claims. Illustrative embodiments are also provided to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in some embodiments, a dressing for treating a tissue site is described. The dressing can include a contact layer having a first side and a second side. The first side of the contact layer can be configured to be positioned adjacent to the tissue site. The contact layer can have a plurality of holes extending through the contact layer from the first side to the second side. The dressing can include a cover layer having a first side and a second side. The first side of the cover layer can be coupled to the contact layer. The dressing can also include at least one retainer layer removably coupled to the second side of the cover layer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of manufacturing a dressing for a tissue site is also described herein. A first layer of foam can be provided and a sheet of adhesive can be coupled to a side of the first layer of foam. A plurality of holes can be formed in the first layer of foam and the sheet of adhesive, and a second layer of foam can be positioned adjacent to the sheet of adhesive. The sheet of adhesive can be activated. A third layer of foam can be provided, and the third layer of foam can be removably coupled to a side of the second layer of foam opposite of the first layer of foam.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively, other example embodiments may describe a system for treating a tissue site. The system can include a tissue interface, a sealing member configured to be positioned over the tissue interface and sealed to tissue surrounding the tissue site, and a therapy source configured to be fluidly coupled to the tissue interface through the sealing member. The tissue interface can include a debridement tool having a first side and a second side, the first side configured to be positioned adjacent to the tissue site. The debridement tool can have a plurality of perforations extending through the debridement tool from the first side to the second side. The tissue interface can also include a cover layer having a first side and a second side, the first side coupled to the second side of the debridement tool. At least one retainer layer can be removably coupled to the second side of the cover layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another dressing for treating a tissue site may be described.

The following detailed description is, therefore, to be taken as illustrative and not limiting.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The example embodiments may also be described herein with reference to spatial relationships between various elements or to the spatial orientation of various elements depicted in the attached drawings. In general, such relationships or orientation assume a frame of reference consistent with or relative to a patient in a position to receive treatment. However, as should be recognized by those skilled in the art, this frame of reference is merely a descriptive expedient rather than a strict prescription.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;tissue site&#x201d; in this context broadly refers to a wound, defect, or other treatment target located on or within tissue, including but not limited to, a surface wound, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, neural tissue, dermal tissue, vascular tissue, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, or ligaments. The term &#x201c;tissue site&#x201d; may also refer to areas of any tissue that are not necessarily wounded or defective, but are instead areas in which it may be desirable to add or promote the growth of additional tissue. For example, negative pressure may be applied to a tissue site to grow additional tissue that may be harvested and transplanted. A surface wound, as used herein, is a wound on the surface of a body that is exposed to the outer surface of the body, such as injury or damage to the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous layers. Surface wounds may include ulcers or closed incisions, for example. A surface wound, as used herein, does not include wounds within an intra-abdominal cavity. A wound may include chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute, and dehisced wounds, partial-thickness burns, ulcers (such as diabetic, pressure, or venous insufficiency ulcers), flaps, and grafts, for example.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified functional block diagram of an example embodiment of a therapy system <b>100</b> that can provide negative-pressure therapy with instillation of topical treatment solutions to a tissue site in accordance with this specification. The therapy system <b>100</b> may include a source or supply of negative pressure, such as a negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, a dressing <b>104</b>, a fluid container, such as a container <b>106</b>, and a regulator or controller, such as a controller <b>108</b>, for example. Additionally, the therapy system <b>100</b> may include sensors to measure operating parameters and provide feedback signals to the controller <b>108</b> indicative of the operating parameters. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, the therapy system <b>100</b> may include a pressure sensor <b>110</b>, an electric sensor <b>112</b>, or both, coupled to the controller <b>108</b>. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dressing <b>104</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a tissue interface <b>114</b>, a cover <b>116</b>, or both in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The therapy system <b>100</b> may also include a source of instillation solution. For example, a solution source <b>118</b> may be fluidly coupled to the dressing <b>104</b>, as illustrated in the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The solution source <b>118</b> may be fluidly coupled to a positive-pressure source such as a positive-pressure source <b>120</b>, a negative-pressure source such as the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, or both in some embodiments. A regulator, such as an instillation regulator <b>122</b>, may also be fluidly coupled to the solution source <b>118</b> and the dressing <b>104</b> to ensure proper dosage of instillation solution (e.g. saline or sterile water) to a tissue site. For example, the instillation regulator <b>122</b> may comprise a piston that can be pneumatically actuated by the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> to draw instillation solution from the solution source <b>118</b> during a negative-pressure interval and to instill the solution to the dressing <b>104</b> during a venting interval. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>108</b> may be coupled to the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, the positive-pressure source <b>120</b>, or both, to control dosage of instillation solution to a tissue site. In some embodiments, the instillation regulator <b>122</b> may also be fluidly coupled to the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> through the dressing <b>104</b>, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some components of the therapy system <b>100</b> may be housed within or used in conjunction with other components, such as sensors, processing units, alarm indicators, memory, databases, software, display devices, or user interfaces that further facilitate therapy. For example, in some embodiments, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may be combined with the solution source <b>118</b>, the controller <b>108</b>, and other components into a therapy unit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, components of the therapy system <b>100</b> may be coupled directly or indirectly. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may be directly coupled to the container <b>106</b>, and may be indirectly coupled to the dressing <b>104</b> through the container <b>106</b>. Coupling may include fluid, mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical coupling (such as a chemical bond), or some combination of coupling in some contexts. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may be electrically coupled to the controller <b>108</b>, and may be fluidly coupled to one or more distribution components to provide a fluid path to a tissue site. In some embodiments, components may also be coupled by virtue of physical proximity, being integral to a single structure, or being formed from the same piece of material. For example, the tissue interface <b>114</b> and the cover <b>116</b> may be discrete layers disposed adjacent to each other, and may be joined together in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A distribution component is preferably detachable, and may be disposable, reusable, or recyclable. The dressing <b>104</b> and the container <b>106</b> are illustrative of distribution components. A fluid conductor is another illustrative example of a distribution component. A &#x201c;fluid conductor,&#x201d; in this context, broadly includes a tube, pipe, hose, conduit, or other structure with one or more lumina or open pathways adapted to convey a fluid between two ends. Typically, a tube is an elongated, cylindrical structure with some flexibility, but the geometry and rigidity may vary. Moreover, some fluid conductors may be molded into or otherwise integrally combined with other components. Distribution components may also include or comprise interfaces or fluid ports to facilitate coupling and de-coupling other components.

In many cases, the local ambient pressure may also be the atmospheric pressure at which a tissue site is located. Alternatively, the pressure may be less than a hydrostatic pressure associated with tissue at the tissue site. Unless otherwise indicated, values of pressure stated herein are gauge pressures. References to increases in negative pressure typically refer to a decrease in absolute pressure, while decreases in negative pressure typically refer to an increase in absolute pressure. While the amount and nature of negative pressure applied to a tissue site may vary according to therapeutic requirements, the pressure is generally a low vacuum, also commonly referred to as a rough vacuum, between &#x2212;5 mm Hg (&#x2212;667 Pa) and &#x2212;500 mm Hg (&#x2212;66.7 kPa). Common therapeutic ranges are between &#x2212;50 mm Hg (&#x2212;6.7 kPa) and &#x2212;300 mm Hg (&#x2212;39.9 kPa).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The container <b>106</b> is representative of a container, canister, pouch, or other storage component, which can be used to manage exudates and other fluids withdrawn from a tissue site. In many environments, a rigid container may be preferred or required for collecting, storing, and disposing of fluids. In other environments, fluids may be properly disposed of without rigid container storage, and a re-usable container could reduce waste and costs associated with negative-pressure therapy.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A controller, such as the controller <b>108</b>, may be a microprocessor or computer programmed to operate one or more components of the therapy system <b>100</b>, such as the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the controller <b>108</b> may be a microcontroller, which generally comprises an integrated circuit containing a processor core and a memory programmed to directly or indirectly control one or more operating parameters of the therapy system <b>100</b>. Operating parameters may include the power applied to the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, the pressure generated by the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, or the pressure distributed to the tissue interface <b>114</b>, for example. The controller <b>108</b> is also preferably configured to receive one or more input signals, such as a feedback signal, and programmed to modify one or more operating parameters based on the input signals.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sensors, such as the pressure sensor <b>110</b> or the electric sensor <b>112</b>, are generally known in the art as any apparatus operable to detect or measure a physical phenomenon or property, and generally provide a signal indicative of the phenomenon or property that is detected or measured. For example, the pressure sensor <b>110</b> and the electric sensor <b>112</b> may be configured to measure one or more operating parameters of the therapy system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the pressure sensor <b>110</b> may be a transducer configured to measure pressure in a pneumatic pathway and convert the measurement to a signal indicative of the pressure measured. In some embodiments, the pressure sensor <b>110</b> may be a piezoresistive strain gauge. The electric sensor <b>112</b> may optionally measure operating parameters of the negative-pressure source <b>102</b>, such as the voltage or current, in some embodiments. Preferably, the signals from the pressure sensor <b>110</b> and the electric sensor <b>112</b> are suitable as an input signal to the controller <b>108</b>, but some signal conditioning may be appropriate.

The tissue interface <b>114</b> may take many forms, and may have many sizes, shapes, or thicknesses depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of treatment being implemented or the nature and size of a tissue site. For example, the size and shape of the tissue interface <b>114</b> may be adapted to the contours of deep and irregular shaped tissue sites.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the cover <b>116</b> may provide a bacterial barrier and protection from physical trauma. The cover <b>116</b> may also be constructed from a material that can reduce evaporative losses and provide a fluid seal between two components or two environments, such as between a therapeutic environment and a local external environment. The cover <b>116</b> may be, for example, an elastomeric film or membrane that can provide a seal adequate to maintain a negative pressure at a tissue site for a given negative-pressure source. The cover <b>116</b> may have a high moisture-vapor transmission rate (MVTR) in some applications. For example, the MVTR may be at least about 300 g/m<sup>2 </sup>per twenty-four hours in some embodiments. In some example embodiments, the cover <b>116</b> may be a polymer drape, such as a polyurethane film, that is permeable to water vapor but impermeable to liquid. Such drapes typically have a thickness in the range of about 25 microns to about 50 microns. For permeable materials, the permeability generally should be low enough that a desired negative pressure may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cover <b>116</b> may comprise, for example, one or more of the following materials: hydrophilic polyurethane; cellulosics; hydrophilic polyamides; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; hydrophilic acrylics; hydrophilic silicone elastomers; an INSPIRE 2301 material from Coveris Advanced Coatings of Wrexham, United Kingdom having, for example, an MVTR (inverted cup technique) of about 14400 g/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours and a thickness of about 30 microns; a thin, uncoated polymer drape; natural rubbers; polyisoprene; styrene butadiene rubber; chloroprene rubber; polybutadiene; nitrile rubber; butyl rubber; ethylene propylene rubber; ethylene propylene diene monomer; chlorosulfonated polyethylene; polysulfide rubber; polyurethane (PU); EVA film; co-polyester; silicones; a silicone drape; a 3M Tegaderm&#xae; drape; a polyurethane (PU) drape such as one available from Avery Dennison Corporation of Glendale, Calif.; polyether block polyamide copolymer (PEBAX), for example, from Arkema, France; INSPIRE 2327; or other appropriate material.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An attachment device may be used to attach the cover <b>116</b> to an attachment surface, such as undamaged epidermis, a gasket, or another cover. The attachment device may take many forms. For example, an attachment device may be a medically-acceptable, pressure-sensitive adhesive configured to bond the cover <b>116</b> to epidermis around a tissue site. In some embodiments, for example, some or all of the cover <b>116</b> may be coated with an adhesive, such as an acrylic adhesive, which may have a coating weight between about 25 grams per square meter (g.s.m.) and about 65 g.s.m. Thicker adhesives, or combinations of adhesives, may be applied in some embodiments to improve the seal and reduce leaks. Other example embodiments of an attachment device may include a double-sided tape, paste, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, silicone gel, or organ gel.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The solution source <b>118</b> may also be representative of a container, canister, pouch, bag, or other storage component, which can provide a solution for instillation therapy. Compositions of solutions may vary according to a prescribed therapy, but examples of solutions that may be suitable for some prescriptions include hypochlorite-based solutions, silver nitrate (0.5%), sulfur-based solutions, biguanides, cationic solutions, and isotonic solutions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fluid mechanics of using a negative-pressure source to reduce pressure in another component or location, such as within a sealed therapeutic environment, can be mathematically complex. However, the basic principles of fluid mechanics applicable to negative-pressure therapy and instillation are generally well-known to those skilled in the art, and the process of reducing pressure may be described illustratively herein as &#x201c;delivering,&#x201d; &#x201c;distributing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;generating&#x201d; negative pressure, for example.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, exudates and other fluids flow toward lower pressure along a fluid path. Thus, the term &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; typically implies a position in a fluid path relatively closer to a source of negative pressure or further away from a source of positive pressure. Conversely, the term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; implies a position relatively further away from a source of negative pressure or closer to a source of positive pressure. Similarly, it may be convenient to describe certain features in terms of fluid &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; or &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; in such a frame of reference. This orientation is generally presumed for purposes of describing various features and components herein. However, the fluid path may also be reversed in some applications (such as by substituting a positive-pressure source for a negative-pressure source) and this descriptive convention should not be construed as a limiting convention.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">During treatment of a tissue site, some tissue sites may not heal according to the normal medical protocol and may develop areas of necrotic tissue. Necrotic tissue may be dead tissue resulting from infection, toxins, or trauma that caused the tissue to die faster than the tissue can be removed by the normal body processes that regulate the removal of dead tissue. Sometimes, necrotic tissue may be in the form of slough, which may include a viscous liquid mass of tissue. Generally, slough is produced by bacterial and fungal infections that stimulate an inflammatory response in the tissue. Slough may be a creamy yellow color and may also be referred to as pus. Necrotic tissue may also include eschar. Eschar may be a portion of necrotic tissue that has become dehydrated and hardened. Eschar may be the result of a burn injury, gangrene, ulcers, fungal infections, spider bites, or anthrax. Eschar may be difficult to remove without the use of surgical cutting instruments.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition to necrotic tissue, slough, and eschar, the tissue site may include biofilms, lacerated tissue, devitalized tissue, contaminated tissue, damaged tissue, infected tissue, exudate, highly viscous exudate, fibrinous slough and/or other material that can generally be referred to as debris. The debris may inhibit the efficacy of tissue treatment and slow the healing of the tissue site. If the debris is in the tissue site, the tissue site may be treated with different processes to disrupt the debris. Examples of disruption can include softening of the debris, separation of the debris from desired tissue, such as the subcutaneous tissue, preparation of the debris for removal from the tissue site, and removal of the debris from the tissue site.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The debris can require debridement performed in an operating room. In some cases, tissue sites requiring debridement may not be life-threatening, and debridement may be considered low-priority. Low-priority cases can experience delays prior to treatment as other, more life-threatening, cases may be given priority for an operating room. As a result, low priority cases may need temporization. Temporization can include stasis of a tissue site that limits deterioration of the tissue site prior to other treatments, such as debridement, negative-pressure therapy or instillation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When debriding, clinicians may find it difficult to define separation between healthy, vital tissue and necrotic tissue. As a result, normal debridement techniques may remove too much healthy tissue or not enough necrotic tissue. If non-viable tissue demarcation does not extend deeper than the deep dermal layer, or if the tissue site is covered by the debris, such as slough or fibrin, gentle methods to remove the debris should be considered to avoid excess damage to the tissue site.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some debridement processes, a mechanical process is used to remove the debris. Mechanical processes may include using scalpels or other cutting tools having a sharp edge to cut away the debris from the tissue site. Other mechanical processes may use devices that can provide a stream of particles to impact the debris to remove the debris in an abrasion process, or jets of high pressure fluid to impact the debris to remove the debris using water jet cutting or lavage. Typically, mechanical processes of debriding a tissue site may be painful and may require the application of local anesthetics. Mechanical processes also risk over removal of healthy tissue that can cause further damage to the tissue site and delay the healing process.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Debridement may also be performed with an autolytic process. For example, an autolytic process may involve using enzymes and moisture produced by a tissue site to soften and liquefy the necrotic tissue and debris. Typically, a dressing may be placed over a tissue site having debris so that fluid produced by the tissue site may remain in place, hydrating the debris. Autolytic processes can be pain-free, but autolytic processes are a slow and can take many days. Because autolytic processes are slow, autolytic processes may also involve many dressing changes. Some autolytic processes may be paired with negative-pressure therapy so that, as debris hydrates, negative pressure supplied to a tissue site may draw off the debris. In some cases, a manifold positioned at a tissue site to distribute negative-pressure across the tissue site may become blocked or clogged with debris broken down by an autolytic process. If a manifold becomes clogged, negative-pressure may not be able to remove debris, which can slow or stop the autolytic process.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Debridement may also be performed by adding enzymes or other agents to the tissue site that digest tissue. Often, strict control of the placement of the enzymes and the length of time the enzymes are in contact with a tissue site must be maintained. If enzymes are left on a tissue site for longer than needed, the enzymes may remove too much healthy tissue, contaminate the tissue site, or be carried to other areas of a patient. Once carried to other areas of a patient, the enzymes may break down undamaged tissue and cause other complications.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, some dressings for treating a tissue site may include multiple layers and require sizing of the dressing during placement of the dressing at the tissue site. For example, several layers may be needed to completely fill a tissue site prior to placement of a cover to seal the tissue site. Each layer may be individually sized and then placed into the tissue site. Sizing each individual layer may increase the risk of contamination of the layer by foreign bodies in the environment and contamination of the tissue site from errant material from the dressing produced during the sizing process. If there is a preferred order for the layers of the dressing, placing each layer of the dressing individually may lead to improper dressing application. For example, a particular layer may have a special coating requiring a particular placement within a stack of layers that form the dressing. Placing each layer of the dressing individually provides an opportunity for a user to become confused and place the layer in a sub-optimal position within the dressing. This may lead to treatment that has a decreased effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">These limitations and others may be addressed by the therapy system <b>100</b>, which can provide negative-pressure therapy, instillation therapy, and disruption of debris. In some embodiments, the therapy system <b>100</b> can provide mechanical movement at a surface of the tissue site in combination with cyclic delivery and dwell of topical solutions to help solubilize debris. For example, a negative-pressure source may be fluidly coupled to a tissue site to provide negative pressure to the tissue site for negative-pressure therapy. In some embodiments, a fluid source may be fluidly coupled to a tissue site to provide therapeutic fluid to the tissue site for instillation therapy. In some embodiments, the therapy system <b>100</b> may include a contact layer positioned adjacent to a tissue site that may be used with negative-pressure therapy, instillation therapy, or both to disrupt areas of a tissue site having debris. Following the disruption of the debris, negative-pressure therapy, instillation therapy, and other processes may be used to remove the debris from a tissue site. In some embodiments, the therapy system <b>100</b> may be used in conjunction with other tissue removal and debridement techniques. For example, the therapy system <b>100</b> may be used prior to enzymatic debridement to soften the debris. In another example, mechanical debridement may be used to remove a portion of the debris at the tissue site, and the therapy system <b>100</b> may then be used to remove the remaining debris while reducing the risk of trauma to the tissue site. The therapy system <b>100</b> may also provide a dressing that may be applied in fewer steps so as to limit opportunities for contamination of the tissue site and the dressing, and decrease instances of improper placement, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the therapy system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an assembly view of an example of the dressing <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrating additional details that may be associated with some embodiments in which the tissue interface <b>114</b> comprises multiple layers.

The contact layer <b>202</b> may be formed by combining sheets of TPE or TPU. In some embodiments, the sheets of TPE or TPU may be bonded, welded, adhered, or otherwise coupled to one another. For example, in some embodiments, the sheets of TPE or TPU may be welded using radiant heat, radio-frequency welding, or laser welding. Supracor, Inc., Hexacor, Ltd., Hexcel Corp., and Econocorp, Inc. may produce suitable TPE or TPU sheets for the formation of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, sheets of TPE or TPU having a thickness between about 0.2 mm and about 2.0 mm may be used to form a structure having the thickness <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be formed from a 3D textile, also referred to as a spacer fabric.

For example, cellular foam, open-cell foam, reticulated foam, or porous tissue collections, may be used to form the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be formed of V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing, grey foam, or a type of Zotefoams. Grey foam may be a polyester polyurethane foam having about 60 pores per inch (ppi). Zotefoams may be a closed-cell crosslinked polyolefin foam. In one non-limiting example, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be an open-cell, reticulated polyurethane foam such as V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing available from Kinetic Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Tex.; in other embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be an open-cell, reticulated polyurethane foam such as a V.A.C. VERAFLO&#x2122; dressing, also available from Kinetic Concepts, Inc., of San Antonio, Tex. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may have a 25% compression load deflection of at least 0.35 pounds per square inch, and the 65% compression load deflection may be at least 0.43 pounds per square inch. In some embodiments, the tensile strength of the contact layer <b>202</b> may be at least 10 pounds per square inch. The contact layer <b>202</b> may have a tear strength of at least 2.5 pounds per inch.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be formed from a foam that is mechanically or chemically compressed, often as part of a thermoforming process, to increase the density of the foam at ambient pressure. A foam that is mechanically or chemically compressed may be referred to as a compressed foam or a felted foam. A compressed foam may be characterized by a firmness factor (FF) that is defined as a ratio of the density of a foam in a compressed state to the density of the same foam in an uncompressed state. For example, a firmness factor (FF) of 5 may refer to a compressed foam having a density at ambient pressure that is five times greater than a density of the same foam in an uncompressed state at ambient pressure. Generally a compressed or felted foam may have a firmness factor greater than 1.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Mechanically or chemically compressing a foam may reduce a thickness of the foam at ambient pressure when compared to the same foam that has not been compressed. Reducing a thickness of a foam by mechanical or chemical compression may increase a density of the foam, which may increase the firmness factor (FF) of the foam. Increasing the firmness factor (FF) of a foam may increase a stiffness of the foam in a direction that is parallel to a thickness of the foam. For example, increasing a firmness factor (FF) of the contact layer <b>202</b> may increase a stiffness of the contact layer <b>202</b> in a direction that is parallel to the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, a compressed foam may be a compressed V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing. V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing may have a density of about 0.03 grams per centimeter<sup>3 </sup>(g/cm<sup>3</sup>) in its uncompressed state. If the V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing is compressed to have a firmness factor (FF) of 5, the V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing may be compressed until the density of the V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing is about 0.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. V.A.C.&#xae; VERAFLO&#x2122; dressing may also be compressed to form a compressed foam having a firmness factor (FF) up to 5. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>202</b> may have a thickness between about 4 mm and about 15 mm, and more specifically, about 8 mm at ambient pressure. In an exemplary embodiment, if the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer is about 8 mm, and the contact layer <b>202</b> is positioned within the sealed environment and subjected to negative pressure of about &#x2212;115 mm Hg to about &#x2212;135 mm Hg, the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> may be between about 1 mm and about 5 mm and, generally, greater than about 3 mm.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The firmness factor (FF) may also be used to compare compressed foam materials with non-foam materials. For example, a Supracor&#xae; material may have a firmness factor (FF) that allows Supracor&#xae; to be compared to compressed foams. In some embodiments, the firmness factor (FF) for a non-foam material may represent that the non-foam material has a stiffness that is equivalent to a stiffness of a compressed foam having the same firmness factor. For example, if a contact layer is formed from Supracor&#xae;, as illustrated in Table 1 below, the contact layer may have a stiffness that is about the same as the stiffness of a compressed V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing material having a firmness factor (FF) of 3.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Generally, if a compressed foam is subjected to negative pressure, the compressed foam exhibits less deformation than a similar uncompressed foam. If the contact layer <b>202</b> is formed of a compressed foam, the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> may deform less than if the contact layer <b>202</b> is formed of a comparable uncompressed foam. The decrease in deformation may be caused by the increased stiffness as reflected by the firmness factor (FF). If subjected to the stress of negative pressure, the contact layer <b>202</b> that is formed of compressed foam may flatten less than the contact layer <b>202</b> that is formed from uncompressed foam. Consequently, if negative pressure is applied to the contact layer <b>202</b>, the stiffness of the contact layer <b>202</b> in the direction parallel to the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> allows the contact layer <b>202</b> to be more compliant or compressible in other directions, e.g., a direction perpendicular to the thickness <b>212</b>. The foam material used to form a compressed foam may be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. The foam material used to form a compressed foam may also be either reticulated or un-reticulated. The pore size of a foam material may vary according to needs of the contact layer <b>202</b> and the amount of compression of the foam. For example, in some embodiments, an uncompressed foam may have pore sizes in a range of about 400 microns to about 600 microns. If the same foam is compressed, the pore sizes may be smaller than when the foam is in its uncompressed state.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A joining layer, such as the adhesive layer <b>204</b> may be a layer of adhesive disposed on the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer <b>204</b> may be coincident with the contact layer <b>202</b>. The adhesive layer <b>204</b> may include a plurality of through-holes <b>232</b>. The through-holes <b>232</b> may have a same size and shape as the through-holes <b>210</b>. Preferably, the through-holes <b>232</b> are aligned with the through-holes <b>210</b> so that edges of the through-holes <b>232</b> and the through-holes <b>210</b> are coincident. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer <b>204</b> may be free of the through-holes <b>232</b> and can cover the through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In other embodiments, the through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> and the through-holes <b>232</b> of the adhesive layer <b>204</b> can be formed after the adhesive layer <b>204</b> is coupled to the contact layer <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The adhesive of the adhesive layer <b>204</b> may have a bond strength greater than or equal to about the tensile strength of the materials coupled to the adhesive layer <b>204</b>. For example, the adhesive layer <b>204</b> may have a bond strength greater than or equal to the tensile strength of the contact layer <b>202</b> and the first retainer layer <b>218</b>. In some embodiments, the tensile strength of one or both of the contact layer <b>202</b> and the first retainer layer <b>218</b> may be at least 10 pounds per square inch.

The first orientation line <b>406</b> and the second orientation line <b>408</b> may be lines of symmetry of the contact layer <b>202</b>. A line of symmetry may be, for example, an imaginary line across the second surface <b>208</b> or the first surface <b>206</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> defining a fold line such that if the contact layer <b>202</b> is folded on the line of symmetry, the through-holes <b>210</b> and the walls <b>402</b> on each side would be coincidentally aligned. Generally, the first orientation line <b>406</b> and the second orientation line <b>408</b> aid in the description of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the first orientation line <b>406</b> and the second orientation line <b>408</b> may be used to refer to the desired directions of contraction of the contact layer <b>202</b>. For example, the desired direction of contraction may be parallel to the second orientation line <b>408</b> and perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b>.

The through-hole <b>210</b> may include a center <b>502</b> and the perimeter <b>404</b>. The through-hole <b>210</b> may have a perforation shape factor (PSF). The perforation shape factor (PSF) may represent an orientation of the through-hole <b>210</b> relative to the first orientation line <b>406</b> and the second orientation line <b>408</b>. Generally, the perforation shape factor (PSF) is a ratio of &#xbd; a maximum length of the through-hole <b>210</b> that is parallel to the desired direction of contraction to &#xbd; a maximum length of the through-hole <b>210</b> that is perpendicular to the desired direction of contraction. For descriptive purposes, the desired direction of contraction is parallel to the second orientation line <b>408</b>. The desired direction of contraction may be indicated by a lateral force <b>504</b>. For reference, the through-hole <b>210</b> may have an X-axis <b>506</b> extending through the center <b>502</b> parallel to the first orientation line <b>406</b>, and a Y-axis <b>508</b> extending through the center <b>502</b> parallel to the second orientation line <b>408</b>. The perforation shape factor (PSF) of the through-hole <b>210</b> may be defined as a ratio of a line segment <b>510</b> on the Y-axis <b>508</b> extending from the center <b>502</b> to the perimeter <b>404</b> of the through-hole <b>210</b>, to a line segment <b>512</b> on the X-axis <b>506</b> extending from the center <b>502</b> to the perimeter <b>404</b> of the through-hole <b>210</b>.

The contact layer <b>202</b> may include the plurality of through-holes <b>210</b> aligned in parallel rows to form an array. The array of through-holes <b>210</b> may include a first row <b>602</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b>, a second row <b>604</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b>, and a third row <b>606</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, a width of the wall <b>402</b> between the perimeters <b>404</b> of adjacent through-holes <b>210</b> in a row, such as the first row <b>602</b>, may be about 5 mm. The centers <b>502</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> in adjacent rows, for example, the first row <b>602</b> and the second row <b>604</b>, may be characterized by being offset from the second orientation line <b>408</b> along the first orientation line <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, a line connecting the centers of adjacent rows may form a strut angle (SA) with the first orientation line <b>406</b>. For example, a first through-hole <b>210</b>A in the first row <b>602</b> may have a center <b>502</b>A, and a second through-hole <b>210</b>B in the second row <b>604</b> may have a center <b>502</b>B. A strut line <b>608</b> may connect the center <b>502</b>A with the center <b>502</b>B. The strut line <b>608</b> may form an angle <b>610</b> with the first orientation line <b>406</b>. The angle <b>610</b> may be the strut angle (SA) of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the strut angle (SA) may be less than about 90&#xb0;. In other embodiments, the strut angle (SA) may be between about 30&#xb0; and about 70&#xb0; relative to the first orientation line <b>406</b>. In other embodiments, the strut angle (SA) may be about 66&#xb0; from the first orientation line <b>406</b>. Generally, as the strut angle (SA) decreases, a stiffness of the contact layer <b>202</b> in a direction parallel to the first orientation line <b>406</b> may increase. Increasing the stiffness of the contact layer <b>202</b> parallel to the first orientation line <b>406</b> may increase the compressibility of the contact layer <b>202</b> perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b>. Consequently, if negative pressure is applied to the contact layer <b>202</b>, the contact layer <b>202</b> may be more compliant or compressible in a direction perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b>. By increasing the compressibility of the contact layer <b>202</b> in a direction perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b>, the contact layer <b>202</b> may collapse to apply the lateral force <b>504</b> to the tissue site as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the centers <b>502</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> in alternating rows, for example, the center <b>502</b>A of the first through-hole <b>210</b>A in the first row <b>602</b> and a center <b>502</b>C of a through-hole <b>210</b>C in the third row <b>606</b>, may be spaced from each other parallel to the second orientation line <b>408</b> by a length <b>612</b>. In some embodiments, the length <b>612</b> may be greater than an effective diameter of the through-hole <b>210</b>. If the centers <b>502</b> of through-holes <b>210</b> in alternating rows are separated by the length <b>612</b>, the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> parallel to the first orientation line <b>406</b> may be considered continuous. Generally, the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> may be continuous if the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> do not have any discontinuities or breaks between through-holes <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the length <b>612</b> may be between about 7 mm and about 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Regardless of the shape of the through-holes <b>210</b>, the through-holes <b>210</b> in the contact layer <b>202</b> may leave void spaces in the contact layer <b>202</b> and on the second surface <b>208</b> and the first surface <b>206</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> so that only the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> remain with a surface available to contact the tissue site. It may be desirable to minimize the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> so that the through-holes <b>210</b> may collapse, causing the contact layer <b>202</b> to collapse and generate the lateral force <b>504</b> in a direction perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b>. However, it may also be desirable not to minimize the exterior surface of the walls <b>402</b> so much that the contact layer <b>202</b> becomes too fragile for sustaining the application of a negative pressure. The void space percentage (VS) of the through-holes <b>210</b> may be equal to the percentage of the volume or surface area of the void spaces of the second surface <b>208</b> created by the through-holes <b>210</b> to the total volume or surface area of the second surface <b>208</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the void space percentage (VS) may be between about 40% and about 75%. In other embodiments, the void space percentage (VS) may be about 55%. The organization of the through-holes <b>210</b> can also impact the void space percentage (VS), influencing the total surface area of the contact layer <b>202</b> that may contact the tissue site. In some embodiments, the longitudinal edge <b>410</b> and the circular edge <b>412</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> may be discontinuous. An edge may be discontinuous where the through-holes <b>210</b> overlap an edge causing the edge to have a non-linear profile. A discontinuous edge may reduce the disruption of keratinocyte migration and enhance re-epithelialization while negative pressure is applied to the dressing <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the through-holes <b>210</b> may be formed during molding of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In other embodiments, the through-holes <b>210</b> may be formed by cutting, melting, drilling, or vaporizing the contact layer <b>202</b> after the contact layer <b>202</b> is formed. For example, the through-holes <b>210</b> may be formed in the contact layer <b>202</b> by laser cutting the compressed foam of the contact layer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the through-holes <b>210</b> may be formed so that the interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> are parallel to the thickness <b>212</b>. In other embodiments, the through-holes <b>210</b> may be formed so that the interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> form a non-perpendicular angle with the second surface <b>208</b>. In still other embodiments, the interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> may taper toward the center <b>502</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> to form conical, pyramidal, or other irregular through-hole shapes. If the interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> of the through-holes <b>210</b> taper, the through-holes <b>210</b> may have a height less than the thickness <b>212</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, formation of the through-holes <b>210</b> may thermoform the material of the contact layer <b>202</b>, for example a compressed foam or a felted foam, causing the interior surface of the walls <b>402</b> extending between the second surface <b>208</b> and the first surface <b>206</b> to be smooth. As used herein, smoothness may refer to the formation of the through-holes <b>210</b> that causes the interior surface of the walls <b>402</b> that extends between the second surface <b>208</b> and the first surface <b>206</b> to be substantially free of pores if compared to an uncut portion of the contact layer <b>202</b>. For example, laser-cutting the through-holes <b>210</b> into the contact layer <b>202</b>, may plastically deform the material of the contact layer <b>202</b>, closing any pores on the interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> that extend between the second surface <b>208</b> and the first surface <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, a smooth interior surface of the walls <b>402</b> may limit or otherwise inhibit ingrowth of tissue into the contact layer <b>202</b> through the through-holes <b>210</b>. In other embodiments, the smooth interior surfaces of the walls <b>402</b> may be formed by a smooth material or a smooth coating.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, an effective diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> may be selected to permit flow of particulates through the through-holes <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> may be selected based on the size of the solubilized debris to be lifted from the tissue site. Larger through-holes <b>210</b> may allow larger debris to pass through the contact layer <b>202</b>, and smaller through-holes <b>210</b> may allow smaller debris to pass through the contact layer <b>202</b> while blocking debris larger than the through-holes. In some embodiments, successive applications of the dressing <b>104</b> can use contact layers <b>202</b> having successively smaller diameters of the through-holes <b>210</b> as the size of the solubilized debris in the tissue site decreases. Sequentially decreasing diameters of the through-holes <b>210</b> may also aid in fine tuning a level of tissue disruption to the debris during the treatment of the tissue site. The diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> can also influence fluid movement in the contact layer <b>202</b> and the dressing <b>104</b>. For example, the contact layer <b>202</b> can channel fluid in the dressing <b>104</b> toward the through-holes <b>210</b> to aid in the disruption of the debris on the tissue site. Variation of the diameters of the through-holes <b>210</b> can vary how fluid is moved through the dressing <b>104</b> with respect to both the removal of fluid and the application of negative pressure. In some embodiments, the diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> is between about 5 mm and about 20 mm and, more specifically, about 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">An effective diameter of a non-circular area is defined as a diameter of a circular area having the same surface area as the non-circular area. In some embodiments, each through-hole <b>210</b> may have an effective diameter of about 3.5 mm. In other embodiments, each through-hole <b>210</b> may have an effective diameter between about 5 mm and about 20 mm. The effective diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> should be distinguished from the porosity of the material forming the walls <b>402</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. Generally, an effective diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> is an order of magnitude larger than the effective diameter of the pores of a material forming the contact layer <b>202</b>. For example, the effective diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> may be larger than about 1 mm, while the walls <b>402</b> may be formed from V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing having a pore size less than about 600 microns. In some embodiments, the pores of the walls <b>402</b> may not create openings that extend all the way through the material. Generally, the through-holes <b>210</b> do not include pores formed by the foam formation process, and the through-holes <b>210</b> may have an average effective diameter that is greater than ten times an average effective diameter of pores of a material.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the through-holes <b>210</b> may form a pattern depending on the geometry of the through-holes <b>210</b> and the alignment of the through-holes <b>210</b> between adjacent and alternating rows in the contact layer <b>202</b> with respect to the first orientation line <b>406</b>. If the contact layer <b>202</b> is subjected to negative pressure, the through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> may contract.

In some embodiments the void space percentage (VS), the perforation shape factor (PSF), and the strut angle (SA) may cause the contact layer <b>202</b> to contract along the second orientation line <b>408</b> perpendicular to the first orientation line <b>406</b> as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating additional details of the contact layer <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in a contracted state.

If the contact layer <b>202</b> is subjected to a negative pressure of about &#x2212;125 mm Hg, the lateral force <b>504</b> generated by the contact layer <b>202</b> is approximately 11.9 N. If the diameter of the through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> is increased to about 20 mm, the void space percentage (VS) changed to about 52%, the strut angle (SA) changed to about 52&#xb0;, and the perforation shape factor (PSF) and the firmness factor (FF) remain the same, the lateral force <b>504</b> is decreased to about 6.5 N.

If the contact layer <b>202</b> is subjected to a negative pressure of about &#x2212;125 mm Hg, the lateral force <b>504</b> generated by the contact layer <b>202</b> is approximately 13.3 N.

Cyclic therapy may alternately apply negative pressure to and vent negative pressure from a sealed space or sealed environment containing the tissue interface <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, negative pressure may be supplied to the tissue site until the pressure in the sealed environment reaches a predetermined therapy pressure. If negative pressure is supplied to the sealed environment, the debris and the subcutaneous tissue underlying the debris may be drawn into the through-holes <b>210</b>.

In other embodiments, the therapy period may be longer or shorter as needed to supply appropriate negative-pressure therapy to the tissue site.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Following the therapy period, the sealed environment may be vented. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may fluidly couple the sealed environment to the atmosphere (not shown), allowing the sealed environment to return to ambient pressure. In some embodiments, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may vent the sealed environment for about 1 minute.

In some embodiments, the solution source <b>118</b> may provide fluid while the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> vents the sealed environment. For example, the positive-pressure source <b>120</b> may be configured to move instillation fluid from the solution source <b>118</b> to the sealed environment. In some embodiments, the solution source <b>118</b> may not have a pump and may operate using a gravity feed system. In other embodiments, the negative-pressure source <b>102</b> may not vent the sealed environment.

In some embodiments, the volume of fluid may be the same as a volume of the sealed environment. In other embodiments, the volume of fluid may be smaller or larger than the sealed environment as needed to appropriately apply instillation therapy. Instilling of the tissue site may raise a pressure in the sealed environment to a pressure greater than the ambient pressure, for example to between about 0 mm Hg and about 15 mm Hg and, more specifically, about 5 mm Hg.

Generally, the pressure in the sealed environment can exert a force that is proportional to the area over which the pressure is applied. At the through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>, the force may be concentrated as the resistance to the application of the pressure is less than in the walls <b>402</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>.

The position change may cause the contact layer <b>202</b> to engage a slightly different portion of the debris <b>804</b> during the next negative-pressure therapy cycle, aiding disruption of the debris <b>804</b> and the application of antimicrobial/antibacterial agents by the adhesive layer <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The through-holes <b>210</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b> may generate concentrated stresses that influence disruption of the debris in different ways. For example, different shapes of the through-holes <b>210</b> may also focus the stresses generated by the contact layer <b>202</b> in advantageous areas. A lateral force, such as the lateral force <b>504</b>, generated by a contact layer, such as the contact layer <b>202</b>, may be related to a compressive force generated by applying negative pressure at a therapy pressure to a sealed therapeutic environment. For example, the lateral force <b>504</b> may be proportional to a product of a therapy pressure (TP) in the sealed environment, the compressibility factor (CF) of the contact layer <b>202</b>, and a surface area (A) the second surface <b>208</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. The relationship is expressed as follows:</p><p id="p-0109" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Lateral force &#x3b1;(TP*CF*A)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">In some embodiments, the therapy pressure TP is measured in N/m<sup>2</sup>, the compressibility factor (CF) is dimensionless, the area (A) is measured in m<sup>2</sup>, and the lateral force is measured in Newtons (N). The compressibility factor (CF) resulting from the application of negative pressure to a contact layer may be, for example, a dimensionless number that is proportional to the product of the void space percentage (VS) of a contact layer, the firmness factor (FF) of the contact layer, the strut angle (SA) of the through-holes in the contact layer, and the perforation shape factor (PSF) of the through-holes in the contact layer. The relationship is expressed as follows:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Compressibility Factor(CF)&#x3b1;(VS*FF*sin(SA)*PSF)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">Based on the above formulas, contact layers formed from different materials with through-holes of different shapes were manufactured and tested to determine the lateral force of the contact layers. For each contact layer, the therapy pressure TP was about &#x2212;125 mm Hg and the dimensions of the contact layer were about 200 mm by about 53 mm so that the surface area (A) of the tissue-facing surface of the contact layer was about 106 cm<sup>2 </sup>or 0.0106 m<sup>2</sup>. Based on the two equations described above, the lateral force for a Supracor&#xae; contact layer <b>202</b> having a firmness factor (FF) of 3 was about 13.3 where the Supracor&#xae; contact layer <b>202</b> had hexagonal through-holes <b>210</b> with a distance between opposite vertices of 5 mm, a perforation shape factor (PSF) of 1.07, a strut angle (SA) of approximately 66&#xb0;, and a void space percentage (VS) of about 55%. A similarly dimensioned V.A.C.&#xae; GRANUFOAM&#x2122; Dressing contact layer <b>202</b> generated the lateral force <b>504</b> of about 9.1 Newtons (N).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0000"><tables

For example, the sizing perforations may separate portions of the tissue interface <b>114</b> from adjacent portions of the tissue interface <b>114</b>, leaving one or more tabs connecting the portions of the tissue interface <b>114</b>. The tabs may have a size that may be an order of magnitude less than a corresponding size of the sizing perforations. In some embodiments, the sizing perforations may be a spiral cut in the tissue interface <b>114</b> originating near a center of the tissue interface <b>114</b> and emanating outward.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">In some embodiments, the sizing perforations be may be cubed sizing perforations. For example, the tissue interface <b>114</b> may have a plurality of sizing perforations formed in the tissue interface <b>114</b> from the second surface <b>1710</b> of the third retainer layer <b>1706</b> to the first surface <b>206</b> of the contact layer <b>202</b>. The plurality of sizing perforations may be arranged so that the sizing perforations create cubes within the tissue interface <b>114</b> that may be removable from the remainder of the tissue interface <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the cubes may be removed by tearing, cutting, or otherwise separating the cubes from the remainder of the tissue interface <b>114</b>. For example, cubes may be removed from edges of the tissue interface <b>114</b> to decrease a length and width of the tissue interface <b>114</b> to permit the tissue interface <b>144</b> to be placed within a tissue site that is smaller than the tissue interface <b>114</b> prior to removal of the cubes. In other embodiments, the cubed sizing perforations may permit removal of a portion of the tissue interface <b>114</b> in overlaying areas of a tissue site having variable topography. The removed portions of the tissue interface <b>114</b> may be aligned with raised topographical portions of the tissue site, permitting the tissue interface <b>114</b> to lay flat within the tissue site.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">The systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein may provide significant advantages. For example, the embodiments described herein provide a multi-layered tissue interface that is easier to apply to a tissue site, can provide improved healing/wound cleansing, and reduce improper placement of the tissue interface. The tissue interface described herein can also be used on sensitive tissue areas. For example, during sizing of the dressing, the user may place the entirety of the dressing at the tissue site, remove one or more layers, or cut each layer of the dressing simultaneously rather than individually.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">While shown in a few illustrative embodiments, a person having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein are susceptible to various changes and modifications that fall within the scope of the appended claims.
