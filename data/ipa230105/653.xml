id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A support for an area of a body having a hinge joint includes: a flexible, elastically stretchable framework configured to extend across the hinge joint of the area of the body; and a hinge mechanism affixed to the framework. The hinge mechanism includes a strut component and a first arm component connected to the strut component such that the first arm component is rotatable relative to the strut component only about a first pivot axis. A second arm component is connected to the strut component such that the second arm component is rotatable relative to the strut component only about a second pivot axis. The strut component is configured to extend with the framework across the hinge joint such that the first pivot axis is located on a first side of the hinge joint and the second pivot axis is located on a second, opposite side of the hinge joint.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="201.08mm" wi="158.75mm"

(b) a first hinge mechanism affixed to the web proximate a first side of the intermediate portion of the web, the first hinge mechanism comprising a strut component at least partially embedded in a material of the web and first and second arm components at least partially embedded in the material of the web, the first and second arm components being connected to respective opposite end portions of the strut component such that the first and second arm components are rotatable relative to the strut component about respective pivot axes located at opposite end portions of the strut component; and (c) a second hinge mechanism affixed to the web proximate a second, opposite side of the intermediate portion of the web, the second hinge mechanism comprising a strut component at least partially embedded in the material of the web and first and second arm components at least partially embedded in the material of the web, the first and second arm components of the second hinge mechanism being connected to respective opposite end portions of the strut component of the second hinge mechanism such that the first and second arm components of the second hinge mechanism are rotatable relative to the strut component of the second hinge mechanism about respective pivot axes located at opposite end portions of the strut component of the second hinge mechanism. In accordance with this aspect, each of the strut components and arm components of the first and second hinge mechanisms comprises components that are distinct from one another.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a feature of this aspect, the web encompasses and completely encircles at least a middle portion of the strut component.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another feature of this aspect, the support further includes strap interface components, with each strap interface component being affixed to the web. Specifically, the first strap interface component is connected to the first arm component and defines at least one opening therein configured to receive therethrough a strap for attachment of the web to the body on a first side of the hinge joint, and the second strap interface component is connected to the second arm component and defines at least one opening therein configured to receive therethrough a strap for attachment of the web to the body on the second side of the hinge joint.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a feature of this aspect, each of the strap interface components is at least partially embedded in the material of the web.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a feature of this aspect, each of the strut components and arm components of the first and second hinge mechanisms comprises a generally planar component.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for supporting an area of a body that has a hinge joint includes providing a support comprising: (i) a flexible framework configured to extend across the hinge joint of the area of the body, the flexible framework comprising an elastically stretchable material; (ii) a first hinge mechanism affixed to the framework; and (iii) a second hinge mechanism affixed to the framework. The first hinge mechanism itself includes first, second and third distinct components, with the first and second components being connected together such that the first and second components are rotatable relative to each other about a first pivot axis, and with the second and third components being connected together such that the second and third components are rotatable relative to each other about a second pivot axis. Similarly, the second hinge mechanism includes first, second and third distinct components, with the first and second components of the second hinge mechanism being connected together such that the first and second components of the second hinge mechanism are rotatable relative to each other only about a first pivot axis of the second hinge mechanism, and with the second and third components of the second hinge mechanism being connected together such that the second and third components of the second hinge mechanism are rotatable relative to each other only about a second pivot axis of the second hinge mechanism.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method further includes positioning the support against the body such that: (i) the support extends across the hinge joint and such that the second components of the first and second hinge mechanisms extend with the framework across the hinge joint of the body, with the first pivot axes of the first and second hinge mechanisms being located on a first side of the hinge joint of the body and the second pivot axes of the first and second hinge mechanisms being located on a second, opposite side of the hinge joint of the body; and (ii) the second components of the first and second hinge mechanisms extend on opposite sides of the hinge joint of the body.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a feature of this aspect, the area of the body comprises an area of the knee, and the support extends across the knee such that the second components of the first and second hinge mechanisms extend across the knee, with the first pivot axes of the first and second hinge mechanisms being located above the knee and the second pivot axes of the first and second hinge mechanisms being located below the knee.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a feature of this aspect, the step of positioning the support includes tensioning the framework in abutment with the area of the body&#x2014;including the hinge joint&#x2014;and fastening the support to the body on opposite sides of the hinge joint of the body such that the framework is held in tension in its abutment with the area of the body. In so doing, the elastically stretchable framework conforms to the surface contour of the area of the body as a result of said tensioning.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, in accordance with these and other aspects and features of the invention, many of the inventive supports each includes a framework having a surface for abutment with an area of a body. The framework extends in generally first and second directions to define a surface of the framework for abutment with the area of the body. With reference to a cylindrical coordinate system, the framework of the support generally extends in a first axial direction and may extend in a second circumferential direction to define the surface of the framework, which is intended to abut an area of the body when the support is worn, such as a portion of an arm, leg, or torso. Because the framework extends in axial and circumferential directions, the surface of the framework generally is shaped to fit an area of a leg, arm, or torso in its abutting engagement with the body. Furthermore, in many preferred embodiments, the support spans and supports an area that includes a hinge joint of the body and, in such embodiments, the support comprises a potentiating support for the hinge joint. As used herein, a &#x201c;hinge joint&#x201d; refers to a knee joint or an elbow joint and is characterized in that the joint provides hinging movement that is generally limited to being within a plane.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In further accordance with these and other aspects and features of the invention, the framework is formed from one or more elastomeric materials such that the framework is expandable and recoverable. As used herein, &#x201c;elastomeric material&#x201d; refers to &#x201c;a material that is capable of being easily expanded and resuming former shape.&#x201d; Something that has the ability to resume its former shape after expansion or compression is referred to herein as being &#x201c;recoverable.&#x201d; Something that is expandable and recoverable also is referred to herein as being &#x201c;elastically stretchable.&#x201d; This is in contrast to something that is &#x201c;resilient,&#x201d; which refers to having &#x201c;the ability to resume its former shape after compression.&#x201d; Preferably, the framework also is flexible (i.e., pliable) and is capable of conforming to the general area of the body to be supported without substantial stretching; however, it is contemplated within the invention that the framework may need to be stretched to a certain extent in order for the surface of the framework to conform to the general area of the body to be supported. As used herein, &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; refers to &#x201c;the ability to bend freely and repeatedly without breaking.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Still in accordance with these and other aspects and features of the invention, the framework defines at least one permanent opening in a surface thereof regardless of whether the support is donned and regardless of whether the surface of the framework is in abutment with the area of the body to be supported. The at least one opening is bounded by the framework and, preferably, the at least one opening extends completely through the framework from an inner surface of the framework, when disposed in abutment with the area of the body to be supported, to an outer surface of the framework.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, when the support is donned, the framework along its entire boundary with the at least one opening is elastically stretchable between a first initial state and extended states and, when expanded to a said extended state, the framework stores potential energy that is released as kinetic energy upon its return to the initial state. In certain preferred embodiments, interconnected segments of elastomeric material constitute the framework, with the interconnected segments defining these permanent openings in the framework. The interconnected segments may be integrally formed through conventional molding processes or, alternatively, the interconnected segments may be constructed from the joining of segments that are preformed from elastomeric material. Each segment preferably comprises a generally linear segment. A benefit of these openings extending from inner to outer surfaces of the framework is that these openings thereby permit ventilation of portions of the area of the body that are in abutting engagement with the framework. Indeed, the area of the openings to the surface area of the framework preferably has an &#x201c;open air ratio&#x201d; of 50% or greater. However, in alternative embodiments that are not shown, the openings in the surface of the framework may not extend entirely through the framework. In such embodiments, the openings comprise cavities formed in the surface of the framework.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additional aspects include methods of making a support in accordance with any of the foregoing aspects, and methods of using a support in accordance with any of the foregoing aspects.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to the aforementioned aspects and features, the present invention further encompasses the various possible combinations of the foregoing aspects and features.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

Furthermore, any embodiment discussed and identified as being &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; is considered to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. Other embodiments also may be discussed for additional illustrative purposes in providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. Moreover, many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein and fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Accordingly, while the present invention is described herein in detail in relation to one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative and exemplary of the present invention, and is made merely for the purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. The detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor is to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention, which scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof. It is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Thus, for example, any sequence(s) and/or temporal order of steps of various processes or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes or methods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise. Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention is to be defined by the appended claims rather than the description set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which the Ordinary Artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual use of such term herein. To the extent that the meaning of a term used herein&#x2014;as understood by the Ordinary Artisan based on the contextual use of such term&#x2014;differs in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended that the meaning of the term as understood by the Ordinary Artisan should prevail.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, it is important to note that, as used herein, &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; each generally denotes &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; but does not exclude a plurality unless the contextual use dictates otherwise. Thus, reference to &#x201c;a picnic basket having an apple&#x201d; describes &#x201c;a picnic basket having at least one apple&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;a picnic basket having apples.&#x201d; In contrast, reference to &#x201c;a picnic basket having a single apple&#x201d; describes &#x201c;a picnic basket having only one apple.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When used herein to join a list of items, &#x201c;or&#x201d; denotes &#x201c;at least one of the items,&#x201d; but does not exclude a plurality of items of the list.

The support <b>100</b> includes a flexible, elastically stretchable framework <b>106</b> that is configured to extend across the hinge joint of the area of the body. With reference to support <b>100</b>, this support is intended and designed for use with the area of a person's knee, and the flexible, elastically stretchable framework <b>106</b> is configured to extend across and encompass the knee.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The flexible framework <b>106</b> comprises a elastomeric material and, specifically, the framework <b>106</b> defines a flexible, elastically stretchable web of elastomeric interconnected members. The elastomeric interconnected members mostly comprise generally linear or curved segments. Furthermore, the framework <b>106</b>, and the interconnected members in particular, preferably include no internal cavities or pockets of either fluid or gas. The interconnected members define a plurality of permanent openings in the web that extend completely through the framework <b>106</b>. The openings are &#x201c;permanent&#x201d; in that they exist regardless of whether the framework <b>106</b> actually is disposed in abutment with the body due to the permanent interconnection of the segments defining the openings. Furthermore, some of these openings are completely bounded by the interconnected members, and the interconnected members defining such an opening constitute a portion of the framework <b>106</b> that is stretchable and recoverable about the entire boundary of the opening with the framework <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The web includes a larger opening that is symmetrically oriented with respect to the side edges of the framework <b>106</b> and that is configured to receive a portion of the knee therethrough and which serves as an alignment opening <b>107</b>. Specifically, the alignment opening <b>107</b> is defined and bounded completely by interconnected members of the framework <b>106</b> and is dimensioned and shaped specifically to receive a joint protuberance of the knee. For example, insofar as the framework <b>106</b> is adapted to abut a lower thigh and upper calf of a human leg, the alignment opening <b>107</b> is shaped to receive the patella of the knee of the leg.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The framework <b>106</b> is configured to be stretched and tensioned into abutment with the area of the knee such that the framework <b>106</b> conforms to the shape and contour of the area of the knee when stretched and tensioned. In particular, the framework <b>106</b> has a relaxed state when not stretched and tensioned as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wherein the support <b>100</b> rests upon a wood table. In this state, the framework <b>106</b> does not conform to the shape and contour of the area of the knee.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">It will be appreciated by the Ordinary Artisan that, due to the elastically stretchable nature of the framework, the support allows flexing of a hinge joint of the body and, in fact, contributes to such flexing. In this regard, because at least portions of the framework <b>106</b> are elastically stretchable, flexing of the knee from an extended position to a retracted or bent position results in the expansion of the framework <b>106</b> and storage of potential energy therein that is released as kinetic energy when the knee is returned to the extended position. The support <b>100</b> thus is not an immobilizing support but, instead, the support <b>100</b> is a potentiating support for the area of the body including the knee joint insofar as the framework <b>106</b> is capable of dynamically biasing a joint toward a particular state of extension or flexion.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In particular, because of the elastically stretchable and recoverable nature of the material of the framework <b>106</b>, the framework <b>106</b> stores potential energy when stretched and tensioned that is released as kinetic energy upon transitioning of the framework <b>106</b> back toward a relaxed (or less tensioned) state. This correlates to transitioning of hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> (discussed next) from a first position corresponding to a flexed or bent position of the knee, to a second position of the hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> corresponding to a less flexed or bent (i.e., more extended) position of the knee.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The support <b>100</b> further includes a pair of hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b>. Each hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is affixed to the framework <b>106</b> and is structurally the same. Thus, while the detailed structure of hinge mechanism <b>108</b> will now be described, it will equally apply to hinge mechanism <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Hinge mechanism <b>108</b> includes a strut component <b>112</b> and first and second arm components <b>114</b>,<b>116</b>. Each of these components preferably is generally planar, as will be appreciated from inspection of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a side perspective view of a rear, lower portion of the hinge mechanism <b>108</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a side perspective view of a front, middle portion of the hinge mechanism <b>108</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a side perspective view of the front, middle portion of the hinge mechanism <b>108</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a side perspective view of part of the front, middle portion of the hinge mechanism <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As perhaps best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, the first arm component <b>114</b> is connected to the strut component <b>112</b> such that the first arm component <b>114</b> is rotatable relative to the strut component <b>112</b> about a first pivot axis <b>118</b>. As opposed to, for example, a continuous hinge, the strut component <b>112</b> and the first arm component <b>114</b> are mechanically connected, and the first pivot axis <b>118</b> is fixed relative to each of these components. Consequently, the first arm component <b>114</b> is rotatable relative to the strut component <b>112</b> only about a first pivot axis <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Similar to the first arm component <b>114</b>, the second arm component <b>116</b> is connected to the strut component <b>112</b> such that the second arm component <b>116</b> is rotatable relative to the strut component <b>112</b> about a second pivot axis <b>120</b>. Moreover, the strut component <b>112</b> and the second arm component <b>116</b> are mechanically connected, and the second pivot axis <b>118</b> is fixed relative to each of these components. Consequently, the second arm component <b>116</b> is rotatable relative to the strut component <b>112</b> only about the second pivot axis <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The hinge mechanism <b>108</b> is located along a first side edge of the framework <b>106</b>, and the hinge mechanism <b>110</b> is located along a second, opposite side edge of the framework <b>106</b>. The hinge member <b>108</b>, and the strut component <b>112</b> in particular, is partially embedded in a material of the framework <b>106</b>. Indeed, as perhaps best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, a material of the framework <b>106</b> actually encompasses and completely encircles a middle portion of the strut component <b>112</b>. The strut component <b>112</b> may be so embedded within the material of the framework during the manufacture of the support by molding or otherwise forming the framework <b>106</b> directly onto the strut component <b>112</b>. Similarly, each of the first and second arm components <b>114</b>,<b>116</b> may be at least partially embedded in a material of the framework <b>106</b>; however, none of the first and second arm components <b>114</b>,<b>116</b> are even partially embedded in a material of the framework <b>106</b> in the support <b>100</b> as shown.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is arranged relative to the framework <b>106</b> such that the strut component of the each hinge mechanism extends with the framework across the hinge joint such that the first pivot axis of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is located on one side of the hinge joint and the second pivot axis of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is located on the other, opposite side of the hinge joint when the support is worn. In particular, the strut components of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> are configured to extend with the framework <b>106</b> across the knee joint such that the first pivot axis of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is located above the knee and the second pivot axis of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> is located below the knee.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">With further regard to hinging mechanism <b>108</b>, a first hinging member <b>122</b> connects the first arm component <b>114</b> to the strut component <b>112</b>, the first hinging member <b>122</b> including a cylindrical portion <b>124</b> in abutment with which the first arm component <b>114</b> and strut component <b>112</b> rotate. Likewise, a second hinging member <b>126</b> connects the second arm component <b>116</b> to the strut component <b>112</b>, the second hinging member <b>126</b> including a cylindrical portion <b>128</b> in abutment with which the second arm component <b>116</b> and strut component <b>112</b> rotate. As will be appreciated, the first pivot axis <b>118</b> axially extends through the cylindrical portion <b>124</b> of the first hinging member <b>122</b>, and the second pivot axis <b>120</b> axially extends through the cylindrical portion <b>128</b> of the second hinging member <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As will be appreciated from the drawings and above disclosure, each of the components of the hinge mechanism are distinct from one another. Moreover, the components <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> of each hinge mechanism <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> are preferably rigid, in that each provides a degree of rigidity in a local area of the framework <b>106</b>, especially proximate a local peripheral area along longitudinal sides of the framework <b>106</b> within which such respective component may be attached and/or embedded or otherwise may be affixed.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The support <b>100</b> further includes, along each side of the framework <b>106</b>, first and second strap interface components <b>130</b>,<b>132</b>. The strap interface components <b>130</b>,<b>132</b> are structurally the same. Thus, while the detailed structure of a first strap interface component <b>130</b> will now be described, such discussion equally will apply to the second strap interface component <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The strap interface component <b>130</b> is affixed to the framework <b>106</b>. In this respect, the first strap interface component <b>130</b> is at least partially embedded in a material of the framework <b>106</b> (as perhaps best seen at <b>131</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), and/or the first strap interface component <b>130</b> is riveted or otherwise fastened to the material of the framework <b>106</b> (as perhaps best seen at <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">While affixed to the framework <b>106</b>, the first strap interface component <b>130</b> is connected to the first arm component <b>114</b> and the second strap interface component <b>132</b> is connected to the second arm component <b>116</b> of one of the hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b>. In this respect, each strap interface component <b>130</b>,<b>132</b> is riveted or otherwise fastened at <b>135</b> to the respective arm component <b>114</b>,<b>116</b> in fixed disposition relative thereto, as perhaps best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>12</b></figref> as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, wherein a side perspective view of part of a strap interface component is shown. As will be appreciated from examination of these drawings, each strap interface component is not only riveted or otherwise fastened to an arm component but also is fastened to the framework at <b>135</b> by the rivet or other fastener.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The first strap interface components <b>130</b> also each defines at least one opening therein that is configured to receive therethrough a strap for attachment of the framework <b>106</b> to the area of the knee. In particular, the first strap interface components <b>130</b> each defines two openings <b>134</b> through which straps are received for attachment of the upper portion of the framework <b>106</b> to the area of the leg above the knee. Likewise, the second strap interface components <b>132</b> each defines two openings through which straps are received for attachment of the lower portion of the framework <b>106</b> to the area of the leg below the knee.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The front side of the framework <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> generally is the same as the back side of the framework <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>13</b></figref>; however, unlike the surface of the front side of the framework <b>106</b>, selected areas of the surface of the back side of the framework <b>106</b> include raised protuberances (representatives ones of which are indicated by <b>138</b> in the drawings), which protuberances are intended to increase the frictional abutment of the framework <b>106</b> with the area of the knee when the support <b>106</b> is donned. The protuberances <b>138</b> serve to position and hold the support in abutment with the area of the body including the spanning of the hinge joint.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In use of the support <b>100</b> in accordance with the invention, the support <b>100</b> is positioned against the body such that the support <b>100</b> extends across the knee and such that the second strut components <b>112</b> of the first and second hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> extend with the framework <b>106</b> across the knee joint, with the first pivot axes <b>118</b> of the first and second hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> being located above the knee joint and with the second pivot axes <b>120</b> of the first and second hinge mechanisms <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> being located below the knee joint. The support <b>100</b> is further positioned such that the strut components <b>112</b> of the first and second hinge mechanisms extend on opposite sides of the hinge joint of the body. The positioning of the support <b>100</b> includes tensioning the framework <b>106</b> in abutment with the area of the knee and fastening the support <b>100</b> to the body on opposite sides of the knee such that the framework <b>106</b> is held in tension in its abutment with the area of the body including the knee. In so doing, the elastically stretchable framework <b>106</b> preferably conforms to the surface contour of the area of the knee as a result of the tensioning.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The support <b>100</b> is fastened to the body in a conforming position via a fastening mechanism (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>17</b></figref>) that is detachably connected to and applies tension at different points of attachment to the framework <b>106</b> such that the framework <b>106</b> is expanded and tensioned in its abutment with the area of the body and, in particular, in the area of the knee. Furthermore, the fastening mechanism preferably includes fastening straps with Velcro fasteners. The straps are received and extend through the strap openings <b>134</b> of the strap interface components of the support <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The combination of the support <b>100</b> and fastening mechanism is referred to herein as a support assembly. The support assembly optionally may include a sleeve having a open-ended tubular structure.
