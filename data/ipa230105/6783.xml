Specifically, a reception STA receives a PPDU from a transmission STA via a broadband and decodes the PPDU. The PPDU includes a control field and a data field. When the broadband is a band of 320/160+160 MHz including a primary channel of 160 MHz and a secondary channel of 160 MHz, the data field is received via a first multiple RU in which a 996-RU and a 484-RU are aggregated. The first multiple RU is allocated within the primary channel of 160 MHz or the secondary channel of 160 MHz.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

Scanning methods include active scanning and passive scanning.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a network discovery operation including an active scanning process. In active scanning, a STA performing scanning transmits a probe request frame and waits for a response to the probe request frame in order to identify which AP is present around while moving to channels. A responder transmits a probe response frame as a response to the probe request frame to the STA having transmitted the probe request frame. Here, the responder may be a STA that transmits the last beacon frame in a BSS of a channel being scanned. In the BSS, since an AP transmits a beacon frame, the AP is the responder. In an IBSS, since STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns, the responder is not fixed. For example, when the STA transmits a probe request frame via channel 1 and receives a probe response frame via channel 1, the STA may store BSS-related information included in the received probe response frame, may move to the next channel (e.g., channel 2), and may perform scanning (e.g., transmits a probe request and receives a probe response via channel 2) by the same method.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, scanning may be performed by a passive scanning method. In passive scanning, a STA performing scanning may wait for a beacon frame while moving to channels. A beacon frame is one of management frames in IEEE 802.11 and is periodically transmitted to indicate the presence of a wireless network and to enable the STA performing scanning to find the wireless network and to participate in the wireless network. In a BSS, an AP serves to periodically transmit a beacon frame. In an IBSS, STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns. Upon receiving the beacon frame, the STA performing scanning stores information related to a BSS included in the beacon frame and records beacon frame information in each channel while moving to another channel. The STA having received the beacon frame may store BSS-related information included in the received beacon frame, may move to the next channel, and may perform scanning in the next channel by the same method.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">After discovering the network, the STA may perform an authentication process in S<b>320</b>. The authentication process may be referred to as a first authentication process to be clearly distinguished from the following security setup operation in S<b>340</b>. The authentication process in S<b>320</b> may include a process in which the STA transmits an authentication request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an authentication response frame to the STA in response. The authentication frames used for an authentication request/response are management frames.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The authentication frames may include information related to an authentication algorithm number, an authentication transaction sequence number, a status code, a challenge text, a robust security network (RSN), and a finite cyclic group.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The STA may transmit the authentication request frame to the AP. The AP may determine whether to allow the authentication of the STA based on the information included in the received authentication request frame. The AP may provide the authentication processing result to the STA via the authentication response frame.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the STA is successfully authenticated, the STA may perform an association process in S<b>330</b>. The association process includes a process in which the STA transmits an association request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an association response frame to the STA in response. The association request frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a beacon listen interval, a service set identifier (SSID), a supported rate, a supported channel, RSN, a mobility domain, a supported operating class, a traffic indication map (TIM) broadcast request, and an interworking service capability. The association response frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a status code, an association ID (AID), a supported rate, an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameter set, a received channel power indicator (RCPI), a received signal-to-noise indicator (RSNI), a mobility domain, a timeout interval (association comeback time), an overlapping BSS scanning parameter, a TIM broadcast response, and a QoS map.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In S<b>340</b>, the STA may perform a security setup process. The security setup process in S<b>340</b> may include a process of setting up a private key through four-way handshaking, for example, through an extensible authentication protocol over LAN (EAPOL) frame.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a PPDU used in an IEEE standard.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As illustrated, various types of PHY protocol data units (PPDUs) are used in IEEE a/g/n/ac standards.

For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is transmitted, an STA may apply puncturing to the secondary 20 MHz band out of the 80 MHz band, and may transmit a PPDU only through a primary 20 MHz band and a secondary 40 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0195">For example, a pattern of the preamble puncturing may be configured in advance. For example, when a first puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied only to the secondary 20 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a second puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only any one of two secondary 20 MHz bands included in the secondary 40 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a third puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only the secondary 20 MHz band included in the primary 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band). For example, when a fourth puncturing is applied, puncturing may be applied to at least one 20 MHz channel not belonging to a primary 40 MHz band in the presence of the primary 40 MHz band included in the 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0196">Information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU may be included in U-SIG and/or EHT-SIG. For example, a first field of the U-SIG may include information related to a contiguous bandwidth, and second field of the U-SIG may include information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0197">For example, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. When a bandwidth of the PPDU exceeds 80 MHz, the U-SIG may be configured individually in unit of 80 MHz. For example, when the bandwidth of the PPDU is 160 MHz, the PPDU may include a first U-SIG for a first 80 MHz band and a second U-SIG for a second 80 MHz band. In this case, a first field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band. In addition, a first field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the second 80 MHz band. Meanwhile, an EHT-SIG contiguous to the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing applied to the second 80 MHz band (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern), and an EHT-SIG contiguous to the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0198">Additionally or alternatively, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. The U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) for all bands. That is, the EHT-SIG may not include the information related to the preamble puncturing, and only the U-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing (i.e., the information related to the preamble puncturing pattern).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0199">The U-SIG may be configured in unit of 20 MHz. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is configured, the U-SIG may be duplicated. That is, four identical U-SIGs may be included in the 80 MHz PPDU.

As described above, information related to an MCS scheme applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in U-SIG. The EHT-SIG may be configured based on a DCM scheme. For example, among N data tones (e.g., 52 data tones) allocated for the EHT-SIG, a first modulation scheme may be applied to half of consecutive tones, and a second modulation scheme may be applied to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. That is, a transmitting STA may use the first modulation scheme to modulate specific control information through a first symbol and allocate it to half of the consecutive tones, and may use the second modulation scheme to modulate the same control information by using a second symbol and allocate it to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. As described above, information (e.g., a 1-bit field) regarding whether the DCM scheme is applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in the U-SIG. An HE-STF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> may be used for improving automatic gain control estimation in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) environment or an OFDMA environment.

For example, a first type of STF (e.g., lx STF) may be generated based on a first type STF sequence in which a non-zero coefficient is arranged with an interval of 16 subcarriers. An STF signal generated based on the first type STF sequence may have a period of 0.8 &#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 0.8 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a first type STF having a length of 4 &#x3bc;s. For example, a second type of STF (e.g., <b>2</b><i>x </i>STF) may be generated based on a second type STF sequence in which a non-zero coefficient is arranged with an interval of 8 subcarriers. An STF signal generated based on the second type STF sequence may have a period of 1.6 &#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 1.6 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a second type STF having a length of 8 &#x3bc;s.

For example, the equation 2 below may represent a sequence defined as 16 tone intervals from a tone index &#x2212;112 to a tone index 112. Since a subcarrier spacing of 78.125 kHz is applied to the EHT-STR, the 16 tone intervals may imply that an EHT-STF coefficient (or element) is arranged with an interval of 78.125*16=1250 kHz.

Specific details will be described below.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0247">The RU defined in 11ax may include a plurality of subcarriers. For example, when the RU includes N subcarriers, it may be expressed by an N-tone RU or N RUs. A location of a specific RU may be expressed by a subcarrier index. The subcarrier index may be defined in unit of a subcarrier frequency spacing. In the 11ax standard, the subcarrier frequency spacing is 312.5 kHz or 78.125 kHz, and the subcarrier frequency spacing for the RU is 78.125 kHz. That is, a subcarrier index +1 for the RU may mean a location which is more increased by 78.125 kHz than a DC tone, and a subcarrier index &#x2212;1 for the RU may mean a location which is more decreased by 78.125 kHz than the DC tone. For example, when the location of the specific RU is expressed by [&#x2212;121:&#x2212;96], the RU may be located in a region from a subcarrier index &#x2212;121 to a subcarrier index &#x2212;96.

Embodiment Applicable to the Present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0334" num="0350">In the wireless LAN 802.11 system, to increase peak throughput, it is considered to use a wider band than the existing 11ax or to transmit an increased stream by using more antennas. In addition, the present specification also considers a method of aggregating multiple links or aggregating multiple RUs and allocating them to one STA for transmission.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0351">In this specification, a method of allocating and transmitting multiple RUs to one STA is considered, and in this case, a method of aggregating RUs in various bandwidths is proposed. In particular, the present specification focuses on and proposes a method of aggregating large-RU in OFDMA transmission.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0352">In the existing 802.11ax, since each STA is allocated to only one RU and transmitted during OFDMA transmission, RUs having a size other than the defined RU cannot be considered, so there is a disadvantage in terms of efficiency or channel availability. To overcome this drawback, 802.11be considers a method of allocating and transmitting multiple RUs to one STA, and in this specification, several principles and various combinations for RU aggregation during OFDMA transmission are proposed.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0353">The RUs of various sizes proposed in 802.11ax are as follows.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0354">26/52/106/242/484/996/2&#xd7;996 RU</p><p id="p-0339" num="0355">In the present specification, it is assumed that an RU having tones less than 242 is a small-RU and an RU having tones more that 242 is a large-RU. In addition, in terms of efficiency, since the combination of small-RU and large-RU does not have a significant benefit, only the combination between small-RU and large-RU can be considered during RU aggregation, and in this specification, the combination of large-RU is proposed. In addition, a preamble puncturing situation is additionally considered. However, in order to minimize interference during preamble puncturing in each 80 MHz subchannel of various bandwidths, the tone plan of the adjacent 20 MHz channel is replaced with a 20 MHz tone plan, or a tone plan in which only the 20 MHz part is partially shifted from the 80 MHz tone plan can also be used. Of course, the tone plan of the adjacent 20 MHz channel is not changed using hardware/filter that can effectively control interference, that is, the original 80 MHz tone plan is used as it is and the remaining channels except for the 20 MHz preamble punctured can also be used for transmission. Alternatively, the tone plan is used as it is, but when using the 242-tone RU of the preamble punctured 20 MHz adjacent channel, the encoding is applied as the 242-tone RU method of 802.11ax, and instead, during transmission, some tones adjacent to a punctured channel among 242-tone RUs may be transmitted by forcibly puncturing or reducing power. Here, the adjacent 20 MHz channel means 20 MHz channels other than the preamble punctured 20 MHz channels in each 40 MHz subchannel when each 80 MHz subchannel is divided into lower 40 MHz and higher 40 MHz. In addition, 484-tone RU (484-tone RU in the corresponding 40 MHz in the 80 MHz tone plan) can be used for transmission at lower 40 MHz or higher 40 MHz that is not preamble punctured, and 242-tone RU (in the 80 MHz tone plan, 242-tone RUs in the corresponding 20 MHz or 242-tone RUs in the corresponding 20 MHz in the changed tone plan to reduce interference) may be used. This method can be directly applied to all of the following preamble puncturing situations.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0356">4.1. Rule</p><p id="p-0341" num="0357">In PPDU transmission over 160/80 MHz bandwidth, two or more 80 MHz subchannels exist, and when a specific bandwidth is created by combining RUs, in each 80 MHz subchannel, the combination of RUs that can create the maximum bandwidth is used, and the combination of RUs that create a large bandwidth is allocated preferentially. For example, when transmitting through 160/80 MHz bandwidth, each 80 MHz subchannel can use 996-tone RU (80 MHz) when preamble puncturing is not performed, and In the case of preamble puncturing, various combinations of 242+484-tone RU (60 MHz), 484/242+242-tone RU (40 MHz), and 242-tone RU (20 MHz) can be considered. Assuming that the first 80 MHz subchannel can use up to 60 MHz and the second 80 MHz subchannel can use up to 40 MHz, the bandwidth of 80 MHz can be allocated to a specific STA and 20 MHz can be allocated to another STA to transmit OFDMA PPDU, in this case Only the combination of 242+484-tone RUs in the first 80 MHz subchannel and 242-tone RUs in the second 80 MHz subchannel is considered for the combination of RUs to create a bandwidth of 80 MHz. The combination of 484/242+242-tone RU in the first 80 MHz subchannel and 484/242+242-tone RU in the second 80 MHz subchannel is not considered.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0358">4.2.

In this case, a combination of 242+484-tone RU may be considered. In addition, 40 MHz bandwidth can be allocated, and in this case, a combination of 242+242-tone RU can be considered. In this case, it may be preferable to assign and transmit through a 484-tone RU rather than transmission through a combination of 242+242-tone RUs. The reason may be considered a case of allocating at least 20 MHz to another STA in OFDMA transmission in which 40 MHz bandwidth is allocated to one STA. In this case, a minimum bandwidth of 60 MHz is available (only 20 MHz is preamble punctured), which is continuous 60 MHz or non-consecutive 40+20 MHz. In both cases, 484-tone RU is always available, so it is better to use the existing 484-tone RU rather than considering the combination of 242+242-tone RU.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0362">4.2.2. 160/80+80 MHz</p><p id="p-0347" num="0363">For the 160/80+80 MHz tone plan, the 80 MHz tone plan is repeated twice.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0364">The RU combination in 4.2.1. can be considered, and the combination of two 80 MHz subchannels can be additionally considered as follows.

Therefore, since 484-tone RUs necessarily exist in the 80 MHz subchannel to which 40 is allocated, it may be preferable to allocate and transmit the existing 484-tone RUs rather than transmission through the combination of 242+242-tone RUs. If there is no special mention of 40, the same is used in the proposal below. The combination of 60+60 at 120 MHz is not considered because it violates the principle of 4.1. The reason is OFDMA transmission, so 20 MHz for another STA exists, and in this case, one 80 MHz subchannel can be fully used.

The reason <b>60</b> can be allocated is when 20 MHz preamble puncturing occurs in an 80 MHz subchannel, and only a maximum of 60 MHz bandwidth is used. In this case, the 80 MHz subchannel to which 40 is allocated is also a case in which a bandwidth exceeding 60 MHz cannot be used due to preamble puncturing. In the proposal below, except for the 80 MHz subchannel to which the minimum bandwidth is allocated, preamble puncturing is applied to the 80 MHz subchannel to which 60 or 40 is allocated among other subchannels, meaning that the maximum allocable bandwidth is 60 MHz or 40 MHz.

This can be advantageous in situations where there is no secondary 80 MHz. That is, it can be divided into STAs allocated by RU combinations within 160 MHz and STAs allocated by other RU combinations within 80 MHz.

For example, (242)+(242) is created by a combination of two 80 MHz channels is a case in which only 242-tone RUs can be used by preamble puncturing for both channels. If 484-tone RUs can be used in one channel, simply 242/484-tone RUs or (484)+(242) can be used. However, there may be remaining RUs in the 80 MHz channel in which the small RU is used among the two 80 MHz channels (assigned to another STA), and the available bandwidth including this may be the same as or smaller than the usable bandwidth of the channel in which the large RU is used.
