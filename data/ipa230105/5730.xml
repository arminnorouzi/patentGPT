Existing CE-ESI-MS uses electrospray interfaces that may be broadly categorized as either sheath flow (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,993,633; 9,465,014; 9,234,880; and 8,613,845) or sheathless (U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,927,396; 8,754,370; 6,863,790; 10,121,645; and 5,505,832).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sheath flow interfaces typically utilize a coaxial conducting liquid to provide electrical contact for the electrophoretic separation, modify the separation medium to be more MS-compatible, and generate electrospray for MS detection. The f sheath flow interface was developed by Smith's group and was commercialized in the 1990s (U.S. Pat. No. 5,993,633). Since then other versions of the sheath flow interface have been developed. Notably, Dovichi's group developed a sheath flow interface that uses electroosmotic nanoflow to drive the electrospray (U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,465,014 and 9,234,880). In that design, the spray emitter is a borosilicate glass pulled at the distal end to create a micro nozzle, typically with a 10 to 30 &#x3bc;m inner diameter. The separation capillary is inserted into the emitter filled with an MS-compatible conducting liquid supplied from the conducting liquid reservoir through a conducting liquid channel. The high ESI voltage driving the electroosmotic flow inside the emitter is delivered to the conducting liquid reservoir. While this configuration has been shown to provide good sensitivity for multiple analytes the design still has some problems. The emitter's inner diameter of 0.75 mm introduces a relatively high sheath liquid to sample dilution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another notable version of sheath flow interface was developed by Chen's group (U.S. Pat. No. 8,613,845). That design uses a stainless steel hollow needle with a beveled tip. The needle acts as an electrode for the CE outlet and the spray emitter for MS. Although the steel needle interface is more rugged than tapered glass interfaces, the design is typically, used with the electrospray voltage delivered directly, which often leads to bubble formation and corona discharge due to redox reaction on the metal surface. This usually limits the electrospray performance. Further, metal emitters need a mechanical pump-driven flow to maintain a stable electrospray. This requirement creates a higher flow rate than the electrokinetically pumped interface described above, which then limits its sensitivity owing to higher dilution of the analyte by the conducting liquid.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In sheathless interface designs, the separation capillary commonly serves as the emitter which eliminates sample dilution associated with sheath flow interfaces. A notable design was developed by Moini's group (U.S. Pat. No. 6,863,790) and was recently commercialized. The interface used a porous capillary to provide electrical contact to the separation buffer without the introduction of a conducting liquid. The distal end of the separation capillary is etched to a thin porous thickness, sufficiently thin to be conductive. It is placed within a metal sleeve needle filled with a conductive liquid. ESI voltage is then applied to the metal needle to drive electrospray at the capillary tip. Though the interface provides better sensitivity over sheath flow interfaces, the etched capillary is extremely fragile. Under high voltage, deterioration of the porous tip leads to degraded electrospray and decreased sensitivity. Another major drawback is insufficient flow to drive electrospray when performing separation with negligible or reversed electro-osmotic flow. The electrophoresis buffer is also the electrospray liquid, which limits the allowable separation conditions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to the electrospray ionization efficiency dependence of MS detection, quantitation in CE-ESI-MS may benefit from coupling optical detection with the electrospray interface. A few attempts have been made so far to achieve this with marginal success. However, integrating optical detection with ESI in CE-ESI-MS is still a challenge due to the complexity of integrating relatively large optical components with an electrospray interface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In existing sheath flow ESI interfaces, the use of a conducting liquid offers flexibility in separation buffer composition. In contrast, a sheathless interface may use the separation buffer without the introduction of a conducting liquid to generate electrospray. A sheathless interface has the benefit of high sensitivity due to the absence of sheath flow dilution.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An important requirement for a CE-ESI-MS interface is the stability of the electrospray. Achieving stable electrospray at a nanoliter-per-minute flow rate is a challenge with existing technologies. There is, therefore, a need for a CE-ESI-MS interface with improved electrospray stability. There is further a need for such a solution to incorporate optical detection capabilities to incorporate the benefits of such additional testing capabilities.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed solution comprises an injection subassembly that includes a nicked alignment tube, a spray needle, and a conducting liquid tube.

different entities (which may variously be referred to as &#x201c;units,&#x201d; &#x201c;circuits,&#x201d; other components, etc.) may be described or claimed as &#x201c;configured&#x201d; to perform one or more tasks or operations. This formulation&#x2014;[entity] configured to [perform one or more tasks]&#x2014;is used herein to refer to structure (i.e., something physical, such as an electronic circuit). More specifically, this formulation is used to indicate that this structure is arranged to perform the one or more tasks during operation. A structure may be said to be &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; perform some task even if the structure is not currently being operated. A &#x201c;credit distribution circuit configured to distribute credits to a plurality of processor cores&#x201d; is intended to cover, for example, an integrated circuit that has circuitry that performs this function during operation, even if the integrated circuit in question is not currently being used (e.g., a power supply is not connected to it). Thus, an entity described or recited as &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; perform some task refers to something physical, such as a device, circuit, memory storing program instructions executable to implement the task, etc. This phrase is not used herein to refer to something intangible.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0150">The term &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; is not intended to mean &#x201c;configurable to.&#x201d; An unprogrammed FPGA, for example, would not be considered to be &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; perform some specific function, although it may be &#x201c;configurable to&#x201d; perform that function after programming.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0151">Reciting in the appended claims that a structure is &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; perform one or more tasks is expressly intended not to invoke 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(f) for that claim element. Accordingly, claims in this application that do not otherwise include the &#x201c;means for&#x201d; [performing a function] construct should not be interpreted under 35 U.S.C &#xa7; 112(f).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0152">As used herein, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; is used to describe one or more factors that affect a determination. This term does not foreclose the possibility that additional factors may affect the determination. That is, a determination may be solely based on specified factors or based on the specified factors as well as other, unspecified factors. Consider the phrase &#x201c;determine A based on B.&#x201d; This phrase specifies that B is a factor that is used to determine A or that affects the determination of A. This phrase does not foreclose that the determination of A may also be based on some other factor, such as C. This phrase is also intended to cover an embodiment in which A is determined based solely on B. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;based on&#x201d; is synonymous with the phrase &#x201c;based at least in part on.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0153">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; describes one or more factors that trigger an effect. This phrase does not foreclose the possibility that additional factors may affect or otherwise trigger the effect. That is, an effect may be solely in response to those factors, or may be in response to the specified factors as well as other, unspecified factors. Consider the phrase &#x201c;perform A in response to B.&#x201d; This phrase specifies that B is a factor that triggers the performance of A. This phrase does not foreclose that performing A may also be in response to some other factor, such as C. This phrase is also intended to cover an embodiment in which A is performed solely in response to B.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0154">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc. are used as labels for nouns that they precede, and do not imply any type of ordering (e.g., spatial, temporal, logical, etc.), unless stated otherwise. For example, in a register file having eight registers, the terms &#x201c;first register&#x201d; and &#x201c;second register&#x201d; may be used to refer to any two of the eight registers, and not, for example, just logical registers 0 and 1.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0155">When used in the claims, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used as an inclusive or and not as an exclusive or. For example, the phrase &#x201c;at least one of x, y, or z&#x201d; means any one of x, y, and z, as well as any combination thereof.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
