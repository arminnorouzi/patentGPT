The antenna <b>200</b> has an upper broad side <b>204</b>, a lower broad side <b>206</b>, a left narrow side <b>208</b> and a right narrow side <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The waveguide antenna <b>200</b> may be implemented as a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). For example, the waveguide antenna <b>200</b> may be implemented in a dielectric substrate, the upper and lower broadsides <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the antenna <b>200</b> being provided by respective metal coatings on the upper and lower surfaces of the dielectric substrate, and the sidewalls <b>208</b>,<b>210</b> being implemented within the substrate using arrays of metal posts, closely packed vias, or by metallized grooves, using techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first plurality of slots <b>220</b> and the second plurality of slots <b>230</b> are provided on the upper broad side <b>204</b>. The first plurality <b>220</b> of slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> is formed to the left of a longitudinally-extending centre line <b>212</b> of the upper broad side <b>204</b>. The second plurality <b>230</b> of slots <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> is formed to the right of the centre line <b>212</b> of the upper broad side <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, the first plurality <b>220</b> of slots are spaced apart according to a first slot pitch <b>228</b> of 1&#x2032;.<sub>9</sub>1, where 1.<sub>9</sub>1 is the wavelength in the guide of radiation at frequency f<b>1</b>, whereas the second plurality <b>230</b> of slots are spaced apart according to a second slot pitch <b>238</b> of <sub>&#x2212;A.</sub><sub><sub2>9</sub2></sub>2/2, where &#x2212;<sub>A.</sub><sub><sub2>9</sub2></sub>2 is the wavelength in the guide of radiation at frequency fa.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, when radiation having a frequency f<b>1</b> is input to the waveguide <b>200</b>, the phase difference between adjacent slots of the first plurality of slots <b>220</b> is 360&#xb0; and the first plurality <b>220</b> of slots therefore radiate in phase to produce a beam having the first radiation pattern, illustrated by the gain curve <b>301</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In contrast, when radiation having a frequency fa is input to the waveguide <b>200</b>, the phase difference between adjacent slots of the second plurality of slots <b>230</b> is 180&#xb0; and the second plurality of slots radiate in anti-phase to produce a beam having the second radiation pattern, illustrated by the gain curve <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In both cases, the beam radiated from the waveguide antenna <b>200</b> is polarised in the x direction. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the radiation pattern <b>301</b> peaks at zero azimuth angle, whereas the radiation pattern <b>302</b> has twin peaks on both sides of the azimuth. The second radiation pattern <b>302</b> is therefore significantly broader than the first radiation pattern <b>301</b>, thereby providing a broader field of view. This is useful in automotive radar applications, as a narrow field of view is needed for sensing objects immediately in front of the vehicle, such as a vehicle in front, and a wider field of view is needed for sensing objects in the surroundings, such as other vehicles and pedestrians on either side of the vehicle. Different radiation patterns may also be used to provide information at different elevations. Allowing for multiple fields of view to be obtained using a single antenna enables a reduction in the amount of hardware required, and allows the field of view to be switched simply by switching the operating frequency of the antenna. The skilled person will appreciate that other radiation patterns may be used depending on the applications required.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first and second resonant frequencies <b>11</b> and fa may be separated by a frequency difference substantially greater than or equal to the bandwidth of the first and second resonant frequencies. For example, each of the first and second resonant frequencies may have a bandwidth of less than 2 GHz, for example in the range 1 to 2 GHz. The first and second resonant frequencies f<b>1</b> and fa may therefore coexist within the 76 to 81 GHz range, that is, within the automotive radar range, while being substantially non-overlapping. It is therefore possible to switch between the first and second radiation patterns by switching the input frequency to the waveguide antenna <b>200</b> between frequencies at or near the first and second resonant frequencies f<b>1</b>, fa.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a first example, a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna based on a dielectric substrate having a relative permittivity of 3.1 may have a length and width of 8.625 mm and 1.5 mm respectively. The first plurality of slots <b>220</b> may be configured for a first resonant frequency f<b>1</b> of about 83 GHz, and the second plurality of slots <b>230</b> may be configured for a second resonant frequency fa of about 75 GHz. For example, the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the first plurality of slots <b>220</b> may have a length of 1.2 mm, and the slots <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> of the second plurality of slots <b>230</b> may have a length of 1.3 mm. The slot separation or pitch <b>228</b> between the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the first plurality <b>220</b> may be about 2.8 mm. The slot separation or pitch <b>238</b> between the slots <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> of the second plurality <b>230</b> may be about 1.7 mm. The widths of all the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> may be around 0.07 mm, and the distance of the slots from the centreline <b>212</b> may be around 50 mm on each side.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As a second example, the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna of the first example above may be modified for use with a first resonant frequency f<b>1</b> of about 81 GHz, and a second resonant frequency f<b>2</b> of about 77 GHz, both frequencies being within the automotive radar band. In this second example, the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the first plurality of slots <b>220</b> may have a length of 1.22 mm, and the slots <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> of the second plurality of slots <b>230</b> may have a length of 1.28 mm. The slot separation or pitch <b>228</b> between the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the first plurality <b>220</b> may be about 3 mm. The slot separation or pitch <b>238</b> between the slots <b>232</b>,<b>234</b> of the second plurality <b>230</b> may be about 1.6 mm. The widths of all the slots <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> may be around 0.07 mm, and the distance of the slots from the centreline <b>212</b> may be around 50 mm on each side.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be appreciated than many modifications, including additions and/or substitutions, may be made within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the slots may be modified for producing beams at different resonant frequencies and/or to change the bandwidth of the resonances. The first and/or second plurality of slots may also be modified, for example by changing the angle of the slots with respect to the centreline <b>212</b>.
