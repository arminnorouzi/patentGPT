Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or through a break in the skin. By &#x201c;internal hemorrhaging&#x201d; it is meant that a blood vessel inside the body is injured and leaks. Blood leakage from internal blood vessels can be manifested also as external hemorrhaging, yet the injured blood vessel, which is the source of hemorrhaging, is internal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coagulation, also known as clotting, is the process by which liquid blood forms a clot. Coagulation may result in hemostasis, a term known to describe the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel. The mechanism of coagulation, as is well-described in the art, involves both activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets and deposition and maturation of fibrin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An anti-hemorrhagic agent is a substance that promotes hemostasis and arrests bleeding, and is also referred to in the art as a hemostatic agent, a hemostat, or as a pro-coagulant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Internal hemorrhaging (or bleeding) due to blunt or penetrating, civilian or military, trauma is known to cause major loss of human life, as well as drainage of hospital and blood bank resources. Among the most lethal injuries are civilian and military injuries that cause internal hemorrhaging.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Common traumas that lead to internal hemorrhaging include injuries of solid abdominal organs such as liver, spleen, kidneys and other organs. These injuries are commonly treated by surgical techniques such as suturing, resection and devascularization of the organ. A large number of liver, spleen and renal injuries do not respond to these techniques, leading to death of the patient or sacrifice of a valuable organ.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, sever internal hemorrhaging can lead to rapid and heavy loss of blood and death prior to the availability of the surgical treatment. According to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (www(dot)defensemedianetwork(dot)com/stories/wound-care-and-healing), most death cases among soldiers are due to blood loss, or hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bleeding injuries due to trauma or tissue damage during chirurgical operations may cause shock, contamination and death.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Currently used anti-hemorrhagic agents include systemic drugs, which act by inhibiting fibrinolysis or promoting coagulation. Administration of such medications is associated with the risk of generating embolism that may lead to stroke or death.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Anti-hemorrhagic, or hemostatic, agents are typically used during surgical procedures to achieve hemostasis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Locally-acting hemostatic agents act by causing vasoconstriction or promoting platelet aggregation, and have been gaining popularity for use in emergency bleeding control, particularly for internal hemorrhaging caused by severe trauma, which is typically associated with massive bleeding.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since systemic drugs are associated with a risk and since chirurgical procedures are often not applicable at the trauma site, blocking external and internal hemorrhaging by techniques which can be applied within a short time upon the injury is highly sought for, with the goal being agents or compositions which can arrest massive bleeding within several minutes from the injury and preserve the blockage for at least a few hours, for example, until a surgical treatment can be provided to the injured subject (e.g., until the subject is brought to a hospital).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Exemplary known hemostats include microfibrillar collagen hemostat (MCH), which is a topical agent composed of resorbable microfibrillar collagen, typically used in surgical procedures; Chitosan hemostats, which are also topical agents composed of chitosan and its salts, act by bonding with platelets and red blood cells to form a gel-like clot which seals a bleeding vessel, and are known to be used to stop traumatic life-threatening bleeding; zeolites, such as the product QuikClot Combat Gauze&#xae; (nonwoven gauze impregnated with kaolin , and Veriset, a gauze containing lysine, both act as absorbents, and are used for sealing severe injuries quickly; Thrombin and fibrin glue products are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms; desmopressin is used to improve platelet function by activating arginine vasopressin receptor 1A; Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid, present in products such as Hexakapron&#xae;, inhibit fibrinolysis, and lead to a de facto reduced bleeding rate. Some foam-forming agents have also been developed, which, once applied, form a foam that physically reduces bleeding by applying pressure to the blood vessels. The formed foam should thereafter be surgically removed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Properties associated with the function of the exemplary commercially available products that act as locally-acting hemostatic agents QuikClot Combat Gauze&#xae; (kaolin), coagulation factor VII (F7), Veriset (Lysine) and Hexakapron&#xae; (Tranexamic acid) are summarized in Table A below. As can be seen, none of these products can arrest massive bleeding.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE A</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Combat Gauze</entry><entry/><entry>Tranexamic acid</entry><entry>Veriset</entry></row><row><entry>Property</entry><entry>(Kaolin)</entry><entry>F7</entry><entry>(Hexakapron)</entry><entry>(Lysine)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Stops massive</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry></row><row><entry>bleeding</entry></row><row><entry>Accelerates</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry></row><row><entry>coagulation</entry></row><row><entry>Blocks</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry>Fibrinolysis</entry></row><row><entry>Topical</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry>Non-exothermic</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry>Tissue adhesive</entry><entry>ND</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>&#x2212;</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Citrate salts are known anti-coagulation agents.

This effect is achieved by applying the two agents when mixed in a single composition or when administered individually either concomitantly or sequentially.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">The present inventors have now conceived improving the coagulation effect induced by citrate salt and a calcium-carbonate containing particulate material, by physically combining these agents and have designed and successfully prepared and practiced a composite material (a conjugate) in which a citrate and a calcium-carbonate containing particulate material are linked to one another by means of an association moiety. As an exemplary association moiety, a polypeptide-based polymeric material, Poly-D-Lysine (PDL), and free lysine were first used, and then other, various associating moieties were also tested. Lysine has structural features which are similar to those of tranexamic acid, which acts as blood clot stabilizer by inhibition of plasmin and is used clinically to treat bleeding [Hunt B J. Anaesthesia. 2015 Jan;70 Suppl 1:50-3, e18].</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the powdery composite material obtained by associating together particulate calcium carbonate, poly-D-lysine and citrate (CPC), when applied topically to a bleeding tissue or organ, induced coagulation in vitro and arrested massive abdominal and head bleedings in mice in a time scale of seconds to minutes. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>4</b></figref>. The powdery composite material was shown to be hygroscopic and adhesive, and no exothermic reaction occurred upon its application.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">As further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the powdery composite material obtained by associating together particulate calcium carbonate and citrate with polymeric and nonpolymeric associating moieties, when applied topically to a bleeding tissue or organ (e.g., a blood vessel, liver or spleen), induced coagulation in vivo and arrested massive bleedings in swine, including of injured arteries, veins, liver and spleen, in a time scale of several seconds to minutes. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>23</b></figref> and Table 5.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Further studies have showed that the composite material is non-toxic and safe for use (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-C</figref> and Example 7), and, when applied to injured brain, the composite material is able to restore brain functions (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-<b>26</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">Without being bound by any particular theory, it is assumed that the strong effect of a composite material as described herein on blood coagulation arises from several different mechanisms and/or from their synergism, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. One mechanism is associated with calcium activation of the coagulation cascade, that results from the possible citrate-induced release of calcium ions from the calcium carbonate-containing material. An additional mechanism may be associated with a selected association moiety, which may be such that causes stabilization of clots by reducing their degradation, for example, by inhibiting plasmin, the enzyme that reduces clots half-life by degrading fibrin. An additional mechanism may involve interactions with platelets, by the calcium carbonate and/or the association moiety, which promote the formation and stabilization of the blood clot. It is assumed that the latter, physical, non-biological mechanism is the primary act of the composite material, as it is fastest than the biological actions and hence the first to occur upon application, and as it accelerates blood coagulation by itself.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">Overall, it is assumed that the herein disclosed composite material features all of the properties presented in Table A above, contrary to currently available products for treating hemorrhage, and can be utilized as a life-saving technology that enables rapid arrest of massive hemorrhage caused by severe injury or during operation, which cannot be blocked by non-chirurgical means.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Embodiments of the present invention therefore relate to novel composite materials, to compositions, articles-of-manufacturing and kits comprising same, and to uses thereof in inducing blood coagulation and in arresting hemorrhage, including massive hemorrhage and internal hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">The Composite Material:</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a composite material which comprises a calcium carbonate-containing material, a citrate and an associating moiety being associated with the citrate and the calcium carbonate-containing material.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">By &#x201c;associated with&#x201d; it is meant physical and/or chemical association between the indicated components.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Thus, for example, the citrate and/or association moiety can be attached to the calcium carbonate-containing material, by interacting with the carbonate groups and/or the calcium cations via, e.g., covalent bonds, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, donor-acceptor interactions, and/or cation-7c interactions. These interactions lead to the chemical association between the components.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">As an example, and without being bound by any particular theory, the citrate ions may be in chemical association with the positively charged calcium of the calcium carbonate, and/or with positively charged groups of the association moiety. The carbonate groups of the calcium carbonate can also be in chemical association with positively charged groups of the association moiety, while the calcium can be in chemical association with negatively charged group of the association moiety.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">Alternatively, the components can be attached to one another by physical association such as surface adsorption, encapsulation, entrapment, entanglement and the likes.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">The Calcium-Carbonate Containing Material:</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">Herein throughout, the phrase &#x201c;calcium carbonate-containing material&#x201d; describes a material, a substance or a composition-of-matter, which is substantially consisted of calcium carbonate, that it, which includes at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90%, or at least 95%, or about 100%, by weight, calcium carbonate.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The term &#x201c;calcium carbonate&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the chemical compound CaCO<sub>3</sub>.

For solid phase peptide synthesis, a summary of the many techniques may be found in J. M. Stewart and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, W. H. Freeman Co. (San Francisco), 1963 and J. Meienhofer, Hormonal Proteins and Peptides, vol. 2, p. 46, Academic Press (New York), 1973. For classical solution synthesis see G. Schroder and K. Lupke, The Peptides, vol. 1, Academic Press (New York), 1965.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0200">In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids or suitably protected amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then either be attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complimentary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected, under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth. After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups (and any solid support) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to afford the final polypeptide compound. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling (under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers) a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after de-protection, a pentapeptide and so forth.

Examples, without limitations, of carriers include water, buffered aqueous solutions, propylene glycol, emulsions and mixtures of organic solvents with water, as well as solid (e.g. powdered or polymeric) and gaseous carriers.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0240">Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in &#x201c;Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences&#x201d; Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0241">Compositions for use in accordance with the present embodiments thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients and/or auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0242">The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see e.g., Fingl et al., 1975, in &#x201c;The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics&#x201d;, Ch. 1 p.1).</p><p id="p-0247" num="0243">The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either an organic carrier or an aqueous carrier. In some embodiments, the carrier is an aqueous carrier. An aqueous carrier preferably comprises injectable-grade water, i.e., USP grade &#x201c;water for injection&#x201d;. However, other forms of purified water may be suitable, such as, for example, distilled and deionized water.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0244">Aqueous formulations are preferred since these formulations are gentle to bodily tissues and are suitable for use on injured blood vessels or tissues. However, non-aqueous formulations are also contemplated. For example, in cases where the composition is in a form of a paste or an emulsion, non-aqueous carriers or mixed carriers of aqueous and organic carriers can be used.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0245">The composition may be formulated for administration in either one or more of routes, depending on the area to be treated.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0246">According to some embodiments, the composition is formulated for topical application, as a topical dosage form.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0247">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;topical dosage form&#x201d; describes a dosage form suitable for topical administration to the treated area (e.g., an injured blood vessel or tissue). By &#x201c;topical administration&#x201d; it is meant application onto the treated area, or &#x201c;local administration&#x201d;, whereby the treated area can be, for example, an internal or external injured blood vessel or tissue.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0248">The compositions described herein can be, for example, in a form of a powder, granules, a cream, an ointment, a paste, a gel, a lotion, a milk, a suspension, an aerosol, a spray, a foam, a gauze, a wipe, a sponge, a wound dressing, a pledget, a patch, a pad, an adhesive bandage, and a non-adhesive bandage.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0249">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a liquid reservoir, to be applied as drops, spray, aerosol, liquid, foam and the like. Suitable carriers and other ingredients are used in these cases. For example, for application as an aerosol or foam, a propellant is used. For application as foam, foam-forming agents can also be used.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0250">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a cream. Creams are viscous liquids or semisolid emulsions, either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are typically water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase, also called the &#x201c;internal&#x201d; phase, is generally comprised of petrolatum and/or a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol. The aqueous phase typically, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant. Reference may be made to <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy</i>, supra, for further information. An exemplary cream formulation can be obtained by mixing the composite material described herein with a carrier comprising cellulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate, hydroxyethyl cellulose and/or a polyethylene glycol. In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as an ointment. Ointments are semisolid preparations, typically based on petrolatum or petroleum derivatives. The specific ointment base to be used is one that provides for optimum delivery for the active agent chosen for a given formulation. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and nonsensitizing. As explained in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>19th Ed., Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Co. (1995), pp. 1399-1404, ointment bases may be grouped in four classes: oleaginous bases; emulsifiable bases; emulsion bases; and water-soluble bases. Oleaginous ointment bases include, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Emulsifiable ointment bases, also known as absorbent ointment bases, contain little or no water and include, for example, hydroxystearin sulfate, anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Emulsion ointment bases are either water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, and include, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin and stearic acid. Preferred water-soluble ointment bases are prepared from polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0251">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a lotion. Lotions are preparations that are to be applied to the skin surface without friction. Lotions are typically liquid or semiliquid preparations in which solid particles, namely, the calcium carbonate-containing material particles, are present in a water or alcohol base. Lotions are typically preferred for covering/protecting large body areas, due to the ease of applying a more fluid composition. Lotions are typically suspensions of solids, and oftentimes comprise a liquid oily emulsion of the oil-in-water type. It is generally necessary that the insoluble matter in a lotion be finely divided. Lotions typically contain suspending agents to produce better dispersions as well as compounds useful for localizing and holding the active agent in contact with the skin, such as methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, and the like.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0252">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a paste. Pastes are semisolid dosage forms in which the bioactive agent is suspended in a suitable base. Depending on the nature of the base, pastes are divided between fatty pastes or those made from a single-phase aqueous gels. The base in a fatty paste is generally petrolatum, hydrophilic petrolatum and the like. The pastes made from single-phase aqueous gels generally incorporate carboxymethylcellulose or the like as a base. Additional reference may be made to <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy</i>, for further information.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0253">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a gel. Gel formulations are semisolid, suspension-type systems. Single-phase gels contain organic macromolecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout the carrier liquid, which is typically aqueous, but also, preferably, contain an alcohol and, optionally, an oil. Preferred organic macromolecules, i.e., gelling agents, are crosslinked acrylic acid polymers such as the family of carbomer polymers, e.g., carboxypolyalkylenes that may be obtained commercially under the trademark Carbopol&#x2122;. Other types of preferred polymers in this context are hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene oxides, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers and polyvinylalcohol; cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, and methyl cellulose; gums such as tragacanth and xanthan gum; sodium alginate; and gelatin. In order to prepare a uniform gel, dispersing agents such as alcohol or glycerin can be added, or the gelling agent can be dispersed by trituration, mechanical mixing or stirring, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0254">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a foam. Foam compositions are typically formulated in a single or multiple phase liquid form and housed in a suitable container, optionally together with a propellant which facilitates the expulsion of the composition from the container, thus transforming it into a foam upon application. Other foam forming techniques include, for example the &#x201c;Bag-in-a-can&#x201d; formulation technique. Compositions thus formulated typically contain a low-boiling hydrocarbon, e.g., isopropane. Application and agitation of such a composition at the body temperature cause the isopropane to vaporize and generate the foam, in a manner similar to a pressurized aerosol foaming system. Foams can be water-based or hydroalcoholic, but are typically formulated with high alcohol content which, upon application to the treated area, quickly evaporates, driving the composite material to the site of treatment.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0255">In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a powder or granules. Such compositions can optionally be prepared by preparing the composite material (e.g., as described herein) and forming granules or beads containing these ingredients, for example, by adding suitable agents (e.g., water soluble film-forming agents).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0256">In some embodiments, a topical dosage form includes a solid or semi-solid substrate, e.g., a gauze, a wipe, a bandage, a pad, a pledget, a sponge, a mesh, a fabric, and the likes, and the composite material is incorporated in and/or on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0257">The substrate in such topical dosage forms can be of any form and materials used to make up gauzes, wipes, bandages, pads, pledgets, sponges, meshes, fabrics (woven and non-woven, cotton fabrics, and the like), and any other substrates commonly used in medical applications.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0258">Such topical dosage forms may optionally further comprise an adhesive, for facilitating the topical application of the composition onto the treated area for a prolonged time period.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0259">Exemplary adhesives include, but are not limited to, medically acceptable bioadhesives, polymer glues, etc., and can be applied to the substrate by, for example, dip coating with an adhesive base. Such dip coating can be effected during manufacture of the substrate, or at any time prior to its application. In some embodiments, the composite material can be embedded within and/or on the material of the substrate, for example, embedded into or onto a polymer or fabrics by application of heat, or fused to the substrate. In other embodiments, the composite material can be incorporated into the base material of the substrate, for example, mixed within the components of a polymer before polymerization, or mixed with components forming fibers used to make up a gauze or a mesh or pad, etc.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0260">In some of any of the embodiments described herein, the composition is also referred to as an anti-hemorrhaging composition.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0261">The composition described herein can further comprise additional ingredients, which are aimed at improving or facilitating its preparation, application and/or performance.

The clot formation can result from either or both of the intrinsic cascade, initiated when contact is made between blood and exposed negatively charged surfaces, and the extrinsic pathway, initiated upon vascular injury, leading to activation of factor X to Xa which hydrolyzes and activates prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then activates factors XI, VIII and V, until ultimately fibrinogen is converted to fibrin and factor XIII to XIIIa. Factor XIIIa (also termed transglutaminase) cross-links fibrin polymers solidifying the clot. Thus, as used herein, the term &#x201c;clot&#x201d; or &#x201c;thrombus&#x201d; refers to the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. There are two components to a clot/thrombus: aggregated platelets that form a platelet plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. The substance making up a thrombus is also known as cruor.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0296">In some embodiments of the present invention, the blood is mammalian blood. In some embodiments, the blood is human blood.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0297">The &#x201c;inducing coagulation of blood&#x201d;, as used in the context of embodiments of the present invention, describes inducing coagulation and/or influencing the coagulation state of blood by increasing coagulation or coagulation rate of the blood. As such, the compositions described herein are characterized by increasing the clotting of blood and blood clotting state, which includes increasing clotting of plasma or increasing clotting rate of plasma, as well as reducing or preventing or decreasing a rate of lysis or dissolution of a blood clot.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0298">By &#x201c;clotting&#x201d; it is meant formation of blood clots.

An exemplary assay is the aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), performed by adding a surface activator (e.g., kaolin, celite, ellagic acid, or silica) and diluted phospholipid (e.g., cephalin) to citrated plasma. After incubation to allow optimal activation of contact factors (factor XII, factor XI, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen), calcium is added, and the clotting time is measured through absorbance. Clot-based assays use mostly citrated plasma, and the end point for all of them is fibrin clot formation.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0301">In some embodiments, the composite material or a composition containing same described herein can reduce the clotting time of human plasma and/or increase the clotting rate of human plasma.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0302">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the composite material or a composition containing same as described herein is capable of inducing blood coagulation (blood clots formation) upon contacting the blood for a time period that ranges from a few seconds to a few minutes, for example, of 10 minutes or less, e.g., 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 minutes or less, or of one minute or less (e.g., 50 seconds, 40 seconds, 30 seconds or less) regardless of the blood's volume.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0303">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the composite material or a composition containing same as described herein is such that upon contacting the blood, e.g., for a time period as described herein, at least 50% of a blood sample turns into blood clots.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0304">According to some embodiments of the present invention, at least 50% of the clotted blood (formed upon contacting the composition as described herein) remains clotted for at least one hour, or for at least 2 hours, or for at least three hours, or for at least 4 hours, or more.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0305">Any of the compositions, articles and kits described herein can therefore be used for inducing blood coagulation in a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0306">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes mammals, preferably warm-blooded mammals including birds, cows, horses, goat, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens and turkeys, and more preferably human beings at any age which suffer from a pathology that requires induction of blood coagulation.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0307">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method of inducing blood coagulation, which is effected by contacting the blood with a composite material or a composition containing same as described herein.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0308">The contacting can be effected in vitro or ex vivo for example, by contacting a blood sample with composite material or a composition containing same as described herein.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0309">The contacting can alternatively be effected in vivo, by contacting a blood of a subject with a composite material or a composition containing same as described herein.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0310">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a use of composite material or of a composition or article-of-manufacturing containing same as described herein for inducing coagulation of blood.

At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized and their heart was exposed using a transverse incision and cutting the diaphragm and rib cage. Next, to clean the blood system the superior vena cava was cut and 20 ml of PBSX1 was injected through the left vertical using a 23G needle. Then 20 ml of 4% PFA solution was injected to fixate the animal's organs. After fixation the brains were removed and incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in 4% PFA solution. Next, the brains were transferred to sucrose solution containing: 58.75% DDW, 30% sucrose, 1.25% PFA and 10% PBSX10 and incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The brains were then washed with PBSX1, transferred into cryotubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To form slices approximately 1.5 mm thick, lateral incisions at both sides of the injury were done while the brain remains frozen. Brain tissue sections (20 &#x3bc;m to 40 &#x3bc;m) of the injured area were prepared using MEV Slee Semi-Automatic Cryostat and collected into 24 well plates filled with PBSx1 with 0.01 Sodium azide.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0463">Then samples were stained as following: Permeabilized with 0.25% TritonX100 for 5 minutes, and blocked with 3% Inactivated Normal Goat Serum (iNGS) for 1 hour.

The amount to be applied can be determined considering the bleeding rate and the amount of blood that leaked prior to treatment. Any type of bleeding, including those with very high pressure, can be arrested, while using the appropriate amount of the composite material and sufficient pressure duration.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0473">Once the powdery composite material is applied onto a bleeding organ or tissue or wound, preferably pressure is applied (e.g., by means of a force applied by a human being), for example, by means of a gauze that covers the wound and optionally its vicinity and is pressurized. The duration of the pressure can vary between seconds to few minutes, depending on the bleeding rate and the size of the bleeding opening. The actual arrest of the bleeding typically takes place 10-30 seconds for veins, liver and spleen, and 50-120 seconds in arteries, upon contacting the bleeding area with the composite material of some of the present embodiments.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0474">Composite materials made of coral skeleton as the calcium source were more absorbent than the ACC-based composite materials and typically stopped the bleeding in half time pressure. The CS large particles were more absorbent that the small particles. CS (small)-PDL-C was shown to be the most efficient powder, succeeding in reduction of vessels bleeding in 1 minute pressure application and liver and spleen injuries in 0.5 minute pressure application.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0475">The &#x201c;B&#x201d; (blood soaked) series was generally less efficient but produced a tighter closure of wounds in the liver and the spleen than the ACC-based composite materials.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0476">The obtained data further show that ACC-PDL-C was strong enough to block vessel bleedings and even to close the wound at 3 hours after application.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0477">Testing its shelf life showed that a one-month old powder exhibits reduced blocking capacity, as measured by the pressure time required to complete stop. This powder was also effective in blocking liver and spleen injuries and covered the wound with a solid structure.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0478">ACC-L-Lysine-C was shown to exhibit a higher activity compared with ACC-PDL-C, requiring about 50% less amount and time to achieve complete block. ACC-poly-&#x25a1;-lysine-C showed similar strength to CPC containing L-lysine. As the poly-&#x3b5;-lysine is known as having anti-bacterial activity, CPC with poly-&#x25a1;-lysine can be used to arrest bleeding and as antibiotic, simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0479">The results also indicate that although ACC alone and ACC with L, D or &#x25a1;-Lysine can arrest bleeding, the combination of all three components, the ACC, the citrate and the mono/poly lysine provides an enhanced bleeding arrest effect. See, Table 5 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0480">It was also found that once a powdery CPC (ACC-L-Lysine-C) composite contacts blood in femoral vein injury it becomes pasty, and features a texture of an ointment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, yellow arrow=vein; black arrow=ointment-like texture). Such a texture may be advantageous in covering blood ruptures, especially at the operating table. Using the compound ACC-L-Lysine, without citrate, the composite remains in a dry, powdery form (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, yellow arrow=vein; black arrow=dry powder texture). It was further found that the change in texture is oppositely correlated with the size of the polymer used (not shown).</p><p id="p-0493" num="0481">Application of CPC composite materials was also shown to arrest bleeding in brain injury to increase regeneration of brain functions following TBI.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0482">Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
