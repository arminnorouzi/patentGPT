However, the current lithium-ion batteries are difficult to meet the increasing demands, and therefore, it is one of the main lithium-ion battery research and development directions to design a lithium-ion battery with low impedance and high capacity retention rate on the premise of ensuring a lower preparation cost.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among the commonly used positive electrode active materials for lithium-ion batteries, lithium manganate has become a widely used positive electrode active material for lithium-ion batteries due to its abundant raw materials, simple preparation, low price and high safety. However, during the deep charging and discharging of a lithium-ion battery, the lithium manganate material is prone to lattice distortion and corrosion by hydrofluoric acid in electrolyte solution, so transition metals are prone to dissolution. After charge-discharge cycles of the battery several times, these dissolved transition metals greatly attenuate the electrical performance of the battery, especially the battery impedance and capacity retention rate performance, thereby reducing the range and service life of the battery. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a lithium manganate material that reduces the precipitation of transition metal manganese.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure has been made in view of the above-mentioned topics, and the objective is to provide a lithium manganate positive electrode active material that reduces the battery impedance and improves the battery capacity retention rate, as well as a positive electrode sheet, a secondary battery, a battery module, a battery pack and a powered device comprising the same. On the premise of low cost advantage, the lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure can significantly improve the range and service life of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a lithium manganate positive electrode active material that improves transition metal manganese precipitation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another objective of the present disclosure is to provide a lithium manganate positive electrode active material having significantly improved battery capacity retention rate while reducing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors have found that one or more of the above objectives can be achieved by adopting the technical solutions of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a lithium manganate positive electrode active material. The positive electrode active material comprises a lithium manganate matrix and a cladding layer. The cladding layer clads the lithium manganate matrix, and comprises an organic bonding material, one or more A-type salts, and one or more B-type salts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In any of embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of carboxymethyl cellulose salt, alginate salt, and polyacrylate salt, and optionally is one or more of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, potassium carboxymethyl cellulose, lithium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, potassium alginate, lithium alginate, magnesium alginate, aluminum alginate, sodium polyacrylate, potassium polyacrylate, and magnesium polyacrylate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In any of embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of styrene butadiene rubber, polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polymethacrylic acid, and carboxymethyl chitosan, and optionally is one or more of polyvinyl alcohol and carboxymethyl chitosan.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In any of embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of the above organic bonding materials.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In any of embodiments, the A-type salt is derived from oxalate, lactate, tartrate, and edetate, optionally is respective alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, aluminum salts, or ammonium salts of oxalic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, and edetic acid, more optionally is potassium oxalate, lithium oxalate, magnesium oxalate, aluminum oxalate, sodium oxalate, sodium lactate, potassium lactate, sodium tartrate, potassium tartrate, sodium edetate, and potassium edetate, and most optionally is potassium oxalate, lithium oxalate, sodium oxalate, potassium lactate, potassium tartrate, and sodium edetate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In any of embodiments, the B-type salt is derived from silicate, sulfate, and phosphate, optionally is respective alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, aluminum salts, or ammonium salts of silicic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, more optionally is lithium silicate, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, sodium phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and magnesium phosphate, and most optionally is lithium silicate, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, potassium sulfate, sodium phosphate, and potassium phosphate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure has a cladding structure. The cladding layer clads the lithium manganate matrix, and confers, as a &#x201c;functional layer,&#x201d; the conventional lithium manganate material with more beneficial effects: during the charging and discharging process, the lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure, because of having a cladding layer comprising the organic bonding material, one or more A-type salts, and one or more B-type salts, not only can hinder transition metal manganese ions generated by the lithium manganate matrix from directly &#x201c;running&#x201d; into the electrolyte solution, but also can prevent the lithium manganate matrix from generating more transition metal manganese ions caused by being corroded by the electrolyte solution, and further can decrease the transition metal manganese ions that have been generated inside the battery by a chemical reaction or adsorption effect, thereby slowing down the generation of transition metal manganese and catalytic decomposition of a SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) film caused by the transition metal manganese, improving the battery capacity retention rate, and reducing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the organic bonding material to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.01-5):100, and optionally is (0.3-2):100.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An appropriate amount of the organic bonding material can: guarantee that the A-type salt and the B-type salt are fully adhered to the surface of the lithium manganate matrix, guarantee that the B-type salt fully captures fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, guarantee that the A-type salt captures the transition metal manganese ions to the utmost extent, and prevent manganese ions from migrating to the negative electrode, thereby reducing the decomposition of the SEI film by the transition metal manganese, improving the capacity retention rate of the battery with lithium manganate as the positive electrode material, and reducing the battery impedance; and then form a cladding layer with an appropriate thickness, which, on the one hand, protects the lithium manganate matrix within the cladding layer from generating metal ions caused by being corroded by the electrolyte solution, and on the other hand, is enough to prevent some transition metal ions generated by the lithium manganate matrix due to force majeure factors from &#x201c;running&#x201d; out of the cladding layer and migrating to the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the A-type salt to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.05-10):100, optionally is (0.5-5):100, more optionally is (1.5-3):100.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An appropriate amount of the A-type salt can guarantee full capture of manganese ions without causing very large thickness of the cladding layer and increasing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.05-10):100, optionally is (0.5-5):100, more optionally is (1.5-3):100.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An appropriate amount of the B-type salt can guarantee full capture of the fluoride ions, and avoid corrosion of the lithium manganate matrix without causing very large thickness of the cladding layer and increasing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In any of embodiments, a ratio of a mass sum of the A-type salt and the B-type salt to mass of the lithium manganate matrix is (0.1-20):100, and optionally is (1-10):100.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A suitable ratio of the mass sum of the B-type salt and the A-type salt to the mass of lithium manganate is beneficial to fully capture of the transition metal ions inside the battery and the fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, thereby reducing the loss of the SEI film by the formed transition metal manganese, and improving the battery capacity retention rate, and reducing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is (0.01-95):1, and optionally is (1-50):1.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure, the B-type salt is used for capturing the fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, thereby slowing down the precipitation of the transition metal manganese ions caused by the corrosion of the lithium manganate matrix by hydrofluoric acid. The A-type salt is used for directly capturing the transition metal manganese ions inside the battery. The combined use of the B-type salt and the A-type salt has the best effect. When the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is very low, it means that the amount of the B-type salt in the cladding layer is very small, the fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution cannot be fully captured, and the erosion effect on lithium manganate is strengthened; while when the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is very high, it means that mass of the A-type salt in the cladding layer is very small, and the capture rate of the transition metal manganese ions inside the battery by the cladding layer is decreased.

Likewise, &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; is meant to comprise at least one. In the description herein, unless otherwise stated, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is inclusive, that is, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; means &#x201c;A, B, or both A and B&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;cladding layer&#x201d; refers to a portion that clads the lithium manganate matrix, the portion may but not necessarily completely clad the lithium manganate matrix, and the use of &#x201c;cladding layer&#x201d; is only for the convenience of description, and is not intended to limit the present disclosure. Likewise, the term &#x201c;thickness of the cladding layer&#x201d; refers to the thickness of the portion that clads the lithium manganate matrix along the normal direction of the lithium manganate matrix.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">Through many experiments, the inventors have found that for lithium manganate material containing transition metals, during deep charging and discharging, its structure is prone to lattice distortion, and it is easy to be corroded by the electrolyte solution that impregnates its structure (especially by the hydrofluoric acid produced by the decomposition of the electrolyte solution), so that Mn<sup>3+</sup> and/or Mn<sup>4+</sup> originally within the structure are dissolved out of the lattice structure of lithium manganate and further disproportionated into Mn<sup>2+</sup>; these produced Mn<sup>2+</sup> gradually migrate to the surface of the negative electrode under the action of potential difference, and are further reduced to metallic manganese. The resulting metallic manganese is equivalent to a &#x201c;catalyst&#x201d;, and can catalyze a SEI film on the surface of the negative electrode, so that the organic lithium components and inorganic lithium components in the SEI film are rapidly decomposed, thereby resulting in the SEI film failure, and ultimately decreasing the electrical performance of the battery.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">In order to supplement the lost SEI film, the active lithium inside the electrolyte solution and the battery are continuously consumed to convert into organic lithium/inorganic lithium components in a new SEI film, which reduces the content of active lithium actually contributing to charge and discharge, and irreversibly affects the battery capacity retention rate; secondly, the decomposition of SEI film catalyzed by metallic manganese is accompanied by the generation of a series of by-products, which deposit on the surface of the negative electrode, hindering the passage of lithium ions into and out of the negative electrode, thereby increasing the battery impedance. Meanwhile, the continuous consumption of electrolyte in the electrolyte solution also deteriorates the conductivity of the electrolyte solution, increases the resistance to lithium ion migration between the positive electrode and negative electrode, thereby aggravating the deterioration of the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">Through extensive experimentation and research, the inventors have found that the negative effects of transition metal manganese on batteries can be reduced from the following two aspects: the first aspect is to reduce the amount of Mn<sup>2+</sup> produced by the lithium manganate material, such as to prevent the lithium manganate material from directly contacting with the electrolyte solution containing hydrofluoric acid without hindrance, thereby slowing down the decomposition of lithium manganate by hydrofluoric acid; and the second aspect is to prevent Mn<sup>2+</sup> produced by the lithium manganate material from migrating to the negative electrode. Both of the above approaches can reduce the metallic manganese produced by the decomposition of SEI film. Therefore, from the above two aspects, the inventors have obtained a positive electrode active material capable of significantly improving the battery capacity retention rate and impedance performance by modifying the lithium manganate material.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">[Lithium Manganate Positive Electrode Active Material]</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the present disclosure provides a lithium manganate positive electrode active material. The positive electrode active material comprises a lithium manganate matrix and a cladding layer. The cladding layer clads the lithium manganate matrix, and comprises an organic bonding material, one or more A-type salts, and one or more B-type salts.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">In some embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of carboxymethyl cellulose salt, alginate salt, and polyacrylate salt, and optionally is one or more of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, potassium carboxymethyl cellulose, lithium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, potassium alginate, lithium alginate, magnesium alginate, aluminum alginate, sodium polyacrylate, potassium polyacrylate, and magnesium polyacrylate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">In some embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of styrene butadiene rubber, polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polymethacrylic acid, and carboxymethyl chitosan, and optionally is one or more of polyvinyl alcohol and carboxymethyl chitosan.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">In some embodiments, the organic bonding material is derived from one or more of the above organic bonding materials.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">In the present disclosure, selection of the A-type salt is not particularly limited, as long as it can be ionized to a radical group that captures manganese ions in an electrolyte solution environment to precipitate manganese ions, and has no adverse impacts on the electrolyte system. Non-limiting examples of A-type salts include oxalate, lactate, tartrate, edetate, aluminate, citrate, pyromellitate, and other polycarboxylates, such as malonate, glutarate, and adipate. In some embodiments, the A-type salt is derived from oxalate, lactate, tartrate, and edetate, is optionally respective alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, aluminum salts, or ammonium salts of oxalic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, and edetic acid, is more optionally potassium oxalate, lithium oxalate, magnesium oxalate, aluminum oxalate, sodium oxalate, sodium lactate, potassium lactate, sodium tartrate, potassium tartrate, sodium edetate, and potassium edetate, and is most optionally potassium oxalate, lithium oxalate, sodium oxalate, potassium lactate, potassium tartrate, and sodium edetate.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">The lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure has a cladding structure. The cladding layer clads the lithium manganate matrix, and confers, as a &#x201c;functional layer,&#x201d; the conventional lithium manganate material with more beneficial effects. During the charging and discharging process, the lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure, because of having a cladding layer comprising the organic bonding material, one or more A-type salts, and one or more B-type salts, not only can hinder transition metal manganese ions generated by the lithium manganate matrix from directly &#x201c;running&#x201d; into the electrolyte solution, but also can prevent the lithium manganate matrix from generating more transition metal manganese ions caused by being corroded by the electrolyte solution, and further can decrease the transition metal manganese ions that have been generated inside the battery by a chemical reaction or adsorption effect. The modified positive electrode active material of the present disclosure has the above beneficial effects, and thus can slow down the generation of transition metal manganese and catalytic decomposition of the SEI film caused by the transition metal manganese during storage and use of the battery, thereby improving the battery capacity retention rate, and reducing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">The lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure comprises a cladding layer composed of an organic bonding material, and one or more A-type salts and one or more B-type salts bound by the organic bonding material. One of the functions of the cladding layer is to serve as a &#x201c;barrier layer.&#x201d; During charging and discharging of the lithium-ion battery several times, the lithium manganate-based positive electrode active material will inevitably generate transition metal manganese ions, and the existence of the &#x201c;barrier layer&#x201d; can effectively prevent the transition metal manganese ions generated by the lithium manganate matrix from directly &#x201c;running&#x201d; into the electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">In addition, the &#x201c;barrier layer&#x201d; can further prevent the lithium manganate matrix from generating more transition metal manganese ions due to barrier-free direct contact with the electrolyte solution. After several times of charge-discharge cycles, the electrolyte in the electrolyte solution will be decomposed, thus producing water and strongly corrosive hydrofluoric acid. If lithium manganate is in direct contact with the corrosive electrolyte solution, direct corrosion of lithium manganate by hydrofluoric acid will be caused, such that lithium manganate is decomposed to produce more transition metal manganese ions. In the present disclosure, however, the inventor arranges a cladding layer outside lithium manganate, which is equivalent to arranging a protective layer for the lithium manganate matrix, to prevent the lithium manganate material from barrier-free direct contact with the electrolyte solution containing hydrofluoric acid, and significantly slowing down the decomposition of lithium manganate by hydrofluoric acid, thereby reducing the amount of Mn<sup>2+</sup> present in the battery system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">In addition, the cladding layer of the present disclosure comprises a B-type salt component. The B-type salt can capture fluoride ions produced by the electrolyte solution, thereby reducing the amount of hydrofluoric acid, slowing down the corrosive decomposition of lithium manganate by the hydrofluoric acid, and reducing the amount of Mn<sup>2+</sup> present in the battery system. Non-limiting examples of B-type salts include silicate, sulfate, phosphate, phosphite, sulfonate, and the like. In some embodiments, the B-type salt is selected from the group consisting of silicate, sulfate, and phosphate, optionally is respective alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, aluminum salts, or ammonium salts of silicic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, more optionally is lithium silicate, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, sodium phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and magnesium phosphate, most optionally is lithium silicate, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, potassium sulfate, sodium phosphate, and potassium phosphate.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080">Extensive experimentation and research by the inventors show that the mechanism of action of B-type salts consuming hydrofluoric acid to avoid the generation of manganese ions is that acid radicals of the B-type salts directly adsorb fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution or react with hydrofluoric acid to consume fluoride ions. As an example, for example, there are two mechanisms of action by which the silicate consumes the hydrofluoric acid as follows: firstly, the potassium silicate decomposes with the electrolyte solution to produce silicic acid, which reacts with hydrofluoric acid as follows: H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>+4HF&#x2192;SiF<sub>4</sub>+3H<sub>2</sub>O; and secondly, the (&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si)<sub>2</sub>=O group in the silicate is capable of adsorbing fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution. Therefore, the silicate in the cladding layer can reduce the content of hydrofluoric acid contained in the electrolyte solution, and avoid the generation of transition metal manganese ions due to the corrosion of the lithium manganate matrix by the hydrofluoric acid.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">The cladding layer in accordance with the present disclosure further comprises an A-type salt. Inside the battery comprising the transition metal Mn<sup>2</sup>+, the A-type salt dissolved in the electrolyte solution is ionized to generate acid radical ions, thereby capturing possibly generated manganese ions. As an example, for example, an oxalate ionizes to generate C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup> group, and in comparison to alkali metal ions such as N<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> etc., the C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup> groups generated by ionization preferentially bond with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, thereby reducing or even eliminating Mn<sup>2+</sup> that mitigates to the negative electrode terminal.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0082">The cladding layer further comprises an organic bonding material. An electrolyte solution of a lithium-ion battery is generally formed by dissolving various electrolytes that are beneficial to the performance of the battery in an organic solvent. Therefore, in an organic system, the A-type salt and the B-type salt are generally insoluble or hardly soluble in the electrolyte solution, and therefore when the A-type salt and the B-type salt are directly added to an electrolyte solution or directly added to a positive electrode slurry dissolved by an organic solvent, there are problems of uneven mixing, incomplete and uneven contact with transition metal ions and fluoride ions, which significantly reduces the beneficial effects. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively add the A-type salt and the B-type salt into battery systems in practical industrial production processes. For this purpose, on the one hand, the organic bonding material in the present disclosure functions to bond, i.e., bonding the A-type salt and the B-type salt to the surface of the lithium manganate matrix; and on the other hand, some organic bonding materials, such as carboxymethyl cellulose salt, alginate salt, polyacrylate salt and the like also contain functional groups for bonding Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and thus also function to reduce Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the battery system.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0083">Thus, the cladding layer of the present disclosure, with combined action of the organic bonding material, one or more A-type salts, and one or more B-type salts, significantly reduces the content of transition metal Mn<sup>2+</sup> inside the battery, and then significantly reduces the amount of metal manganese generated by &#x201c;catalytic&#x201d; decomposition of the SEI film, thereby slowing down the decomposition and consumption of the SEI film by the transition metal manganese, then reducing the consumption of active lithium in the battery system, increasing the content of active lithium that does contribute to charge and discharge, and finally Improving the battery capacity retention rate after repeated charge-discharge cycles of the battery. Then, under the action of the above modified lithium manganate material, the decomposition of the SEI film by the transition metal is significantly slowed down, so that the by-products generated by the decomposition of the SEI film are also significantly reduced, thus avoiding the deposition of a large number of by-products on the surface of the negative electrode, reducing the resistance of lithium ions entering into and leaving from the negative electrode, and reducing the battery impedance. Further, under the action of the above modified lithium manganate material, the decomposition rate of the SEI film is significantly reduced, so that the consumption of the electrolyte in the electrolyte solution is also significantly reduced, thereby achieving better maintenance effects of the conductivity of the electrolyte solution. Therefore, compared to a lithium-ion battery with unmodified lithium manganate material as the positive electrode active material, the present disclosure significantly reduces the migration resistance of lithium ions between the positive electrode and negative electrode, and the internal resistance increase rate of the battery in the present disclosure is lower after several times of charge and discharge.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">In some embodiments, the mass ratio of the organic bonding material to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.01-5):100, and optionally is (0.3-2):100.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">As described above, the organic bonding material is crucial to the establishment of beneficial functions of the lithium manganate of the present disclosure. In addition, through extensive experimentation, the inventors have found that:</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086">When the content of the organic bonding material in the cladding layer is too low, sufficient bonding effect cannot be achieved; on the one hand, sufficient amount of the A-type salt and the B-type salt cannot be bonded, and on the other hand, it cannot be tightly bonded with the surface of the lithium manganate matrix, which results in the reduction of the above beneficial effects of the organic bonding material and even the failure of the function of the cladding layer. In contrast, when the content of the organic bonding material in the cladding layer is too high, the cladding layer may be too thick, which hinders the transport of lithium ions in the lithium manganate positive electrode active material, so that lithium ions are not easily released or intercalated, resulting in an increase in the battery impedance. However, an appropriate amount of the organic bonding material can: guarantee that the A-type salt and the B-type salt are fully adhered to the surface of the lithium manganate matrix, guarantee that the B-type salt fully captures fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, guarantee that the A-type salt captures the transition metal manganese ions to the utmost extent, and prevent manganese ions from migrating to the negative electrode, thereby reducing the decomposition of the SEI film by the transition metal manganese, improving the capacity retention rate of the battery with lithium manganate as the positive electrode material, and reducing the battery impedance; and then form a cladding layer with an appropriate thickness, which, on the one hand, prevents the lithium manganate matrix within the cladding layer from generating metal ions caused by being corroded by the electrolyte solution, and on the other hand, is enough to prevent some transition metal ions generated by the lithium manganate matrix due to force majeure factors from &#x201c;running&#x201d; out of the cladding layer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">In some embodiments, the cladding layer can completely clad the lithium manganate matrix, or can partially clad the lithium manganate matrix, specifically depending on the amount of each substance in the cladding layer. The inventor found through experimentation and research that whether the cladding layer completely clads the lithium manganate matrix depends largely on the amount of the organic bonding material. When the mass ratio of the organic bonding material to the lithium manganate matrix is higher than 1:100, the cladding layer can substantially completely clad the lithium manganate matrix. When the organic bonding material content is too high, i.e., when the cladding is excessive, the impedance of the lithium-ion secondary battery may be deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">In some embodiments, the mass ratio of the organic bonding material to the lithium manganate matrix may be 0.01:100, 0.3:100, 0.68:100, 1.09:100, 1.9:100, 5:100, or a value within a range obtained by combining any two of the above values.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the A-type salt to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.05-10):100, optionally is (0.5-5):100, more optionally is (1.5-3):100.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">An appropriate amount of the A-type salt can guarantee full capture of manganese ions without causing very large thickness of the cladding layer and increasing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">In any of embodiments, the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the lithium manganate matrix is (0.05-10):100, optionally is (0.5-5):100, more optionally is (1.5-3):100.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">An appropriate amount of the B-type salt can guarantee full capture of the fluoride ions, and avoid corrosion of the lithium manganate matrix without causing very large thickness of the cladding layer and increasing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0093">In some embodiments, a ratio of a mass sum of the B-type salt and the A-type salt to mass of the lithium manganate matrix is (0.1-20):100, and optionally is (1-10):100.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">A suitable ratio of the mass sum of the B-type salt and the A-type salt to the mass of lithium manganate is beneficial to fully capture the transition metal ions inside the battery and the fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, thereby reducing the consumption of the SEI film by the transition metal manganese, improving the battery capacity retention rate, and reducing the battery impedance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">When the content of the B-type salt and the A-type salt in the cladding layer is too low, it results in that the outer layer cannot provide sufficient groups for capturing fluoride ions and transition metal ions, and the improvement of the electrical performance of the battery is not much. In contrast, when the content of the B-type salt and the A-type salt in the cladding layer is too high, since the B-type salt and the A-type salt in the cladding layer contains no active lithium ions, the gram capacity of the lithium manganate positive electrode active material is decreased, that is, the mass proportion of effective lithium manganate in the lithium manganate positive electrode active material with the same mass is decreased, thus the theoretical gram capacity thereof is lost.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0096">In some embodiments, the ratio of the mass sum of the B-type salt and the A-type salt to the mass of the lithium manganate matrix may be 0.1:100, 0.5:100, 1:100, 3:100, 6:100, 8:100, 10:100, 15:100, 20:100, or a value within a range obtained by combining any two of the above values.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0097">In some embodiments, optionally the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is (0.01-95):1, and optionally is (1-50):1.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0098">In the lithium manganate positive electrode active material of the present disclosure, the B-type salt is used for capturing fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution, thereby slowing down the precipitation of transition metal manganese ions caused by the corrosion of the lithium manganate matrix by hydrofluoric acid; and the A-type salt is used for directly capturing the transition metal manganese ions inside the battery. The combined use of the B-type salt and the A-type salt has the best effect. When the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is too low, it means that the amount of the B-type salt in the cladding layer is too small, the fluoride ions in the electrolyte solution cannot be fully captured, and the erosion effect on lithium manganate is strengthened; and in contrast, when the mass ratio of the B-type salt to the A-type salt is too high, it means that mass of the A-type salt in the cladding layer is too small, and the capture rate of the transition metal manganese ions inside the battery by the cladding layer is decreased.
