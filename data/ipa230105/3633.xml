The average annual cost of corrosion in the U.S. transmission pipeline sector (including natural gas and crude oil gathering lines) is estimated to be $7B per year. Corrosion coupons (CCs) and electrical resistance (ER) probes are often installed at access fittings which permit the removal and reinstallation of the coupons/probe while the system is operating (e.g., at operational pressures). The primary limitation of CCs and ER probes in remote locations is the lack of complete system coverage. It is often impractical to install either monitoring method at intermediate points between facilities. When operating in onshore, arctic locations, pipelines are largely aboveground, however, they are also insulated. While their aboveground location provides an opportunity for additional monitoring points, the presence of insulation and the inaccessibility of many locations during certain seasons presents additional challenges. In-line inspection (ILI) techniques provide &#x201c;complete&#x201d; system inspection, but have a relatively low sensitivity (compared to other monitoring techniques) and are prone to noise. As a result of these limitations, the exposure period required to accrue corrosion damage that is detectable via ILI tools is significantly longer (2-5 years). Discrete non-destructive inspection (NDI) locations are also employed, but are limited by accessibility and the operational limits of the inspector and the equipment. A primary drawback of using electronic sensors for continuous corrosion monitoring in remote locations is the need to provide power at the test location. Another primary drawback of using electronic sensors for continuous corrosion monitoring in remote locations is the need to provide communications at the test location. Given the aforementioned limitations of current monitoring techniques, the development of a standalone, remotely-monitored corrosion sensor, capable of operating for long periods without service, would be extremely advantageous. Such a device would assist operators in extending the coverage of their corrosion monitoring system, allowing sensors to be installed at known problem locations (e.g., dead legs, low spots, etc.) where the deployment of CCs and ER probes is not practical. Conductivity sensors are simple, robust, and relatively low-power instruments. In some process streams, the measurements from strategically-oriented conductivity probes may correlate well with corrosion rates, or at the very least, can be used to detect the presence of an electrolyte (indicating a likelihood of corrosion). These and other considerations are addressed herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive. Methods and systems for detecting corrosive fluids are described herein. A probe comprising one or more sensors may be disposed in a vessel (e.g., a pipe or other container) such that the one or more sensors are exposed to a process fluid. The probe may be a low-power, standalone probe. The one or more sensors may comprise an electrochemical sensor. The electrochemical sensor may generated a signal. The signal may be received by an analysis unit. The signal may relate to a condition such as the presence of an analyte in a corrosive fluid. A determination may be made as to whether the condition satisfies a threshold. The threshold may comprise a value. If it determined the condition satisfies the threshold, an alarm may be generated.

The apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise one or more probes <b>102</b>. The one or more probes <b>102</b> may comprise a remotely-monitored corrosion sensor. For example, the one or more probes <b>102</b> may comprise a power unit <b>116</b>. The power unit <b>116</b> may comprise, for example, a standalone power source such a battery, a solar cell, a wind power generation technique, or any other distributed energy resource (DER) not requiring a connection to a power grid. The one or more probes <b>102</b> may comprise a power subsystem. For example, the power subsystem may store energy from the power unit <b>116</b>. For example, the power subsystem may comprise a super-capacitor. For example, if the power unit <b>116</b> is a solar cell or other photovoltaic (PV) cell or other energy harvesting device, the super-capacitor (or any other suitable energy storage device) may accumulate a charge. The charge may be sufficient for powering the one or more probes <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The one or more probes <b>102</b> may comprise a sensing element <b>104</b>. The sensing element <b>104</b> may comprise a first sensor <b>106</b> and a second sensor <b>108</b>. The first sensor <b>106</b> may comprise an electrochemical sensor. For example, the first sensor <b>106</b> may comprise one or more electrodes. As an example, the first sensor <b>106</b> may comprise at least one anode and at least one cathode. The at least one anode may comprise at least one conducting material. For example, the at least one conducting material may comprise at least one of magnesium, aluminum, zinc, lithium, or similar materials and the like and combinations thereof. The at least one cathode may comprise at least one conducting material. For example, the at least one cathode may comprise cobalt, nickel, manganese and the like and combinations thereof. The at least one cathode and the at least one anode may be electronically coupled such that an electronic signal passes between them. The sensor may comprise an electrochemical sensor. The electrochemical sensor may comprise a working and counter electrode combination which are configured to produce an electrical signal that is related to the concentration of an analyte in the process fluid. The electrode pair (working and counter) may be configured to produce an electrical signal which is sufficiently strong to provide a signal-to-noise ratio suitable to distinguish between concentration levels of the analyte over an entire range of interest. In other words, the current flow between the working electrode and the counter electrode may be measurably proportional to the concentration of the analyte over the concentration range of interest. In addition to a working electrode and a counter electrode, the electrochemical sensor may include a third, reference electrode. The reference electrode may be configured to maintain the working electrode at a known voltage or potential. The reference electrode may be physically and chemically stable in the electrolyte and carry the lowest possible current to maintain a constant potential. The ER probe may consist of a resistive element made from the vessel material. As corrosion thins the resistive element, the measured electrical resistance increases. This change in resistance may be translated into a corrosion rate. ER probes are the most sensitive of the aforementioned methods and provide the shortest response time, typically between 1 and 10 days.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The process fluid may be multiphase mixtures (oil, water, and natural gas), water (for secondary recovery), produced water, separated oil (with residual water), wet natural gas, and dry natural gas. Other gasses, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide may also be present in production fluids and can greatly impact internal corrosion rates and mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first sensor <b>106</b> (e.g., the electrochemical sensor) may draw power generated by the power source and stored by the power subsystem. For example, once sufficient charge has been accumulated, the sensor wakes up, acquires a new data point from the attached sensor, queries the network for communication protocols, and exchanges stored data with the network. If sufficient charge remains on the super-capacitor, there is a built in delay before the cycle repeats. If there is insufficient charge, the device sleeps until the energy harvesting circuity has replenished the requisite charge.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, the one or more probes <b>102</b>, may comprise one or more antifouling electrodes. For example, the one or more probes <b>102</b> may comprise one or more of anode and cathode elongate antifouling electrodes, each comprising an uninsulated, distal, terminal tip, between which an electrical current flows, wherein the sensing electrodes and antifouling electrode tips are disposed on a planar surface, which may be flat or curved, and the antifouling electrode tips, when disposed in a process fluid the current causes chemical reactions in the process fluid around one or both of the sensor electrodes tips which reduces or prevents fouling of the tip of one or both of the sensor electrodes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sensing element <b>104</b> may comprise a second sensor <b>108</b>. The second sensor <b>108</b> may comprise one or more corrosion coupons. The one or more corrosion coupons may comprise a material susceptible to corrosion. The one or more corrosion coupons (CCs) may be disposed in or on one or more corrosion coupon holders. The CCs may be configured so as to not require electrical power. The CCs may be disposed in the process fluid so as to contact the process fluid over a period of time. The CCs may be composed of a metal which corrodes at a particular rate when exposed to electrolytes. For example, the CCs may have an initial weight and a corroded weight. The initial weight may be the weight (e.g., mass) of the coupon before the coupon has been exposed to the process fluid. For the corroded weight (e.g., corroded mass) may be the weight of the coupon after the coupon has been exposed to the process fluid for an exposure period. The exposure period may be 60, 90, 120 days, or the like. The CCs may comprise a material similar to the material of the vessel which carries the process fluids. The CCs may be comprised of a material which, when exposed to a process fluid, may suffer corrosion and thus the mass of the corrosion coupon may change over time. As such, the mass lost during the exposure period is used to calculate the average corrosion rate of the coupon material during that time. This value is ostensibly correlated to the average corrosion rate experienced by the vessel material.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The one or more probes <b>102</b> may be situated in an access fitting.

The</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">WSN may comprise the one or more probes <b>102</b> distributed over an area. For example, the WSN may comprise twelve probes distributed equidistant from each other over an area of 5000 m<sup>s</sup>. The aforementioned example is merely exemplary and explanatory and is not meant to be limiting. The one or more probes may be positioned such that they may communicate with each other wirelessly, for example through 3G, 5G, wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or any other suitable communication protocol. For example, if a first probe of the one or more probes <b>102</b> detects a condition satisfying a threshold, the first probe may relay that information to a second probe of the one or more probes <b>102</b>. This process may be repeated until, with the signal passing from one probe to another until the signal reaches a probe within a transmission distance of the computing device at which point the signal may be passed to the computing device. For example, operating at low power, the maximum transmission distance of the communicate unit <b>118</b> may be 100 meters. As such, along a pipeline, the one or more probes may be located at 100 m intervals so as to facilitate communication among the one or more probes <b>102</b>. Similarly, in a grid area (as opposed to a linear arrangement along a pipeline), the one or more probes may be arranged geometrically such that any given probe of the one or more probes <b>102</b> is within transmission distance of at least one other probe of the one or more probes <b>102</b>.

The one or more conductivity sensor electrodes <b>302</b>A and <b>302</b>B may comprise one or more exposed elements. The one or more exposed elements may be conductors (metals) and they require little in the way of maintenance and re-calibration. The robust nature of conductivity probes makes them well-suited for remote locations with limited accessibility. Conductivity measurements consume a relatively small amount of electrical energy. As such, they are an ideal technique for applications where electrical utilities are not present, or, where a local energy harvesting device (e.g., thermoelectric, solar, etc.) is to be used. For locations with limited communications infrastructure, conductivity probes are well-suited for integration into a low-power, wireless sensor network (WSN).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The probe <b>300</b> may be coupled to an access fitting <b>304</b>.

For example, the probe <b>400</b> may be configured for measuring the conductivity of electrolytes via the four-point method as is known in the art. This technique requires four, electrically-isolated conductors to be submerged in a fluid of interest. A known current is passed between the external conductors and the resulting voltage difference between the internal conductors is measured. In applications where the accuracy of the conductivity measurement is superseded by time-based trends (changes in conductivity), a more rudimentary two-point conductivity probe may be sufficient. In either the two- or four-point case, there must be a continuous electrolytic path between the electrodes. The accuracy of conductivity probes may be adversely affected by the accrual of solids on the electrode surfaces (fouling), however this electrode fouling error is expected to be less pronounced in conductivity measurements than in electrochemical corrosion rate measurements (e.g., LPR, EIS). The design of the probe <b>400</b> and the supporting electronics dictates the range of conductivity values that can be measured by the system. In multiphase process streams where a significant difference in conductivity exists between the phases, the orientation and flow regime about the probe's electrodes may influence the resulting measurements.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The probe <b>400</b> may comprise a conductivity probe integrated into corrosion coupon (CC) holder.
