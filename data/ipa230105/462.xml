In particular, the present disclosure is directed to subcutaneously placeable blood pressure monitoring systems and methods suitable, inter alia, for long-term monitoring of cardiovascular signals.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hypertension is a significant precursor to cardiovascular disease and death. It is estimated that there are 1.6 billion people worldwide with hypertension, over 100 million in the United States alone, and less than one-third are under control. Hypertension is costly and deadly. There are an estimated 7.8 million deaths each year due to hypertension, and it costs the United States an estimated $131 billion annually due to lost productivity and healthcare costs. Due to its deadliness and costs, it has been a target of government, academic, for-profit, and non-profit organizations. A recent task force has been formed to help reduce the incidence and prevalence of hypertension.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While there are many effective therapies and management protocols to prevent the progression of cardiovascular disease, patients and clinicians are challenged to achieve optimal management for a variety of reasons. First, hypertension is largely asymptomatic. Patients are often unaware they have hypertension which creates skepticism and doubt whether they need to take their prescribed medications or follow diet and exercise recommendations. Secondly, doctors only have sporadic, point-in-time data with varying accuracy of the measurement taken when it is taken outside the clinic. When measurements are taken in a clinic setting, patients may experience either White Coat Syndrome, or Masked Hypertension. This lack of consistent and accurate blood pressure data and trends decreases confidence in the right medical management decisions. Clinicians do not have enough data to make an accurate therapeutic change that could benefit the patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current practices to improve blood control status and management include home blood pressure monitoring and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Many patients use, and clinicians prescribe, home blood pressure monitors to augment in-clinic measurements. These traditional home blood pressure monitors are point-in-time and require the patient to take action regularly, and to have cognitive physical ability to accurately place the blood pressure cuff and collect multiple measurements that can be averaged to filter out inaccuracies or outliers. Another challenge with traditional home blood pressure monitoring is that it does not allow a patient to take their blood pressure at night for obvious reasons. It is also not possible to capture blood pressure readings during different activities compared to resting. Clinical research has demonstrated the clinical relevance and importance of day vs. night blood pressure and the relationship to when medications are administered.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another prescribed technology is Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM). Recent FDA approvals and CMS coverage decisions for ABPM are promising and the technology addresses some of the challenges of traditional home blood pressure monitoring systems. But the technology continues to be a barrier to patient and physician adoption. ABPM technology available today uses traditional sphygmomanometer methods to capture blood pressure measurements every 15 minutes for a period of 24-48 or even 72 hours. While the patient can be &#x201c;ambulatory&#x201d;, the patient wears a cuff that inflates as often as every 15 minutes continuously for up to 72 hours causing pain and bruises. It keeps the patient awake at night, and it is an inconvenient system to wear during activities or even during a working day. It is intrusive into the patient's life and indiscreet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there remains a clinical need for effective and minimally invasive and minimally intrusive methods to monitor and track blood pressure continuously over time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one implementation, the present disclosure is directed to a hemodynamic sensor system, which includes a sensor implant, comprising a housing configured and dimensioned to be placed subcutaneously in tissue adjacent a target blood vessel in a patient, the sensor implant further comprising within the housing: at least one sensor configured to detect one or more physiological parameters indicative of patient hemodynamic condition, wherein at least one the sensor comprises an at least one ultrasound transducer;

Disclosed devices, systems and methods use one or more micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) sensors for the accurate and continuous measurement of physiological hemodynamic signals such as diastolic and systolic blood pressure. In certain variations, embodiments disclosed herein may include any, or all, of the following additional clinical signals of overall patient status: heart rate, activity level (patient movement or position), temperature, heart rate variability, and stenosis. Disclosed embodiments can provide a long-term sensor system will provide accurate (equivalent to current standard of care) blood pressure over an extended duration (for instance, months or years), enabling the clinician to provide appropriate treatment recommendations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing techniques in disclosed embodiments provides a unique micro-sized design, construction, and fixation that allows the implanted sensor system to be fixated just outside the target blood vessel wall, or in some alternatives in the vessel wall, using methods familiar to clinicians trained in accessing a blood vessel (such as ultrasound-guided imaging, and standard needle and syringe access to artery) and minimally invasive outpatient procedures. MEMS construction, unique materials and resultant miniaturized design also promotes efficient use of power compared to more conventional ultrasound transducers. Typical sizes of disclosed sensor implants are millimeter size scale; for example, in some embodiments sensor implant size will have dimensions ranging from about 1 mm to about 30 mm in any of length, width and height directions, and more typically may be in the range 2.5-7.5 mm width&#xd7;15-30 mm length&#xd7;2-4 mm height. Novel injection tools enable the sensor implant to be inserted in an outpatient or clinic setting within minutes. A benefit of a clinic setting is that the patient acceptance increases, and more physicians will be skilled/trained in the minimally invasive procedure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Persons skilled in the art will appreciate various features and advantages of devices, systems and methods of the present disclosure, including, but not limited to active implant (battery or inductively powered) to help reduce patient compliance challenges; fixation mechanism that allows the sensor system to be injected, but fixated outside the artery (in some embodiments, e.g. extravascular) to help reduce thrombus that can lead to signal drift and decreased sensitivity, minimize dislodgement, and clot adverse events compared to an intravascular sensor; MEMS-based-sensor module that incorporates one or more of sensors (strain/piezoelectric resistive transducer, piezoelectric/capacitive ultrasound); biocompatible nano-coatings to minimize encapsulation/biofouling; and ability to continuously capture and store cardiovascular signals for an extended duration.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, components of a basic system <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure may comprise injectable sensor implant <b>102</b>, injection device <b>104</b>, local control module <b>106</b>, network-based analytics and data management modules <b>108</b> and clinician module <b>110</b> comprising user interfaces/applications for data access, analysis and alerts.

In some embodiments, capacitive pressure sensing may be employed. Other sensing modules may be configured as patient status sensors with additional sensing capabilities as described herein below. Functional layers <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, together comprise a sensor package contained within a biocompatible housing <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, power supply and communication layer <b>114</b> may be configured for inductive coupling for charging and/or communications.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The layered MEMS structures described herein provide actively powered, integrated sensor implants well-suited to long-term sub-cutaneous and extravascular monitoring of blood pressure and other cardiovascular vital signs using ultrasound (US). The disclosed structures thus address challenges of previous approaches to collect reliable continuous blood pressure over time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate a number of alternative configurations for sensor implant <b>102</b> that achieve these advantages.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Sensor implant <b>102</b><i>a</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, includes power module <b>121</b> and communications module <b>122</b> in functional layer <b>114</b>. In some embodiments where inductive power coupling is used as the power source, the power module <b>121</b> and communications module <b>122</b> may be integrated as a single communications/power source module. Control and signal processing module <b>123</b> resides in functional layer <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, MUT sensor array <b>124</b>, along with status sensor module <b>130</b> and optional acoustic lens <b>125</b> comprise sensor layer <b>118</b>. This layered MEMS structure is contained within biocompatible housing <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, housing <b>120</b> may comprise rigid materials such as titanium, stainless steel or nitinol. Biocompatible plastics or silicone also may be used as a housing material. If the material for housing <b>120</b> is not freely transmissive of US signals, one or more appropriate US transmissive window(s) <b>127</b> may be provided aligned with US sensor array <b>124</b>, such that housing <b>120</b> may comprise non-US transmissive portions <b>126</b> and transmissive portions <b>127</b>. Materials for US transmissive window(s) <b>127</b> include biocompatible materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), silicone, glass, ceramic or parylene coatings.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Outer surfaces of housing <b>126</b> may be provided with a coating of materials to promote tissue adhesion, such as collagen, fibrin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and alginate, and/or may have textured, roughened or featured surfaces for this purpose. Other surfaces, such as US transmissive windows <b>127</b>, may have coatings to prevent tissue adhesion. Examples of adhesion preventative coatings include polymer brushes and self-assembled monolayers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, fixation features <b>128</b> may comprise three-dimensional surface irregularities designed to create friction and prevent device migration over time. These irregularities may be rigid structures or compliant structures, such as fabric mesh or loops. In other embodiments, retractable tines with memory and flexibility (nitinol) are optimally placed to promote stable implant position over time. Fixation tines are collapsible and are collapsed inside of an insertion tool and engage when released from the insertion tool. Alternatively, one or more wings, or flaps, are optimally placed to promote stable implant position over time, and may be configured to collapse when inside the insertion tool and engage when released from the insertion tool. In some embodiments, fixation features <b>128</b> also may be configured as antennas as a part of communications module <b>122</b>. Sensor implants <b>102</b> also may include an attachment and release feature <b>129</b> on an outer surface of housing <b>126</b>. Attachment and release feature <b>129</b> may comprise a loop or recess that is releasably engageable by a delivery and retrieval mechanism as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, extravascular sensor implants according to the present disclosure are preferably positioned at a known distance from the outer wall of the blood vessel (BV) to be interrogated. Optimum placement distance from the blood vessel may be set by persons of ordinary skill based on the teachings of the present disclosure taking into account parameters such as a sensor array configuration, tuning of the US signal using system electronics and selection of an acoustic lens. An advantage of injection devices <b>104</b> hereinafter described is that they allow for precise placement at a preferred sensing distance using visualization such as external ultrasound visualization. In some embodiments, sensing distance from the blood vessel outer wall will be in the range of about 2 mm to about 50 mm. In other embodiments, a narrower distance range of about 3 mm to about 15 mm may be preferable and, in some cases, a placement of 5 mm to 7 mm may be ideal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">While sensor implant <b>102</b><i>a </i>includes only a single sensor array <b>124</b>, often it will be preferable to include at least two, spaced-apart sensor arrays <b>124</b> in order to facilitate pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements as in sensor implant <b>102</b><i>b</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Sensor implant <b>102</b><i>b </i>is configured substantially the same as sensor implant <b>102</b><i>a</i>, with the exception of the accommodation of two sensor arrays <b>124</b> and corresponding two US transmissive windows <b>127</b>. Alternatively, rather than discrete windows, the two ends of the sensor implant may be transparent and comprised of material that supports ultrasound and communication. Examples of such materials include polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), silicone, glass and ceramic. In a further alternative, the entire housing <b>120</b> may comprise a US transparent material that also permits transmission of communications signals from the antenna structure of communication module <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a further alternative embodiment, including multiple (N<b>1</b> through Nn) sensor arrays <b>124</b>, wherein sensor implant <b>102</b><i>c </i>is entirely a flexible construction including housing <b>120</b> being made of flexible material that also permits US signal transmission and communication signal transmission from communication module <b>122</b>. An example of such a housing material includes certain polymers and ceramic. Flexible functional layers <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> may be fabricated using carbon nanotubes or ultrathin silicon integrated circuit technologies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> also illustrates a further alternative fixation feature <b>128</b>, in the form of micro hooks. Such hooks may be comprised of resilient materials such as nitinol wire or biocompatible fabrics formed as hooks of hook and loop fasteners material.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of sensor implants disclosed herein are physically arranged in a manner to promote accurate readings regardless of migration or changes in orientation after implantation. This will include a combination of unique sensor fabrication that physically orients transducers in a fashion that will maintain focus on vessel of interest regardless of modest migration or movement of sensor away from vessel of interest. Aspects of this physical arrangement include the elongated configuration of housing <b>126</b> with plural spaced-apart sensor arrays <b>124</b> positioned on one side of the sensor implant, with appropriately positioned fixation features <b>128</b>. These aspects of the disclosed sensors present a unique advantage over prior systems by making PWV calculations and blood pressure calculations based on the PWV calculations possible using only a single, unitary sensor implant to provide not only all necessary timing and dimensional data at two spaced-apart locations, but also, in some embodiments, additional patient position and movement data to allow more accurate assessment of patient hemodynamic state, and blood pressure in particular.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> presents a representative block diagram of major functional blocks within embodiments of implant sensors <b>102</b> as disclosed herein. As shown therein, power module <b>121</b> provides a power source in the form of a power supply comprising battery <b>131</b> and power management sub-module <b>132</b>. Note that the battery can be generalized to any suitable implantable primary cell or rechargeable power source as may be devised by persons of ordinary skill. Power management sub-module <b>132</b> is configured for battery optimization to power US wireless communication, etc., with no required patient interaction to power the device, which is a substantial improvement over prior devices. Long-term monitoring can be achieved through the application of algorithms that reduce power consumption during idle times and optimize overall battery consumption, including detecting power requirements and automatedly switching appropriate modules or sub-modules to &#x201c;power off&#x201d; mode when power is not required in those modules or sub-modules.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Communications module <b>122</b> comprises a transceiver sub-module configured for the selected communications mode and corresponding antenna, which is preferably positioned opposite the sensor modules at or through housing <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the antenna may comprise fixation features <b>128</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-C</figref>). Control and signal processing module <b>123</b> may comprise memory <b>133</b>, digital control <b>134</b>, transmit and receive electronics sub-module <b>135</b>, data converter <b>137</b> and processing sub-module <b>136</b> including at least one microprocessor. These components may be configured by persons skilled in the art based on the teachings contained herein. As will be appreciated, sensor integration with ASIC provides efficiency gains in power and size by integrating the MEMS sensor into the ASIC design. While in some embodiments pulse wave velocity and patient blood pressure may be calculated within sensor implant <b>102</b>, it may be preferable to configure processing module <b>123</b> with instructions to produce a data stream from which pulse wave velocity for the blood vessel and patient blood pressure (optionally also heart rate) can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Status sensor module <b>130</b> may comprise one or a collection of several different sensor types, including but not limited to inertial measurement unit (IMU), accelerometer, temperature sensor, electrodes for ECG or impedance, and oxygen saturation. Status sensor module <b>130</b> thus provides for monitoring of a number of different physiologic parameters, such as temperature, body position, activity, ECG and fluid retention, to compliment blood pressure measurements to assist in assessment of patient's overall condition. In most embodiments, at least a status sensor module with an accelerometer will be included to allow the data stream produced by control and processing module <b>123</b> to include information needed to adjust the blood pressure calculation to compensate for patient position and/or movement.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates sensor array state configurations. When multiple sensor arrays are employed, for example as in sensor implant <b>102</b><i>c</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, with each additional sensor array, its operation state during use (Tx or Rx) is flexible. As an example, a configuration where Sensor N<b>1</b> and Sensor N<b>2</b> are present is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, wherein each sensor array has options of receive, transmit and active switching between receive and transmit. Sensor state is programmable via electronics sub-module <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A two-dimensional representation of a cMUT or pMUT array is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. In this example, sensor module <b>124</b> comprises substrate <b>138</b> with an array of sensor elements <b>139</b>. Ideally, the array parameters, Ds (sensor element diameter), Hs (array height) and Ls (array length), are optimized for performance within a specific sensor implant and system. For example, Ds is preferably selected based at least in part on a desired frequency of operation, thus defining a minimum vessel diameter change that can be detected by the sensor implant. Hs and Ls define number of sensor elements and are selected at least in part to optimize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the pulse echo amplitude is defined by these parameters. Sensor array size can also be selected in combination with the number of plural sensor modules (as in, for example, sensor implant <b>102</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) in order to facilitate position identification and compensation as discussed below. In some embodiments a preferred material for sensor array <b>138</b>/<b>139</b> is aluminium nitride (AlN), which provides US power-efficient and biocompatible sensor array substrate compatible with human implantation. Previous lead-based ultrasound transducers require 100&#xd7; more energy to power sensor and are also not biocompatible for implantable use in living beings.

As shown therein, injection device <b>170</b> comprises outer introducer <b>172</b> with a sharpened, needle or syringe-like distal end, an inner atraumatic curved sheath <b>174</b> and device injector <b>176</b> sliding within inner sheath <b>174</b>. Injection device <b>170</b> is also generally configured as a syringe-type device. In order to deploy sensor implant <b>102</b> with injection device <b>170</b>, introducer <b>172</b> is positioned subcutaneously at the desired location, preferably under visualization, such as with ultrasound. When appropriate positioning is confirmed, inner sheath <b>174</b> is advanced out of the distal end of introducer <b>172</b>. Atraumatic distal end of inner sheath <b>174</b> facilitates positioning in close proximity to a blood vessel of interest while minimizing possibility of trauma to the blood vessel during the sensor injection procedure. Distal end of inner sheath <b>174</b> may have a pre-set curve as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> such that after exiting outer introducer the inner sheath automatically assumes the pre-set curvature thereby facilitating placement with reduced risk of trauma to the adjacent blood vessel.

The distal end of device injector <b>176</b> may be provided with a retrieval mechanism such as a hook as described herein. After position of sensor <b>102</b> and engagement of the fixation feature is confirmed, inner sheath <b>174</b> may be withdrawn and then the sensor disengaged from device injector <b>176</b>.

Ultrasound is the transmission of sound waves through a medium. When the ultrasound sound waves reach a surface or differing medium, the wave reflects and travels back in the originating direction. The time it takes for the ultrasound wave to travel can be used to calculate the distance from the reflecting surface. This ultrasound concept may be used in embodiments of the present disclosure to calculate the diameter of the vessel wall and can be used to estimate volumetric changes in the vessel as a pulse wave travels through the vessel. Based on the wave transmission and properties, the ability to differentiate the variability in reflecting mediums, such as hard plaque or wall stiffness, is also possible.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">One example of known algorithms for blood pressure calculation on this basis is described by Ma, et al., <i>Relation between blood pressure and pulse wave velocity for human arteries</i>, Proc.

With signal data appropriately processed for interpretation by the designated computing device (internal, external or networked), vessel diameter as a function of time is determined based on analysis of the US signals (step <b>193</b>). Measured and recorded data stored in memory module <b>133</b> may include, for example, vessel inner and outer diameters at each US sensor array, &#x394;T between the different US sensor array readings, heart rate/interval, temperature and patient or sensor implant orientation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0068">Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is determined and recorded at step <b>194</b> based on parameters determined in prior steps. Based on determined PWV and at least the previously measured and entered Diastole BP (step <b>186</b>), blood pressure is calculated (step <b>195</b>), according to correlations known in the art, for example, using algorithms described by Ma et al. as explained above. Additional inputs to blood pressure calculation (step <b>195</b>), which may increase accuracy of the calculated blood pressure, may include other measured parameters (step <b>188</b>) such as patient activity or orientation (as determined by accelerometer or IMU in status sensor module <b>130</b>) and body temperature (as determined by temperature sensor in module <b>130</b>). Other parameters as described hereinabove also may be factored in by persons of ordinary skill based on the teachings of the present disclosure. Patient blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters as measured and determined, along with measured parameters (step <b>188</b>) are delivered to the clinician/patient interface, such as interface <b>110</b> (step <b>196</b>). In one embodiment, calculation of blood pressure is executed in network-based systems through appropriate network connections with local control module <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a further alternative embodiment of a system <b>100</b><i>a </i>according to the present disclosure. In this example, sensor implant <b>102</b> includes at least two ultrasound sensor modules comprised of micromachined ultrasonic transducer arrays, a status sensor module comprised of at least an accelerometer, and a control module including at least one microprocessor and at least one memory containing instructions and configured to allow the sensor implant to perform at least sensing and processing steps <b>188</b> through <b>193</b>. In this specific example, communication module <b>122</b> uses Bluetooth communication to transmit a processed data stream containing blood vessel dimension, timing and accelerometer information as needed to permit calculation of pulse wave velocity and patient blood pressure. In this example, a personal mobile device is configured as one or both of local module <b>106</b> and patient interface <b>110</b> using a mobile device app and transmits the processed data stream to a networked computer for calculation of pulse wave velocity and patient blood pressure according to stored algorithms discussed herein. Patient blood pressure information is conveyed back to the patient via the mobile device <b>106</b>/<b>110</b>. Optionally, a separate clinician interface may receive the patient data directly from networked computing device <b>108</b> via the network or through the patient mobile device <b>106</b>/<b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0070">Parameters utilized in processing may include those parameters that are determined during initial implantation of implant sensor <b>102</b> and as may be updated as needed with periodic calibration. In some embodiments periodic calibration may include analysis to determine placement relative to initial placement location. Given the unique implant structure employing, in some embodiments (e.g. sensor implants <b>102</b><i>b </i>and <b>102</b><i>c</i>), multiple sensor MUT modules positioned at known fixed distances with respect to one another, analysis of returned US signals allows for continually accurate PWV calculation by using changes in the US-viewed orientation relative to the observed vascular structure to determine a skew factor for correcting PWV calculations. For example, using anatomical markers as detected by sensor modules <b>124</b> and interpreted by control and signal processing module <b>123</b>, the system may determine that the longitudinal axis of the sensor implant, originally preferably implanted in alignment with direction of blood flow or at a known orientation with respect thereto, has become skewed relative to flow direction by a determined skew angle. The system may then recalculate the distance between N and N+1 sensor modules <b>124</b> as (cos[skew angle])/[fixed sensor module spacing]=[skew adjusted sensor spacing].</p><p id="p-0081" num="0071">As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, devices, systems and methods disclosed herein, given the large and varied amount of physiological and specifically hemodynamic data generated, allow for accurate detection and classification of arrythmias, such as bradycardia, ventricular tachy-cardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and sinus pause using data generated in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure in known diagnostic algorithms.
