present disclosure relate generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to configuring connectivity of a PC5 remote user equipment (UE) with UE-to-network (NW) relay access to a 5G core via a Interworking Function (IWF).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, and so on. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time-division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. For example, a fifth generation (5G) wireless communications technology (which can be referred to as NR) is envisaged to expand and support diverse usage scenarios and applications with respect to current mobile network generations. In an aspect, 5G communications technology can include: enhanced mobile broadband addressing human-centric use cases for access to multimedia content, services and data; ultra-reliable-low latency communications (URLLC) with certain specifications for latency and reliability; and massive machine type communications, which can allow a very large number of connected devices and transmission of a relatively low volume of non-delay-sensitive information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, for various communications technology such as, but not limited to NR, UE-to-NW relaying in NR implementations may increase transmission speed and flexibility but also transmission complexity. Thus, improvements in wireless communication operations may be desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure relates to wireless communications, and more particularly to providing connectivity of a PC5 remote user equipment (UE) with UE-to-network (NW) relay access to the 5G Core (5GC) via an Interworking Function (IWF) (e.g., Non-3GPP IWF). Specifically, L3 UE-to-NW relaying may be implemented to support relaying for a remote UE as part of a system enhancement for Proximity based Services (ProSe) in a 5G System (5GS). In such system, the ProSe 5G UE-to-NW relay UE may provide functionality to support connectivity to the network for remote UEs by relaying the remote UEs user plane (UP) traffic to a gNB/5GC.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, there may be a number of drawbacks of the L3 UE-to-NW relay scheme. For example, a network access stratum (NAS) connection may not exist for the remote UE with the 5GC over PC5 UE-to-NW relay path, e.g., no authorization and authentication of the remote UE by 5GC. Further, for instance, end-to-end security may not exist for remote UE data, only hop-by-hop (e.g., PC5 and Uu) security supported. Additionally, a remote UE Internet Protocol (IP) session continuity may not exist when a data path switches between a radio interface (e.g., Uu) link and a relay link. In particular, a remote UE may have multiple paths available, such as a Uu path (in-coverage of gNB) or a UE-to-NW relay path via PC5 or multiple UE-to-NW relay paths (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In such cases, the UE may switch from one path to another path exhibiting better radio conditions to support service continuity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As such, to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, it may be desirable to provide connectivity of a PC5 remote UE with UE-to-NW relay access to the 5GC via an IWF (e.g., N3IWF). In one implementation, a remote UE may configure a NAS connection with 5GC via an N3IWF. The UE-to-NW relay over PC5 may be another access type connected to the N3IWF. In another aspect, Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) may be implemented at a remote UE. For instance, the remote UE NAS may message for ATSSS support carried via N3IWF to the 5GC.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one implementation, a remote UE may discover an IWF while connected to a relay UE over a sidelink interface. The remote UE may further establish a non-access stratum (NAS) connection with a network entity using the signaling IPsec security association established (via the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) security association (SA) procedures) with the IWF, similar to untrusted non-3GPP Access via N3IWF. The remote UE may further communicate, with the network entity via the relay UE, by sending the data over the IPsec Child SAs established with the IWF for the corresponding PDU Sessions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another implementation, a relay UE may receive at least one relay discovery parameter from a network entity. The relay UE may further determine, based at least on the at least one relay discovery parameter from a remote UE, at least one parameter for establishing one or more PDU sessions towards an IWF, while connected to the remote UE over a sidelink interface. The relay UE may further establish, for the remote UE, a single relay PDU session or multiple relay PDU sessions.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another implementation, a remote UE may determine satisfaction of a service continuity condition over a radio interface or a sidelink interface while connected to a network entity via a relay UE. The remote UE may further establish a multi-access packet data unit (MA-PDU) session via at least one of the radio interface or an IWF. The remote UE may further communicate, with the network entity via the relay UE, data via the radio interface or the IWF.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The described features will be presented in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>23</b></figref></p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, software, a combination of hardware and software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components can communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software modules, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and other systems. The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; may often be used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as CDMA2000, Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), etc. CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95, and IS-856 standards. IS-2000 Releases 0 and A are commonly referred to as CDMA2000 1&#xd7;, 1&#xd7;, etc. IS-856 (TIA-856) is commonly referred to as CDMA2000 1&#xd7;EV-DO, High Rate Packet Data (HRPD), etc. UTRA includes Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) and other variants of CDMA. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM&#x2122;, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) are new releases of UMTS that use E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE, LTE-A, and GSM are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP). CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). The techniques described herein may be used for the systems and radio technologies mentioned above as well as other systems and radio technologies, including cellular (e.g., LTE) communications over a shared radio frequency spectrum band. The description below, however, describes an LTE/LTE-A system for purposes of example, and LTE terminology is used in much of the description below, although the techniques are applicable beyond LTE/LTE-A applications (e.g., to fifth generation (5G) NR networks or other next generation communication systems).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The following description provides examples, and is not limiting of the scope, applicability, or examples set forth in the claims. Changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements discussed without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Various examples may omit, substitute, or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance, the methods described may be performed in an order different from that described, and various steps may be added, omitted, or combined.

The wireless communications system (also referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN)) can include base stations <b>102</b>, UEs <b>104</b>, an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>160</b>, and/or a 5G Core (5GC) <b>190</b>. The base stations <b>102</b>, which may also be referred to as network entities, may include macro cells (high power cellular base station) and/or small cells (low power cellular base station). The macro cells can include base stations. The small cells can include femtocells, picocells, and microcells. In an example, the base stations <b>102</b> may also include gNBs <b>180</b>, as described further herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one example, some nodes such as UE <b>104</b> of the wireless communication system may have a modem <b>340</b> and communicating component <b>342</b> for providing connectivity of a PC5 remote UE with UE-to-NW relay access to the 5GC via an IWF (e.g., N3IWF), as described herein. In another example, some nodes, such as base station <b>102</b>/gNB <b>180</b>, may have a modem <b>240</b> and communicating component <b>242</b> for facilitating communication with one or more UEs <b>104</b>. Though a UE <b>104</b> is shown as having the modem <b>340</b> and communicating component <b>342</b> and a base station <b>102</b>/gNB <b>180</b> is shown as having the modem <b>240</b> and communicating component <b>242</b>, this is one illustrative example, and substantially any node or type of node may include a modem <b>240</b> and communicating component <b>242</b> for providing corresponding functionalities described herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The base stations <b>102</b> configured for 4G LTE (which can collectively be referred to as Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN)) may interface with the EPC <b>160</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., using an S1 interface). Alternatively, or in addition, the base stations <b>102</b> configured for 5G NR (which can collectively be referred to as Next Generation RAN (NG-RAN)) may interface with 5GC <b>190</b> through backhaul links <b>184</b>. In addition to other functions, the base stations <b>102</b> may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, and delivery of warning messages. The base stations <b>102</b> may communicate directly or indirectly (e.g., through the EPC <b>160</b> or 5GC <b>190</b>) with each other over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., using an X2 interface). The backhaul links <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and/or <b>184</b> may be wired or wireless.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The base stations <b>102</b> may wirelessly communicate with one or more UEs <b>104</b>. Each of the base stations <b>102</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. There may be overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>. For example, the small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; may have a coverage area <b>110</b>&#x2032; that overlaps the coverage area <b>110</b> of one or more macro base stations <b>102</b>. A network that includes both small cell and macro cells may be referred to as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include Home Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group, which can be referred to as a closed subscriber group (CSG). The communication links <b>120</b> between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (UL) (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>. The communication links <b>120</b> may use multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links may be through one or more carriers. The base stations <b>102</b>/UEs <b>104</b> may use spectrum up to Y MHz (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, 400, etc. MHz) bandwidth per carrier allocated in a carrier aggregation of up to a total of Yx MHz (e.g., for x component carriers) used for transmission in the DL and/or the UL direction. The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to DL and UL (e.g., more or less carriers may be allocated for DL than for UL). The component carriers may include a primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers. A primary component carrier may be referred to as a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be referred to as a secondary cell (SCell).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another example, certain UEs <b>104</b> may communicate with each other using device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>158</b>. The D2D communication link <b>158</b> may use the DL/UL WWAN spectrum. The D2D communication link <b>158</b> may use one or more sidelink channels, such as a physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH), a physical sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH), a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), and a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH). D2D communication may be through a variety of wireless D2D communications systems, such as for example, FlashLinQ, WiMedia, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, LTE, or NR.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The wireless communications system may further include a Wi-Fi access point (AP) <b>150</b> in communication with Wi-Fi stations (STAs) <b>152</b> via communication links <b>154</b> in a 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum. When communicating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the STAs <b>152</b>/AP <b>150</b> may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the channel is available.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; may operate in a licensed and/or an unlicensed frequency spectrum. When operating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; may employ NR and use the same 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum as used by the Wi-Fi AP <b>150</b>. The small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032;, employing NR in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A base station <b>102</b>, whether a small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; or a large cell (e.g., macro base station), may include an eNB, gNodeB (gNB), or other type of base station. Some base stations, such as gNB <b>180</b> may operate in a traditional sub 6 GHz spectrum, in millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies, and/or near mmW frequencies in communication with the UE <b>104</b>. When the gNB <b>180</b> operates in mmW or near mmW frequencies, the gNB <b>180</b> may be referred to as an mmW base station. Extremely high frequency (EHF) is part of the RF in the electromagnetic spectrum. EHF has a range of 30 GHz to 300 GHz and a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 10 millimeters. Radio waves in the band may be referred to as a millimeter wave. Near mmW may extend down to a frequency of 3 GHz with a wavelength of 100 millimeters. The super high frequency (SHF) band extends between 3 GHz and 30 GHz, also referred to as centimeter wave. Communications using the mmW/near mmW radio frequency band has extremely high path loss and a short range. The mmW base station <b>180</b> may utilize beamforming <b>182</b> with the UE <b>104</b> to compensate for the extremely high path loss and short range. A base station <b>102</b> referred to herein can include a gNB <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The EPC <b>160</b> may include a Mobility Management Entity (MME) <b>162</b>, other MMES <b>164</b>, a Serving Gateway <b>166</b>, a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) Gateway <b>168</b>, a Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) <b>170</b>, and a Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway <b>172</b>. The MME <b>162</b> may be in communication with a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>174</b>. The MME <b>162</b> is the control node that processes the signaling between the UEs <b>104</b> and the EPC <b>160</b>. Generally, the MME <b>162</b> provides bearer and connection management. All user Internet protocol (IP) packets are transferred through the Serving Gateway <b>166</b>, which itself is connected to the PDN Gateway <b>172</b>. The PDN Gateway <b>172</b> provides UE IP address allocation as well as other functions. The PDN Gateway <b>172</b> and the BM-SC <b>170</b> are connected to the IP Services <b>176</b>. The IP Services <b>176</b> may include the Internet, an intranet, an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a PS Streaming Service, and/or other IP services.

The BM-SC <b>170</b> may serve as an entry point for content provider MBMS transmission, may be used to authorize and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within a public land mobile network (PLMN), and may be used to schedule MBMS transmissions. The MBMS Gateway <b>168</b> may be used to distribute MBMS traffic to the base stations <b>102</b> belonging to a Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) area broadcasting a particular service, and may be responsible for session management (start/stop) and for collecting eMBMS related charging information.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The 5GC <b>190</b> may include a Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) <b>192</b>, other AMFs <b>193</b>, a Session Management Function (SMF) <b>194</b>, and a User Plane Function (UPF) <b>195</b>. The AMF <b>192</b> may be in communication with a Unified Data Management (UDM) <b>196</b>. The AMF <b>192</b> can be a control node that processes the signaling between the UEs <b>104</b> and the 5GC <b>190</b>. Generally, the AMF <b>192</b> can provide QoS flow and session management. User Internet protocol (IP) packets (e.g., from one or more UEs <b>104</b>) can be transferred through the UPF <b>195</b>. The UPF <b>195</b> can provide UE IP address allocation for one or more UEs, as well as other functions. The UPF <b>195</b> is connected to the IP Services <b>197</b>.

Also, there may be some remote UEs which do not support or are not authorized for N3IWF connection or they do not need IPsec tunneling for UP traffic of certain services running on the Remote UE.
