In some examples, premixers with counterclockwise swirl may be placed adjacent to premixers of clockwise swirl to guide the pilot products radially and/or circumferentially. In some examples, a subset of premixers may guide the pilot products. In some examples, the premixers may guide the pilot products to nearby premixers or adjacent (e.g., directly next to) premixers. The direction of swirl may be achieved by angling the tangential openings of the premixer in a counterclockwise manner or a clockwise manner. The arrangement of premixers may be selected within a premixer zone, between adjacent premixer zones, between adjacent premixer arrays, between multiple premixer arrays, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an engine <b>10</b> having a mixer <b>12</b>.

Thus, the mixer <b>12</b> may provide a fuel-air mixture (provided by the combination of air flow from the premixers <b>14</b> and the pilot tube(s) <b>104</b>) to the engine <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In operation, and with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a fuel flow may be provided through the pilot tube <b>104</b>.

This may generate a combined premixer fuel-air mixture flow that acts to move the pilot fuel or fuel-air mixture flow or pilot products to flow in a radial outward direction R (e.g., in a radial direction with respect to the engine <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. This may also be referred to as an axial direction of the premixer array <b>16</b>) to provide a flow <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>) of fuel-air mixture or combustion products in the radially outward direction and radially inward direction. A similar action is achieved on the bottom side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> in the B-Zone by arranging the bottom left premixer as a counterclockwise swirled premixer tube <b>100</b><i>b </i>and the bottom right premixer as a clockwise swirled premixer tube <b>100</b><i>a</i>. This arrangement may cause pilot products to move radially inward in the direction R. Thus, when two adjacent premixers are arranged with opposing flows (e.g., one arranged clockwise and one arranged counterclockwise), the fuel-air mixture flow from the premixer may meet and pull the pilot fuel or fuel-air mixture flow or products of combustion from pilot along therewith. That is, adjacent swirled premixer tubes <b>100</b> may be arranged to flow in opposing directions. The adjacent swirled premixer tubes <b>100</b> may be arranged to cause the pilot products to flow in a radially outward direction and/or a radially inward direction. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the top two premixers of the B-Zone pulls the fuel flow radially outward and the bottom two premixers of the B-Zone pulls the fuel flow radially inward. Such an arrangement may reduce or prevent circumferential flow of the pilot fuel or combustion product from pilot (e.g., fuel or pilot combustion product to the left and right as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) and induce the combustion products from pilot to move towards A-Zone or C-Zone thereby providing flame stability to the premixers in A-Zone and C-Zone that do not have a pilot <b>104</b>. Including a swirled premixer in the C-Zone may further pull the now fuel-air mixture in the desired direction. Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> as a clockwise swirled premixer tube <b>100</b><i>a</i>, this may be a counterclockwise swirled premixer tube <b>100</b><i>b</i>. A swirled premixer tube provided in the C-Zone or in the upper A-zone may assist in reducing a re-circulation zone closer to the combustion liner <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), which is typically seen with non-swirling premixer. Reducing the corner re-circulation zone closer to the combustion liner <b>20</b> helps in reducing flame quenching effect and maintaining a shortened flame for premixers those are near the inner liner or the outer liner of the combustion zone.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the opposing flow of the swirled premixer tubes <b>100</b> may move the pilot products in a selected direction or a predetermined direction. This arrangement may be used to induce the pilot products to flow from the pilot tube to the main mixer and, thus, to the engine. Directing the pilot products in the desired direction may allow for the premixer array <b>16</b> to achieve enhanced mixing and lower NO<sub>x </sub>emissions as compared to premixer arrays that do no employ such directing of pilot products. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the pilot products are induced to flow radially towards A-Zone and C-Zone and circumferential flow is limited.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>D</figref>, a premixer array <b>16</b> may include a plurality of non-swirled premixer tubes <b>150</b> and a plurality of swirled premixer tubes <b>100</b>.

For example, the premixer array may include a first premixer array and a second premixer array. The first premixer array may produce a clockwise flow and the second premixer array may produce a counterclockwise flow. That is, the premixer array may include two or more premixer arrays, wherein half of the two or more premixer arrays produce a clockwise flow and one of the two or more premixer arrays produces a counterclockwise flow. For example, where two mixer arrays are present, one premixer array has a clockwise flow and one premixer array has a counterclockwise flow, when four premixer arrays are present two premixer arrays form a clockwise flow and one premixer array forms a counterclockwise flow, and so on.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Accordingly, the premixer array of the present disclosure provides for a pilot introduced between main mixer swirl couplets to provide enhanced radial spread of product of combustion from pilot tubes to flow towards both upper sides and lower sides of the main mixer cluster or tubes. Upward (e.g., radially outward) pilot flow may be induced using a combination of clockwise left swirler tubes and anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) right swirler tubes. Downward (e.g., radially inward) pilot flow may be induced using a combination of counterclockwise left swirler tubes and clockwise right swirler tubes. This may provide stable ignition source to main tubes or a cluster of main tubes. Circumferential flow may be eliminated in some examples. The direction of flow of the pilot products may be controlled by placement of the swirled premixer tubes and by selection of counterclockwise or clockwise angled tangential openings in the premixer tubes.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to the present disclosure, the premixer arrays may reduce a recirculation zone, reduce temperature of the liner, stabilize the flame structure, move the flow closer to the outer liner to fill the recirculation zone, and/or move the flow closer to the inner liner to reduce the temperature on the liner.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the present disclosure, a combination of clockwise and counterclockwise, lightly swirled premixer tubes may create a secondary flow structure that positively impacts the heat release near the dome and heat shield, which may provide a combustion dynamics benefit.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the present disclosure swirl couplets (e.g., swirled premixer tubes) may be provided close to an outer liner and/or inner liner of the combustion zone to reduce a corner circulation zone near the liner. This may reduce flame quenching, may lower CO emissions, and may lower the liner temperature.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to the present disclosure, a swirling pilot and/or a non-swirling pilot may be introduced between non-swirling premixer tubes or swirling premixer tubes to cause products of combustion from the pilot to flow toward adjacent premixer tubes or adjacent clusters of premixer tubes or adjacent premixer arrays.

This may achieve compact flame structure as compared to non-swirling premixer tubes, which may result in an emissions benefit. The non-swirling forward and/or aft holes with swirling vanes in a premixer may generate higher turbulent levels within the premixer due to the shear created between the non-swirling and swirling flow within the premixer itself.
