Generally, in a flexible printed circuit, a pattern layer serving as a conductor circuit is laminated on a base film. A pattern layer has bonding regions as regions for soldering electrodes of chip components. Further, a coverlay for protecting the pattern layer or the like is laminated on the base film or the pattern layer. A coverlay has openings for externally exposing, for example, bonding regions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A coverlay is bonded onto a base film by hot pressing via an adhesive. If the adhesive protrudes from the edge of an opening provided in the coverlay during bonding, the protruding adhesive may reach a bonding region. In this case, a desired bonding region cannot be secured, and as a result, the reliability of soldering may be reduced. Accordingly, J P 2004-235459 A discloses a technique for manufacturing a flexible printed circuit in which an adhesive layer around an opening is semi-cured half-hardened when a coverlay is bonded onto a base film in order to prevent such an adhesive from protruding.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The manufacturing method disclosed in JP 2004-235459 A includes a step of heating only the peripheral portion of the opening in order to semi-cure the adhesive layer around the opening of the coverlay, and thus, this makes the overall process complicated. Further, for example, in a case where a large number of small chip components are mounted on a flexible printed circuit, the process becomes more complicated, and thus, it may be difficult to perform the semi-curing process for all openings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the disclosure is to provide a flexible printed circuit capable of easily suppressing deterioration in the reliability of soldering when mounting an electronic component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A flexible printed circuit of an embodiment includes: an electronic component having an electrode; a base film; a conductive pattern layer which is laminated on a portion of the base film and has a bonding region to which the electrode is soldered; and a coverlay laminated on the base film or the pattern layer via an adhesive and having an opening for externally exposing a portion of the pattern layer including the bonding region, and the electronic component. The pattern layer has a groove that opens in a range between the bonding region and an edge of the opening on a surface of the pattern layer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a flexible printed circuit according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a plan view of an electronic component mounting portion in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the electronic component mounting portion in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of an electronic component mounting portion as a comparative example.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of an electronic component mounting portion in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view of an electronic component mounting portion in a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view of an electronic component mounting portion in a fourth embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hereinafter, a flexible printed circuit according to the respective embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.

The pattern layer is formed of a material having conductivity, for example, copper foil. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the first pattern layer <b>11</b> and the second pattern layer <b>12</b> are exemplified as a pattern layer related to the mounting portion of the chip component <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first pattern layer <b>11</b> is a pattern layer connected to the first electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>, which is one electrode of the chip component <b>2</b>. The first pattern layer <b>11</b> includes a pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a pattern <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>is a portion where a bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>to which the first electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is soldered is set.

In the present embodiment, the pattern width WP is parallel to the pad width W<b>1</b> and is shorter than the pad width W<b>1</b>. The respective centers of the pattern width WP and the pad width W<b>1</b> coincide with each other in the width direction in which these widths are defined.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second pattern layer <b>12</b> is a pattern layer connected to the second electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>which is the other electrode of the chip component <b>2</b>.

Like the pad <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the pad <b>12</b><i>a </i>is provided with a bonding region <b>12</b><i>d </i>to which the second electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>is soldered.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The coverlay <b>13</b> is a protective layer which is laminated on the entire surface of the base film <b>10</b>, that is, laminated on the base film <b>10</b> or the pattern layer, via an adhesive <b>14</b>, and protects the pattern layer and the like. The adhesive <b>14</b> may be an epoxy adhesive containing an epoxy resin having excellent flexibility as a main component.

In order to reduce exposure of the base film <b>10</b> and the pattern layer to the outside as much as possible, the shape of an edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>approximately follows the outer peripheral shape of the chip component <b>2</b>, and the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>does not come into contact with the chip component <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In mounting the chip component <b>2</b>, the first electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is soldered to the pad <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and similarly, the second electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>is soldered to the pad <b>12</b><i>a</i>.

In the present embodiment, the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>has the same opening shape as that of the groove <b>12</b><i>c</i>. For example, referring to the groove <b>12</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the opening shape of the groove <b>12</b><i>c </i>is a rectangle in which a groove width LG<b>1</b> is constant. The groove width LG<b>1</b> is the width in the direction in which the bonding region <b>12</b><i>d </i>and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>face each other. Meanwhile, a groove length LG<b>2</b>, which is the length in the direction perpendicular to the groove width LG<b>1</b>, has approximately the same length as the length in the direction in which the bonding region <b>12</b><i>d </i>and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>face each other.

For this reason, even when the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes from the edge <b>13</b><i>b</i>, it is difficult to reach the bonding region <b>111</b><i>d </i>set on the pad <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and the bonding region <b>112</b><i>d </i>set on the pad <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, in the region where the pattern layer is exposed in the opening <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>is continuous with the pattern <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the pad <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and the pattern <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the pad <b>112</b><i>a</i>. For this reason, if the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes from the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>and flows out onto the surface of the pattern <b>111</b><i>b </i>or the pattern <b>112</b><i>b</i>, the adhesive <b>14</b> may reach the bonding region <b>111</b><i>d </i>or the bonding region <b>112</b><i>d</i>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the pattern <b>111</b><i>b </i>is continuous with the pad <b>111</b><i>a </i>toward a central region <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the bonding region <b>111</b><i>d</i>, a portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the adhesive <b>14</b> that has flowed onto the surface of the pattern <b>111</b><i>b </i>is likely to flow into the central region <b>111</b><i>e</i>. This is also the case in a central region <b>112</b><i>e </i>of the bonding region <b>112</b><i>d </i>set on the pad <b>112</b><i>a</i>. The inflow of the adhesive <b>14</b> into the bonding region <b>111</b><i>d </i>or the like leads to narrowing of the range of the bonding region <b>111</b><i>d </i>or the like, and as a result, this may reduce the reliability of soldering performed as a later step.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, in the FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>is formed in advance in the pad <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and similarly, the groove <b>12</b><i>c </i>is formed in advance in the pad <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, even when the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes from the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>and flows out onto the surface of the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>or the pad <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the adhesive <b>14</b> flows down into the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>or the groove <b>12</b><i>c </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, thereby making it difficult to reach the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>or the bonding region <b>12</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, the effect of the FPC <b>1</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes an electronic component having an electrode. The FPC <b>1</b> includes the base film <b>10</b>, and a conductive pattern layer laminated on a portion of the base film <b>10</b> and having a bonding region to which the electrode is soldered. Further, the FPC <b>1</b> includes the coverlay <b>13</b> which is laminated on the base film <b>10</b> or the pattern layer via the adhesive <b>14</b>. The coverlay <b>13</b> has the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>for externally exposing a portion of the pattern layer including the bonding region, and the electronic component. The pattern layer has a groove that opens in a range between the bonding region and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>on the surface of the pattern layer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the electronic component corresponds to the above chip component <b>2</b>. The electrode corresponds to the above first electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the above second electrode <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The pattern layer corresponds to the above first pattern layer <b>11</b> and the above second pattern layer <b>12</b>. The bonding region corresponds to the above bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>and the above bonding region <b>12</b><i>d</i>. The groove corresponds to the above groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the above groove <b>12</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the following description regarding the effect, the portion relating to the first pattern layer <b>11</b> will be specifically discussed for the sake of simplicity, and the same will be applied to the portion relating to the second pattern layer <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Even when the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes from the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>and flows out onto the surface of the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>during the bonding of the coverlay <b>13</b> before the chip component <b>2</b> is mounted, the adhesive <b>14</b> flows down into the groove <b>11</b><i>c</i>. As a result, this makes it difficult for the adhesive <b>14</b> to reach the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>set on the pad <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and thus, this is less likely to cause the range of the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>to be narrowed by the inflow of the adhesive <b>14</b> into the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d</i>. Accordingly, when the chip component <b>2</b> is mounted as a later step, the FPC <b>1</b> makes it possible to avoid, in advance, the failure of not being possible for solder paste to be applied to a desired range of the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d</i>, thereby causing a defect in soldering thereafter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, as a structure for suppressing the inflow of the adhesive <b>14</b> into the bonding region such as the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d</i>, in the FPC <b>1</b>, only a groove such as the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>is formed in a portion of the pattern layer exposed from the opening <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, even when the chip component <b>2</b> is small or the number of mounted chip components <b>2</b> is large, it is possible to suppress the complexity of the manufacturing process of the FPC <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the present embodiment makes it possible to provide the FPC <b>1</b> for easily suppressing deterioration in the reliability of soldering when mounting an electronic component.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, assuming that the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes when the coverlay <b>13</b> is bonded, for example, it is conceivable for the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>is to be set in advance to be large in size such that the protruding adhesive <b>14</b> does not easily reach the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d</i>. However, setting the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>to be large in size means that the range of the pattern layer exposed from the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>increases, and thus this is undesirable from the viewpoint of protecting the pattern layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, in the FPC <b>1</b>, it is only necessary to form the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>in a portion of the pattern layer exposed from the opening portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, and this makes it possible to avoid a large diameter for the opening portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>. For example, when the chip component <b>2</b> is small, it is assumed that the protruding amount of the adhesive <b>14</b> is about 0.2 mm. In this case, assuming that the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>does not exist, the opening gap between a portion of the pattern layer in which the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>is set and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>needs to be 0.2 mm or more. In contrast, in the case of the FPC <b>1</b> having the groove <b>11</b><i>c</i>, this opening gap can be set to 0.2 mm or less.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, in the FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the groove may face the entire bonding region.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the FPC <b>1</b> makes it possible to guide the adhesive <b>14</b> that is about to travel from the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>via the surface of the pattern layer, to the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>more reliably, thereby making it difficult for the adhesive <b>14</b> to reach the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the opening shape of the groove may be a rectangle having a constant width in the direction in which the bonding region and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>face each other.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The FPC <b>1</b> makes it possible to easily guide the adhesive <b>14</b> to the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>without reaching a position where the adhesive <b>14</b> protrudes from the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Further, since the opening shape of the groove is simplified, this is advantageous in avoiding complication of the manufacturing process of the FPC <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the pattern layer may include a pad where a bonding region is set. In this case, the groove may be formed in the pad.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the FPC <b>1</b>, for example, since the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>is formed in the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>where the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d </i>is set, the opening shape of the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>can be set to be wide in accordance with the range of the bonding region <b>11</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the FPC <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, a portion of the outer peripheral region of the pad faces the bonding region across the groove, and this portion may be positioned below the coverlay <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the FPC <b>1</b>, for example, since the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>can be formed at a position corresponding to the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the opening shape of the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>can be set as wide as possible within a range between the bonding region and the edge <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the opening portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the description using the above figures, a case where a groove such as the groove <b>11</b><i>c </i>is formed in a pad such as the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>is exemplified. However, there may be a case where the difference between the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the pattern <b>11</b><i>b </i>is small in the pattern layer, for example, when the pattern width WP of the pattern <b>11</b><i>b </i>continuous with the pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>is set in advance to be equal to the pad width W<b>1</b> of the pad <b>11</b><i>a</i>.
