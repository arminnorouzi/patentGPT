Here, a plurality of crystallites <b>120</b> structuring the support fine particles <b>150</b> is fusion bonded to form a chained portion, thereby forming the branch <b>160</b>. Gas diffusion route to diffuse and transfer oxygen as the oxidant and/or hydrogen as the fuel to the support and metal catalyst <b>100</b> is formed by the three-dimensional arrangement of the support fine particles <b>150</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> as an example of structure model of the support and metal catalyst, the support fine particles <b>150</b> comprise four pores of a first pore surrounded by points b<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b>, b<b>5</b>, b<b>4</b>, and b<b>1</b>, where the branches link with each other (may be referred to as branching points, or merely as branch); a second pore surrounded by branching points b<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b>, b<b>3</b>, and b<b>1</b>; a third pore surrounded by branching points b<b>2</b>, b<b>3</b>, b<b>6</b>, b<b>7</b>, b<b>5</b>, and b<b>2</b>; and a fourth pore surrounded by branching points b<b>1</b>, b<b>3</b>, b<b>6</b>, b<b>7</b>, b<b>5</b>, b<b>4</b>, and b<b>1</b>. Here, when a plane surrounded by the branching points of each of the pores (first to fourth pores) is taken as the pore plane, the void <b>110</b> is a three-dimensional space surrounded by the four pore planes. The support fine particles <b>150</b> comprise a plurality of pores surrounded by a plurality of branching points in which a plurality of branches link with each other. Further, the three-dimensional spaces (voids) which are surrounded by the plurality of pores are provided sequentially, thereby structuring the support fine particles.

As the branching points b<b>1</b> to b<b>7</b>, the center of gravity of the crystallite of the metal oxide structuring the support fine particles <b>150</b> in which the branches connect with each other can be taken as the branching point, or an arbitrary point in the crystallite can be taken as the branching point.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The support fine particles <b>150</b> have a branch <b>160</b> comprising a chained portion which is structured by fusion bonding a plurality of crystallites <b>120</b> into a chain.

The 8 samples were each filled into 8 sample holders (3 mm diameter, 5 mm depth) in the measurement tool, respectively. The measurement tool filled with the target samples was set in a pressure device, and the target samples were compressed with a force of 1.1 kN. By using the electrode provided with the compression tool of the pressure device, the resistance of the target sample during compression was measured by the DC two-terminal method, and the length of the target sample was also measured at the same time. These procedures were performed with 4 or more kinds of target samples with different weight. The relation between the length of the target sample (x axis) and resistance (y axis) during compression was obtained, and extrapolation towards the y axis was performed to obtain the y intercept. The specific resistance of the target sample was obtained from the value of the y intercept, length and cross-sectional area of the compressed powder. The electric conductivity was calculated as the inverse of the specific resistance.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0080"><b>1</b>: manufacturing apparatus, <b>2</b>: burner, <b>2</b><i>a</i>: burner gas, <b>3</b>: raw material supplying unit, <b>4</b>: reaction cylinder, <b>5</b>: collector, <b>5</b><i>a</i>: filter, <b>5</b><i>b</i>: gas discharging portion, <b>6</b>: gas reservoir, <b>6</b><i>a</i>: cold gas introducing portion, <b>6</b><i>b</i>: slit, <b>6</b><i>c</i>: inner peripheral wall, <b>6</b><i>d</i>: burner insertion hole, <b>6</b><i>g</i>: cold gas, <b>7</b>: flame, <b>13</b>: outer cylinder, <b>13</b><i>a</i>: mist gas, <b>20</b>: fuel cell, <b>23</b>: raw material distribution cylinder, <b>23</b><i>a</i>: raw material solution, <b>23</b><i>b</i>: mist, <b>100</b>: support and metal catalyst, <b>110</b>: void, <b>120</b>: crystallite, <b>130</b>: metal fine particles, <b>150</b>: support fine particles, <b>160</b>: branch, <b>200</b>: fuel cell, <b>201</b>: anode, <b>202</b>: cathode, <b>203</b>: load, <b>210</b>A: gas diffusion layer on anode side, <b>210</b>K: gas diffusion layer on cathode side, <b>220</b>A: catalyst layer on anode side, <b>220</b>K: catalyst layer on cathode side</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
