Improvements in energy density are therefore imperative to exploit the complete potential of these novel environmentally benign technologies. Li&#x2014;S battery systems uses sulfur which has a theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh/g<sup>1 </sup>as cathode and exhibits a thermodynamic specific energy density of 2600 Wh/kg<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) technology is widely investigated as an attractive alternative to currently used Li-ion battery (LIB) chemistries for the PED/EV industry, due to the superior theoretical capacity and specific energy density of elemental sulfur.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the natural abundance of sulfur in the earth's crust makes it a more economical and highly attractive proposition compared to currently existing intercalation-based LIB cathode material systems. Lithium-Sulfur (Li&#x2014;S) batteries have the potential to meet the increased energy density requirements of electric vehicle (EV) technologies. However, the Li&#x2014;S system is plagued by deleterious polysulfide shuttling. Furthermore, there are limitations associated with the LSB technology including the dissolution of sulfur via formation of soluble polysulfides (i.e., poor capacity retention) and inferior electronic conductivity of sulfur (barrier to complete active materials utilization). Current generation, sulfur cathodes exhibit low reversible specific storage capacity, poor charging rates and low loading densities.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various strategies have been explored to address these challenges. Conductive carbon was introduced into the sulfur cathodes to increase the conductivity and active material utilization of the electrodes, with overall reduction in cathode resistance by high conductivity carbon black incorporation in the active material mixture. The active carbon possesses nanopores (&#x2dc;2-10 nm) with a high surface area (&#x2dc;500-2000 m<sup>2</sup>/g) absorbing the polysulfide species thereby preventing their dissolution into the electrolyte. Mesoporous carbon acts as an ordered encapsulation substrate for sulfur. There has been systematically tuned and investigated the pore sizes and pore volumes of several mesoporous carbon materials and showed that the large pore size (&#x2dc;3-22 nm) of mesoporous carbon can accommodate higher sulfur loading (&#x3e;80% S) and can exhibit enhanced cell performance under higher sulfur loading situations. Transition metal silicates, aluminum oxides, vanadium oxides, and transition-metal chalcogenides have been utilized with sulfur cathodes to decrease the polysulfide diffusion and migration. However, their electron transport property was limited by large particle size that tend to decrease the electrochemical performance. In addition to limitations in sulfur cathodes, the lithium anode side is also plagued with limitations of dendrite formation posing a safety hazard. Replacing the commonly used Li&#x2014;S battery organic electrolyte (dioxolane(DOL)/dimethoxyeethane(DME)) with a PVdF-HFP based composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) has shown ability to trap the polysulfides due to the very low electrolyte content of the CPE (&#x2dc;1-2 &#x3bc;l electrolyte/mg sulfur). The safety and cyclic life of the anode was improved using polymer and solid-state electrolytes that protect lithium metal and minimize dendrite formation on the anode, hence leading to enhanced performance of Li&#x2014;S batteries. Nevertheless, polymer and solid-state electrolytes generally suffer from low Li-ion conductivity due to the high viscous nature of polymers hindering the lithium ion transport due to high energy barrier in solid state electrolytes as well as the ceramic nature of the solid state electrolytes requiring high activation energy for Li-ion diffusion. These approaches however, lead to an increase in the utilization of active material in sulfur cathodes although, they lack complete prevention of the dissolution of polysulfide species into the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there is a need for the design and development of CFM-based cathodes to enable batteries with higher energy density and decreased capacity fade properties. Successful implementation of CFM-based sulfur cathodes in lithium-ion batteries would expedite the development of high energy density batteries.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the invention provides a complex framework material structure including a complex framework material host, which includes a complex framework material and a coating applied to the complex framework material including one or more layers that include a component selected from the group consisting of an electronic conductor, a lithium ion conductor and a functional catalyst.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the complex framework material comprises a porous carbon matrix.

The invention includes the development of CFMs, which enable chemical binding of polysulfides and catalytic promoters for polysulfide conversion. The CFMs reduce or preclude, e.g, completely, polysulfide dissolution into an electrolyte of a battery. The CFM-based architectures are used to form cathodes for use in lithium-sulfur batteries.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention includes novel high sulfur loading, directly doped sulfur architecture (DDSA), binder-free cathodes and unique polysulfide trapping agent (PTA) configurations, novel inorganic framework materials (IFM) enabling high sulfur loading and polysulfide (PS) confinement, organic complex framework materials (CFMs) serving as improved sulfur hosts using wet-chemical methods, high Li-ion conducting (LIC) and PS dissolution resistant coatings on sulfur nanoparticles, and functional catalysts (FCs) determined by Density Functional Theory (DFT) or first principles theoretical calculations for rapid conversion of PS to Li<sub>2</sub>S and Li<sub>2</sub>S to Li and S.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The invention provides high throughput, high yield, scalable and commercially inexpensive processes for synthesis of electro-chemically stable sulfur-based cathode materials/architectures.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Suitable CFMs for use in the invention include high surface area and high pore volume organic and inorganic materials, such as, a porous carbon matrix, and any highly porous high surface area, e.g., from about 2000 to about 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, YP-80F, and mixtures thereof, with the ability to bind polysulfide via carbon-sulfur linkages. In certain embodiments, the CFMs include but are not limited to carbon black (Super-P) to form carbon black (Super-P)-based CFM hosts. Suitable electronic conductors (ECs) for use in the invention include nitrogen or sulfur or phosphorus containing carbon backbone based aromatic or aliphatic ring polymers such as pyrolyzed form of poly acrylonitrile (PAN), polythiophene, polyaniline and the like. Suitable lithium ion conductors (LICs) include Li-salt reacted with PAN to form LiOPAN as well as other S, P and N containing polymers. Suitable functional catalysts (FC) include one or more of a transition metal oxide, nitride, sulfide, boride, selenide, telluride, phosphide, bismuthides, antimonide and arsenide, as well as any transition metal-containing non-oxide with an ability to bind negatively charged polysulfide species to form FC-CFM. The FC converts polysulfides to Li<sub>2</sub>S, and Li<sub>2</sub>S to Li and S, respectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, a single coating or layer of EC or LIC or FC is applied to the CFM, e.g., porous carbon matrix. In certain other embodiments, more than one coating or layer, e.g., a multilayer, of EC and/or LIC and/or FC or a combination thereof, is each separately and individually applied to the CFM, e.g., porous carbon matrix. The coated CFMs, for example, include EC-CFM, LIC-CFM, and FC-CFM nanocrystalline, porous architectures. Sulfur is then infiltrated into the CFM to form EC-CFM-S, LIC-CFM-S, and FC-CFM-S nanocrystalline, porous architectures. In certain embodiments, the nanocrystalline porous architectures include porous carbon structures. The porosity of the architectures varies and, in certain embodiments, the porosity is from 10 to 90 percent or from 50 to 60 percent. The EC-CFM-S, LIC-CFM-S and FC-CFM-S architectures include sulfur particles within at least a portion of the pores of the porous carbon structures. In certain embodiments, the sulfur loading of the CFM architectures is from 8 to 18 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments, the coated EC-CFM, LIC-CFM, and FC-CFM nanocrystalline, porous architectures are doped. A dopant, such as a nanostructured dopant, is added to the coating. In other embodiments, the coated EC-CFM, LIC-CFM, and FC-CFM nanocrystalline, porous architectures are undoped. Various conventional/traditional doping techniques are known in the art. In certain embodiments, using suitable doping techniques, such as a facile solid diffusion technique, a dopant is employed to interact with the LIC and/or EC coating. Suitable dopants include Ti, Au, Ag, Al, Mg, Ca, F, Nb, B, V, N, P, S, Se, Te, Mn, Sn, Bi, Ni, Co, Fe or any element from the transition metal series or Group IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA and VIIA, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The CFM host in the absence of the aforementioned coating(s) exhibits poor electrical conductivity, low surface area and pore volume, as well as low and higher order polysulfides. Whereas, the CFMs having the aforementioned EC coating(s) exhibit one or more of improved electrical conductivity, high surface area and pore volume, as well as reduced polysulfide dissolution and high areal capacity. The EC-CFM-S demonstrates an ability to trap the polysulfide, thereby improving the areal capacity. The LIC-CFM-S having the aforementioned LIC coating(s) exhibits one or more of improved ionic conductivity, high surface area and pore volume, as well as high areal capacity. The FC-CFM-S having the aforementioned FC coating(s) exhibits one or more of high surface area and pore volume, as well as a reduction or prevention of polysulfide dissolution and high areal capacity. All of these CFM systems have inherent polysulfide trapping agent (PTA) configurations, and hence, they demonstrate an improvement for confining polysulfide species, and the ability to accommodate high sulfur loadings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In certain embodiments, the CFM structure/architecture has an LIC coating deposited on a high surface area CFM (LIC-HCFM), wherein sulfur is infiltrated into the CFM to form a LIC-HCFM-S nanocrystalline, porous architecture.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The electronic conductor (EC) and lithium ion conductor (LIC) are prepared using conventional wet chemical and low temperature synthesis approaches. The ECs and LICs used to coat the CFMs exhibit high electronic conductivities (&#x3e;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/cm) and room temperature lithium ion conductivities (&#x3e;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm), respectively. The porous metal oxide and non-oxide functional catalyst (FC) (&#x3e;150 m<sup>2</sup>/g) capable of catalyzing the polysulfide reduction and oxidation are generated using a simple room-temperature method. In certain embodiments, the oxide and non-oxide functional catalysts (FC) are prepared using dry and wet chemical methods. The EC-CFM, LIC-CFM and FC-CFM are then infiltrated with sulfur using low-temperature under vacuum/inert conditions to form EC-CFM-S, LIC-CFM-S and FC-CFM-S. These EC-CFM-S, LIC-CFM-S and FC-CFM-S architectures exhibit a strong binding between the carbon atoms from the CFM hosts and the sulfur molecules forming &#x2014;C&#x2014;S&#x2014; bonds. The creation of these &#x2014;C&#x2014;S&#x2014; bonds inhibits polysulfide dissolution by binding them, as is evident from XPS analysis of the sulfur infiltrated CFMs.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Lithium-sulfur cathodes according to the invention consist of a uniquely designed CFM coated with a Li-ion conductor to form LIC-CFM. The LIC-CFM includes one or more porous carbon-based materials coated with a novel nitrogen containing hydrocarbon or carbonaceous polymer such as polyacrylonitride (PAN) modified by reaction with LiNO<sub>3 </sub>resulting in a Li-ion conducting coating (LiOPAN) combined with elemental sulfur (S). The composite LIC-CFM containing sulfur cathode is suitable for use as a stable, high cycle life and high capacity cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li&#x2014;S) batteries.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The PAN polymer on the surface of the porous carbon based CFM is pyrolyzed, e.g., in argon gas at a temperature of 240&#xb0; C., in the presence of LiNO<sub>3 </sub>and elemental sulfur (S), which leads to the formation of a cyclized PAN polymer network with structural changes including Li-ions attached to the carbon and nitrogen backbone on the surface of porous carbon matrix to form a LiOPAN coating. In certain embodiments, the entire synthesis of the cyclized PAN and LiNO<sub>3 </sub>to form LiOPAN and all the chemical reactions are executed inside a sealed swagelok container containing a dry mixture of the composite materials. Two major changes that occur simultaneously during PAN pyrolysis process on the surface of porous carbon matrix are the following: (i) PAN converting into N-type PAN, namely, nitrogen doped PAN (N-type PAN) forming LiOPAN after decomposition of LiNO<sub>3</sub>, (ii) N-type LiOPAN converting into sulfurized PAN with long-range N-type bonds, the N-type PAN undergoes sulfurization, e.g., at a temperature of 240&#xb0; C., and it is in turn, transformed into sulfurized PAN due to a cyclization reaction, which creates conjugated polymer structure with long-range N-type bonds. Hence, the LiOPAN coated porous carbon matrix is converted to sulfurized LiOPAN coating on porous carbon matrix and the sulfurized LiOPAN coating also further develops cross-linked networks on the surface and within the bulk of the porous carbon matrix. In addition, the heat treatment, e.g., at a temperature of 240&#xb0; C., results in the creation of carbon-sulfur linkages leading to trapping of ensuing polysulfide species formed during the reaction with Li-ions when cycled in the Li&#x2014;S battery. Thus, the sulfurized LiOPAN coating serves to effectively trap polysulfides while also serving as Li-ion conducting channels with the electron conducting coatings and the FCs together providing electron transport and catalytic features enabling conversion of polysulfides to Li<sub>2</sub>S and back to Li and S.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">These C&#x2014;S linkages are formed with the sulfur within the pores and on the surface of the porous carbon matrix filled with vaporized sulfur during vapor phase sulfur infiltration. Hence, the final product of S cathode composite material consists of a uniform electrically conductive network of sulfurized PAN as well as Li-ion reacted with PAN to form LiOPAN on the surface and within the pores of the porous carbon matrix already filled with nano-sized sulfur. The novel LiOPAN coated CFM-S cathode provides S cathode stability, high capacity and cycle life improvements due to the synergetic effect of sulfurized PAN network on porous carbon matrix. The sulfurized LiOPAN coated porous carbon-based S cathode composite material can also be synthesized in large-scale (few kilograms per batch, depending on the size of the swagelok container). The production is also possible with low cost using vapor phase sulfur infiltration method. Commercial porous carbon materials used as porous carbon matrix for PAN coating and sulfur infiltration comprise Super P with surface area &#x2248;62 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Timcal super P), activated carbon with surface area &#x2248;2004 m<sup>2</sup>/g (YP-80F, Kuraray coal) and a mixture of Super P and YP-80F.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, fabrication of crack free electrodes with targeted porosity (&#x2dc;50-60%) and a target sulfur loading of (&#x2dc;4-6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of sulfur cathode are provided to facilitate and achieve efficient charge transport in the electrode. Attainment of crack free S cathode is critical and needed to improve the S utilization rate and confer cycling stability of the assembled Li&#x2014;S cell.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the invention, slurry coatings and 3D-printed (3DP) architectures are also used to form the cathodes. The slurry coatings are produced using conventional slurry coating methods. The 3D-printed architectures of the CFMs, e.g., EC-CFM-S, LIC-CFM-S and FC-CFM-S, are produced by conventional 3D-printing techniques to form the CFM-based cathodes. A composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) membrane replaces liquid electrolyte (e.g, CPE as electrolyte). In certain embodiments, a lithium anode (+), CPE and sulfur cathode (+) form a stacked configuration. The CPE is positioned (e.g., sandwiched) between the lithium anode and the sulfur cathode. In accordance with the invention, the inventors have found for 3DP-LIC-CFM-S of nanocrystalline porous architecture with CPE, for which the CPE has very low electrolyte (E)/sulfur (S) ratio and the 3DP-LIC-CFM-S separator has no polysulfide dissolution after cycling, as well as exhibiting very high areal capacity. The CFM-based cathodes of the invention within a lithium ion battery provide a lithium-sulfur battery system with enhanced performance and properties.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, a pouch cell is fabricated as follows. A single-sided Li foil is applied, e.g., calendered, onto a Cu foil as the Li anode for the single layer pouch cell. The separator for the pouch cell is a battery separator membrane or film, such as, but not limited to Celgard 2400. The single-sided CFM-S based cathode, separator, and single-sided Li anode are arranged in a stacked configuration, such that the separator is &#x201c;sandwiched&#x201d; between the S cathode and the Li anode, as the single layer pouch cell. In certain other embodiments, a multi-layer pouch cell is fabricated. A double-sided Li foil is applied, e.g., calendered, onto a Cu foil as the Li anode of a pouch cell. A double-sided CFM-S based cathode, separator, and double-sided Li anode are stacked together with two pieces or layers of the single-sided CFM-S based cathode as the outer layer for the multi-layer pouch cells. An electrolyte, such as, but not limited to LiTFSI, is used. The electrolyte injection and pouch cell sealing are carried out, such as, in a glovebox.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiment, the CFM architectures are tested in coin cells and pouch cells under lean electrolyte conditions of 3-4 &#x3bc;l/mg of electrolyte (E) to sulfur (S) ratios showing feasibility.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In certain embodiments, the LIC-CFM-S is prepared by mixing the LIC-CFM and sulfur in a weight ratio from 10:90 to 20:80.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hybrid composite solid polymer electrolytes (HSE) are synthesized by mixing sulfur, CFM and functional monomer in a weight ratio from 70:20:10 to 80:10:10, to yield sulfur rich-CFM with sulfur polymer (S-CFM).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain embodiments, CFM-S is prepared using a synthetic polymer binder (SPB) to produce a cathode.

The STEM image of the CNF matt after sulfur electrodeposition (DDSA-PTA) showed that the sulfur particles were of uniform size with an average diameter of 5-7 &#x3bc;m and the CNF matt was uniformly coated with the sulfur particles. The use of electrodeposition aided in preparing uniform sulfur deposits on the CNF matt.

The discharge capacity was calculated based on the weight of sulfur in the electrode measured from EDS. The DDSA-PTA electrodes exhibited a relatively stable discharge capacity during electrochemical charge-discharge cycling. The first and 100<sup>th </sup>cycle discharge capacity of the DDSA-PTA (sample 1) is 1152 mAh/g and 925 mAh/g, respectively corresponding to an areal capacity of &#x2dc;11.29 mAh/cm<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, the first and 100<sup>th </sup>cycle discharge capacity of the DDSA-PTA (sample 2) is 1188 mAh/g and 870 mAh/g, respectively giving an area capacity of &#x2dc;10.71 mAh/cm<sup>2</sup>. Correspondingly the DDSA-PTA (sample 1) and DDSA-PTA (sample 2) electrodes exhibit very low fade rate of 0.20%/cycle and 0.26%/cycle, respectively while additionally exhibiting very high coulombic efficiency of &#x2dc;99.6%. The observation of slight fade in capacity is due to the formation of insulating Li<sub>2</sub>S that is not completely oxidized upon charging and not due to polysulfide dissolution. It is deduced that the sulfur electrodeposited onto CNF mattes by the electrochemical method is responsible for the stable electrochemical cycling performance due to its physical and chemical interactions with polysulfides. In addition, the sulfur electrodeposition at the solid/liquid (CNF/aqueous thiourea solution) interface can ensure intimate contact of sulfur particles with the CNF mattes, effectively confining lithium polysulfides from dissolving into the organic liquid electrolyte. The rate capability of the DDSA-PTA (sample 3) electrode at different current densities from 0.1 C to 1 C rate was determined. A reversible capacity of &#x2dc;825 mAh/g was obtained at a current density of 0.2 C rate, owing to the good electrical conductivity of the CNF (1.81&#xb1;0.17&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>S/cm) and contact with the uniformly dispersed S. The value of the discharge capacity was &#x2dc;589 and 492 mAh/g for 0.5 C and 1 C rate, respectively, and the discharge capacity returned to &#x2dc;918 mAh/g at 0.1 C rate, the electrode almost recovering its original capacity.

The S2p XPS spectra was obtained for the DDSA-PTA (sample 1 and sample 2) separators collected after 100 cycles. The commercial sulfur separator after 100 cycles exhibited S2p peaks at 168.53 eV<sup>22</sup>, 167.14 eV<sup>1, 23 </sup>and 163.50 eV<sup>24 </sup>corresponding to CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> groups from the LiTFSI salt, lower and higher order polysulfides, respectively. However, the DDSA-PTA separators after cycling showed significant reduction in peak intensities at 167.14 eV and 163.50 eV confirming that there is almost negligible polysulfide dissolution in the DDSA-PTA system. Similarly, the commercial sulfur electrodes (sample 1 and sample 2) after cycling exhibited S2p peaks at 168.53 eV, 167.14 eV and 163.50 eV corresponding to CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> groups from the LiTFSI salt, lower and higher order polysulfides, respectively. However, the DDSA-PTA electrodes after cycling showed significant reduction in peak intensities at 163.50 eV indicating the absence of higher order polysulfides on the DDSA-PTA cathode, which could be attributed to the polysulfide reduction property of Au. XPS results on the separators collected after 100 cycles of other DDSA-PTA electrodes were compared to the commercial sulfur cycled separator after 100 cycles. The UV-VIS spectroscopic analysis conducted on the DOL-DME solvent containing polysulfides added to the CNF matt, the DDSA and DDSA-PTA samples correspondingly also revealed the absence of higher order polysulfides in the polysulfide solution immersed in DDSA-PTA electrode.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">The DDSA-PTA electrodes were further studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis before and after cycling. The Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit used to fit the data showed that the experimental data fits well with the fitted data using the equivalent circuit. The Nyquist plots showed two semicircles, corresponding to the resistance of passivation film (interface resistance-R<sub>i</sub>) of the discharge product in the high-frequency region and the charge transfer resistance R<sub>ct </sub>in the medium-frequency area. The R<sub>ct </sub>decreased considerably after cycling due to complete wetting of the electrode by the electrolyte and the rearrangement of the migrated active materials to the electrochemically favorable position.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The interfacial resistance R<sub>i </sub>of the pristine as well as the cells after 1<sup>st </sup>and 100<sup>th </sup>cycle remained almost constant at &#x2dc;20 &#x3a9;, before and after the first cycle while the charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) undergoes significant change with lithiation (after first cycle). This reduction in R<sub>ct </sub>is likely due to the immobilization of polysulfides by the Au nanoparticles, thereby restricting the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode arising from the deposition of the low order polysulfides. All these electrochemical characterizations further suggest that the modest decoration of the cathode by the electrodeposition of Au nanoparticles has a profound influence on the improvement of the electrochemical performance of Li&#x2014;S batteries.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Summary</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0084">A simple electrodeposition technique was implemented to prepare PTA coated DDSA electrodes that were used as free-standing cathodes in Li&#x2014;S batteries.

The PTA-DDSA electrodes exhibited very low fade rate of 0.23&#xb1;0.03%/cycle and significantly reduced polysulfides when examined by XPS and UV-VIS spectroscopy. The EIS impedance analysis of the DDSA-PTA before and after cycling also suggests polysulfide immobilization by Au nanoparticles.
