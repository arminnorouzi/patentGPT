level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0001">The present invention relates to a reaction agent for amide reaction and a method of producing an amide compound using the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0002">Conventionally, amide compounds represented by peptides have been used in a wide variety of fields, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and functional foods. Development of synthetic methods thereof has been diligently pursued as an important research goal in synthetic chemistry (NPL 1 to 6). However, there are few truly effective catalysts or reactants other than carboxylic acid activators for the amidation reaction, which is the most important reaction in peptide synthesis. Therefore, it is unavoidable to use a reaction mode that forms by-products, and thus, peptide synthesis, which involves repeating multi-stage reactions, is extremely inefficient from the viewpoint of atom economy (atomic yield). The amount of by-products is large, and there are few effective purification means. As a result, the cost of disposal of by-products and purification constitutes most of the necessary costs for peptide synthesis, and is the largest obstacle to development in this field.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0003">In peptide synthesis, which uses amino acids or derivatives thereof as starting materials, it is desirable for the amidation reaction to proceed with high stereoselectivity. Enzyme reactions in the body are examples of highly stereoselective amidation reactions. For example, in the body, peptides are synthesized with extremely high stereoselectivity through sophisticated use of enzymes and hydrogen bonds. However, enzyme reactions are not suitable for mass production, requiring enormous financial and time costs when applied to synthetic chemistry.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0004">In synthetic chemistry, amidation reactions using catalysts have been examined, but in conventional means, the amide bond is formed primarily through the method of activating carboxylic acid, such that racemization occurs quickly, whereby synthesizing a peptide with high stereoselectivity and efficiency is difficult.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0005">According to conventional methods, it is very difficult to link an additional amino acid or derivative to a peptide comprising a plurality of amino acids or derivatives thereof (chemical ligation) or link two or more peptides via amide bonds. As an amidation method for ligation to such peptides, there are known a method for ligation by using an amino acid having a sulfur atom to utilize the high reactivity of the sulfur atom (NPL 7) and a method for ligation by synthesizing an amino acid hydroxyamine to utilize the high reactivity of the hydroxyamine (NPL 8). However, in the former method, it is difficult to synthesize amino acids having a sulfur atom, and in the latter method, hydroxyamine synthesis involving several steps is necessary. Both methods are time-consuming and costly and have a disadvantage in efficiency.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0006">The present inventors have developed, as techniques for synthesizing an amide compound in a highly chemoselective manner: a method of amidating a carboxylic acid/ester compound having a hydroxy group at the 3-position in the presence of a specific metal catalyst (PTL 1); a method of using a hydroxyamino/imino compound as an amino acid precursor and amidating it in the presence of a specific metal catalyst, and then reducing them in the presence of a specific metal catalyst (PTL 2); and a method of amidating a carboxylic acid/ester compound in the presence of specific metal catalyst (PTL 3).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature (PTL)</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[PTL 1] WO 2017/204144 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">[PTL 2] WO 2018/199146 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">[PTL 3] WO 2018/199147 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Literature (NPL)</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">[NPL 1] Annu.

The silane compound(s) (A) and/or (B), as well as the second silane compound optionally used, is deemed to be activated by the reaction accelerator coexisting in the reaction system, resulting in the acceleration of the amidation reaction.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0268">For the details of such reaction accelerators, various publications can be referred to, such as Blandez et al., Catalysis Science &#x26; Technology, 2015, Vol. 5, pp. 2167-2173; Bonar-Law et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, Vol. 31, No. 46, pp. 6725-6728; Corru et al., Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 1976, Vol. 114, pp. 135-144; Davis et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1995, Vol. 36, No. 18, pp. 3269-3272; Dunne et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2011, Vol. 133, No. 42, pp. 16782-16785; Horner et al., Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 1985, Vol. 282, pp. 155-174.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0000">*Reaction procedure:</p><p id="p-0266" num="0269">Amidation by the production method according to the present invention can be carried out by contacting the reactant compound(s) with the silane compound(s) (A) and/or (B), and optionally with the second silane compound, the aminosilane catalyst, the Lewis acid catalyst, the phosphorus compound, and/or the other ingredients if used. The order of contacting these components is not limited, and all may be mixed simultaneously or sequentially in any order. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, the following procedures.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0270">For example, if there are no other carboxyl groups, amino groups, and/or other reactive groups than the carboxyl and amino groups being the target of the desired amidation reaction, or if such other carboxyl groups, amino groups, or other reactive groups are protected with protective groups, the order of contact is not particularly limited. However, from the standpoint of reaction efficiency, it is preferred to mix the reactant compounds and the silane compound(s) (A) and/or (B) simultaneously, optionally with the second silane compound, the amino silane catalyst, the Lewis acid catalyst, the phosphorus compound, and/or the other components. When each of other carboxyl groups and/or amino groups than the target carboxyl and amino groups is protected with a protective group, it would be necessary to carry out a protection step to introduce the protective group before the amidation reaction, and also a deprotection step to remove the protective group after the amidation reaction.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0271">On the other hand, when, as in the case of Embodiment (3), the terminal carboxyl group of the first amino acid or peptide (3-1) is reacted with the terminal carboxyl group of the second amino acid or peptide (3-2), the reaction may preferably be carried out in the following order: (a) the first amino acid or peptide (3-1) is contacted with the silane compound(s) (A) and/or (B); (b) the second silane compound optionally used is then brought into contact; and (c) the second amino acid or peptide (3-2) is then brought into contact. This procedure allows selective amidation reaction to occur between the terminal carboxyl group of the first amino acid or peptide (3-1) and the terminal amino group of the second amino acid or peptide (3-2) without protecting other carboxyl and/or amino groups of each reactant compound that are not subject to the amidation reaction. This reaction procedure is highly desirable from the standpoint of efficiency since it eliminates the need for a protection step to introduce a protecting group before the amidation reaction and a deprotection step to remove the protecting group after the amidation reaction. In this reaction procedure, the timing of addition of optionally used components (such as the aminosilane catalyst, the Lewis acid catalyst, the phosphorus compound, and/or the other ingredients) is not restricted and can be added at any stage.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0272">The silane compound(s) (A) and/or (B), as well as the second silane compound optionally used, may be either added to the reaction system directly as the final compound or may be generated in the reaction system by reacting raw material compounds for the desired compound in the system. For example, when a silyl imidazole compound (e.g., dimethylsilyl(2-methyl)imidazole) is used as the second silane compound, the desired silylimidazole compound can be synthesized by adding a corresponding silyl halide (e.g., silyl chloride) and a corresponding imidazole compound (e.g., 2-methylimidazole) in the system and causing them to react each other. In this case, since the amount of hydrogen halide (e.g., hydrochloric acid) generated is equivalent to the amount of the silyl imidazole compound, it is necessary to use two or more equivalents of the imidazole compound to the silyl halide. A person skilled in the art can select and implement various methods for the in-system synthesis of such silane compounds based on technical common knowledge.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0273">From the viewpoint of increasing reaction efficiency, amidation may be carried out in an organic solvent. The type of the organic solvent is not particularly limited, examples thereof including: aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene; pentane; ethers such as petroleum ether, 1-methyltetrahydrofuran (1-MeTHF), diisopropylether (i-Pr<sub>2</sub>O), diethylether (Et<sub>2</sub>O), cyclopentylmethylether (CPME): esters such as ethyl acetate (AcOEt); and organic acids such as acetic acid.
