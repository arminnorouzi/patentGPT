For example, therapeutic antibodies in aqueous solution are prone to degradation, aggregation or undesired chemical modifications, unless the solution is formulated properly. The stability of an antibody in liquid formulation depends on the kinds of excipients used in the formulation, as well as the amounts and proportions of the excipients relative to one another. In addition, viscosity and visual quality must be taken into consideration when preparing an aqueous antibody formulation. Thus, when formulating a therapeutic antibody, considerable care must be taken to devise a formulation that remains stable, contains an adequate concentration of antibody, has a suitable viscosity, and can conveniently be administered to patients.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Anti-C5 antibodies are known in the art. However, there remains a need in the art for novel pharmaceutical formulations comprising anti-C5 antibodies which are sufficiently stable and suitable for administration to patients, e.g., patients with complement-associated disorders, such as PNH or aHUS, who are at risk of substantial morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved formulations and methods for treating patients with complement-associated disorders.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided herein were stable, highly-concentrated, aqueous solutions of an anti-C5 antibody, such as ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) (also known as &#x201c;antibody BNJ441&#x201d; and &#x201c;ALXN1210&#x201d;), as well as methods for making and using the formulations. The disclosure provides, among other aspects, formulation conditions suitable for maintaining over considerable time the physical and functional stability of ravulizumab in high concentration solutions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The benefits of stable, highly-concentrated aqueous solutions of an anti-C5 antibody (e.g., ravulizumab), are numerous. First, for therapeutic applications which require the antibody to be administered to a patient in a small volume, therapeutic efficacy often turns on the amount of antibody that can be administered in that small volume.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, methods for producing the aqueous solutions described herein do not require a lyophilization step, nor do the featured high concentration aqueous solutions need to be reconstituted from lyophilized material. The instantly featured high concentration antibody solutions provide several advantages over reconstituted lyophilized antibody formulations. First, medical practitioners must locally reconstitute lyophilized antibody solutions aseptically, which increases the opportunity for microbial contamination of the solution prior to administration. In addition, reconstitution requires considerable care to be certain that all the solids contained in the reconstitution vessel were properly dissolved in solution. The high concentration aqueous solutions provided herein thus provide the medical practitioner, caregiver, and/or patient with a fast, easy, safe, and efficient means for delivering a therapeutic antibody to a patient in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other benefits of high concentration formulations include, e.g., manufacturing cost savings from decreasing bulk storage space and/or the number of product fills. In addition, the ability to produce a product having a longer shelf-life will ultimately require fewer production runs, which ultimately reduces cost for the manufacturer and consumer of the highly-concentrated therapeutic antibody.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary anti-C5 antibody is ravulizumab comprising the heavy and light chains having the sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 14 and 11, respectively, or antigen binding fragments and variants thereof. In other embodiments, the antibody comprises the heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or variable regions (VRs) of ravulizumab. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the antibody comprises the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 domains of the heavy chain variable (VH) region of ravulizumab having the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:12, and the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 domains of the light chain variable (VL) region of ravulizumab having the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:8. In another embodiment, the antibody comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 heavy chain sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:19, 18, and 3, respectively, and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 light chain sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:4, 5, and 6, respectively.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the antibody comprises VH and VL regions having the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO:8, respectively.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the antibody comprises a heavy chain constant region as set forth in SEQ ID NO:13.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the antibody comprises a variant human Fc constant region that binds to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), wherein the variant human Fc CH3 constant region comprises Met-429-Leu and Asn-435-Ser substitutions at residues corresponding to methionine 428 and asparagine 434 of a native human IgG Fc constant region, each in EU numbering.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the antibody comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 heavy chain sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:19, 18, and 3, respectively, and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 light chain sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:4, 5, and 6, respectively and a variant human Fc constant region that binds to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), wherein the variant human Fc CH3 constant region comprises Met-429-Leu and Asn-435-Ser substitutions at residues corresponding to methionine 428 and asparagine 434 of a native human IgG Fc constant region, each in EU numbering.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the antibody competes for binding with, and/or binds to the same epitope on C5 as, the above-mentioned antibodies. In another embodiment, the antibody has at least about 90% variable region amino acid sequence identity with the above-mentioned antibodies (e.g., at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% variable region identity with SEQ ID NO:12 and/or SEQ ID NO:8).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the antibody binds to human C5 at pH 7.4 and 25&#xb0; C. with an affinity dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is in the range 0.1 nM&#x2264;K<sub>D</sub>&#x2264;1 nM. In another embodiment, the antibody binds to human C5 at pH 6.0 and 25&#xb0; C. with a K<sub>D</sub>&#x2265;10 nM. In yet another embodiment, the [(K<sub>D </sub>of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof for human C5 at pH 6.0 and at 25&#xb0; C.)/(K<sub>D </sub>of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof for human C5 at pH 7.4 and at 25&#xb0; C.)] of the antibody is greater than 25.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, a stable aqueous solution is provided (e.g., a sterile solution). In another embodiment, the stable aqueous solution comprises one or more additional agents (e.g., stabilizing agents, buffering agents, surfactants, and/or preservatives). For example, in one embodiment, the stable aqueous solution comprises a stabilizer. Exemplary stabilizers include, but are not limited to polyols, sugars (e.g., sucrose or trehalose), amino acids (e.g., arginine), amines, and salting out salts. In one embodiment, the solution comprises at least one stabilizing agent at a concentration of 2-10%, inclusive. In another embodiment, the solution comprises at least one or more stabilizing agents at a concentration of 10 mM to 50 mM, inclusive. In another embodiment, the stabilizing agent is present in the solution at a concentration of at least, or equal to, 20 mM. In another embodiment, the stabilizing agent is present in the solution at a concentration of at least, or equal to, 25 mM. In another embodiment, the stabilizing agent is present in the solution at a concentration of at least, or equal to, 50 mM. In another embodiment, the solution comprises 5% sucrose. In another embodiment, the solution comprises between about 30 mg/mL to 60 mg/mL of sucrose (e.g., about 30 mg/mL, 31 mg/mL, 32 mg/mL, 33 mg/mL, 34 mg/ml, 35 mg/ml, 36 mg/mL, 37 mg/mL, 38 mg/mL, 39 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, 41 mg/mL, 42 mg/mL, 43 mg/mL, 44 mg/mL, 45 mg/mL, 46 mg/mL, 47 mg/mL, 48 mg/mL, 49 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 51 mg/mL, 52 mg/mL, 53 mg/mL, 54 mg/mL, 55 mg/mL, 56 mg/mL, 57 mg/mL, 58 mg/mL, 59 mg/mL, or 60 mg/mL).

The solutions can be used in a variety of therapeutic applications, such as methods for treating or preventing complement-associated disorders. While in no way intended to be limiting, exemplary solutions, formulations, therapeutic kits, and methods for making and using any of the foregoing are elaborated on below and are exemplified in the working Examples.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. Definitions</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0094">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by the skilled artisan. Although any methods and compositions similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and compositions are described herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0095">The singular form &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0096">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d;, particularly in reference to a given quantity or number, is meant to encompass deviations within plus or minus ten percent (&#xb1;10%), (e.g., &#xb1;5%).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0097">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutical formulation&#x201d; refers to preparations which are in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredients to be unequivocally effective, and which contain no additional components which are significantly toxic to the subjects to which the formulation would be administered.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0098">As used herein, an &#x201c;aqueous&#x201d; pharmaceutical composition is a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use, wherein the aqueous carrier is water. A composition suitable for pharmaceutical use may be sterile, homogeneous and/or isotonic. Aqueous pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared directly in an aqueous form and/or may be reconstituted from a lyophilisate.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0099">An &#x201c;isotonic&#x201d; formulation is one which has essentially the same osmotic pressure as human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 275 to 350 mOsm/kg. The term &#x201c;hypotonic&#x201d; describes a formulation with an osmotic pressure below that of human blood. Correspondingly, the term &#x201c;hypertonic&#x201d; is used to describe a formulation with an osmotic pressure above that of human blood. Isotonicity can be measured, for example, using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer. A &#x201c;tonicity agent&#x201d; is a compound which renders the formulation isotonic.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0100">As used herein, the &#x201c;osmolality&#x201d; of a solution is the number of osmoles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Osmolality is a measure of the number of particles present in solution and is independent of the size or weight of the particles. It can be measured only by use of a property of the solution that is dependent only on the particle concentration. These properties are vapour pressure depression, freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure, and are collectively referred to as colligative properties.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0101">A &#x201c;sterile&#x201d; formulation is aseptic or free or essentially free from all living microorganisms and their spores.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0102">A &#x201c;stable&#x201d; formulation, as used herein, is one in which the antibody therein essentially retains its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) and Jones, A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 10: 29-90 (1993). Stability of the anti-C5 antibody formulations can be measured at selected temperatures after selected time periods. For example, an increase in aggregate formation following storage is an indicator for instability of an aqueous anti-C5 antibody formulation. In addition to aggregate formation, retention of original clarity, color and odor throughout shelf life are indicators utilized to monitor stability of the aqueous anti-C5 antibody solutions described herein.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0103">An antibody &#x201c;retains its physical stability&#x201d; in a pharmaceutical formulation if it shows substantially no signs of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation upon visual examination of color and/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0104">The term &#x201c;aggregation&#x201d; refers to the assembly of native, folded proteins to from aggregates containing non-native structures. Aggregation can occur even under physiological, non-denaturing conditions, and is often irreversible, resulting in non-native aggregates that are inactive, and sometimes immunogenic and toxic.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0105">The phrase &#x201c;low to undetectable levels of aggregation&#x201d; as used herein refers to samples containing no more than about 5%, no more than about 4%, no more than about 3%, no more than about 2%, no more than about 1% and no more than about 0.5% aggregation by weight of protein as measured by gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC), high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) or static light scattering (SLS) techniques.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0106">An antibody &#x201c;retains its chemical stability&#x201d; in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the antibody is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the antibody. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g., clipping), deamidation, racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination and disulfide exchange which can be evaluated using known techniques, for example, size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS), and/or ion-exchange chromatography.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0107">An antibody &#x201c;retains its biological activity&#x201d; in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the antibody in a pharmaceutical formulation is biologically active for its intended purpose. For example, biological activity is retained if the biological activity of the antibody in the pharmaceutical formulation is within about 30%, about 20%, or about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared (e.g., as determined in an antigen binding assay). Herein, &#x201c;biological activity&#x201d; of a monoclonal antibody refers to the ability of the antibody to bind to antigen. It can further include antibody binding to antigen and resulting in a measurable biological response which can be measured in vitro or in vivo.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0108">&#x201c;Shelf-life&#x201d; of a pharmaceutical product, e.g., an aqueous solution comprising an anti-C5 antibody is the length of time the product is stored before decomposition occurs. For example, shelf-life may be defined as the time for decomposition of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 5%, or 10% of the product.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0109">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; describes polypeptides comprising at least one antibody derived antigen binding site (e.g., VH/VL region or Fv, or CDR). Antibodies include known forms of antibodies. For example, the antibody can be a human antibody, a humanized antibody, a bispecific antibody, or a chimeric antibody. The antibody also can be a Fab, Fab&#x2032;2, ScFv, SMIP, Affibody&#xae;, nanobody, or a domain antibody. The antibody also can be of any of the following isotypes: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgAsec, IgD, and IgE. The antibody may be a naturally occurring antibody or may be an antibody that has been altered by a protein engineering technique (e.g., by mutation, deletion, substitution, conjugation to a non-antibody moiety). For example, an antibody may include one or more variant amino acids (compared to a naturally occurring antibody) which changes a property (e.g., a functional property) of the antibody. For example, numerous such alterations are known in the art which affect, e.g., half-life, effector function, and/or immune responses to the antibody in a patient. The term antibody also includes artificial or engineered polypeptide constructs which comprise at least one antibody-derived antigen binding site.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0110">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;specific binding,&#x201d; &#x201c;selective binding,&#x201d; &#x201c;selectively binds,&#x201d; and &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined antigen but not to other antigens. Typically, the antibody (i) binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, such as approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or even lower when determined by, e.g., surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE&#xae; 2000 surface plasmon resonance instrument using the predetermined antigen, e.g., C5, as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand, or Scatchard analysis of binding of the antibody to antigen positive cells, and (ii) binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, an antibody that &#x201c;specifically binds to human C5&#x201d; refers to an antibody that binds to soluble or cell bound human C5 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M or 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M or even lower.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0111">The term &#x201c;surface plasmon resonance&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).

In one embodiment, the patient is a human patient (e.g., a human patient having a complement-associated condition).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0115">The terms &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; as used herein, refer to therapeutic measures described herein. The methods of &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; employ administration to a subject the combination disclosed herein in order to cure, delay, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder or recurring disease or disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0116">As used herein, &#x201c;effective treatment&#x201d; refers to treatment producing a beneficial effect, e.g., amelioration of at least one symptom of a disease or disorder. A beneficial effect can take the form of an improvement over baseline, i.e., an improvement over a measurement or observation made prior to initiation of therapy according to the method. Effective treatment may refer to alleviation of at least one symptom of a disease or condition.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0117">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of an agent that provides the desired biological, therapeutic, and/or prophylactic result. That result can be reduction, amelioration, palliation, lessening, delaying, and/or alleviation of one or more of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease or condition, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. In one example, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; is the amount of a stable aqueous solution to alleviate at least one symptom of a disease or condition. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0118">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;induction&#x201d; and &#x201c;induction phase&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to the first phase of treatment.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0119">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;maintenance&#x201d; and &#x201c;maintenance phase&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to the second phase of treatment.

Anti-C5 Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0120">Anti-C5 antibodies (or VH/VL domains derived therefrom) suitable for use in the invention can be generated using methods well known in the art. Alternatively, art recognized anti-C5 antibodies can be used. Antibodies that compete with any of these art-recognized antibodies for binding to C5 also can be used.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0121">An exemplary anti-C5 antibody is ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) comprising heavy and light chains having the sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs:14 and 11, respectively, or antigen binding fragments and variants thereof. Ravulizumab (also known as BNJ441 and ALXN1210) is described in PCT/US2015/019225 and U.S. Pat. No. 9,079,949, the teachings or which are hereby incorporated by reference. The terms ULTOMIRIS&#xae;, ravulizumab, BNJ441, and ALXN1210 may be used interchangeably throughout this document. Ravulizumab selectively binds to human complement protein C5, inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b during complement activation. This inhibition prevents the release of the proinflammatory mediator C5a and the formation of the cytolytic pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC) C5b-9 while preserving the proximal or early components of complement activation (e.g., C3 and C3b) essential for the opsonization of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0122">In other embodiments, the antibody comprises the heavy and light chain CDRs or variable regions of ravulizumab.

In order to determine the effect of an anti-C5 antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, on classical complement pathway-mediated hemolysis in a serum test solution in vitro, for example, sheep erythrocytes coated with hemolysin or chicken erythrocytes sensitized with anti-chicken erythrocyte antibody are used as target cells. The percentage of lysis is normalized by considering 100% lysis equal to the lysis occurring in the absence of the inhibitor. In some embodiments, the classical complement pathway is activated by a human IgM antibody, for example, as utilized in the Wieslab&#xae; Classical Pathway Complement Kit (Wieslab&#xae; COMPL CP310, Euro-Diagnostica, Sweden). Briefly, the test serum is incubated with an anti-C5 antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, in the presence of a human IgM antibody. The amount of C5b-9 that is generated is measured by contacting the mixture with an enzyme conjugated anti-C5b-9 antibody and a fluorogenic substrate and measuring the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength. As a control, the test serum is incubated in the absence of the anti-C5 antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the test serum is a C5-deficient serum reconstituted with a C5 polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0143">To determine the effect of an anti-C5 antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, on alternative pathway-mediated hemolysis, unsensitized rabbit or guinea pig erythrocytes can be used as the target cells. In some embodiments, the serum test solution is a C5-deficient serum reconstituted with a C5 polypeptide. The percentage of lysis is normalized by considering 100% lysis equal to the lysis occurring in the absence of the inhibitor. In some embodiments, the alternative complement pathway is activated by lipopolysaccharide molecules, for example, as utilized in the Wieslab&#xae; Alternative Pathway Complement Kit (Wieslab&#xae; COMPL AP330, Euro-Diagnostica, Sweden).

The CH50 eq assay is a method for measuring the total classical complement activity in serum. This test is a lytic assay, which uses antibody-sensitized erythrocytes as the activator of the classical complement pathway and various dilutions of the test serum to determine the amount required to give 50% lysis (CH50). The percent hemolysis can be determined, for example, using a spectrophotometer. The CH50 eq assay provides an indirect measure of terminal complement complex (TCC) formation, since the TCC themselves are directly responsible for the hemolysis that is measured.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0145">The assay is well known and commonly practiced by those of skill in the art. Briefly, to activate the classical complement pathway, undiluted serum samples (e.g., reconstituted human serum samples) are added to microassay wells containing the antibody-sensitized erythrocytes to thereby generate TCC. Next, the activated sera are diluted in microassay wells, which are coated with a capture reagent (e.g., an antibody that binds to one or more components of the TCC). The TCC present in the activated samples bind to the monoclonal antibodies coating the surface of the microassay wells. The wells are washed and to each well is added a detection reagent that is detectably labeled and recognizes the bound TCC. The detectable label can be, e.g., a fluorescent label or an enzymatic label.

The term &#x201c;binds to the same epitope&#x201d; with reference to two or more antibodies means that the antibodies bind to the same segment of amino acid residues, as determined by a given method. Techniques for determining whether antibodies bind to the &#x201c;same epitope on C5&#x201d; with the antibodies described herein include, for example, epitope mapping methods, such as, x-ray analyses of crystals of antigen:antibody complexes which provides atomic resolution of the epitope and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Other methods monitor the binding of the antibody to peptide antigen fragments or mutated variations of the antigen where loss of binding due to a modification of an amino acid residue within the antigen sequence is often considered an indication of an epitope component. In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping can also be used. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. Antibodies having the same VH and VL or the same CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences are expected to bind to the same epitope.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0149">Antibodies that &#x201c;compete with another antibody for binding to a target&#x201d; refer to antibodies that inhibit (partially or completely) the binding of the other antibody to the target.

Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods well known in the art. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen, and yield of the monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host.

Accordingly, an interim analysis of a phase 2, open-label, multiple ascending dose study extension period (NCT02605993) was conducted to characterize the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) following a formulation change (10 mg/mL intravenous [IV] to 100 mg/mL IV).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0279">In brief, complement inhibitor-naive adults with PNH received four different ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) dosing regimens (cohorts 1-4; see FIGURE) according to the protocol described in WO 2017/123636, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. In the extension phase, cohorts 1-3 switched to weight-based dosing, followed by all cohorts changing from ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) 10 mg/mL IV to 100 mg/mL IV later in the extension period. Data before and after changing the formulation were then compared. Efficacy (lactate dehydrogenase levels), safety, PK (serum ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) trough concentrations) and immunogenicity were assessed. Analyses for cohorts 1-3 (received weight-based dosing every 8 weeks [q8w]) were grouped. Results for cohort 4 (dosed every 12 weeks) were presented separately. Adverse events (AEs) were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 21.0. Patients gave informed consent, and the relevant independent ethics committees provided approval.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0280">In total, 25 patients receiving ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) 10 mg/mL IV switched to 100 mg/mL IV. The majority of patients were male (76.0%, n=19). Ethnicity was reported as not Hispanic or Latino (84.0%, n=21), Hispanic or Latino (4.0%, n=1) or was not provided (12.0%, n=3). Patients reported their race as White (60.0%, n=15), Asian (24.0%, n=6), &#x2018;Other&#x2019; (4.0%, n=1) or did not disclose this information (12.0%, n=3). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age at first infusion was 44.6 (16.5) years. At baseline, mean (SD) weight, height and body mass index were 78.1 (14.8) kg, 174.8 (10.6) cm and 25.4 (3.2) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. No meaningful difference in mean lactate dehydrogenase levels or serum trough concentrations following formulation change was observed. Overall exposure-adjusted rate of treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) and serious AEs were comparable for both formulations, and all reported TEAEs were considered unrelated to ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab). No deaths, discontinuations or anti-drug antibody positive responses occurred before or after formulation change. Use of the 100 mg/mL formulation gave an 87-minute reduction in infusion time versus the 10 mg/mL preparation for adult patients weighing 40-60 kg (57 minutes [100 mg/mL] vs 144 minutes [10 mg/mL]). Infusion time was reduced by 78 minutes for patients weighing 60-100 kg (42 minutes [100 mg/mL] vs 120 minutes [10 mg/mL]), and by 102 minutes for patients weighing &#x3e;100 kg (30 minutes [100 mg/mL] vs 132 minutes [10 mg/mL]).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0281">In this interim analysis, the efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity of ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) IV 100 mg/mL were comparable to the IV 10 mg/mL formulation, and the high-concentration formulation was well tolerated in patients with PNH. The ULTOMIRIS&#xae; (ravulizumab) IV 100 mg/mL formulation permitted a considerable reduction in infusion time versus the low-concentration formulation (78-102 minute reduction of maintenance dose infusion time in adults versus 10 mg/mL formulation), offering improved patient convenience.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0"
