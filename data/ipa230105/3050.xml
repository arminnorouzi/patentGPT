description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to securing spare keys for accessing real estate locations, and more specifically to a stand assembly for securing spare keys for use by real estate agents to access real estate locations for purposes of sale.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As anyone who has ever been accidentally locked out of their home can attest, having a spare key accessible from outside can be very important. Many property owners seek clever ways to hide spare keys outside, under a welcome mat or in an adjacent shed or storage space. Several products exist in the market to assist property owners in this task, such as fake rocks or potting plants with hidden compartments. However, the ever-present risk of unauthorized entry and theft at such properties remains a concern.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">So too is this true with respect to selling a piece of property. Providing real estate agents with a spare key to enter a property on the market for sale is common practice. However, the manner of providing spare keys can be problematic and can involve the same concerns regarding unauthorized entry and theft. Those involved in real estate sales are always looking for the most efficient and effective way to store spare keys for use during open houses, etc. in a secure manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, it is appropriate to simply provide a single real estate agent with the spare key(s). However, this approach is limited, especially if a real estate agency responsible for a listing may send one of several agents to the property at any given time. And the agent might forget the key and have to drive back to retrieve it, which could delay a showing and even result in a lost sale. Accordingly, it is generally preferable to securely store the spare key at the real estate location.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically in the real estate business, agents and agencies use a classic lockbox device to store the spare keys. These devices typically attach around a door handle or other fixture outside the property or otherwise attach directly to the property. Such devices often employ a code to access the compartment containing the spare key. However, these devices continue to suffer from significant drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For one thing, these devices are limited in their use, requiring something to secure them to. As a result, a real estate agent unfamiliar with the location of the spare key security device could spend a substantial amount of time outside the property searching for the device, and often they may be unable to find or access it at all. Furthermore, securing such a device around a door handle, for example, and repeatedly accessing such a device, can result in damage to the door handle or door or to the property otherwise&#x2014;the last thing a property owner wants when in the process of selling a property.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there remains a market need for a secure, convenient way to store a spare key outside but local to a property, such as a residence or place of business. And there is a particular need for such a device for use by real estate agents listing properties for sale and requiring access to show the properties to prospective buyers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a device and system for securely and accessibly storing a spare key outside of a property. It is a further object of the present invention to provide the device and system in a convenient, easily locatable and accessible, and aesthetically pleasing manner, considerations that are particularly important when selling real estate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To accomplish these and other objectives, the present invention provides a lockbox stand with attachable lockbox device with a lockable compartment. The lockbox stand includes a base and a post connected thereto. The base preferably provides a mechanism for extending and collapsing the post such that, when upright, the post extends perpendicular to the ground and to a lateral area of the base and, when collapsed, the post extends parallel to the ground and to a lateral area of the base. This feature provides for convenient storage of the lockbox stand when the post is in the collapsed position and effective use of the lockbox stand to hold a lockbox device easily accessible to a user when the post is in the upright.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferable embodiments of the base employ a groove extending from the point of attachment of the post to at least one edge of the base, such groove preferably sized to snugly contain at least a portion of the post when the post is in the collapsed position. In some preferable embodiments, the post may also distend to reduce its length for more convenient storage when in the collapsed position and elongate when in the upright position. In such embodiments, the groove in the base is preferably sized to snugly contain at least a portion of, and more preferably the majority or the entire length of, the post when distended.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some preferable embodiments of the base further include one or more wheels to assist in moving the lockbox stand into the most convenient position, especially when the post is extended and elongated (in applicable embodiments). Such wheels are preferably located on a single edge of the base, allowing a user to simply tilt the lockbox stand toward the wheel edge to free the remaining edges of the base from contact with the ground and allow the lockbox stand to freely move from location to location without lifting the entire lockbox stand off the ground. Such embodiments improve the convenience of the lockbox stand design, particularly for real estate agents seeking to select the most aesthetically pleasing and convenient location.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferable embodiments of the lockbox stand's base also use a retractable cable coiled within the base, the retractable cable being operable to secure the lockbox stand to a property fixture to prevent any unauthorized removal. Such embodiments preferably employ a high-grade cable that is difficult to cut or otherwise tamper with but is still sufficiently malleable to allow it to retract into a coil within the base. Preferable materials for the cable utilize high strength alloys such as galvanized steel or the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Such preferable embodiments of the base also include an open space into which the cable can be retracted into a coil for convenient storage and transport. The base preferably includes internal components that help to organize the coiled cable, such as a plurality of protrusions that extend down into the open space from the top surface of the base and extend outward toward the edges of the base, forming an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape. The cable may be coiled around such protrusions when retracted. Preferable embodiments include a cable length of at least 6-10 feet or greater.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferable embodiments of the lockbox stand's post include one or more hooks or like extensions. Such extensions provide a location for attaching a lockbox device containing a spare key for entering the associated property, preferably such that the lockbox device cannot be easily removed without knowing the combination to access or remove the lockbox device. For example, a hook can preferably connect to the post on both ends forming a closed loop, which the lockbox device's upper handle can be inserted into for secure attachment, rather than simply hung on an open-ended hook. Such hooks or like extensions are preferably welded onto a back side of the post such that they are not removeable, although removeable attachments such as bolting are likewise possible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferable embodiments of the post also include one or more detachable signs. The signs preferably include common words or phrases, such as &#x201c;Welcome&#x201d; or &#x201c;Welcome Home,&#x201d; and are preferably removably attachable to the post's front side, although a single sign may also be welded thereto as those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize. Some preferable embodiments of the signs may be attachable to the post using a classic nuts-and-bolts arrangement while others may be attached using magnets or other known attachment means. Some preferable embodiments may include several different manners of attachment, which the user can choose and apply based upon the particular circumstances of the lockbox stand's use and convenience.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The signs preferably cover most of the length of the post when the post is in the upright position and fully elongated where applicable. The signs are also preferably wide enough to conceal any lockbox device attached to the back side of the post such that an observer might recognize the lockbox stand only as a welcoming feature of the associated property rather than a manner of storing a spare key. In some embodiments, signs may contain a front and two sides to cover any lockbox device attached to the back side of the post or may contain a front, two sides, and a back to fully encircle such lockbox device. Such embodiments provide for improved concealment of the lockbox device but also make the lockbox device less convenient to access.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferable embodiments of the lockbox stand also include a biasing mechanism to encourage the post into the upright position and a latch mechanism to hold the post in the collapsed position. Some preferable embodiments may employ a spring based biasing mechanism while others may employ a pneumatic or hydraulic biasing mechanism, or any combination thereof. The biasing mechanism is preferably incorporated into the lockbox stand's components that attach the post to the base, which preferably also include means for rotateably connecting a lower extension of the post within the interior of the base, the base preferably employing a slot to permit the post's lower extension to pivot relative to a longitudinal axis of the base to permit the post's movement between the upright and collapsed positions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments and arrangements described above. Other objects of the present invention and its particular features and advantages will become more apparent from consideration of the following drawings and detailed description of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

the technology by way of example, not by way of limitation of the principles of the invention. This description will enable one skilled in the art to make and use the technology, and describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives and uses of the invention, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize alternative variations and arrangements, and the present technology is not limited to those embodiments described hereafter.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a preferable embodiment of a lockbox stand <b>10</b> is provided with a post assembly <b>12</b>, a base assembly <b>32</b>, and a connection assembly <b>52</b> for connecting the post assembly <b>12</b> to the base assembly <b>22</b>. The post assembly <b>12</b> includes a primary post <b>14</b> upon which a sign(s) <b>16</b> may be mounted. The sign(s) <b>16</b> preferably mount to the front-facing side of the primary post <b>14</b> so as to present the most pleasingly aesthetic view of the lockbox stand <b>10</b> to a user encountering it for the first time. The sign(s) <b>16</b> is preferably mountable to the primary post <b>14</b> through various means that will be known to those of skill in the art, including through welding, bolt or other mechanical connection, or magnetic connection.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The sign(s) <b>16</b> is preferably sized to conceal most if not all of the primary post <b>14</b> when the post is extended in the upright position as well as any projections <b>18</b> or other items connected to the rear-facing side or elsewhere on the primary post <b>14</b>. The sign(s) <b>16</b> are intended to provide viewers with a pleasant, inviting atmosphere and may have such inviting messages as &#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, &#x201c;Welcome Home,&#x201d; or other messages or presentations, such as a floral arrangement, depictions of a sunny, pleasant day, or the like. The present invention is not limited to any particular depiction on the sign(s) <b>16</b> connected to the primary post <b>14</b>, and several signs <b>16</b> may be added or removed as the user sees fit in preferable embodiments.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some preferable embodiments of the primary post <b>14</b> are extendable and retractable to assist in storage and transport of the lockbox stand <b>10</b>. Various means of extending and retracting the primary post <b>14</b> will be known to those of skill in the art, such as a primary post <b>14</b> consisting of two or more sections that travel in guides/brackets and/or that collapse within one another and other, similar means. In such preferable embodiments the sign(s) <b>16</b> are preferably removable to facilitate the retraction of the primary post <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the primary post <b>14</b> preferably includes one or more projections <b>18</b> on the rear-facing side. The projections <b>18</b> provide for the attachment of secondary items, including a lockbox device. Among the projections <b>18</b>, preferable embodiments of the lockbox stand <b>10</b> include an attachment mechanism <b>20</b> for hanging a lockbox device or other key-containing device. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the attachment mechanism <b>20</b> extends from near the top of the rear-facing side of the primary post <b>14</b>. The attachment mechanism preferably includes a closed hook <b>22</b> that is attached to the primary post <b>14</b> and cannot be easily removed, for example because it is welded to the primary post <b>14</b> or otherwise permanently attached.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some preferable embodiments, the closed hook <b>22</b> is welded directly to the primary post <b>14</b> while, in others, the closed hook <b>22</b> is welded to an upper extension <b>24</b> creating a surface for attachment of the closed hook <b>22</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such an arrangement of the attachment mechanism <b>20</b> improves the security of any attached lockbox or other key-containing device by eliminating the application of shearing force upon the closed hook <b>22</b> when the lockbox stand <b>10</b> is in use in the upright position. Those of skill in the art will recognize additional or alternative arrangements for securing a key to the primary post <b>14</b> and reducing the likelihood of theft or loss.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Preferable embodiments of the post assembly <b>12</b> also employ a lower disk <b>26</b> among the projections <b>18</b> extending from near the bottom of the rear-facing side of the primary post <b>14</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Lower disk <b>26</b> preferably includes a curved edge opposite the edge adjacent to the primary post <b>14</b> with at least two positioning slots <b>28</b> cut therein. The positioning slots <b>28</b> are engageable by components of the connection assembly <b>52</b> to hold the rotational positioning of the primary post <b>14</b> and associated sign <b>16</b> in at least one of two positions: an upright position and a collapsed position. Some preferable embodiments employ a plurality of positioning slots <b>28</b> such that the primary post <b>14</b> and associated sign <b>16</b> can also be locked in a multitude of positional angles between the fully-upright and fully-collapsed positions. A lower peripheral bore <b>30</b> is also provided near the bottom edge of the primary post <b>14</b> and adjacent to lower disk <b>26</b>, in some preferable embodiments.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The base assembly <b>32</b> includes a housing <b>34</b> with one or more attachable feet <b>48</b> and one or more wheels <b>50</b>. The housing is preferably square when viewed from above but may form other polygonal shapes, including a rectangle, hexagon, octagon, etc. The housing <b>34</b> is preferably formed by a plurality of side panels <b>36</b>&#x2014;four side panels <b>36</b> in square and rectangular designs, six side panels <b>36</b> in hexagonal designs, eight side panels <b>36</b> in octagonal designs, etc.&#x2014;and a top panel <b>38</b> forming a flat surface near the center of the housing <b>34</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. An interior of the housing <b>34</b> is preferably open to house the connection assembly <b>52</b>, among other features.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The housing <b>34</b> includes an insertion slot <b>40</b> sized to accept the post assembly <b>12</b> and arranged near the center of the housing <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the insertion slot <b>40</b> preferably extends from the approximate center of the housing <b>34</b> through the top panel <b>38</b> and into a portion of at least one of the side panels <b>36</b>. The insertion slot <b>40</b> is sized and arranged to allow the post assembly <b>12</b> to swing up into the upright position and fold back into the collapsed position without detaching the post assembly <b>12</b> from the base assembly <b>32</b>. When the post and base assemblies <b>12</b>, <b>32</b> are connected, the lower disk <b>26</b> of preferable embodiments of the post assembly <b>12</b> is housed within the interior of the housing <b>34</b> such that the lower disk <b>26</b> is contactable by the components of the connection assembly <b>52</b> to provide for the angular positioning of the primary post <b>14</b> and associated sign <b>16</b>, as described above.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The side panels <b>36</b> preferably include an angled upper portion and a lower portion perpendicular to the ground, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, though the side panels <b>36</b> may alternatively consist of a single angular surface as well. At least one side panel <b>36</b> of the housing <b>34</b> preferably includes one or more slots <b>42</b> cut into its bottom edge, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to accommodate components of the connection assembly <b>52</b>. The housing <b>34</b> also preferable includes feet-connection surfaces <b>44</b> arranged parallel to the ground and located at each of the transition points or corners <b>46</b> of the housing <b>34</b> where two side panels <b>36</b> of the housing meet.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The feet <b>48</b> are preferably attachable to the feet-connection surfaces <b>44</b> at each corner <b>46</b> of the housing <b>34</b>. Some embodiments include feet <b>48</b> attached at each corner <b>46</b> of the housing <b>34</b> while others may include feet <b>48</b> only at certain corners <b>46</b>. Some preferable embodiments of the base assembly <b>32</b> also include one or more wheels <b>50</b> to facilitate easy positioning of the lockbox stand <b>10</b>, especially when the post assembly <b>12</b> is in the upright position. The wheels <b>50</b> are preferably housed within the housing <b>34</b> with a portion extending below the lower edge of the side panels <b>36</b> of the housing <b>34</b>. The wheels <b>50</b> preferably extend at least as far below the lower edge of the housing <b>34</b> as do the feet <b>48</b> and even more preferably the wheels <b>50</b> extend at least slightly further below the lower edge of the housing <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Preferable embodiments of the connection assembly <b>52</b> include a post support assembly <b>54</b>, a forked base support <b>56</b>, and a latch sub-assembly <b>58</b>, including a latch slider <b>60</b>, and one or more biasing mechanisms <b>62</b>. In some preferable embodiments, the latch slider <b>60</b> may be attached to or part-in-parcel with the forked base support <b>56</b> while, in others, it is a separate part, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The biasing mechanisms <b>62</b> may employ pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical biasing means, such as a compressible spring or coil, and are preferably surrounded by a latch shroud <b>64</b>. The latch shroud <b>64</b> also preferably connects the post support assembly <b>54</b> with the forked base support <b>56</b> when the connection assembly is installed and in use.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Preferable embodiments of the post support assembly <b>54</b> include a bottom panel portion <b>66</b> and two side panel portions <b>68</b> with an open top, forming a U-shaped design when the post support assembly <b>54</b> is viewed from the edge. A lengthwise slot <b>70</b> cut from a first end of the post support assembly <b>54</b> and through a substantial portion of the bottom panel portion <b>66</b> permits the passage of the lower disk <b>26</b>, in preferable embodiments, when adjusting the post assembly <b>12</b> between upright and collapsed positions. Likewise, lengthwise slots <b>72</b> cut from a first end of the post support assembly <b>54</b> and through a substantial portion of the side panel portions <b>68</b> permit the translation of the latch slider <b>60</b> within the post support assembly <b>54</b>. Preferable embodiments of the lengthwise slots <b>72</b> in the side panel portions <b>68</b> extend around &#xbc; to &#xbd; of the length of the post support assembly <b>54</b> and preferable embodiments of the lengthwise slot <b>70</b> in the bottom panel portion extend around &#x2153; to &#x2154; of the length of the post support assembly <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The side panel portions <b>68</b> of the post support assembly <b>54</b> also include central bores <b>86</b> preferably located near the upper edge of the side panel portions <b>68</b> and substantially centrally along the post support assembly's <b>54</b> length. When connection assembly <b>52</b> is installed within base assembly <b>32</b>, the post support assembly <b>54</b> is preferably located adjacent to the housing's <b>34</b> top panel <b>38</b> and just below the insertion slot <b>40</b>. As such, post support assembly <b>54</b> may be connected to post assembly <b>12</b> by aligning the central bores <b>86</b> of the side panel portions <b>68</b> with the lower peripheral bore <b>30</b> of the primary post <b>14</b>, when the primary post's <b>14</b> lower portion and lower disk <b>26</b>, in preferable embodiments, are inserted into the interior of the housing <b>34</b> through the insertion slot <b>40</b>. Connection pin <b>88</b> may thus be inserted to rotatably connect the post assembly to the post support assembly <b>54</b>. Notably, it is important that the primary post <b>14</b> can rotate relative to the post support assembly <b>54</b> as the post assembly <b>12</b> is moved between the upright and collapsed positions, so lower peripheral bore <b>30</b> and central bores <b>86</b> are each preferably circular and connection pin <b>88</b> is preferably cylindrical in shape, though other designs and arrangements are likewise available, as those of skill in the art will recognize.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferable embodiments of the forked base support <b>56</b> include a substantially horizontal forked portion <b>74</b> and a vertical extension portion <b>76</b>. The vertical extension portion <b>76</b> preferably includes a lateral projection <b>78</b> extending perpendicularly from each side edge of the vertical extension portion <b>76</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each with a projection bore <b>80</b> provided therethrough. The forked base support <b>56</b> preferably connects with the latch shroud <b>64</b>, which is itself connected to the post support assembly <b>54</b>, by aligning the projection bores <b>80</b> of the lateral projections <b>78</b> with similarly sized and situated peripheral bores <b>82</b> in the latch shroud <b>64</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A pin <b>84</b> is inserted through the projection bores <b>80</b> and peripheral bores <b>82</b> when aligned, thereby connecting the forked base support <b>56</b> to the latch shroud <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The substantially horizontal forked plate <b>74</b>, meanwhile, is preferably engaged with the base assembly <b>32</b> by aligning and introducing one or more prongs <b>90</b> of the forked plate <b>74</b> into the one or more slots <b>42</b> provided in at least one of the side panels <b>36</b> of the base assembly's <b>32</b> housing <b>34</b>. This insertion of prongs <b>90</b> into slots <b>42</b> precludes lateral displacement of the connection assembly <b>52</b> relative to the base assembly <b>32</b> while the connection assembly's <b>52</b> connection to the post assembly <b>12</b> precludes vertical displacement. In some preferable embodiments, the one or more prongs <b>90</b> of the forked plate <b>74</b> may be provided at an angle relative to the remaining substantially horizontal portion <b>92</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such preferable embodiments include an angle preferably between 5 and 45 degrees, more preferably between 10 and 30 degrees, and even more preferably around 15 degrees.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-C</figref> depict the lockbox stand <b>10</b> in the collapsed position, with the post assembly <b>12</b> connected to the base assembly <b>32</b> via the connection assembly <b>52</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a view from above, the sign <b>16</b> conceals virtually all of the primary post <b>14</b> as well as its projections <b>18</b> and any key-containing device attached thereto. Notably, the key-containing device(s) are preferably removed from the lockbox stand <b>10</b> prior to collapsing the post assembly <b>12</b> into the collapsed position. The lower-most portion of the primary post <b>14</b> (and lower disk <b>26</b> in preferable embodiments) is received within the insertion slot <b>40</b> such that the front surface of sign <b>16</b> is at an elevation substantially equivalent to the elevation of the base assembly's <b>32</b> top panel <b>38</b> when in the collapsed position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, which depicts the lockbox stand <b>10</b> in the collapsed position from below, feet-connection surfaces <b>44</b>, feet <b>48</b>, wheels <b>50</b>, and the connection assembly <b>52</b> are each visible, with the connection assembly <b>52</b> substantially located within the interior of housing <b>34</b> and the feet <b>48</b> and wheels <b>50</b> extending below the lower edge of the housing's <b>34</b> side panels <b>36</b> to substantially the same elevation, in preferable embodiments.

It is important that the upper lift strut fitting <b>274</b> can rotate relative to the lift strut mount <b>270</b> as the post assembly <b>212</b> is adjusted between the upright and collapsed positions, so peripheral bore <b>288</b> and lateral bore <b>292</b> are both preferably circular and pin <b>290</b> is preferably cylindrical in shape, though other designs and arrangements are likewise available, as those of skill in the art will recognize.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Also preferably included in the connection assembly <b>252</b> are means for latching <b>296</b> the post assembly <b>212</b> in the collapsed position. The latching means <b>296</b> prevent the post assembly <b>212</b> from springing up into the upright position due to the pressure created by the translational strut portion's <b>278</b> biasing means. Those of skill in the art will recognize the various manners of latching the post assembly <b>212</b> in the collapsed position, all of which are available to the present invention. Preferable embodiments of the lockbox stand <b>210</b> that employ latching means <b>296</b> may, for example, incorporate one or more of the projections <b>220</b> attached to the rear-facing side of the primary post <b>214</b> into the latching operation.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Another preferable embodiment of a lockbox stand <b>310</b> according to the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. As depicted, the lockbox stand <b>310</b> preferably includes a post assembly <b>312</b>, a base assembly <b>332</b>, and a connection assembly <b>352</b> for connecting the post assembly <b>312</b> to the base assembly <b>332</b>. The post assembly <b>312</b> preferably includes a primary post <b>314</b> upon which a sign or signs <b>316</b> may be mounted, preferably upon the front-facing side of the primary post <b>314</b>. The signs <b>316</b> are preferably mountable to the primary post <b>314</b> through various means that will be known to those of skill in the art, including through welding, bolt or other mechanical connection, or by magnetic connection for easy installation and removal.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Extending from the rear-facing side of the primary post <b>314</b>, opposite the side that the signs <b>316</b> attach to, are one or more projections <b>318</b>. The projections <b>318</b> provide means to attach, hang, or otherwise connect items, such as a real estate lockbox device, to the lockbox stand <b>310</b>. Preferable embodiments of the post assembly <b>312</b> include an attachment mechanism <b>320</b> specifically designed to connect a lockbox device to the lockbox stand <b>310</b>.

As those of skill in the art will recognize, the number of side panels <b>336</b> will determine the shape of the housing <b>334</b>, with preferable shapes including a square, rectangle, hexagonal, or other multilateral shapes. The preferable embodiment of the housing <b>334</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b></figref> is square. The housing <b>334</b> includes an insertion slot <b>340</b> preferably extending from the approximate center of the housing <b>334</b> through to an edge of the top panel <b>338</b> and into one of the side panels <b>336</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>19</b></figref>. Each side panel <b>336</b> abuts and connects to another at transition demarcations <b>342</b>, thereby forming the enclosed housing <b>334</b> within which the connection assembly <b>352</b> resides when the lockbox stand <b>310</b> is assembled. Also stored within the housing <b>334</b> is a cable, in preferable embodiments, which can be used to attach and secure the lockbox stand <b>310</b> to the real property to avoid theft or misplacement.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The base assembly <b>332</b> also preferably includes one or more feet <b>346</b> and one or more wheels <b>348</b> connected to the lower edge of the housing <b>334</b>. The feet <b>346</b> are preferably removably attachable to foot-connection portions <b>344</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>. The foot connection portions <b>344</b> and feet <b>346</b> are preferably located near each of the transition demarcations <b>342</b>, although other arrangements will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, including arrangements employing more or less feet <b>346</b>. Wheels <b>348</b> are likewise preferably removably attached to the housing <b>334</b> through the use of wheel housings <b>350</b>. The wheel housings <b>350</b> allow the wheels <b>348</b> to rotate freely relative to the housing <b>334</b> to facilitate locating the lockbox stand <b>310</b> as desired.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Preferable embodiments of the connection assembly <b>352</b> include two locking plates <b>356</b>, a post retention assembly <b>362</b>, and a retention bar <b>354</b> extending therefrom. The locking plates <b>356</b> reside within the housing <b>334</b> when the lockbox stand is assembled and attach to each side of the primary post <b>314</b> via pin <b>378</b>. The locking plates <b>356</b> each include a central bore <b>360</b> preferably located centrally near the locking plate's linear edge <b>380</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The central bore <b>360</b> aligns with the primary post's <b>314</b> post attachment bore <b>326</b> such that pin <b>378</b> can pass through each to connect the post assembly <b>312</b> to the connection assembly <b>352</b>. Each of the locking plates <b>356</b> also has a circumferential aperture <b>358</b> located along a substantial portion of the circumference of the locking plates <b>356</b> near their circumferential edge <b>382</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>C and <b>20</b></figref>. The circumferential apperture <b>358</b> includes two or more positioning slots <b>384</b> to facilitate transitioning the lockbox stand <b>310</b> between upright and storage positions, and at various points in between in some preferable embodiments.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Preferable embodiments of the post retention assembly <b>362</b> and retention bar <b>354</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. The retention bar <b>354</b> preferably extends substantially linearly from one end of the post retention assembly <b>362</b>, as depicted. At the opposite end of the post retention assembly <b>362</b> reside one or more positioning knobs <b>368</b>. The retention bar extends through the entire length of the hollow primary post <b>314</b> of the post assembly <b>312</b> when the lockbox stand <b>310</b> is assembled, with a small portion of the retention bar <b>354</b> extending out of the top of the primary post <b>314</b> such that a user can access, grab, and pull on the end of the retention bar <b>354</b>. The post retention assembly <b>362</b> includes two parallel rectangular plates <b>364</b> separated by at least a first spacer <b>374</b> and a second spacer <b>376</b>. As those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize additional spacers may be employed without departing from the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The first and second spacers <b>374</b>, <b>376</b> are sized and oriented to separate the two parallel rectangular plates <b>364</b> at a distance that creates a snug fit between the post retention assembly <b>362</b> and the hollow primary post <b>314</b> when the lockbox stand <b>310</b> is assembled and portions of the post retention assembly <b>362</b> reside within the hollow primary post <b>314</b>. Because the positioning knobs <b>368</b> extend beyond the outer surfaces of the rectangular plates <b>364</b>, the positioning knobs <b>368</b> cannot enter the hollow primary post <b>314</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>. Instead, the post retention assembly <b>362</b> is inserted within the hollow primary post <b>314</b> until the oblong apertures <b>366</b> on the rectangular plates <b>364</b> align with the post attachment bore <b>326</b> located at the lower end of the primary post <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">When fully assembled, the central bores <b>360</b> of the locking plates <b>356</b> also align with the post attachment bore <b>326</b> and the oblong apertures <b>366</b>, and each part is connected using pin <b>378</b>. The locking plates <b>356</b> being preferably affixed to the housing <b>334</b>, the pin <b>378</b> thus rotatably connects each of the post assembly <b>312</b>, base assembly <b>332</b>, and connection assembly <b>352</b> to one another. The lower end of the primary post <b>314</b>, the locking plates <b>356</b>, and the post retention assembly <b>362</b> all reside entirely within the housing <b>334</b> when the lockbox stand <b>310</b> is assembled, with only the post assembly <b>312</b> being visible and accessible from outside the housing <b>334</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">When the lockbox stand <b>310</b> is fully assembled, the positioning knobs <b>368</b> of the post retention assembly <b>362</b> are slidably inserted within the circumferential aperture <b>358</b>. When the post assembly <b>312</b> is lying flat in the storage position, for example, the positioning knobs <b>368</b> are locked into the positioning slots <b>384</b> closest to the linear edge <b>380</b> of the locking plates <b>356</b>. Likewise, when the post assembly <b>312</b> is upright and in use, the positioning knobs <b>368</b> are locked into the positioning slots <b>384</b> located near the center of the circumferential edge <b>382</b> of the locking plates <b>356</b>. A biasing mechanism <b>370</b> employed by the post retention assembly <b>362</b> ensures that the rectangular plates <b>364</b> and their associated positioning knobs <b>368</b> are continuously encouraged toward the positioning slots <b>384</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">To transition the lockbox stand <b>310</b> between the upright, in-use position and the flat, storage position, and other positions therebetween in some preferable embodiments, the user pulls on the end of the retention bar <b>354</b> disposed above the top of the hollow primary post <b>314</b>. Doing so relieves the biasing pressure created by the biasing mechanism <b>370</b> and pulls the rectangular plates <b>364</b> and their associated positioning knobs <b>368</b> toward the top end of the primary post <b>314</b>, withdrawing the positioning knobs <b>368</b> from the positioning slots <b>384</b> allowing them to slide freely within the circumferential aperture <b>358</b> between positioning slots <b>384</b> and allowing the post assembly <b>312</b> to rotate relative to the base assembly <b>332</b> thereby. Some preferable embodiments of the post assembly <b>312</b> include a retention bar grip <b>386</b> to assist the user in pulling the retention bar <b>354</b> to permit the transition of the lockbox stand <b>310</b> between positions. As noted, and as will be understood to those of ordinary skill in the art, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>C and <b>20</b></figref> show only two positioning slots <b>384</b> at each end of the circumferential aperture <b>358</b> (associated with the upright and flat positions for the lockbox stand <b>310</b>), additional slots may be included to permit the post assembly to lock into place at an angle between upright and flat.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments and arrangements of parts, features, and the like, it is not limited to these embodiments or arrangements.
