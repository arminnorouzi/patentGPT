These warnings may advantageously prevent collisions between the vulnerable road users and the moving objects.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, consider the scenario in which a pedestrian is about to cross a street by using a crosswalk at an intersection and an approaching vehicle is about to pass through the same crosswalk. In this situation, a vehicle user equipment device (VUE) located within the vehicle transmits a warning message using device-to-device (D2D) communication resources. The pedestrian user equipment device (PUE) receives the warning message, if the PUE is monitoring all available D2D communication resources. Although effective, this method is inefficient, from a battery-consumption point of view, since the PUE must constantly remain powered on and active to monitor all of the available D2D communication resources.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to save battery power, the PUE can be configured to (1) perform periodic monitoring of selected D2D communication resources (e.g., partial sensing method), and (2) go to sleep in between the sensing durations (e.g., periods). The VUEs are configured to transmit their warning messages using only the selected D2D communication resources that are being periodically monitored by the PUE. Although the PUE monitors a smaller subset of D2D communication resources, this method still does not significantly reduce the power consumption required by the PUE to monitor the D2D communication resources. More specifically, the PUE must periodically wake-up from its sleep state, resynchronize, and then detect the VUE's warning messages. Besides the inefficient battery consumption, this method is also not suitable in situations when latency is critical. For example, the periodicity of the selected D2D communication resources could be too long for many collision-avoidance scenarios.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As an alternative to the VUEs transmitting warning messages, the PUEs could broadcast warning messages using the first available D2D communication resource. Since the VUEs have no battery consumption constraint, they can continuously monitor all of the D2D communication resources. For example, a PUE would transmit a warning message when it gets close to a potentially hazardous situation (e.g., before reaching a street crossing). This warning message would provide safety-related information such as the PUE's location and heading. Once the PUE is no longer in or near a potentially hazardous situation (e.g., the pedestrian is done crossing the street), the PUE stops transmitting the warning message. However, this method would require the PUE to be constantly aware of its geo-location, which would require the PUE's power-consuming, global positioning system (GPS) receiver or other geo-location determination hardware to stay active.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Instead of the PUE determining its geo-location, an improvement to the above method is for the network to send a warning message to the PUE using the cellular link (Uu-link), which would trigger the PUE to transmit a location/heading safety message over D2D communication resources. For example, if a road sensor (e.g., camera, radar, etc.) detects a pedestrian, the road sensor notifies the cellular network. After receiving the notification, a gNB (e.g., base station) of the cellular network broadcasts a paging or notification message to an area in which the PUE is located. In other examples, the gNB transmits the paging or notification message to one or more PUEs via a unicast or multicast transmission. Regardless of how the paging or notification message is transmitted, the paging or notification message contains an indicator, which instructs the PUE to activate a collision-avoidance procedure. In some examples, the collision-avoidance procedure includes transmitting a D2D location/heading safety message.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The near-by VUEs receive this safety message and take the appropriate steps to avoid collision. Although this method reduces the PUE's battery-consumption, the method has a large delay due to the road sensor detection processing, road sensor accessing the network, network processing, and the network paging the PUE. Moreover, the network must wait to page the PUE when the PUE wakes up from its sleep cycle. In some examples, all of these added delays are unacceptable, especially for safety-related applications. Therefore, there is a need to reduce this delay.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some of the examples described herein are configured to operate in conjunction with the IDLE state procedure of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 5G New Radio (3GPP 5G NR) communication specification. As part of the 3GPP 5G NR IDLE state procedure, a user equipment device (UE) sleeps for a time-period to reduce battery consumption and periodically wakes up to receive a paging message. If the UE does not receive a paging message, the UE goes back to sleep until the next wake up time. This sleep cycle is also known as discontinuous reception (DRX).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The basic mechanism for DRX is a configurable DRX cycle in the UE. A DRX cycle configuration consists of many parameters, such a DRX period, on-duration, DRX inactivity timer, DRX retransmission timer, etc. With a DRX cycle configured, the UE monitors the downlink control signaling only when active, sleeping with the receiver circuitry switched off (e.g., in an IDLE state) when not active. This allows for a significant reduction in power consumption: the longer the cycle, the lower the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Naturally, this implies restrictions to the scheduler as the UE can be addressed only when active, according to the DRX cycle. Thus, a (long) DRX cycle in combination with the UE remaining awake for some period after being scheduled is sufficient for most scenarios. However, some services, most notably Voice over</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Internet Protocol (VoIP), are characterized by periods of regular transmission, followed by periods of no or very little activity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To handle these services, a short DRX cycle can optionally be used in addition to the long cycle described above. Normally, the UE follows the long DRX cycle, but if it has recently been scheduled, the UE will follow a shorter DRX cycle for some time. Handling VoIP in this scenario can be done by setting the short DRX cycle to 20 ms, as the voice codec typically delivers a VoIP packet once every 20 ms. The long DRX cycle is then used to handle longer periods of silence when the UE is not receiving VoIP packets.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Upon waking from an IDLE state (e.g., sleep state), the UE attempts to detect the last serving cell's Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) to receive the paging message. In the context of 3GPP 5G NR, the SSB is comprised of a primary synchronization signal (PSS), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), and a downlink physical broadcast channel (PBCH). The PSS and SSS are a pair of downlink signals that are used by UEs to find, identify, and synchronize to a network. The PBCH is transmitted together with the PSS/SSS and carries a minimum amount of system information including an indication where the remaining broadcast system information is transmitted. The PSS, SSS, and PBCH are jointly referred to as the SSB.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Besides attempting to detect the last serving cell's SSB upon waking, the UE may also attempt to detect one or more neighboring cell's SSBs, as well. If successfully detected, the UE adds the detected SSBs of the neighboring cells to a list of candidate cells. The UE maintains the list of candidate cells in order to perform a handover to another cell when the downlink signal of one of the candidate cells has a stronger received signal strength than the downlink signal of the serving cell. Since the UE may have performed a reselection to another cell, the network is not aware of the exact cell the UE is camping on during its IDLE state. Thus, when the network needs to page a</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">UE, the network will send the page to a group of cells in case the UE has performed a handover to a neighboring cell during the IDLE state of the UE.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The methods, devices, and systems discussed herein involve a mobile wireless communication device, such as a PUE, receiving a first DRX cycle configuration from a network. The PUE also receives a second DRX cycle configuration that is different from the first DRX cycle configuration from the network. In some examples, the second DRX cycle configuration is compatible with a sidelink DRX cycle configuration of a D2D-capable device. Upon entering a first area that is near a potential safety scenario, such as an intersection, the PUE receives a signal containing an indicator. In response to receiving the signal, the PUE utilizes the second DRX cycle configuration to detect one or more device-to-device (D2D) transmissions from a D2D-capable device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the different examples described herein may be discussed separately, any of the features of any of the examples may be added to, omitted from, or combined with any other example.

Alternatively, the mobile wireless communication device could receive and store the second DRX cycle configuration prior to entering an IDLE state, and in response to receiving the signal containing the indicator, the mobile wireless communication device would initiate a procedure to utilize the previously received second DRX cycle configuration, which is different than the first DRX cycle configuration, to detect one or more device-to-device (D2D) transmissions from a D2D-capable device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For the examples described herein, the first DRX cycle configuration may be a UE-specific DRX cycle configuration, which is configured by the upper layer of the mobile wireless communication device, or a default DRX cycle configuration configured by a System Information Block (SIB) message received from the network (e.g., from a base station).

In some examples, upon detecting signal <b>104</b>, WCD <b>106</b> initiates a Random-Access Channel (RACH) procedure, whereby WCD <b>106</b> indicates in Msg <b>1</b> (e.g., a RACH Preamble message) or Msg <b>3</b> (e.g., an RRC Connection Request message) that WCD <b>106</b> plans to switch to using the stored, second DRX cycle configuration. Base station <b>102</b> responds in Msg <b>4</b> (e.g., RRC Connection Setup message) to indicate whether the request from WCD <b>106</b> to use the second DRX cycle configuration is accepted. If the request is accepted, WCD <b>106</b> begins using the second DRX cycle configuration and returns to an IDLE state. Note, in this example, WCD <b>106</b> does not enter the connected mode since the RACH procedure would not be completed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Regardless of whether the second DRX cycle configuration is obtained after WCD <b>106</b> enters first area <b>108</b> or is preconfigured before WCD <b>106</b> enters an IDLE state, there are various considerations when determining the second DRX cycle configuration. For example, it is advantageous to utilize a second DRX cycle configuration that allows for WCD <b>106</b> to detect D2D transmissions from VUEs (e.g., D2D-capable device <b>110</b>). Thus, the second DRX cycle configuration should be one in which WCD <b>106</b> is awake and ready to receive D2D transmissions at the same time as the VUEs are actively transmitting the D2D transmissions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since VUEs use &#x201c;sidelink&#x201d; for their broadcast transmissions, it is advantageous to select and utilize a second DRX cycle configuration at WCD <b>106</b> that is coordinated (e.g., aligned) with the sidelink DRX cycle configuration of one or more VUEs. More specifically, if D2D-capable device <b>110</b> uses a particular sidelink DRX cycle configuration, then base station <b>102</b> can configure WCD <b>106</b> with a second DRX cycle configuration that is coordinated with the sidelink DRX cycle configuration of the D2D-capable device <b>110</b>. Thus, in some examples, the second DRX cycle configuration is compatible with a sidelink DRX cycle configuration of a D2D-capable device (e.g., D2D-capable device <b>110</b>). In other examples, the second DRX cycle configuration is the same as the sidelink DRX cycle configuration of a D2D-capable device. In still other examples, the second DRX cycle configuration has an on-duration time that at least partially overlaps with the on-duration time of the sidelink DRX cycle configuration of a D2D-capable device, assuming the sidelink DRX cycle configuration wake time is longer than the wake time of the second DRX cycle configuration. In other examples, if WCD <b>106</b> is capable of operating in both the cellular and the sidelink modes simultaneously, then the second DRX cycle configuration could be non-overlapping with the first DRX cycle configuration. In this case, WCD <b>106</b> would apply both the first and the second DRX cycle configurations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some examples, the second DRX cycle configuration is a shorter DRX cycle configuration than the first DRX cycle configuration. In further examples, the second DRX cycle configuration is selected from a plurality of user equipment (UE) specific DRX cycle configurations. In the examples in which the second DRX cycle configuration is selected from a plurality of UE-specific DRX cycle configurations, the second DRX cycle configuration may be a sidelink DRX cycle configuration.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, controller <b>216</b> of WCD <b>106</b> utilizes the second DRX cycle configuration to detect one or more device-to-device (D2D) transmissions from D2D-capable device <b>110</b>. In other examples, controller <b>216</b> of WCD <b>106</b> is further configured to activate a collision-avoidance procedure that includes sensing device-to-device (D2D) resources in order to detect the D2D transmissions from D2D-capable device <b>110</b>, in response to receiving signal <b>104</b> or the second DRX cycle configuration. In further examples, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the collision-avoidance procedure includes transmitting, from WCD <b>106</b>, a periodic device-to-device (D2D) safety message using D2D resources. The collision-avoidance procedure will help avoid a collision between WCD <b>106</b> and D2D-capable device <b>110</b>, which is approaching WCD <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this regard, the time duration between when WCD <b>106</b> enters first area <b>108</b> to the time when WCD <b>106</b> activates the collision-avoidance procedure depends upon the periodicity of the broadcast transmissions from D2D-capable device <b>110</b> and the second DRX cycle configuration of WCD <b>106</b>. Thus, first area <b>108</b> should cover an area that is large enough to ensure that a WCD <b>106</b> configured with the second DRX cycle configuration will wake up to receive signal <b>104</b> and the broadcast transmissions from D2D-capable device <b>110</b> before reaching second area <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, a D2D-capable device is any device that is capable of D2D communication. In some examples, D2D-capable device <b>110</b> is integrated into a vehicle, drone, robot, or the like as an onboard unit (OBU). In other examples, D2D-capable device <b>110</b> may simply be a user equipment (UE) device that is located within a vehicle, drone, robot, or the like.

In some examples, if the second DRX cycle configuration does not need to be updated (e.g., if all the VUEs, including D2D-capable device <b>110</b>, use the same DRX cycle configuration) within second area <b>112</b>, the network could release WCD <b>106</b> to IDLE even within second area <b>112</b>.

One way in which this can be achieved is for WCD <b>106</b> to indicate to base station <b>102</b>, upon receipt of signal <b>104</b>, that WCD <b>106</b> is functioning as a PUE, which would prevent base station <b>102</b> from sending WCD <b>106</b> to the IDLE state. Once WCD <b>106</b> exits first area <b>108</b> and/or second area <b>112</b>, WCD <b>106</b> can send an RRC message to base station <b>102</b> indicating that WCD <b>106</b> has left first area <b>108</b> and/or second area <b>112</b>, which would trigger base station <b>102</b> to release WCD <b>106</b> to the IDLE state.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In still further examples, controller <b>216</b> of WCD <b>106</b> is also configured to, upon exiting at least one of first area <b>108</b> and second area <b>112</b>, utilize a DRX cycle configuration that is different than the second DRX cycle configuration.
