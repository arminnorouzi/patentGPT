Accordingly, compact optical modulators capable of high-speed response are highly sought-after. One of such optical modulators is an electro-absorption (EA) modulator that utilizes an electro-absorption effect in semiconductors. The EA modulator has a p-i-n structure with a multiple quantum well layer as an i-layer, and voltage can be applied to the p-i-n structure to perform optical intensity modulation. Typically, an EA modulator includes, for example, an InP substrate and has a multiple quantum well layer formed of InGaAsP. In another example, an EA modulator includes an Si-based structure and has an i-layer formed of SiGe. Further, an EA modulator is often used as an optical semiconductor device integrally integrated with a semiconductor laser.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases, a p-side electrode of an EA modulator is formed of a mesa-top electrode along a mesa, a pad electrode (to which a wire connected from the outside is bonded), and a lead-out wire electrode that connects the pad electrode and the mesa-top electrode. In some cases, carriers (photo current), generated by an EA modulator that absorbs light, have a distribution in a direction along the mesa of the EA modulator. Further, a structure in which, in order to increase a heat dissipation property at such a time, a connection portion between a lead-out wire electrode and a mesa-top electrode is provided on a light input end side.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A prime factor in a reduction in response time in an EA modulator is an electrostatic capacitance of the EA modulator. Further, a response time can be improved by reducing a modulator length. However, when a length of the EA modulator is reduced, a total amount of light absorption is reduced and an extinction ratio is reduced, which may increase a communication error ratio of an optical transmission of the EA modulator. Thus, in order to obtain a high extinction ratio in an EA modulator having a short modulator length, a light absorption amount per unit length needs to increase. However, an increase in a light absorption amount leads to an increase in carriers (photogenerated carriers) generated in the EA modulator. There is no problem when the generated photogenerated carriers are satisfactorily extracted from the EA modulator, but there are cases in which the photogenerated carriers are not extracted satisfactorily. In those cases, the carriers remain in the EA modulator, usually in a multiple quantum well layer of the EA modulator. As a result, carrier pileup in the multiple quantum well layer occurs. The carrier pileup leads to reductions in characteristics of the EA modulator, such as extinction characteristics and response time. Extinction characteristics and response time are reduced based on an intensity of light input to the EA modulator and a light absorption amount of the EA modulator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, a light input side of an EA modulator has a large amount of photo current as compared to a light output side. When a substantially constant voltage is applied with respect to an optical axis direction of the EA modulator, a distribution of the photo current shows a distribution tendency of the photogenerated carriers. In other words, a large amount of carriers should be extracted from a multiple quantum well of the EA modulator on the light input side as compared to the light output side. Even if the carriers are satisfactorily extracted when the voltage applied to the EA modulator is a direct current, or has a low speed of less than a kilohertz (kHz), the carriers may not be extracted when an alternating voltage of a gigahertz (GHz) or more is applied. When the carriers are not extracted at high speed, extinction characteristics and frequency characteristics, such as bandwidth, are reduced. This effect is significant when a light absorption amount per unit length is large, for example, in a short EA modulator or at a high temperature at which light absorption is increased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and therefore provides an electro-absorption modulator with improved high-speed responsivity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, an electro-absorption modulator (EA modulator), includes: a substrate; a mesa structure, which is provided on a first surface of the substrate, and includes a first conductivity type cladding layer, a multiple quantum well layer, and a second conductivity type cladding layer; a first conductivity type electrode to be electrically connected to the first conductivity type cladding layer; and a second conductivity type electrode provided on a second surface of the substrate. The first conductivity type electrode includes a mesa-top electrode arranged along a direction in which the mesa structure extends, a pad electrode, to which an electric signal from an outside source is to be input, and a lead-out wire electrode, which connects the mesa-top electrode and the pad electrode. The mesa structure has a light input end, to which light is to be input from the outside, and a light output end, which is on a side of the mesa structure that is opposite of the light input end. A connection position between a center position in a short-side direction of the lead-out wire electrode and the mesa-top electrode is closer to the light output end side in a long-side direction of the mesa-top electrode. The connection position is a position that is less than 50% away from the light output end side with respect to a length in the long-side direction of the mesa-top electrode.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of an electro-absorption modulator integrated laser in a first example implementation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A of an electro-absorption modulator illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph showing a distribution in an optical axis direction of a photo current of the electro-absorption modulator illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph showing an electric field strength of a multiple quantum well layer of the electro-absorption modulator illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph showing the electric field strength of the multiple quantum well layer of the electro-absorption modulator illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a graph showing electric field strength ratios and a photo current distribution at 10 GHz in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a graph showing electric field strength ratios and a photo current distribution at 20 GHz in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is a graph for electric field strength ratios and a photo current distribution at 40 GHz in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> is a graph showing electric field strength ratios and a photo current distribution at 60 GHz in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph showing an average electric field strength ratio for each length of the electro-absorption modulator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top view of an electro-absorption modulator integrated laser in a second example implementation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top view of an electro-absorption modulator integrated laser in a third example implementation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line C-C of the electro-absorption modulator illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a top view of an electro-absorption modulator integrated laser in a fourth example implementation of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some implementations are specifically described in detail in the following with reference to drawings.

The photo current indicates an electric current that flows when a reverse bias is applied to the EA modulator <b>2</b> under a state in which output light of the semiconductor laser <b>4</b> is transferred to the EA modulator <b>2</b>. A magnitude of the photo current may be substantially proportional to a light absorption amount in the EA modulator <b>2</b>. In other words, the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> indicates the semiconductor laser <b>4</b> side, and the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> indicates the front facet <b>101</b> side. The photo current is large on the position B side, that is, the semiconductor laser <b>4</b> side. This indirectly indicates that a large amount of photogenerated carriers are generated on a light input end side. The photo current may be reduced from a light input end toward the light output end. In other words, a photo current distribution may be not constant in the optical axis direction in the EA modulator <b>2</b>. The photo current may be proportional not only to an intensity of input light, but also to a magnitude of a voltage applied to the EA modulator <b>2</b>. As the voltage applied to the EA modulator <b>2</b> becomes larger, the photo current increases. The voltage applied to the EA modulator <b>2</b> may be applied to the pad electrode <b>8</b> via the electrical conduction means from the outside. The voltage applied to the pad electrode <b>8</b> may be conveyed to the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> via the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b>.

For a first analysis example, a length of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> is 150 &#x3bc;m, and a width) in a direction along an optical axis of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> is 10 &#x3bc;m. A center position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> corresponds to a position within 3% of the light output end side (B&#x2032; side) in a length direction in view of the entire mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>. In a second analysis example, a center position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> corresponds to a center position of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>. In the case of the structure in which the center positions match, the center position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> is at a position of 50% from the light output end side (B&#x2032; side) of a long-side direction in view of the entire mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>. A connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> is hereinafter represented as the position of 3%, the position of 50%, or the like using a percentage from the light output end side to the center position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows results obtained when a high-frequency electric signal of 40 GHz is applied to the pad electrode <b>8</b>. In this example, the length of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> and a length of the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b> are the same. The solid line indicates an electric field strength distribution in the first analysis example (position of 3%), and the dotted line indicates an electric field strength distribution in the second analysis example (position of 50%). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, as compared to the case of the second analysis example, in which the electric field strength may be substantially constant at any position, the electric field strength of the EA modulator <b>2</b> in the first analysis example takes a different value depending on the position. Specifically, the electric field strength may be larger than the electric field strength of the second analysis example on the light input end side (B side), and may be smaller than the electric field strength of the second analysis example on the light output end side (B&#x2032; side). The distribution generated in the electric field strength results from the fact that the connection position between the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> and the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> may be on the light output end side (B&#x2032; side). The high-frequency electric signal applied to the pad electrode <b>8</b> may be conveyed through the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b>, and may be transferred to the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>. The electric signal applied to the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> may be transferred to the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>, and may be transferred to the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b> via the p-type contact layer. Accordingly, when viewed from a contact point between the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> and the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b>, the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> electrically operates as an open stub. As a result, it is assumed that the distribution is generated in the electric field strength on the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>. A strong electric field can be applied to the light input end side, on which the photo current (that is, the photogenerated carriers) may be large. Further, the electric field strength may be reduced gradually from the light input end side toward the light output end side. However, the amount of photogenerated carriers (amount of photo current) may be similarly reduced. With the amount of carriers to be extracted being small, even when the electric field strength becomes small, the carriers can be extracted satisfactorily, and the carrier pileup rarely occurs. As a result, the carrier pileup can be suppressed in the entire EA modulator <b>2</b>. As the applied voltage becomes larger, more photogenerated carriers can be extracted from the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b>, and hence the EA modulator <b>2</b> according to the first example implementation provides a structure with excellent extractability. With the excellent carrier extractability, the EA modulator <b>2</b> has excellent extinction characteristics and high-frequency characteristics, and therefore minimization and/or suppression of the carrier pileup is provided.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the electric field strength of the EA modulator <b>2</b> when high-frequency electric signals of from 10 GHz to 60 GHz are applied to the pad electrode <b>8</b>. Absolute values of the electric field strength are changed depending on the frequency, and hence are each standardized using the position of B&#x2032; as a reference. At 10 GHz, the electric field strength is not greatly changed between the positions of the light input end side B and the light output end side B&#x2032;. However, as the frequency becomes higher, the electric field strength on the light input end side B becomes larger with respect to the light output end side B&#x2032;. In other words, it can be seen that effects obtained by applying a stronger electric field to the light input end side B having a larger photo current becomes more significant as the frequency becomes higher. The carriers tend to pile up more easily as a driving frequency becomes higher, some implementations described herein minimize and/or suppresses the pileup especially when the driving frequency is high, which may be effective for an EA modulator supporting 56 Gbps, for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The electric field strength distributions may also depend on a difference in connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b>. The connection position in a first example analysis example being positions of 3% (frontmost end), 10%, 20%, and 33% (see a fourth example implementation of the present disclosure and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), and with a connection position in the comparative example being a position of 50% (center). The other conditions are the same as those described above. Results of 10 GHz, 20 GHz, 40 GHz, and 60 GHz are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, respectively. The horizontal axis in each figure indicates a position in the optical&#x201c;axi&#x201d; direction. A line plotted as &#x201c;Iph&#x201d; indicates the photo current obtained when a DC voltage is applied, and corresponds to the axis on the right side. The other plots are electric field strength ratios standardized for the respective connection positions described above with respect to the electric field strength obtained in the case in which the connection position is the position of 50%, and correspond to the axis on the left side.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of the electric signal of 10 GHz shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, there may be a tendency that the electric field strength is substantially equal irrespective of the connection position, and is substantially equal at any position in the optical axis direction as compared to the case of the position of 50%. Further, there may be little difference in electric field strength depending on the connection position. In the case of the electric signal of 20 GHz shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, there may be a tendency that the electric field strength ratios become higher on the light input end side B, and that the electric field strength ratios become lower on the light output end side B&#x2032;. This tendency becomes more significant as the frequency becomes higher as is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> of 40 GHz and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> of 60 GHz. Further, as a difference depending on the connection position, the electric field strength ratios for the positions of 3%, 10%, and 20%, at which the connection position may be close to the light output end side B&#x2032;, are substantially equal, but the electric field strength ratio for the position of 33% has a small increasing rate depending on the frequency. It can be seen from this result that, when the connection position between the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> and the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> is set closer to the light output end side B&#x2032; of a center portion of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>, the electric field strength ratios on the light input end side B can be increased. In particular, when the connection position is moved over to a position of 33% or less, the effects become significant. Further, in order to obtain stable effects in consideration of a manufacturing variation, it may be preferred to move the connection position to a position of 20% or less, at which the electric field strength ratios become substantially equal.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Irrespective of the connection position, the electric field strength ratios are lower than 1 at positions that are slightly on the light output end side B&#x2032; side of the center position in the optical axis direction. In a region in which the electric field strength ratios are lower than 1, the electric field strength may be small as compared to the position of 50% in typical configurations, which indicates that extractability for the photogenerated carriers is reduced. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the electric field strength ratios become lower than 1 with a certain position being a boundary. The electric field strength ratios being lower than 1 indicates that the electric field strength is small as compared to the structure having the connection position of 50% in typical configurations. The small electric field strength indicates reduced extractability of the photogenerated carriers. Accordingly, in the region in which the electric field strength ratios are lower than 1, the high-frequency characteristics may be reduced as compared to typical configurations. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the amount of photo current may be not constant from the light input end side B to the light output end side B&#x2032;, and has a distribution of being reduced toward the light output end side B&#x2032;. A total amount of photo current in a region in which the electric field strength ratios are 1 or more accounts for 95% of a total amount of photo current. Conversely, the amount of photo current in the region in which the electric field strength ratios are less than 1 only accounts for 5% of the total amount of photo current. Even when the electric field strength in the region in which 5% of the total amount of photo current is distributed becomes small as compared to the related-art structure, effects on extractability of the photo current are small. Rather, the effect of increasing the extractability of the photo current (proportional to the photogenerated carriers) by increasing the electric field strength in the region in which 95% of the total amount of photo current is distributed is significant, and the increase in extinction characteristics and the increase in high-frequency characteristics are obtained in total. In other words, the features of the present disclosure reside in that, by shifting the connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> from the center portion (50%) of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> to the light output end side B&#x2032;, the distribution of electric field strengths in the direction along the optical axis of the mesa structure is changed. In typical configurations, the electric field strength in the direction along the optical axis of the mesa structure is substantially constant, but in the present disclosure, while the electric field strength on the light output end side B&#x2032;, on which the photo current is small, is reduced, the electric field strength is increased on the light input end side B, on which the photo current is large. As a result, an EA modulator with an improved high-speed responsivity is provided.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, consideration was given to a relationship between a length of the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b>, that is, a modulator length Lmod, and the effects of the present disclosure. In order to support high-speed driving at 25 Gbaud or more, it is efficient to reduce the modulator length to reduce a parasitic capacitance. Here, also in consideration of supporting driving at 56 Gbaud or more, analyses are provided for cases in which the modulator length is 100 &#x3bc;m and 125 &#x3bc;m, respectively, in addition to the above-mentioned case in which the modulator length is 150 &#x3bc;m. Further, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, analyses are provided for each connection position between the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> and the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>.

Further, as is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the electric field strength ratios have a distribution at positions in the optical axis direction. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an average of the electric field strength ratios in a region which is on the light input end side B of the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b>, and in which 95% of the total amount of photo current is distributed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the effect of increasing the electric field strength may be obtained at any modulator length. Further, the effect becomes more significant as the modulator length becomes longer. Further, the modulator length and the effect of increasing the average electric field strength ratio may be substantially proportional, and, at least in a range in which the modulator length may be 100 &#x3bc;m or more and 150 &#x3bc;m or less, the above-mentioned effect can be obtained by moving the connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> over to the light output end side B&#x2032; side. The effect of increasing the average electric field strength ratio may be small when the connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> is 33%, and when the modulator length is 100 &#x3bc;m. In order to obtain the effect of increasing the average electric field strength ratio irrespective of the modulator length, the connection position of the lead-out wire electrode <b>7</b> may be 20% or less. Further, when the connection position may be 10% or less, the effect of increasing the average electric field strength ratio may be closer to its peak.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The analysis assumes that the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b> and the mesa-top electrode <b>6</b> have the same length, but in reality, the multiple quantum well layer <b>10</b> may be slightly longer in consideration of a manufacturing variation.
