Other Aspects</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0059">The present disclosure is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be realized with various configurations without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. For example, the technical features of the embodiments corresponding to the technical features in each embodiment described below can be appropriately replaced or combined to solve some or all of the above-described problems, or to achieve some or all of the above effects. In addition, when the technical feature is not described as essential in the present specification, it can be deleted as appropriate. In addition, when the technical feature is not described as essential in the present specification, it can be appropriately deleted.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">(1) According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a cartridge that is detachably mounted in a liquid ejecting apparatus including a liquid introduction portion. The cartridge includes: a liquid accommodating portion for accommodating a liquid; a liquid supply portion having a supply portion flow path that communicates with the liquid accommodating portion; a valve seat arranged on the supply portion flow path and having a valve seat insertion port into which the liquid introduction portion is inserted; a valve body for closing the valve seat insertion port, arranged on the supply portion flow path, the valve body being located upstream of the valve seat in a circulating direction of the liquid in the supply portion flow path when the liquid is supplied; a biasing member arranged on the supply portion flow path and biasing the valve body toward the valve seat; a cap located downstream of the valve seat in the circulating direction; and a liquid absorbing material in contact with the cap. The cap has a first surface facing the valve seat, a second surface facing the first surface and in contact with the liquid absorbing material, a cap insertion port formed over the first surface and the second surface, into which the liquid introduction portion is inserted, a groove formed in the first surface and facing the valve seat, and a hole formed over the first surface and the second surface and coupled to the groove. The hole is in contact with the liquid absorbing material. According to the aspect, the liquid adhering to the valve seat insertion port of the valve seat is transmitted to an outer surface of the valve seat, and guided to the groove facing the valve seat, due to insertion/removal of the liquid introduction portion of the liquid ejecting apparatus. The liquid that has entered the groove is further transmitted to the groove, and is absorbed by the liquid absorbing material that is in contact with the hole through the hole that is coupled to the groove. Thus, it is possible to prevent the liquid from dripping from the supply portion flow path to the outside of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">(2) In the aspect, the cap may have a plurality of grooves. According to the aspect, it is possible to fully absorb the liquid adhering to the valve seat insertion port, and to prevent the liquid from dripping to the outside of the cartridge over the whole periphery of the valve seat insertion port.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">(3) In the aspect, the groove may have a bottom wall and side surfaces rising from the bottom surface, and a corner may be formed by the bottom surface and the side surfaces. According to the aspect, the liquid is transmitted to the corner by a capillary force, such that the liquid can be reliably guided to the hole.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">(4) In the aspect, the hole may have an inner peripheral surface having a corner portion formed to be recessed outward, and the corner portion may be coupled to the corner. According to the aspect, the liquid guided to the corner of the groove is further transmitted to the corner portion by the capillary force, such that the liquid can be reliably guided to the liquid absorbing material.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">(5) In the aspect, the groove may extend in a separating direction in which the groove is separated from the cap insertion port, and the hole may be formed on an end portion of the groove in the separating direction. According to the aspect, it is possible to arrange the liquid absorbing material away from the cap insertion port. It is possible to enhance a degree of freedom in arrangement of the liquid absorbing material.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">In addition to the aspect described above, the present disclosure can be realized as an aspect such as a method of manufacturing a cartridge, a liquid supply portion of the cartridge, or the like.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
