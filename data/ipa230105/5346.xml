Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When it comes to travel, there are many options available for a traveler to obtain hospitality accommodations. Although hotels are the most common type of hospitality accommodation, guest homes and/or private home rentals are also popular. Notwithstanding the lower cost and privacy offered by private home rentals, security and/or trust can be a greater concern because sometimes a homeowner of the private home rental will unexpectedly return to the private home rental and/or simply the neighborhood is unfamiliar to the traveler.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, the probability of theft is significantly increased while traveling. Since the traveler is often on vacation while traveling, the security risk can create an inconvenient and/or a stressful concern for the traveler. Moreover, the traveler is dependent on the private home rental having an adequate security system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for a portable alarm device that is controlled by the traveler to alert the traveler of a security breach.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present general inventive concept provides a portable alarm device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing and/or other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may be achieved by providing a portable alarm device connected to a mobile device, the portable alarm device including a main body having a hand held size, at least one sensor disposed on and within at least a portion of the main body to illuminate a color in response to detecting movement within a predetermined distance therefrom, and a communication unit disposed on and within at least a portion of the main body to transmit an alert signal from the at least one sensor to the mobile device in response to the at least one sensor detecting movement within the predetermined distance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The communication unit may include a camera to move from retracted within the main body to at least partially extended away from the main body in response to the at least one sensor transmitting the alert signal, such that the camera records at least one of at least one image and at least one video thereon based on the at least one sensor detecting movement.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The portable alarm device may further include at least one biometric reader disposed within at least a portion of the main body to scan at least one of a finger and a toe and store a biometric reading of at least one of the finger and the toe on a storage unit based on at least one unauthorized user contacting the main body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The at least one biometric reader may scan using an entire outer surface of the main body.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and/or other features and utilities of the present generally inventive concept will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a portable alarm device, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of the portable alarm device, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various example embodiments (a.k.a., exemplary embodiments) will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments are illustrated.

In other words, an entire outer surface of the main body <b>110</b> may be used to scan.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">Furthermore, the at least one biometric reader <b>150</b> may transmit a biometric reading of the at least one finger and/or the at least one toe to the storage unit <b>140</b>. As such, the fingerprint and/or the toeprint may be retrieved by the mobile device <b>10</b> using the app. Therefore, the app may provide evidence of at least one unauthorized user contacting the main body <b>110</b> that can be shared with law enforcement. For example, the at least one biometric reader <b>150</b> may provide a record of tampering, attempted tampering, and/or theft of the main body <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">The clip <b>160</b> may be removably disposed on at least a portion of a second surface (i.e. rear surface) of the main body <b>110</b> opposite with respect to the first surface. The clip <b>160</b> may connect the main body <b>110</b> to an external object, such as a door. As such, the clip <b>160</b> may suspend the main body <b>110</b> on the door. Therefore, the main body <b>110</b> may be disposed at any position and/or any location as desired by the user while traveling, such as in a hotel room, a private home rental, and/or a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051">The power button <b>170</b> may be disposed on at least a portion of the second surface of the main body <b>110</b>.
