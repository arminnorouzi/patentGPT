For example, embodiments described herein reduce the overall size of the optical display system in a cost effective manner providing for a compact system architecture while still efficiently projecting desired image light out of an eyepiece and to the user. Embodiments discussed herein reduce light leakage in an optical system by implementing a tri-layout super pupil configuration wherein the illumination sources and incoupling optical elements are rotated rough 120 degrees respective to each other and are positioned in an alternating pattern to form the super pupil area. The tri-layout super configuration being operable to produce a maximum efficiency in the eyepiece waveguide. Embodiments discussed herein allow for compact designs of super pupil areas as the sub-pupil elements are positioned physically closer together. Embodiments discussed herein further utilize truncated sub-pupil designs, to reduce light leakage among the sub-pupils. Truncation elements can be any arbitrary form and placed on the surface of the sub-pupil elements. Moreover, embodiments discussed herein implement absorption pads that are optimized in position, size, and shape to reduce leakage significantly while having minimal impact on the overall brightness and uniformity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Illustrative embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the following drawing figures:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a user's view of augmented reality (AR) through an AR device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a conventional display system for simulating three-dimensional imagery for a user.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate relationships between radius of curvature and focal radius.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a representation of the accommodation-vergence response of the human visual system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates examples of different accommodative states and vergence states of a pair of eyes of the user.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of a representation of a top-down view of a user viewing content via a display system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrates another example of a representation of a top-down view of a user viewing content via a display system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates aspects of an approach for simulating three-dimensional imagery by modifying wavefront divergence.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of a waveguide stack for outputting image information to a user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example of exit beams outputted by a waveguide.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of a stacked waveguide assembly in which each depth plane includes images formed using multiple different component colors.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an example of a set of stacked waveguides that each includes an in-coupling optical element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an example of the one or more stacked waveguides of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> illustrates a top-down plan view of an example of the one or more stacked waveguides of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref> illustrates an example of wearable display system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a side view of a projector assembly including a polarizing beam splitter with a light source injecting light into one side of the beamsplitter and projection optics receiving light from another side of the beamsplitter.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a side view of an augmented reality display system including a light source, a spatial light modulator, optics for illuminating the spatial light modulator and projecting an image of the spatial light modulator (SLM), and a waveguide for outputting image information to a user.

refer to like parts throughout. Unless indicated otherwise, the drawings are schematic and not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a conventional display system for simulating three-dimensional imagery for a user. It will be appreciated that a user's eyes are spaced apart and that, when looking at a real object in space, each eye will have a slightly different view of the object and may form an image of the object at different locations on the retina of each eye. This may be referred to as binocular disparity and may be utilized by the human visual system to provide a perception of depth. Conventional display systems simulate binocular disparity by presenting two distinct images <b>190</b>, <b>200</b> with slightly different views of the same virtual object-one for each eye <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the views of the virtual object that would be seen by each eye were the virtual object a real object at a desired depth. These images provide binocular cues that the user's visual system may interpret to derive a perception of depth.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the images <b>190</b>, <b>200</b> are spaced from the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>by a distance <b>230</b> on a z-axis. The z-axis is parallel to the optical axis of the viewer with their eyes fixated on an object at optical infinity directly ahead of the viewer. The images <b>190</b>, <b>200</b> are flat and at a fixed distance from the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Based on the slightly different views of a virtual object in the images presented to the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, respectively, the</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">eyes may naturally rotate such that an image of the object falls on corresponding points on the retinas of each of the eyes, to maintain single binocular vision. This rotation may cause the lines of sight of each of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>to converge onto a point in space at which the virtual object is perceived to be present. As a result, providing three-dimensional imagery conventionally involves providing binocular cues that may manipulate the vergence of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, and that the human visual system interprets to provide a perception of depth.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Generating a realistic and comfortable perception of depth is challenging, however. It will be appreciated that light from objects at different distances from the eyes have wavefronts with different amounts of divergence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate relationships between distance and the divergence of light rays. The distance between the object and the eye <b>210</b> is represented by, in order of decreasing distance, R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and R<b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, the light rays become more divergent as distance to the object decreases. Conversely, as distance increases, the light rays become more collimated. Stated another way, it may be said that the light field produced by a point (the object or a part of the object) has a spherical wavefront curvature, which is a function of how far away the point is from the eye of the user. The curvature increases with decreasing distance between the object and the eye <b>210</b>. While only a single eye <b>210</b> is illustrated for clarity of illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> and other FIGS. herein, the discussions regarding eye <b>210</b> may be applied to both eyes <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, light from an object that the viewer's eyes are fixated on may have different degrees of wavefront divergence. Due to the different amounts of wavefront divergence, the light may be focused differently by the lens of the eye, which in turn may require the lens to assume different shapes to form a focused image on the retina of the eye. Where a focused image is not formed on the retina, the resulting retinal blur acts as a cue to accommodation that causes a change in the shape of the lens of the eye until a focused image is formed on the retina. For example, the cue to accommodation may trigger the ciliary muscles surrounding the lens of the eye to relax or contract, thereby modulating the force applied to the suspensory ligaments holding the lens, thus causing the shape of the lens of the eye to change until retinal blur of an object of fixation is eliminated or minimized, thereby forming a focused image of the object of fixation on the retina (e.g., fovea) of the eye. The process by which the lens of the eye changes shape may be referred to as accommodation, and the shape of the lens of the eye required to form a focused image of the object of fixation on the retina (e.g., fovea) of the eye may be referred to as an accommodative state.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a representation of the accommodation-vergence response of the human visual system is illustrated. The movement of the eyes to fixate on an object causes the eyes to receive light from the object, with the light forming an image on each of the retinas of the eyes. The presence of retinal blur in the image formed on the retina may provide a cue to accommodation, and the relative locations of the image on the retinas may provide a cue to vergence. The cue to accommodation causes accommodation to occur, resulting in the lenses of the eyes each assuming a particular accommodative state that forms a focused image of the object on the retina (e.g., fovea) of the eye. On the other hand, the cue to vergence causes vergence movements (rotation of the eyes) to occur such that the images formed on each retina of each eye are at corresponding retinal points that maintain single binocular vision. In these positions, the eyes may be said to have assumed a particular vergence state. With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, accommodation may be understood to be the process by which the eye achieves a particular accommodative state, and vergence may be understood to be the process by which the eye achieves a particular vergence state. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the accommodative and vergence states of the eyes may change if the user fixates on another object. For example, the accommodated state may change if the user fixates on a new object at a different depth on the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Without being limited by theory, it is believed that viewers of an object may perceive the object as being &#x201c;three-dimensional&#x201d; due to a combination of vergence and accommodation. As noted above, vergence movements (e.g., rotation of the eyes so that the pupils move toward or away from each other to converge the lines of sight of the eyes to fixate upon an object) of the two eyes relative to each other are closely associated with accommodation of the lenses of the eyes. Under normal conditions, changing the shapes of the lenses of the eyes to change focus from one object to another object at a different distance will automatically cause a matching change in vergence to the same distance, under a relationship known as the &#x201c;accommodation-vergence reflex.&#x201d; Likewise, a change in vergence will trigger a matching change in lens shape under normal conditions.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, examples of different accommodative and vergence states of the eyes are illustrated. The pair of eyes <b>222</b><i>a </i>is fixated on an object at optical infinity, while the pair eyes <b>222</b><i>b </i>are fixated on an object <b>221</b> at less than optical infinity. Notably, the vergence states of each pair of eyes is different, with the pair of eyes <b>222</b><i>a </i>directed straight ahead, while the pair of eyes <b>222</b> converge on the object <b>221</b>. The accommodative states of the eyes forming each pair of eyes <b>222</b><i>a </i>and <b>222</b><i>b </i>are also different, as represented by the different shapes of the lenses <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Undesirably, many users of conventional &#x201c;3-D&#x201d; display systems find such conventional systems to be uncomfortable or may not perceive a sense of depth at all due to a mismatch between accommodative and vergence states in these displays. As noted above, many stereoscopic or &#x201c;3-D&#x201d; display systems display a scene by providing slightly different images to each eye. Such systems are uncomfortable for many viewers, since they, among other things, simply provide different presentations of a scene and cause changes in the vergence states of the eyes, but without a corresponding change in the accommodative states of those eyes. Rather, the images are shown by a display at a fixed distance from the eyes, such that the eyes view all the image information at a single accommodative state. Such an arrangement works against the &#x201c;accommodation-vergence reflex&#x201d; by causing changes in the vergence state without a matching change in the accommodative state. This mismatch is believed to cause viewer discomfort. Display systems that provide a better match between accommodation and vergence may form more realistic and comfortable simulations of three-dimensional imagery.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the human eye typically may interpret a finite number of depth planes to provide depth perception. Consequently, a highly believable simulation of perceived depth may be achieved by providing, to the eye, different presentations of an image corresponding to each of these limited numbers of depth planes. In some embodiments, the different presentations may provide both cues to vergence and matching cues to accommodation, thereby providing physiologically correct accommodation-vergence matching.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, two depth planes <b>240</b>, corresponding to different distances in space from the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, are illustrated. For a given depth plane <b>240</b>, vergence cues may be provided by the displaying of images of appropriately different perspectives for each eye <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. In addition, for a given depth plane <b>240</b>, light forming the images provided to each eye <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may have a wavefront divergence corresponding to a light field produced by a point at the distance of that depth plane <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the illustrated embodiment, the distance, along the z-axis, of the depth plane <b>240</b> containing the point <b>221</b> is 1 m. As used herein, distances or depths along the z-axis may be measured with a zero-point located at the exit pupils of the user's eyes. Thus, a depth plane <b>240</b> located at a depth of 1 m corresponds to a distance of 1 m away from the exit pupils of the user's eyes, on the optical axis of those eyes with the eyes directed towards optical infinity. As an approximation, the depth or distance along the z-axis may be measured from the display in front of the user's eyes (e.g., from the surface of a waveguide), plus a value for the distance between the device and the exit pupils of the user's eyes. That value may be called the eye relief and corresponds to the distance between the exit pupil of the user's eye and the display worn by the user in front of the eye. In practice, the value for the eye relief may be a normalized value used generally for all viewers. For example, the eye relief may be assumed to be 20 mm and a depth plane that is at a depth of 1 m may be at a distance of 980 mm in front of the display.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D</figref>, examples of matched accommodation-vergence distances and mismatched accommodation-vergence distances are illustrated, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the display system may provide images of a virtual object to each eye <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The images may cause the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>to assume a vergence state in which the eyes converge on a point <b>15</b> on a depth plane <b>240</b>. In addition, the images may be formed by a light having a wavefront curvature corresponding to real objects at that depth plane <b>240</b>. As a result, the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>assume an accommodative state in which the images are in focus on the retinas of those eyes. Thus, the user may perceive the virtual object as being at the point <b>15</b> on the depth plane <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">It will be appreciated that each of the accommodative and vergence states of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>are associated with a particular distance on the z-axis. For example, an object at a particular distance from the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>causes those eyes to assume particular accommodative states based upon the distances of the object. The distance associated with a particular accommodative state may be referred to as the accommodation distance, Ad. Similarly, there are particular vergence distances, Vd, associated with the eyes in particular vergence states, or positions relative to one another. Where the accommodation distance and the vergence distance match, the relationship between accommodation and vergence may be said to be physiologically correct. This is considered to be the most comfortable scenario for a viewer.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In stereoscopic displays, however, the accommodation distance and the vergence distance may not always match. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, images displayed to the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be displayed with wavefront divergence corresponding to depth plane <b>240</b>, and the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may assume a particular accommodative state in which the points <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>on that depth plane are in focus. However, the images displayed to the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may provide cues for vergence that cause the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>to converge on a point <b>15</b> that is not located on the depth plane <b>240</b>. As a result, the accommodation distance corresponds to the distance from the exit pupils of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>to the depth plane <b>240</b>, while the vergence distance corresponds to the larger distance from the exit pupils of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>to the point <b>15</b>, in some embodiments. The accommodation distance is different from the vergence distance. Consequently, there is an accommodation-vergence mismatch. Such a mismatch is considered undesirable and may cause discomfort in the user. It will be appreciated that the mismatch corresponds to distance (e.g., VaAd) and may be characterized using diopters.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, it will be appreciated that a reference point other than exit pupils of the eyes <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be utilized for determining distance for determining accommodation-vergence mismatch, so long as the same reference point is utilized for the accommodation distance and the vergence distance. For example, the distances could be measured from the cornea to the depth plane, from the retina to the depth plane, from the eyepiece (e.g., a waveguide of the display device) to the depth plane, and so on.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Without being limited by theory, it is believed that users may still perceive accommodation-vergence mismatches of up to about 0.25 diopter, up to about 0.33 diopter, and up to about 0.5 diopter as being physiologically correct, without the mismatch itself causing significant discomfort. In some embodiments, display systems disclosed herein (e.g., the display system <b>250</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) present images to the viewer having accommodation-vergence mismatch of about 0.5 diopter or less. In some other embodiments, the accommodation-vergence mismatch of the images provided by the display system is about 0.33 diopter or less. In yet other embodiments, the accommodation-vergence mismatch of the images provided by the display system is about 0.25 diopter or less, including about 0.1 diopter or less.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates aspects of an approach for simulating three-dimensional imagery by modifying wavefront divergence.

The light carrying the image information is thus divided into a number of related exit beams that exit the waveguide at a multiplicity of locations and the result is a fairly uniform pattern of exit emission toward the eye <b>210</b> for this particular collimated beam bouncing around within a waveguide.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, one or more DOEs may be switchable between &#x201c;on&#x201d; states in which they actively diffract, and &#x201c;off&#x201d; states in which they do not significantly diffract. For instance, a switchable DOE may comprise a layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystal, in which microdroplets comprise a diffraction pattern in a host medium, and the refractive index of the microdroplets may be switched to substantially match the refractive index of the host material (in which case the pattern does not appreciably diffract incident light) or the microdroplet may be switched to an index that does not match that of the host medium (in which case the pattern actively diffracts incident light).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, a camera assembly <b>630</b> (e.g., a digital camera, including visible light and infrared light cameras) may be provided to capture images of the eye <b>210</b> and/or tissue around the eye <b>210</b> to, e.g., detect user inputs and/or to monitor the physiological state of the user. As used herein, a camera may be any image capture device. In some embodiments, the camera assembly <b>630</b> may include an image capture device and a light source to project light (e.g., infrared light) to the eye, which may then be reflected by the eye and detected by the image capture device.

Light <b>640</b> is injected into the waveguide <b>270</b> at the input surface <b>460</b> of the waveguide <b>270</b> and propagates within the waveguide <b>270</b> by TIR. At points where the light <b>640</b> impinges on the DOE <b>570</b>, a portion of the light exits the waveguide as exit beams <b>650</b>. The exit beams <b>650</b> are illustrated as substantially parallel but, as discussed herein, they may also be redirected to propagate to the eye <b>210</b> at an angle (e.g., forming divergent exit beams), depending on the depth plane associated with the waveguide <b>270</b>. It will be appreciated that substantially parallel exit beams may be indicative of a waveguide with outcoupling optical elements that out-couple light to form images that appear to be set on a depth plane at a large distance (e.g., optical infinity) from the eye <b>210</b>. Other waveguides or other sets of out-coupling optical elements may output an exit beam pattern that is more divergent, which would require the eye <b>210</b> to accommodate to a closer distance to bring it into focus on the retina and would be interpreted by the brain as light from a distance closer to the eye <b>210</b> than optical infinity.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, a full color image may be formed at each depth plane by overlaying images in each of the component colors, e.g., three or more component colors.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of a stacked waveguide assembly in which each depth plane includes images formed using multiple different component colors.

Each depth plane may have three or more component color images associated with it, including: a first image of a first color, G; a second image of a second color, R; and a third image of a third color, B. Different depth planes are indicated in the FIG. by different numbers for diopters (dpt) following the letters G, R, and B. Just as examples, the numbers following each of these letters indicate diopters (1/m), or inverse distance of the depth plane from a viewer, and each box in the FIGS. represents an individual component color image. In some embodiments, to account for differences in the eye's focusing of light of different wavelengths, the exact placement of the depth planes for different component colors may vary. For example, different component color images for a given depth plane may be placed on depth planes corresponding to different distances from the user. Such an arrangement may increase visual acuity and user comfort and/or may decrease chromatic aberrations.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, light of each component color may be outputted by a single dedicated waveguide and, consequently, each depth plane may have multiple waveguides associated with it.

While the waveguides associated with each depth plane are shown adjacent to one another in this drawing for ease of description, it will be appreciated that, in a physical device, the waveguides may all be arranged in a stack with one waveguide per level.

The projector assembly <b>1000</b> includes an illumination source <b>1010</b>, which can include, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers (e.g., laser diodes), or other type of light source. This light may be collimated by collimating optics. The illumination source <b>1010</b> can emit polarized, unpolarized, or partially polarized light. In the illustrated design, the illumination source <b>1010</b> may emit light <b>1012</b> polarized having a p-polarization. A first optical element <b>1015</b> (e.g., a pre-polarizer) is aligned to pass light with the first polarization (e.g., p-polarization).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">This light is directed to the polarizing beam splitter <b>1020</b>. Initially, light passes through an interface <b>1022</b> (e.g., a polarizing interface) of the PBS <b>1020</b>, which is configured to transmit light of the first polarization (e.g., p-polarization). Accordingly, the light continues to and is incident on the spatial light modulator <b>1030</b>. As illustrated, the SLM <b>1030</b> is a reflective SLM configured to retro-reflect the light incident and selectively modulate the light. The SLM <b>1030</b>, for example, includes one or more pixels that can have different states. The light incident on respective pixels may be modulated based on the state of the pixel. Accordingly, the SLM <b>1030</b> can be driven to modulate the light so as to provide an image. In this example, the SLM <b>1030</b> may be a polarization based SLM that modulates the polarization of the light incident thereon. For example, in an on state, a pixel of the SLM <b>1030</b> changes input light from a first polarization state (e.g., p-polarization state) to a second polarization state (e.g., s-polarization state) such that a bright state (e.g., white pixel) is shown. The second polarization state may be the first polarization state modulated (e.g., rotated) by 90&#xb0;. In the on state, the light having the second polarization state is reflected by the interface <b>1022</b> and propagates downstream to the projector optics <b>1040</b>. In an off state, the SLM <b>1030</b> does not change the polarization state of the light incident thereon, for example, does not rotate the input light from the first polarization state, thus a dark state (e.g., black pixel) is shown.

The coupling optic <b>1105</b> may have an asymmetric profile to operate on the light emitted from the light source <b>1110</b> asymmetrically. For example, the coupling optic <b>1105</b> may reduce the divergence a different amount in orthogonal directions (e.g., x and z directions). Such asymmetry in the coupling optic <b>1105</b> may address asymmetry in the light emitted from the light source <b>1110</b> which may include, for example, a laser diode that emits a wider range of angles of light in one direction (e.g., x or z) as opposed to the orthogonal direction (e.g., z or x, respectively).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">As discussed above, the system <b>1100</b>A includes optics <b>1130</b> configured to illuminate the SLM <b>1140</b> that is disposed in an optical path between the light source <b>1110</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>.

For example, a first pixel may be in a first state and rotate polarization while a second pixel may be in a second state and not rotate polarization. The light between the coupling optic <b>1105</b> and the optics <b>1130</b> may fairly uniformly illuminate the SLM <b>1140</b>.

Such polarizers may offer appreciable absorption of unwanted light and therefore increased contrast. Some such polarizers can be made to include one or more dielectric layers on top of the wires and/or multilayer films. In some implementations the SLM <b>1140</b> may be a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) SLM and may include LC cells and a retarder (e.g., compensator). In some implementations, the analyzer <b>1150</b> may be a compensator intended to provide a more consistent polarization rotation (e.g., of 90&#xb0;) of the SLM <b>1140</b> for different angles of incidence and different wavelengths. A compensator may be used to improve contrast of the display by improving the rotation polarization for rays that are incident across a spread of angles and wavelengths. The SLM <b>1140</b> may include, for example, a TN LCoS that is configured to rotate incident light of a first polarization (e.g., s-polarization) to a second polarization (e.g., p-polarization) for a first pixel to produce a bright pixel state as the light will pass through the analyzer <b>1150</b>. Conversely, the SLM <b>1140</b> may be configured to not rotate incident light of the first polarization (e.g., s-polarization) to the second polarization (e.g., p-polarization) for a second pixel such that the reflected light remains the first polarization to produce a dark pixel state as the light will be attenuated or blocked by the analyzer <b>1150</b>. In such a configuration, the polarizer <b>1115</b> closer along the optical path to the light source <b>1110</b> may be oriented different (e.g., orthogonal) to the analyzer <b>1150</b> farther along the optical path from the light source <b>1110</b>. Other, for example, opposite, configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The light is then deflected, for example, turned by the in-coupling optical element <b>1160</b>, so as to be guided in the waveguide <b>1120</b> where it propagates by TIR. The light then impinges on the light distributing element <b>1170</b> turning the light in another direction (e.g., more towards the z direction) causing an increase in dimensions of an eyebox along the direction of the z-axis as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. The light is thus deflected toward the out-coupling optical element <b>1180</b> which causes the light to be directed out of the waveguide <b>1120</b> toward the eye <b>210</b> (e.g., the users eye as shown). Light being coupled out by different portions of the out-coupling optical element <b>1180</b> along the z direction causes an increase in dimensions of the eyebox along at least the direction parallel to the z-axis as defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. Notably, in this configuration, the optics <b>1130</b> are used both for illuminating the SLM <b>1140</b> and projecting an image onto the in-coupling optical element <b>1160</b>. Accordingly, the optics <b>1130</b> may act as projection optics distributing light from the light source <b>1110</b> (e.g., uniformly) as well as imaging optics providing an image of the SLM <b>1140</b> and/or of an image formed by the SLM <b>1140</b> into the eye. The system <b>1100</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref>/B may in some instances be more compact than the system <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In some cases, not employing the PBS <b>1020</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> can possibly reduce cost and/or size of the system. Additionally, without the PBS <b>1020</b>, the system can be more symmetric and is easier to design by shortening the back focal length of the optics <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">As referred to above, alternative configurations are possible. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, for example, in some designs, a system <b>1100</b>C may be configured to pass light having a polarization not rotated by the SLM <b>1140</b>. In one implementation, for example, the SLM <b>1140</b> be a liquid crystal (LC) based SLM and may include vertically aligned (VA) LC on silicon (LCoS). The SLM <b>1140</b> may have a first pixel that is in a first state that does not rotate the polarization and a second pixel that is in a second state that rotates the polarization. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, a singled shared analyzer/polarizer <b>1155</b> is utilized. This analyzer <b>1155</b> may transmit light of a first polarization (e.g., s-polarization) and attenuate or reduce transmission of a second polarization (e.g., p-polarization). Accordingly, light (e.g., s-polarized light) incident on a first pixel in the first state that does not rotate the polarization orientation is reflected from the SLM <b>1140</b> and passes through the analyzer <b>1155</b> to the waveguide <b>1120</b>. Conversely, light (e.g., s polarized light) incident on the second pixel in the second state that rotates the polarization orientation is reflected from the SLM <b>1140</b> and attenuated, reduced, or not passed through the analyzer <b>1155</b> to the waveguide <b>1120</b>. This configuration, may thereby permit the polarizer <b>1115</b> and the analyzer <b>1150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> to be incorporated into a shared optical element, the analyzer <b>1155</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, thereby possibly simplifying the system <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref>/B by reducing the number of optical components. The analyzer <b>1155</b> may be disposed between the waveguide <b>1120</b> and the optics <b>1130</b>. In other implementations, a separate analyzer/polarizer and analyzer/polarizer may be used such as shown in system <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref>/B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate the polarizer <b>1115</b> between the light source <b>1110</b> and the waveguide <b>1120</b>, and the analyzer <b>1140</b> between the optics <b>1130</b> and the waveguide <b>1120</b>.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">A wide variety of other configurations may be employed that utilize the optics <b>1130</b> for both illumination of the SLM <b>1140</b> and imaging of the image formed by the SLM <b>1140</b>. For example, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref> show a single waveguide <b>1120</b>, one or more waveguides such as a stack of waveguide (possibly different waveguides for different color light) may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, for example, illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an example system <b>1200</b>A including a stack <b>1205</b> including waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> that each includes an in-coupling optical element <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>. The waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> may each be configured to output light of one or more different wavelengths, or one or more different ranges of wavelengths. The stack <b>1205</b> may be substantially similar to the stack <b>260</b> and <b>660</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>9</b>A</figref>) and the illustrated waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> of the stack <b>1205</b> may correspond to part of the waveguides <b>670</b>, <b>680</b>, <b>690</b>, however, the stack <b>1205</b> and waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> need not be so limited. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> may be, for example, associated with, included in or on the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b>, respectively. The in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> may be color selective and may primarily divert or redirect certain wavelengths into the corresponding waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> to be guided therein. As illustrated, because the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> are color selective, the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> need not be laterally displaced and may be stacked over each other. Wavelength multiplexing may be employed to couple the particular color into the corresponding waveguide. For example, the red in-coupling optical element may in-couple red light into the waveguide designated for propagating red light while not in-coupling blue or green light, which is coupled instead into the other waveguides by the other blue and green color selective waveguides, respectively.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some implementations, the light source <b>1110</b> may be a multi-color light source capable of emitting different colored light at different times. For instance, the light source <b>1110</b> may emit red, green, and blue (RGB) light and may be configured to, at a first time period emit red and not more than negligible amounts of green and blue, at a second time period emit green and not more than negligible amounts of red and blue, and at a third time period emit blue and not more than negligible amounts of red and green. These cycles can be repeated and the SLM <b>1140</b> can be coordinated so as to produce the suitable pattern of pixel states for the particular color (red, green, or blue) to provide the proper image color component for a given image frame. The different waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> of the stack <b>1205</b> may each be configured to output light with different respective colors. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> may be configured to output blue, green, and red color light respectively. Of course, other colors are possible, for example, the light source <b>1110</b> may emit other colors and the color selective in-coupling optical element <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>, out-coupling optical element etc., can be configured for such other colors. Additionally, individual red, green, and blue emitters may be located close enough in proximity to effectively function as a single pupil light source. The red, green, and blue emitters may be combined with lenses and dichroic splitters to form a single red, green, and blue pupil source. The multiplexing of a single pupil may be extended beyond, or in addition to, color selectivity and may include the use of polarization sensitive gratings and polarization switching. These color or polarization gratings can also be used in combination with multiple display pupils to increase the number of layers that can be addressed.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The different in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> in the different waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> may be disposed over and/or under and aligned laterally with respect to each other (e.g., in the x and z directions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>) as opposed to being laterally displaced with each other and not aligned. Accordingly, in some implementations, for example, the different in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> can be so configured such that light of a first color can be coupled by the in-coupling optical element <b>1260</b> into waveguide <b>1120</b> to be guided therein and light of a second color different from the first color can pass through the in-coupling optical element <b>1260</b> to the next in-coupling optical element <b>1262</b> and can be coupled by the in-coupling optical element <b>1262</b> into the waveguide <b>1122</b> to be guided therein. Light of a third color different from the first color and the second color can pass through in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b> and <b>1262</b> to the in-coupling optical element <b>1264</b> and can be coupled into the waveguide <b>1124</b> to be guided therein. Additionally, the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> may be polarization selective. For example, the different in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> can be so configured such that light of a certain polarization either is coupled into the waveguide by a corresponding polarization selective incoupling optical element <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> or passes through the in-coupling optical element <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Depending on the configuration, the SLM <b>1140</b> may include a polarization based SLM that modulates the polarization. The system <b>1200</b>A can include polarizers and/or analyzers so as to modulate the light injected into the stack <b>1205</b> on a pixel by pixel basis, for example, depending on the state of the respective pixel (e.g., whether the pixel rotates the polarization orientation or not). Various aspects of such systems that employ polarization based SLMs are discussed above and any one of such features may be employed in combination with any other features described herein. Other designs, however, are still possible.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, a deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b> may be employed. For example, the SLM <b>1140</b> may include one or more moveable optical elements such as moveable mirror that can reflect and/or deflect light along different directions depending on the state of the optical element. The SLM <b>1140</b> may, for example, include one or more pixels including such optical elements such as micro-mirrors or reflectors. The SLM <b>1140</b> may incorporate, for example, Digital Light Processing (DLP&#x2122;) technology which uses digital micromirror devices (DMD). An example of a system <b>1200</b>B that uses such a deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. The system <b>1200</b>B includes a deflection based SLM <b>1140</b> as well as a light dump <b>1250</b>. The light dump <b>1250</b> may include an absorbing material or structure that is configured to absorb light. The deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b> may include one or more micro moveable mirrors that can be selectively tilted to deflect light in different directions. For example, the deflection based SLM <b>1140</b> may be configured to deflect light from the light source <b>1110</b> incident thereon to the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> when a given pixel is in a bright state. As discussed above, this light will thus be coupled by one of the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>, for example, depending on the color of light, into one of the respective waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> and directed to the eye <b>210</b>. Conversely, when a given pixel is in a dark state, light from the light source <b>1110</b> may be deflected to the light dump <b>1250</b> and the light is not coupled by one of the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> into one of the respective waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> and directed to the eye <b>210</b>. The light may instead be absorbed by absorbing material comprising the light dump <b>1250</b>. In some implementations, the analyzer <b>1150</b> may be a polarizer (e.g., &#x201c;clean-up&#x201d; polarizer) used to eliminate undesired reflections from the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>. This polarizer may be useful as the optics <b>1130</b> may include plastic optical elements, which have birefringence and may alter polarization. A &#x201c;clean-up&#x201d; polarizer may attenuate or remove light (e.g., reflections) having unwanted polarization from being directed onto the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b>. Other types of light conditioning elements may be disposed between the SLM <b>1140</b> and the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> such as between the optics <b>1130</b> and the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b>. For example, such a light conditioning element may also include a circular polarizer (i.e., linear polarization and retarder such as a quarter waveplate). The circular polarizer may reduce the amount of reflection from the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> or in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> that are again incident on the waveguides <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> and coupled therein. Reflected light may be circular polarized and may possess a circular polarization opposite to that of the incident light (e.g., right-handed circularly polarizer light is converted to left-handed circular polarized light, or vice versa, upon reflection). The retarder in the circular polarizer may convert the circular polarized light to linearly polarized light, such as of the orthogonal polarization of the polarizer, which is attenuated, e.g., absorbed, by the linear polarizer in the circular polarizer. The clean-up polarizer may be used with a polarization independent modulator such as a DMD. As mentioned above, the clean-up polarizer may be useful for suppressing reflections and/or improving coupling of light into the in-coupling optical elements <b>1260</b>, <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b> with optimal polarization states.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> illustrates a side or cross-sectional view of such the system <b>1200</b>B, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> shows a top view of the lateral arrangement of the in-coupling optical element <b>1264</b>, the light dump <b>1250</b>, and the light source <b>1110</b>.

Such a lens <b>1930</b> may provide for refractive correction of the eye <b>210</b>. Additionally, if the prescription lens <b>1930</b> is a variable lens it may provide different refractive corrections for multiple users. Variable focus lenses are discussed above. The eye <b>210</b> may for example have myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism. The lens <b>1930</b> may have a prescription (e.g., optical power) to reduce the refractive error of eye <b>210</b>. The lens <b>1930</b> may be spherical and/or cylindrical and may be positive or negative. The lens <b>1930</b> may be disposed between the stack <b>1905</b> and the eye <b>210</b> such that light from both the world <b>510</b> and from the stack <b>1905</b> undergoes the correction provided by the lens <b>1930</b>. In some implementations, the lens <b>1930</b> may be disposed between the eye <b>210</b> and the first variable focus optical element <b>1910</b>. Other locations for the lens <b>1930</b> are possible. In some embodiments, prescriptive lenses may be variable and allow multiple user prescriptions to be implemented.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In some designs, the system <b>1900</b> may include an adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b>. In some implementations, this adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may be disposed on a side of the stack of waveguides <b>1900</b> opposite to the eye <b>210</b> (e.g., world side). Accordingly, this adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may be disposed between the stack of waveguides <b>1900</b> and the world <b>510</b>. The adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may include an optical element that provides variable attenuation of light transmitted there through. The adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may include electrical inputs to control the level of attenuation. In some cases the adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> is configured to increase attenuation when the eye <b>210</b> is exposed to bright light, such as when the user goes outdoors. Accordingly, the system <b>1900</b> may include a light sensor to sense the brightness of the ambient light and control electronics to drive the adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> to vary the attenuation based on the light levels sensed by the light sensor.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Different types of adjustable dimmers <b>1940</b> may be employed. Such adjustable dimmers <b>1940</b> may include variable liquid crystal switches with a polarizer, electrochromic material, photochromic material, and the like. The adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may be configured to regulate the amount of light entering and/or transmitted through the stack <b>1905</b> from the world <b>510</b>. The adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> can be used in some cases to reduce the amount of light from the ambient that passes through the waveguide stack <b>1900</b> to the eye <b>210</b> that may otherwise provide glare and decrease the user's ability to perceive virtual objects/images injected into the eye <b>210</b> from the stack <b>1905</b>. Such an adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may reduce the incident bright ambient light from washing out the images that are projected into the eye <b>210</b>. The contrast of the virtual object/image presented to the eye <b>210</b> may therefore be increased with the adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b>. In contrast, if ambient light is low, the adjustable dimmer <b>1940</b> may be adjusted to reduce attenuation so that the eye <b>210</b> can more readily see objects in the world <b>510</b> in front of the user. The dimming or attenuation may be across the system or localized to one or more portion of the system. For example, multiple localized portions may be dimmed or set to attenuate light from the world <b>510</b> in front of the user <b>210</b>. These localized portions may be separated from each other by portions without such increased dimming or attenuation. In some cases, only one portion is dimmed or caused to provide increased attenuation with respect to other portions of the eyepiece. Other components may be added in different designs. Also the arrangement of the components can be different. Similarly, one or more components may be excluded from the system.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">An example of another configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> shows a side view of a system <b>2000</b> including laterally displaced in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> on different waveguides as well as a color filter array <b>2030</b> including laterally displaced color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> aligned with respective in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>. The color filter array <b>2030</b> may be disposed on the side of a stack <b>2005</b> proximate the eye <b>210</b> and optics <b>1130</b>. The color filter array <b>2030</b> may be between the stack <b>2005</b> and the optics <b>1130</b>. The color filter array <b>2030</b> may be disposed in or on a coverglass <b>2050</b> that is located between the stack <b>2005</b> and the optics <b>1130</b>. The color filter array <b>2030</b> may include one or more different color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> such as a red color filter, a green color filter, and a blue color filter, laterally dispose with respect to each other. The system <b>2000</b> includes lights sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> laterally displaced with respect to each other. These light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> may include different color light sources such as red, green, and blue light sources. The color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may be transmissive or transparent filters. In some implementations, the color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> include absorption filters, however, the color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may also include reflective filters. The color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> in the color filter array <b>2030</b> may be separated and/or surrounded by a mask such as an opaque mask that would reduce propagation of stray light. The filters in the color filter array <b>2030</b> may be used to reduce or eliminate undesired reflections within the system such as from the waveguides and/or in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> from reentering the waveguides used for different colors through in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> for different colors. Examples of color filter arrays can be found in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/683,412, filed on Aug. 22, 2017, entitled &#x201c;PROJECTOR ARCHITECTURE INCORPORATING ARTIFACT MITIGATION, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety; and U.S. Application No. 62/592,607 filed on Nov. 30, 2017, entitled PROJECTOR ARCHITECTURE INCORPORATING ARTIFACT MITIGATION, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The mask may be a black mask and may include absorbing material to reduce propagation and reflection of stray light. The light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> may be disposed with respect to the optics <b>1130</b> and SLM <b>1140</b> to couple light in to corresponding color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> in the color filter array <b>2030</b>. For example, the color filter array <b>2030</b> may include first, second, and third, (e.g., red, green, and blue) color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> that are disposed to receive light from the first, second, and third, light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b>, respectively. The first, second, and third, (e.g., red, green, and blue) color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may be aligned (e.g., in the x and z direction) with the respective in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>. Accordingly, light from the first light source <b>1110</b> will be directed through the first color filter <b>2040</b> and to a first in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b>, light from the second light source <b>1112</b> will be directed through the second color filter <b>2042</b> and to a second in-coupling optical element <b>1362</b>, and light from the third light source <b>1114</b> will be directed through the third color filter <b>2044</b> and to a third in-coupling optical element <b>1364</b>. In some implementations, the incoupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> may be color specific. For example, the first and second in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b> may be configured to couple light of respective first and second colors into the first and second waveguides, respectively. Similarly, the first, second, and third in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> may be configured to couple light of respective first, second, and third colors into the first, second, and third waveguides, respectively. The first in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b> may be configured to couple more light of the first color than the second color (or the third color) into the first waveguide. The second in-coupling optical element <b>1362</b> may be configured to couple more light of the second color than the first color (or the third color) into the second waveguide. The third in-coupling optical element <b>1364</b> may be configured to couple more light of the third color than the first color or the second color into the second waveguide. In other configurations, the in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> may be broad band. For example, the first in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b> may be configured to couple light of first, second, and third colors into the first waveguide. The second in-coupling optical element <b>1362</b> may be configured to couple light of first, second, and third colors into the second waveguide. The third in-coupling optical element <b>1364</b> may be configured to couple light of first, second, and third colors into the third waveguide. The plurality of color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b>, may, however, be color specific, selectively transmitting light of a particular color. For example, the first color filter <b>2040</b> may transmit more of the first color than the second color (and third color). The second color filter <b>2042</b>, may transmit more of the second color than the first color (and third color). The third color filter <b>2044</b>, may transmit more of the third color than the first color and second color. Likewise, the first, second, and third color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may be color filters that selectively transmit the first, second, and third color, respectively. Accordingly, the first, second, and third color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may be band pass filters that selectively pass the first, second, and third colors, respectively. In some implementations, the first, second, and third light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b>, may selectively emit the first, second, and third colors, respectively. For example, the first light source <b>1110</b>, may emit more of the first color than the second color (and third color). The second light source <b>2042</b>, may emit more of the second color than the first color (and third color). The third light source <b>2044</b>, may transmit more of the third color than the first color and second color. The color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b>, may reduce the amount of stray light that is inadvertently directed to a particular in-coupling optical element. In other implementations, the one or more of the light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> are broad band light sources. For example, the first light source <b>1110</b> may emit the first and second (and possibly third) colors. The second light source <b>1112</b> might also emit the first and second, (and possibly third) colors. The third light source <b>1114</b> might also emit the first and second (and possibly third) colors. Although three filters are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>G</figref>, more or less filters may be included. For example, in some implementations, two filters (not three) may be used. Accordingly, two colors corresponding to the two color filters may be selectively transmitted into by the filters. In some such implementations, two corresponding in-coupling optical elements may be used and be aligned with the two filters. In some implementations, the two in-coupling optical elements selectively couple the two colors, respectively, into the two respective waveguides. In some implementations, two light sources may be used instead of three. Other variations and other numbers of components may be used. Also, the color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may or may not be integrated together in a single array.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">As discussed above, the components and their location and arrangement may vary. For example, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> shows an analyzer <b>1150</b> disposed between the optics <b>1130</b> and the stack <b>1905</b>, the analyzer <b>1150</b> may be located at a different position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> shows an analyzer <b>1150</b> located between the optics <b>1130</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>. In some designs, the analyzer (e.g., polarizer) <b>1150</b> may attach directly to the SLM <b>1140</b>. For instance, the analyzer <b>1150</b> may be adhered to or mechanically coupled to the SLM <b>1140</b>. For example, the analyzer <b>1150</b> may be glued, cemented to the SLM <b>1140</b> (e.g., to the SLM window) using adhesive. Accordingly, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> shows a gap between the analyzer <b>1150</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>, in some designs no gap between the analyzer <b>1150</b> and SLM <b>1140</b> is present. The analyzer <b>1150</b> may be affixed to the SLM <b>1140</b> mechanically (e.g., using a mechanical fixture), and in such cases may or may not include a gap between the analyzer <b>1150</b> and SLM <b>1140</b>. Birefringence from the optics <b>1130</b> may be cleaned up by positioning a polarizer directly on the SLM <b>1140</b> as described above. In some implementations, an analyzer <b>1150</b> disposed between the optics <b>1130</b> and the in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> may also be included to clean up the polarization of light outbound from the optics <b>1130</b> (e.g., as illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>). In addition, a retarder (not shown) such as a quarter waveplate may be included proximal the SLM <b>1140</b>, for example, between the optics <b>1130</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>. As used herein a quarter waveplate may refer to a quarter wave retarder regardless of if the quarter wave retarder comprises a plate, film, or other structure for providing a quarter wave of retardance. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, for example, the retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may be disposed between the analyzer <b>1150</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>. The retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may be used for skew ray management. For example, the retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may, for example, compensate for variations caused by differences in wavelength and angle of incidents on the SLM <b>1140</b>. As discussed above, a compensator may be included and may provide a more consistent polarization rotation (e.g., of 90&#xb0;) of the SLM <b>1140</b> for different angles of incidence and different wavelengths. The compensator may be used to increase contrast of the display by providing more consistent orthogonal rotation. The compensator may be attached or affixed to the SLM <b>1140</b> such as described above. For example, glue, cement or other adhesive may be used. The compensator may also be attached to the SLM <b>1140</b> using a mechanical fixture. A gap or no gap may be included between the compensator or SLM <b>1140</b>. Other light conditioning optics may also be included in addition or in the alternative and may be affixed to the SLM <b>1140</b> such as described above with respect to the analyzer <b>1150</b> and/or compensator.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In some embodiments, large angle spreads (e.g., &#x2212;70 degrees) may be used. The angle spread may refer to an angle of light entering into the optics <b>1130</b>, for example, from the light sources <b>1110</b>. <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b>, and/or an angle of light exiting the optics <b>1130</b> into the in-coupling optical elements <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>. In these embodiments, a thinner SLM <b>1140</b> may be used. For example, if the SLM <b>1140</b> is a liquid crystal (LC) SLM (e.g., a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) SLM), the LC layer may be made thinner to accommodate the large angle spread.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">A double pass retardance through a polarizer and the analyzer <b>1150</b> may need to be a half wave. The polarizer may be between the optics <b>1130</b> and the analyzer <b>1150</b>. The double pass retardance may be a function of a ratio of a refractive index of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b> and a thickness of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b>. For a given refractive index of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b> and a given thickness of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b>, going in and out of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b> at large angles makes a path length of light longer than going in and out of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b> at small angles. The path length is related to the thickness of the LCoS SLM <b>1140</b>. In one example, a LCoS SLM may have a first refractive index and a first thickness. For small angles, a double pass retardance of the LCoS SLM having the first refractive index and the first thickness may be a half wave. For large angles, a double pass retardance of the LCoS SLM having the first refractive index and the first thickness may not be a half wave (e.g., may be greater than a half wave). The thickness of the LCoS SLM may be changed from the first thickness to a second thickness, where the second thickness is less than the first thickness. For small angles, a double pass retardance of the LCoS SLM having the first refractive index and the second thickness may not be a half wave (e.g., may be less than a half wave). For large angles, a double pass retardance of the LCoS SLM having the first refractive index and the second thickness may be a half wave.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Also, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> illustrate the use of a polarization-based SLM <b>1140</b>, other types of SLMs may be utilized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref>, for example, illustrates use of a deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b> such as a movable micro-mirror based SLM. As discussed above, such SLM <b>1140</b> may include Digital Light Processing (DLP&#x2122;) and digital micromirror device (DMD) technology. As discussed above, the deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b> can couple light from one of the light source <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> into the respective in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b>, depending on the state of the pixel of the SLM <b>1140</b>. In one state, the light from the light source <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> would be directed to the respective in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>D</figref>. In another state, the light from the light source <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> would be directed away from the in-coupling optical element <b>1360</b>, <b>1362</b>, <b>1364</b> as illustrated in FIG. ZOE. In some implementations, while in the off state, the black absorbing mask between color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> in the color filter array <b>2030</b> may serve as a light dump. As described above, the color filters <b>2040</b>, <b>2042</b>, <b>2044</b> may be surrounded and/or separated by a mask such as an absorbing mask (e.g., a black mask). This mask may include absorbing material such that of the light incident more is absorbed than reflected therefrom. This mask may also be opaque.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Other variations are possible. Although the light sources are shown as emitters <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> (e.g., LEDs, laser diodes) coupled to coupling optic <b>1105</b> such as nonimaging optical coupling element (e.g., compound parabolic collectors (CPC) or cones), other configurations are possible. For example, the coupling optic <b>1105</b> (e.g., CPC) may be tilted with respect to a stack of waveguides. In some cases the projector (i.e., the optics <b>1130</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>) may be tilted relative to the eyepiece (e.g., the stack of waveguides). In some implementations, the lens optics <b>1130</b> is tilted with respect to the SLM <b>1140</b> to reduced distortion such as keystone distortion. A Scheimplug configuration may be employed to reduce such distortion. Components may be tilted (e.g., optics <b>1130</b> and/or spatial light modulator <b>1140</b>) as needed, for example, to fit more conformally about a head and/or face. As described above, the light emitter(s) and/or coupling optic <b>1105</b> may be tilted. In some configurations, the assembly including the waveguides may be tilted with a side closer to a side of the eye <b>210</b> (e.g. temporal side) being closer to the eye <b>210</b> to increase perceived field of view of a binocular system as a whole (at a cost of binocular overlap).</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">As discussed above, components and their location and arrangement may vary. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>F</figref> is a side view of a system <b>2000</b>F including cover glass <b>2050</b> disposed between the stack <b>2005</b> and the optics <b>1130</b>. In some designs, the light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> may be disposed on a world side of the cover glass <b>2050</b> and configured to propagate light through the cover glass <b>2050</b> to the optics <b>1130</b> and SLM <b>1140</b>. As illustrated, the cover glass <b>2050</b> may extend laterally (e.g., parallel to the x axis) beyond the stack <b>2005</b> such that light emitted by the light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> enters the optics <b>1130</b> without passing through waveguides in the stack <b>2005</b>. Although the system <b>2000</b>F depicts a deflection-based SLM <b>1140</b>, similar configurations of the light source may also be used with a non-deflection-based SLM or in with any other configuration or features disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>G</figref> is a side view of a system <b>2000</b>G including cover glass <b>2060</b> disposed on the world side of the stack <b>2005</b> (i.e., opposite the side of the stack <b>2005</b> proximal the optics <b>1130</b>.

The light source <b>1110</b> may be disposed with respect to a polarizer <b>1115</b> configured to recycle light having an undesired polarization. The polarizer <b>1115</b> may include, for example, a wire grid polarizer that transmits light of a first polarization and retro reflects light of a second opposite polarization. Accordingly, light <b>2110</b> may be emitted from the light source <b>1110</b> and impinge on the polarizer <b>1115</b>. The polarizer <b>1115</b> may transmit light of the first polarization, for which a projector (not shown) is configure to use. For example, an SLM may properly operate with light of this first polarization. Light of the second polarization <b>2120</b> is reflected back toward the light source <b>1110</b> and can be recycled. The polarization of the light <b>2120</b> may be altered, for polarization rotated, after reflecting off portions (e.g., sidewalls) of the coupling optic (not shown) such as non-imaging optics like the compound parabolic collector (CPC) at various angles. Some light having suitable polarization (e.g., polarization orientation), that may be passed by the polarizer <b>1115</b> may result. Multiple reflections may change polarization of the light and may cause light to exit with a desired polarization. This recycled light <b>2130</b> is then emitted back toward the polarizer <b>1115</b>. Such a configuration may improve efficiency, e.g., energy efficiency as more of the desired polarization is produced.

The light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may include lenses or other optics to collect light from the light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b>. The light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> may be laser diodes or other emitters that emit light over a wide range of angles. The light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may be used to collect much of that light. The light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> may emit light asymmetrically. For example, light may be emitted in a wider range of angles in one direction (e.g., x or z direction) than in the orthogonal directions (e.g., z or x direction). Accordingly, the light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may be asymmetric. For example, the light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may be have different optical power in different possible orthogonal directions. The light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may, for example, include lenses such as anamorphic lenses. The light collection optics <b>2210</b>, <b>2212</b>, <b>2214</b> may also possibly include non-imaging optics. Apertures <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b> may be included. A diffuser <b>2230</b> may also be included proximal the apertures <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b>, for example, when the light sources <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1114</b> lasers such as laser diode. With the diffuser proximal the apertures <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b>, the apertures may appear to be the location of the laterally displaced light sources. The apertures <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b> may be matched with in-coupling optical elements on a waveguide or waveguides via optics and SLM as discussed above. For example, each aperture <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b> may be matched with a respective in-coupling optical element. Similarly, in certain implementations, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, each aperture <b>2220</b>, <b>2222</b>, <b>2224</b> may be matched with respective groups of (e.g., color selective) in-coupling optical elements.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">A wide range of system variations and configurations are possible. For example, although the linearly polarized light is described as being propagated through the optics <b>1130</b> to the SLM <b>1140</b> and back through the optics to the waveguide stack, in some designs circular polarized light may be used instead. For example, circularly polarized light may be directed into the optics <b>1130</b>. A retarder such as a quarter waveplate may be disposed such that this light passes through the retarder prior to being incident on the SLM. The retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may be disposed between the optics <b>1130</b> and the SLM <b>1140</b>. In some cases, such as described above, the retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may be affixed to the SLM <b>1140</b>, such as for example, using adhesive or a mechanical fixture. The retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate) may transform the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light after reflection from the SLM <b>1140</b>. Accordingly, in some implementations, circular polarized light may again pass through the optics <b>1130</b> toward the stack. Another retarder (e.g., quarter waveplate), for example, proximal to the analyzer <b>1150</b> may transform the circular polarized light into linearly polarized light that may or may not pass through the analyzer depending on the linear polarization (e.g., orientation). Pixels of the SLM <b>1140</b> may be have states that can be varied to rotate or not rotate the polarization. Still other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref> is a side view of an augmented reality display system <b>2300</b> including a light source <b>2305</b>, a polarization rotator <b>2307</b>, optics having optical power (e.g., lenses) <b>2320</b>, polarizers <b>2312</b>, <b>2335</b> such as linear polarizers (e.g. horizontal or vertical polarizers), retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b> such as quarter wave retarders (e.g., quarter waveplates), and at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> for outputting image information to a user. Such a configuration can be used to illuminate a reflective spatial light modulator (not shown) such that light emitted from light source <b>2305</b> is reflected from the spatial light modulator and is coupled into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> to be directed to a user's eye. The configuration and placement of these elements, particularly the polarizers and retarders, may reduce or eliminate reflections from optical surfaces within the system such as surfaces from the optics <b>2320</b>, which may otherwise result in ghost images being visible to the user. For example, optical elements that are polarization selective and/or that have retardance (e.g., polarizers <b>2312</b>, <b>2335</b> and retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b>) can be arranged and configured to convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light that changes from left-handed to right-handed or right-handed to left-handed upon reflection from optical surfaces. Similarly, such optical elements that are polarization selective and/or that have retardance (e.g., polarizers <b>2312</b>, <b>2335</b> and retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b>) can be arranged and configured to convert circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light that can be attenuated or filtered out by the polarizers (e.g., linear polarizers). Circular polarizers that transform linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa may be fabricated with such optical elements that are polarization selective and that have retardance (e.g., polarizers <b>2312</b>, <b>2335</b> and retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b>). For example, a circular polarizer may comprise a linear polarizer and a quarter wave retarder. Circular polarizers can be used to convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light having a first state (e.g., handedness) and to filter out circularly polarized light having a second state (e.g., handedness) that is of a different first state. For example, circular polarizers can be used to convert linearly polarized light having a certain orientation into left-handed circular polarized light and to filter out circular polarized light that is right-handed circularly polarized. Circular polarizers can also be used to convert linearly polarized light having a certain orientation into right-handed circular polarized light and to filter out circular polarized light that is left-handed circularly polarized. Circular polarizers or other configurations of optical elements that include retardance that can be used to transform linearly polarized light into circular polarizer light and back and that can selectively filter linearly polarized light can be used to reduce back reflection from optical surfaces as discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">It is noted that left-hand and right-hand circular polarization is illustrated with clockwise and counter-clock-wise arrows, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B</figref>.

In some implementation, the ray <b>2310</b> can pass through the polarization rotator <b>2307</b>. The rotator <b>2307</b> is optional and can be used to rotate the polarization of the light from the light source <b>2305</b>, e.g., ray <b>2310</b>. In various implementations, the rotator <b>2307</b> can rotate the angle of the polarization (e.g., of the linear polarization). For example, the rotator <b>2307</b> can rotate the linear polarization of the ray <b>2310</b> to an orientation aligned with the first polarizer <b>2312</b> so as to be transmitted therethrough. In some implementations, the polarization rotation <b>2307</b> may comprise a retarder, for example, a half-wave retarder in some cases. The optic axis of the half-wave retarder may be oriented to rotate the polarization of the light from the light source <b>2305</b> from vertical to horizontal or vice versa. Alternatively the polarization rotator <b>2307</b> may be configured to rotate the angle of polarization of linearly polarized light emitted from the light source <b>2305</b> by different amounts. The polarization rotator <b>2307</b> need not be included in the system. For example, in implementations where the light source <b>2305</b> emits light having the same polarization as the first polarizer <b>2312</b>, the polarization rotator <b>2307</b> may be excluded. As illustrated, the light, for example, the ray <b>2310</b>, passes through a polarizer <b>2312</b>, here shown as a horizontal polarizer. In instance where light from the light source <b>2305</b> is unpolarized, the light transmitted through the horizontal polarizer <b>2312</b>, shown as ray <b>2310</b>, is linearly polarized (e.g., horizontally polarized) after passing through the polarizer <b>2312</b>. While horizontal linear polarizers are used in this example, it will be understood that the principles taught can be applied using vertical linear polarizers. Alternatively, linear polarizers having different orientations other than vertical or linear may also be used.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The horizontally polarized light ray <b>2310</b> travels through the retarder <b>2315</b>, here shown as a quarter wave retarder. This retarder <b>2315</b> may include sufficient retardance to transform the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light. For example, the horizontally polarized light may be converted into left-handed circularly polarized light as illustrated by the curved (e.g., clockwise directed) arrow. In this example, the combination of the polarizer <b>2312</b> and the retarder <b>2315</b> (e.g., quarter wave) forms a circular polarizer, referred to here as the first circular polarizer, that can convert light of a particular linear polarization (e.g., horizontal or vertical polarization) into a particular circular polarization (e.g., left- or right-handed circular polarization or vice versa). A circular polarizer may also block light of a particular circular polarization (e.g., right- or left-handed circular polarization) depending on the configuration.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In some implementations, various optical elements have birefringence. In certain such cases, the retarder <b>2315</b> may include an amount of retardance sufficient to convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and need not be a quarter waveplate. More or less than a quarter wave of retardance may be included in the retarder <b>2315</b> as retardance may be contributed by other optical elements. Similarly, retardance can be distributed in a number of optical elements. As another example, multiple retarders may be employed to provide the appropriate amount of retardance.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">The circularly polarized ray <b>2310</b> (here left-handed circularly polarized) then passes through the optics <b>2320</b>. Undesirable reflections may occur at any interface in the system with media having dissimilar refractive indices such as, for example, air to material interfaces. These reflections can be problematic if they are allowed to enter the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> as this reflected light may be directed into the user's eye and form &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; images visible in the user's eye. For example, in an instance where the display projects a first image into the viewer's eye with the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b>, a second faint duplicate image that is displaced (e.g., laterally displaced) with respect to the first image may also be seen by the user. Such &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; images, formed by reflections from optical surfaces that are directed into the user's eye, may be distracting or otherwise degrade the viewing experience. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, light such as a reflected ray <b>2325</b> can be reflected from a lens within the optics <b>2320</b>. This light may be directed toward the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b>, which is configured to direct light into the user's eye for presenting images thereto. However, in this case, the circularly polarized light reverses handedness. For example, upon reflecting off of the lens, the direction of the circular polarization is changed (e.g., from left-handed to right-handed). The right-handed reflected ray <b>2325</b> then travels through the retarder <b>2315</b> and is transformed into linearly polarized light having a different (e.g., orthogonal) linear polarization than that which is transmitted by the polarizer <b>2312</b>. In this case, for example, the light reflected from the optical surface of the lens is converted by the retarder <b>2315</b> into vertical linear polarization, which is orthogonal to the polarization transmitted by the horizontal linear polarizer <b>2312</b>. The horizontal linear polarizer <b>2312</b> selectively passes horizontally polarized light and filters out vertically polarized light. Thus, the reflected ray <b>2325</b> is attenuated and/or not transmitted by the horizontal linear polarizer <b>2312</b> and is prevented from reaching the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> or at least a reduced amount of such reflected light reaches the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> or is coupled therein, for example, through in-coupling optical elements (e.g., one or more in-coupling gratings). The result would be similar for left-handed circularly polarized rays reflected from different optical surfaces of the optics <b>2320</b> or other optical surfaces on different optical elements.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">As illustrated, the display system <b>2300</b> further includes a second retarder <b>2330</b> (e.g., quarter wave retarder or quarter waveplate) as well as second polarizer <b>2335</b> (e.g., linear polarizer) disposed between the optics <b>2320</b> and the spatial light modulator (not shown).

The second retarder <b>2330</b> is disposed between the optics <b>2320</b> and the second polarizer <b>2335</b>. Likewise, the second polarizer <b>2335</b> is disposed between the second retarder <b>2330</b> and the spatial light modulator.

Likewise, the second retarder <b>2330</b> converts the circularly polarized light back to the original linear polarization state that was output by the first polarizer <b>2312</b>. As will be discussed below, this second retarder <b>2330</b> and second polarizer <b>2312</b> may be useful in reducing &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; images caused by light reflected from the spatial light modulator that passes through optical surfaces (e.g., on the powered optics or lenses <b>2320</b>) as the light travels to the at least one light guide <b>2348</b>.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">A third retarder <b>2340</b> (e.g., a quarter wave retarder or quarter waveplate) is disposed between the second polarizer <b>2335</b> and the spatial light modulator.

Also, in various implementations such as shown, the second polarizer <b>2335</b> is between the second and third retarders <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b>. As illustrated, the ray <b>2310</b> upon passing through the second polarizer <b>2335</b> is linearly polarized and in some implementations, the second retarder <b>2330</b>/second polarizer <b>2335</b> may convert the light to the original linear polarization of the first polarizer <b>2312</b> (e.g., horizontally polarized). This linearly polarized light is incident on the third retarder <b>2340</b>.

In certain implementations, the spatial light modulator is configured to operate on circularly polarized light. In some implementations, the spatial light modulator is a reflective spatial light modulator that reflects the incident circularly polarized light back as circularly polarized light. In some embodiments, the circularly polarized light reflected from the spatial light modulator may have the same handedness (e.g., left-handed circularly polarized) as that incident thereon depending possibly on whether the spatial light modulator pixels are in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off&#x201d; states.

In this example, the horizontally polarized light passes through the second polarizer <b>2335</b>. The linearly polarized light is incident on the second retarder <b>2330</b> and is converted into circularly polarized light. In this example, the horizontally polarized light is converted into left-hand polarized light and is transmitted to the optics <b>2320</b>. Here again, reflections from optical surfaces such as the surfaces of the optics <b>2320</b> having optical power may create ghost images by reflecting back off the spatial light modulator into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and to the user's eye. As described above, undesirable reflections may occur at any interface with media having dissimilar refractive indices such as air to material interfaces.

The act of being reflected from the surface causes the reflected ray <b>2346</b>, which is circularly polarized to switch handedness, in this example, to switch from left-handed circular polarization to right-handed circular polarization. The switched circular polarized light is attenuated by the second circular polarizer formed by the second retarder and polarizer <b>2330</b>, <b>2335</b>.

In some implementations, the compensator <b>2365</b> may include a combination of optical retarders that when combined, produce the retardance that may potentially offset the residual retardance from the SLM (e.g., LCoS panel).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, the light after passing through the compensator <b>2365</b> is incident on the cover glass <b>2370</b> and the SLM <b>2375</b>. This light incident on the cover glass <b>2370</b> and the SLM <b>2375</b> is depicted as left-hand circularly polarized light. Depending on the type of and the state of the spatial modulator, the SLM <b>2375</b> may reflect circularly polarized light of the same handedness. For example, when a pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> is in an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state (although this state may be an undriven state in some implementations), the SLM <b>2375</b> may introduce a quarter wave of retardance on each pass through the SLM <b>2375</b>. Accordingly, on reflection, incident circularly polarized light may remain circular polarized on reflection. In various configurations, the handedness may also remain the same. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, the incident left-hand circularly polarized light may remain left-handed circularly polarized on reflection. This circularly polarized light reflected from the SLM <b>2375</b>, represented by ray <b>2342</b>, may pass through the cover glass <b>2370</b> and compensator <b>2365</b> and be incident on the fifth retarder <b>2360</b>, which converts the circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, the circularly polarized light incident on the fifth retarder <b>2360</b> is left-handed and the fifth retarder <b>2360</b> converts this circularly polarized light into horizontally polarized light. The third polarizer <b>2355</b> may be configured to selectively transmit the polarization of light output by the fifth retarder <b>2360</b>. Accordingly, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> where the light output from the fifth retarder <b>2360</b> is horizontally polarized, the third polarizer <b>2355</b> selectively transmits the horizontally polarized light. This linearly polarized light transmitted by the polarizer <b>2355</b> is incident on the fourth retarder <b>2345</b> and converted into circularly polarized light. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, this circularly polarized light is left-hand circularly polarized. This light can travel through the second circular polarizer comprising the second retarder <b>2330</b> and second polarizer <b>2335</b>, the optics <b>2320</b>, as well as the first circular polarizer comprising the first polarizer <b>2312</b> and the first retarder <b>2315</b> onto the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and into the eye of the user as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Light reflected from optical surfaces may, however, be attenuated by the third circular polarizer thereby reducing the likelihood that such reflections will reach the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and be directed to the user's eye producing ghost images. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> shows and example ray <b>2343</b> reflected from an optical surface of the third retarder <b>2340</b>, for example, from the interface between the air and the third retarder <b>2340</b>. As discussed above, reflections may occur at any interface between media having dissimilar refractive indices such as air to material interfaces or interfaces between different dielectric layers. However, circularly polarized light reverses handedness upon reflection. For example, upon reflecting off of the surface of the third retarder <b>2340</b>, the direction of the circular polarization is changed (e.g., from left-handed to right-handed). The right-handed reflected ray <b>2343</b> then travels through the fourth retarder <b>2345</b> and is transformed into linearly polarized light having a different, for example, orthogonal, linear polarization than that which is selectively transmitted by the third polarizer <b>2355</b>. In this case, for example, the light reflected from the optical surface of the third retarder <b>2340</b> is converted by the fourth retarder <b>2345</b> into vertical linear polarization, which is orthogonal to the polarization selectively transmitted by the third polarizer <b>2355</b>. The third polarizer <b>2355</b> selectively passes horizontally polarized light and filters out vertically polarized light. Thus, the reflected ray <b>2343</b> is attenuated and/or not transmitted by the third polarizer <b>2355</b> and is prevented from reaching the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> (e.g., by reflecting off another surface) or at least a reduced amount of such reflected light reaches the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> or is coupled therein.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The result may be the similar for circularly polarized rays reflected from different optical surfaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, for example, shows a reflection of incident light ray <b>2310</b> off the optical surface of the fourth retarder <b>2345</b>. The reflection <b>2350</b> off of the fourth retarder <b>2345</b> switches the handedness of the polarization. For example, the incident ray <b>2310</b> depicted as left-handed circularly polarized is converted upon reflection into a ray <b>2350</b> that is shown as having right-handed circularly polarization. The reflected ray <b>2350</b> passes through the third retarder <b>2340</b> and is transformed into vertically polarized light. This vertically polarized light is selectively attenuated or filtered out by the second polarizer <b>2335</b>.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">As described above, a pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> may, for example, be in an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state (although an undriven state in some implementations) where light incident on this pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> is reflected therefrom and coupled into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and directed to the eye of the user. However, a pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> can be in an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state (which may be a driven state in some implementations), in which light incident on the pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> is not coupled into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and is not coupled into the user's eye. In this &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, for example, various implementations of the SLM <b>2375</b> may introduce no retardance upon reflection therefrom. Accordingly, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, circularly polarized light incident on the SLM <b>2375</b> may remain circularly polarized on reflection from the SLM <b>2375</b>. This handedness of the circularly polarized light may, however, change upon reflection from the SLM <b>2375</b>. For example, the ray <b>2310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> that is left-handed circularly polarized that is incident on the SLM <b>2375</b>, may be transformed into right hand circularly polarized light upon reflection from the SLM <b>2375</b>. This reflected light, however, may be selectively attenuated by the third polarizer <b>2355</b>. For example, the right circularly polarized light reflected from the SLM <b>2375</b> may pass through the cover glass <b>2370</b>, the compensator <b>2365</b>, and the fifth retarder <b>2360</b>. The fifth retarder <b>2360</b> may convert the right-handed circularly polarized light into vertically polarized light, which is selectively attenuated by the third polarizer <b>2355</b>, which may include a horizontal polarizer. Accordingly, in various implementations, the fifth retarder <b>2360</b> may convert light reflected from a pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> when the pixel of the SLM is in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, into a linear polarization that is orthogonal to the linear polarization selectively transmitted by the third polarizer <b>2355</b>. This third polarizer <b>2355</b> may thus selectively attenuate this linearly polarized light thereby reducing or blocking the light from that pixel of the SLM <b>2375</b> from reaching the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and being directed into the eye.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Variations in the configurations, such as variations in the polarization optical elements, are possible. For example, more or less circular polarizers may be included.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In various implementations, for example, the third circular polarizer including the fourth retarder <b>2345</b> and third polarizer <b>2355</b> is excluded such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>. In this particular implementation, the fourth retarder <b>2345</b>, third polarizer <b>2355</b>, and the fifth retarder <b>2360</b> are not included in the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref> illustrates a design of the augmented reality system <b>2300</b> that includes components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B</figref>, with the exception of the fourth retarder <b>2345</b>, third polarizer <b>2355</b>, and the fifth retarder <b>2360</b>. Nevertheless, despite excluding the third circular polarizer, the augmented reality display system is still configured to reduce ghost images. The second circular polarizer, for example, reduces reflection that would otherwise contribute to ghost images. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>, depicts light, illustrated as ray <b>2380</b>, reflected from the third retarder <b>2340</b>. The act of being reflected from the surface of the third retarder <b>2340</b> causes the reflected ray <b>2380</b>, which is circularly polarized to switch handedness. In this example, the polarization is switched from left-handed circular polarization to right-handed circular polarization. The switched circular polarized light <b>2380</b> then passes through the compensator <b>2365</b> and is incident on the cover glass <b>2370</b> and the SLM <b>2375</b>. As discussed above, the SLM <b>2375</b> may reflect circularly polarized light of the same handedness. Accordingly, the incident right-hand circularly polarized light may remain right-handed circularly polarized on reflection. This circularly polarized light reflected from the SLM <b>2375</b>, represented by ray <b>2382</b>, may then pass through the cover glass <b>2370</b> and compensator <b>2365</b> and be incident on the third retarder <b>2340</b>. The switched circular polarized light <b>2382</b> is attenuated by the second circular polarizer and in particular by the third retarder <b>2340</b> and polarizer <b>2335</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>, for example, the circularly polarized light <b>2382</b> reflected from the SLM <b>2375</b> is incident on the third retarder <b>2340</b> and transformed by the third retarder <b>2340</b> into linearly polarized light having a different, e.g., orthogonal, linear polarization than that which is selectively transmitted by the second linear polarizer <b>2335</b>. In this case, for example, the right-handed circularly polarized light <b>2382</b> is converted by the third retarder <b>2340</b> into vertical linear polarization, which is orthogonal to the polarization selectively transmitted by the second polarizer <b>2335</b>. The second polarizer <b>2335</b> attenuates or prevents transmission of this linearly polarized light.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Reflections that may contribute to ghost reflections may also potentially be reduced by tilting the optical surfaces in the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates an example configuration having a tilted optical surface for reducing reflections that may produce ghost reflections. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows an augmented reality display system <b>2400</b> including a light source <b>2305</b> that emits light represented by a ray <b>2310</b> that passes through any number of polarizers, retarders, lenses and/or other optical components as the light travels toward a spatial light modulator (SLM) <b>2375</b>. A first polarizer <b>2312</b> and a first retarder <b>2315</b> possibly forming a first circular polarizer as well as lenses <b>2320</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> for illustrative purposes. However, additional components may be included or components may be excluded or arranged or configured differently. In the example illustrated, the SLM <b>2375</b> includes therewith a cover glass <b>2370</b>. The cover glass <b>2370</b> can be a contributor to reflections that produce ghost images. As such, in some implementations, the cover glass <b>2370</b> can be shaped so as to direct reflections that may yield ghost images away from being directed into a user's eye. As illustrated, the cover glass <b>2370</b> has a surface that can be tilted such that the surface is not parallel with other components or optical surfaces of the system (e.g., the SLM <b>2375</b>, first retarder <b>2315</b>, first polarizer <b>2312</b>, at least one waveguide <b>2348</b>, etc., or optical surfaces thereof). A major surface of the cover glass <b>2370</b> may, for example, have a normal that is tilted so as not to be aligned or parallel to the optical axis of the augmented reality display system <b>2400</b> or optical components therein such as optics <b>2320</b>. By being tilted, reflections from the optical surface of the cover glass <b>2370</b> can be directed away from the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> or in-coupling optical elements (e.g., in-coupling gratings or diffractive optical elements) for in-coupling light into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and reduce the likelihood that reflections from the cover glass <b>2370</b> enter the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b>. As depicted, reflected light <b>2405</b> is directed back toward the light source <b>2305</b> and away from the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> where such light could ultimately reach the eye of a user. In some implementations, the reflected light <b>2405</b> can be directed back to the light source and a least a portion recycled at the light source <b>2305</b>.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> depicts the cover glass <b>2370</b> having a surface that is tilted, optical surfaces that are tilted to divert reflections away from being coupled into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> can be included on any component in the system where undesired reflection is possible. Accordingly, optical surfaces on other components, such as polarizers, retarders, etc., may be tilted to reduce reflection being coupled into the at least one waveguide <b>2348</b> and to the eye of the user. Variations in the shape and size of the cover glass <b>2370</b> or other optical components are possible. The cover glass <b>2370</b> or other optical component may, for example, be thinner. Similarly, the cover glass <b>2370</b> or other optical component may have a different aspect ratios (length to thickness) than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In some implementations, the cover glass <b>2370</b> or other optical component is wedge shaped. Other shapes, however, are possible.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Still other arrangements are possible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, for example, illustrates an implementation of an augmented reality display system <b>2500</b> similar to the system <b>2400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> but further including a light dump <b>2505</b> for absorbing light directed thereto. The system <b>2500</b> includes the tilted cover glass <b>2370</b> to direct reflections <b>2510</b> from the cover glass <b>2370</b> to the light dump <b>2505</b> instead of being directed back to the light source <b>2305</b>. The light dump <b>2505</b> may include an absorbing material or structure that is configured to absorb light. The location of the light dump <b>2505</b> can change depending on the implementation, for example, depending on the angle of the tilted cover glass <b>2370</b>. As discussed above, this approach can be applied to other optical surfaces in the system. In addition, the shapes and sizes of the optical elements may be different.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">A wide range of variations in the augmented reality display are possible. Variations in the polarization optical elements are possible. For example, although horizontal polarizers are used, in some implementations, vertical polarizers or a combination of horizontal and vertical polarizers are employed. Additionally, polarizers characterized by polarization other than vertical or horizontal may be used. Likewise, the light shown in the figures need not be horizontally polarized but may be vertically polarized. Similarly, light shown as vertically polarized may be horizontally polarized or vice versa in different implementations. Lin-early polarized light having polarizations other than vertical or horizontal may also be used.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Additionally, the retarders may be configured differently. For example, the polarized light in the figures need not be left-hand circularly polarized but may be right-hand circularly polarized light and/or the right-hand polarized light may be left-hand circularly polarized. Still other variations are possible. Different retarder configurations can be employed to produce different combinations of left-handed and/or right-handed polarized light than shown. Also, in some implementations, elliptical polarized light may possibly be used instead of circularly polarized light. Retarders may be employed, for example, to convert elliptically polarized light into linear polarized light and vice versa. Linear polarizers can be used to filter light and may be used to reduce ghost reflections such as described herein.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In some implementations, other types of polarization elements and configurations thereof are employed. For example, the retarders are not limited to quarter wave retarders or quarter waveplates. For example, in some implementations, various optical elements have birefringence. In certain such cases, any one or more of the retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b> may include an amount of retardance sufficient to convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and need not be a quarter wave retarder. More or less than a quarter wave of retardance may be included in any one or more of the retarders <b>2315</b>, <b>2330</b>, <b>2340</b> as retardance may be contributed by other optical elements. Similarly, retardance can be distributed in a number of optical elements. As another example, multiple retarders may be employed to provide the appropriate amount of retardance. Also, as described above, in some implementations, elliptical polarized light may possibly be used instead of circularly polarized light. Retarders may be employed, for example, to convert elliptically polarized light into linear polarized light and vice versa. Linear polarizers can be used to filter light and may be used to reduce ghost reflections such as described herein.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Additionally, the optical components may be in the form of optical layers, sheets and/or films as well as stacks or one or more layers, sheets and/or films. Accordingly, different polarization elements, in different amounts, locations, and arrangements may be used. For example, one or more of the retarders and/or polarizers may comprise films.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some implementations, the spatial light modulator may operate differently. For example the spatial light modulator may operate on light other than circularly polarized light and/or may output light other than circularly polarized light.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">Embodiments of the present invention provide solutions to, reduce, minimize, or eliminate direct leakage from the illumination sources into the eyepiece waveguide in double pass projection systems used for augmented reality.

Thus, in these systems, the light leakage into the incoupling DOEs is negligible. It will be appreciated that LCoS diffraction orders occur due to the small pixel size. This can result in an angular shift to the zero-order diffraction/specular reflections at the display, which leads to a spatial shift in the pupil plane. In some cases, these diffracted orders overlap with more than one incoupling DOE and can lead to double images. In some projection illumination systems, the distance between the incoupling DOEs can be large enough that double images due to LCoS diffraction orders are not dominant.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">Embodiments of the present invention enable the design and fabrication of wearable, virtual or augmented reality display headsets in which the overall size of the projection illumination system is reduced. In some cases, this reduction in the overall size can result in light leaking between the optical elements, for example, resulting in the generation of double images due to LCoS diffraction orders as discussed above. Some techniques mitigate the issue of LCoS diffraction orders by the use of color filters, which can have a high cost, or by minimizing the intensity of the LCoS diffractive orders with respect to the specular reflection, which ca be difficult to achieve. As described herein, embodiments of the present invention enable compact designs while overcoming the impact of light leakage despite the fact that the illumination sources and the incoupling DOEs are positioned close to each other. By utilizing predetermined tri-layout configurations, i.e., specific tri-layout arrangements of sub-pupil elements, embodiments of the present invention align the light leakage with areas of the incoupling DOEs characterized by low waveguide efficiency. Accordingly, leakage that occurs does not incouple efficiently into the eyepiece waveguide layers, thereby reducing light leakage observed by the user.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">As described herein, embodiments of the present invention not only reduce or eliminate the formation of double images, but reduce the light leakage to a level and improve system performance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> provides a framework to understand light leakage and a process to select illumination sources and incoupling DOEs for each color in view of waveguide efficiency. As will be evident to one of skill in the art, the incoupling DOEs of the waveguide layers of the eyepiece waveguide stack are highly sensitive to wavelength (i.e., incoupling efficiency vs. angle of incidence and wavelength). This sensitivity leads to distinctive waveguide efficiency patterns vs. angle of incidence and wavelength.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>A</figref> is a plan view for a left eye of light leakage patterns in a distributed sub-pupil architecture according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The integration of one or more optical absorbers with the tri-layout sub-pupil distributed architecture can include optimization of the position (x, y, z, rotation), size, and shape of the optical absorbers.

However, super pupil area <b>3600</b> has been modified to include first optical absorber <b>3610</b> disposed between second illumination source <b>2712</b> and third incoupling DOE <b>2722</b> and second optical absorber <b>3612</b> disposed between second illumination source <b>2712</b> and first incoupling DOE <b>2732</b>.

In a manner similar to the truncation of the illumination source and/or the incoupling DOE, the placement of these optical absorbers reduces the intensity of scattered light at the incoupling DOEs adjacent to the corresponding illumination source and, therefore, reduces the light leakage significantly, but only produces a minimal impact on the overall brightness and uniformity.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0317">As discussed more fully in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref>, the positioning of the optical absorbers can vary depending on the particular application. The optical absorbers can be coupled to a surface of at least one of the first waveguide layer, the second waveguide layer, or the third waveguide layer. Moreover, the optical absorbers can be placed with one optical absorber coupled to a waveguide layer or multiple optical absorbers coupled to one or more of the waveguide layers. For example, first optical absorber <b>3610</b> and second optical absorber <b>3612</b> can be coupled to one of the surfaces of first waveguide layer <b>2720</b>. As another example, first optical absorber <b>3610</b> can be coupled to one of the surfaces of first waveguide layer <b>2720</b> and the second optical absorber <b>3612</b> can be coupled to one of the surfaces of second waveguide layer <b>2730</b>, although neither of these particular placements of the optical absorbers is required by embodiments of the present invention. Thus, the optical absorbers are placed both in the lateral plane as well as the longitudinal plane according to various embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, the optical absorbers are integrated with the waveguide layers so that the optical absorber is positioned at a location between the surfaces of the waveguide layer. As a result, the examples discussed herein in which the optical absorber is positioned on a surface of the waveguide layer is merely exemplary. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0318">The optical absorbers can be fabricated from a variety of materials that absorb light in the visible spectrum. As an example, the optical absorbers can be formed using a thin film of black material that is deposited on one or more surfaces of the waveguide layer. Alternatively, the waveguide layer could be processed to darken an internal region of the waveguide layer aligned with the illustrated optical absorbers.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0319">Optical absorbers can be fabricated using color-absorbing resin that can include UV and thermally curable crosslinking monomers and oligomers, with or without oxygen inhibitors. To make the color-absorbing resin, dye or pigment can be premixed with solvent and resin, and a photo-initiator can be added to yield the UV curable resin. The dye or pigment can be selected to absorb all or a portion of light in the visible region. In some examples, the dye or pigment is black (i.e., absorbs all visible wavelengths). In other examples, the dye or pigment is blue (i.e., absorbs green and red wavelengths), green (i.e., absorbs blue and red wavelengths), red (i.e., absorbs blue and green wavelengths), or any combination thereof. In particular, a color-absorbing region can include a combination of red, green, and blue dye or pigmented polymer that is not black, but all absorbs wavelength ranges of visible light that is incident on the waveguide. In some examples, the resin includes epoxy vinyl esters, where the vinyl monomer can be methyl methacrylate, and difunctional or trifunctional vinyl monomers (diacrylates, triacrylates, dimethacrylates, etc.) with or without aromatic molecules in the monomer etc., and generally has an index in a range from about 1.5 to about 1.7. In some cases, fabrication of the resin includes the application of a cyclic aliphatic epoxy containing UV and/or heat curable resin. A UV cationic photo-initiator and co-reactant can be added to promote UV curing in ambient. UV acrylate coatings and films tend to suffer from oxygen inhibition during ambient curing. During curing, oxygen will react with acrylate radicals at the surface to generate peroxide radicals, which are inactive. This will effectively stop the chain reaction and result in a sticky, wet surface after UV exposure, which is not desirable. Viscosity of the material can be in a range of about 10 cPs to about 100,000 cPs to about 500,000 cPs.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0320">Merely by way of example, the optical absorbers can have dimensions of: 1) Length: 50 &#x3bc;m to 50 mm, 2) Width: 50 &#x3bc;m to 50 mm; and 3) Thickness: 1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m.
