Tooling is used on the tablet press to identify and produce specific products. The tooling consists of an upper punch, lower punch, and a die. To form a tablet, granulated powder material must be fed into a cavity formed by two punches and a die. The punches are pressed together with sufficient force to fuse the powder into a tablet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional rotary tablet press, a turret is rotatable about a vertical axis and carries a plurality of dies. Each die has associated upper and lower punches driven by upper and lower cams to compress the granulation into a tablet. An upper punch, a lower punch and a die are together referred to as a station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such rotary tablet presses are provided by various manufacturers and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,988,275 and 6,676,863 and EP1050399.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical rotary tablet press turret includes a plurality of stations aligned in a circle proximate an outer peripheral edge of the turret. The number of stations depends on various factors, including the size of the turret and the size of the dies and punches. While there is a desire to maximize output of tablets with the press, this is limited by the available space to accommodate each station. Limitations may also result when multi-tip punches are used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to improvements in design of a turret and cams.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a turret including multiple concentric rings of stations. As such, the number of tablets produced with a turret can increase by a factor corresponding to the number of rows of stations. In an exemplary embodiment there are two rows of stations which approximately doubles output. Additional rows could also be provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a multiple row turret module is provided for use in a rotary tablet press comprising a pressure roll assembly and a turret drive assembly. The multiple row turret module comprises a turret including a hub selectively engageable by the drive assembly for rotation about a vertical axis. The hub supports a die table and upper and lower guideways defining a plurality of stations. Each station comprises an upper punch opening in the upper guideway and an aligned die opening in the die table and a lower punch opening in the lower guideway. The stations are aligned in first and second concentric rows. A plurality of upper punches are provided, one in each of the upper punch openings. A plurality of lower punches are provided, one in each of the lower punch openings. An upper cam assembly is supported above the upper guideway for selectively reciprocating the first and second concentric rows of upper punches toward and away from the die openings responsive to rotation of the turret. A lower cam assembly is supported below the lower guideway for selectively reciprocating the first and second concentric rows of lower punches toward and away from the die openings responsive to rotation of the turret. The pressure roll assemblies selectively engage the upper and lower punches responsive to rotation of the turret to compress a granulation into a tablet at the stations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a feature that the turret may be of one-piece construction or assembled from a plurality of components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another feature that the die table has a plurality of through openings spaced about its periphery and further comprising a plurality of die, one for each through opening, and wherein each die comprises a plurality of the aligned die openings. Lock screws may be provided for removably mounting the die in the through openings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further feature that the upper cam assembly comprises an upper cam body supported above the hub and a plurality of upper cams mounted to the upper cam body. The upper cams are sized to reciprocate the first and second rows of upper punches. The lower cam assembly comprises a lower cam base supporting the hub for rotation relative thereto and a plurality of lower cams are mounted to the lower cam base. The lower cams are sized to reciprocate the first and second rows of lower punches.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is still another feature that the turret module comprises an equal number of stations in each of the first and second concentric rows.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a multiple row turret module is provided for use in a rotary tablet press comprising a pressure roll assembly and a turret drive assembly. The multiple row turret module comprises a turret including a hub selectively engageable by the drive assembly for rotation about a vertical axis. The hub supports a die table and upper and lower guideways defining a plurality of stations. Each station comprises an upper punch opening in the upper guideway and an aligned die opening in the die table and a lower punch opening in the lower guideway. The stations are aligned in a plurality of concentric rows. A plurality of upper punches are provided, one in each of the upper punch openings. A plurality of lower punches are provided, one in each of the lower punch openings. An upper cam assembly is supported above the upper guideway for selectively reciprocating the plurality of concentric rows of upper punches toward and away from the die openings responsive to rotation of the turret. A lower cam assembly is supported below the lower guideway for selectively reciprocating the plurality of concentric rows of lower punches toward and away from the die openings responsive to rotation of the turret. The pressure roll assemblies selectively engage the upper and lower punches responsive to rotation of the turret to compress a granulation into a tablet at the stations.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further features and advantages will be apparent from the specification and the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a rotary tablet press machine including a turret module in accordance with the invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary turret module in accordance with the invention comprising two rows of stations, with punches removed for clarity;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of the turret module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the turret of the turret module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with a die shown removed;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view of the turret module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with punches added and an upper cam body removed;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded view of the turret module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view of the turret module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along the line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of an alternative double row turret module in accordance with the invention; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exploded view of the turret of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a rotary tablet press machine <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention is illustrated.
