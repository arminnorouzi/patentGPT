Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a block diagram <b>1200</b> is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein. In particular a virtualized communication network is presented that can be used to implement some or all of the subsystems and functions of system <b>100</b>, the subsystems and functions of RAN <b>201</b> and/or RAN node <b>202</b>, and the operations of operations flows <b>700</b>, <b>900</b>, and <b>1000</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. For example, virtualized communication network <b>1200</b> can facilitate in whole or in part detecting, by a wireless communication device, a transmission, by a radio access network node, of an alert message, identifying contents of the alert message, determining that the wireless communication device is authorized to relay the contents of the alert message, generating alert information comprising the contents of the alert message, and transmitting a ProSe direct discovery message comprising the alert information.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In particular, a cloud networking architecture is shown that leverages cloud technologies and supports rapid innovation and scalability via a transport layer <b>1250</b>, a virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b> and/or one or more cloud computing environments <b>1275</b>. In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In contrast to traditional network elements&#x2014;which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements (VNEs) <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As an example, a traditional network element <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a VNE <b>1230</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it's elastic: so the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle-boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>1250</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>110</b>, wireless access <b>120</b>, voice access <b>130</b>, media access <b>140</b> and/or access to content sources <b>175</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized, and might require special DSP code and analog front-ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as VNEs <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b> or <b>1234</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>1250</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>1250</b> to provide the VNEs <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b> and <b>1234</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, VNEs <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b> and <b>1234</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements don't typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers&#x2014;each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The cloud computing environments <b>1275</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNEs <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>1225</b> and cloud computing environment <b>1275</b> and in the commercial cloud, or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third party locations.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.

Mobile network platform <b>1410</b> comprises CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b> which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network(s) <b>1440</b> (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), or public land mobile network (PLMN)) or a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>1460</b>. CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b> can authorize and authenticate traffic (e.g., voice) arising from such networks. Additionally, CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b> can access mobility, or roaming, data generated through SS7 network <b>1460</b>; for instance, mobility data stored in a visited location register (VLR), which can reside in memory <b>1430</b>. Moreover, CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b> interfaces CS-based traffic and signaling and PS gateway node(s) <b>1418</b>. As an example, in a 3GPP UMTS network, CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b> can be realized at least in part in gateway GPRS support node(s) (GGSN). It should be appreciated that functionality and specific operation of CS gateway node(s) <b>1412</b>, PS gateway node(s) <b>1418</b>, and serving node(s) <b>1416</b>, is provided and dictated by radio technology(ies) utilized by mobile network platform <b>1410</b> for telecommunication over a radio access network <b>1420</b> with other devices, such as a radiotelephone <b>1475</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to receiving and processing CS-switched traffic and signaling, PS gateway node(s) <b>1418</b> can authorize and authenticate PS-based data sessions with served mobile devices.

The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
