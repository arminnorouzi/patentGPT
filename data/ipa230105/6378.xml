The assemblies may be implemented with a printed circuit board (PCB) with a first connector with at least two mating interfaces. One mating interface may be configured to connect to a power supply. The other mating interface may be configured to receive a conductive interconnect, such as a busbar, that can be routed over the PCB to a second connector. Without the conductive interconnect in place, power supplied through the first mating interface of the first connector may be distributed to components on the PCB through the power planes of the PCB.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the conductive interconnect in place, a portion of the supplied current may flow through the interconnect to a location on the PCB remote from the first connector where the current may flow into the power planes of the printed circuit board. In this way, the current density in the vicinity of the first connector is decreased relative to a configuration in which the interconnect is not installed. Alternatively or additionally, the total current supplied to the PCB may be increased without increasing the current density in the vicinity of the first connector.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An increase in current may be desired, for example, during the life of an electronic assembly when additional or more powerful components are added to the PCB, which draw more power. These components may be added in the field or may be included in newly manufactured devices using PCB's designed prior to the upgrade. The capability to add the interconnect and increase the total current without increasing current density enables the PCB to be designed with a capability to carry less than the total amount of power that every copy of such a PCB might ever have to carry over its lifetime. Because increasing the current carrying capacity of a PCB conventionally entails adding more layers to the PCB, enabling a PCB to be designed for less than the total current it might carry, a PCB may be designed to be thinner and to have a lower manufacturing cost than a conventional PCB of the same capabilities.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a connector that supports selective addition of a conductive interconnect may have a mounting interface and two mating interfaces, which may be orthogonal to each other. The mating interfaces and the mounting interface may be interconnected within the connector housing such that power supplied through one mating interface may be distributed to components on the PCB either through the mounting interface and then through the power planes of the PCB or through the second mating interface to a conductive interconnect and then to a second connector where the current may be coupled to the components attached to the PCB through the PCB.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, one of the mating interfaces of the connector may be a card edge connector, which may be configured to receive a card edge, or similarly sized structure, from a power supply. Another mating interface may similarly be configured like a card edge connector, but may receive, a busbar or similarly sized terminal of a power cable.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a Printed Circuit Board (&#x201c;PCB&#x201d;) <b>100</b> configured to be inserted into a card-edge connector. PCBs mechanically support and electrically connect one or more electronic components using conductive traces, pads, and other features etched from one or more conductive layers laminated onto layers of a non-conductive material. Traditionally, conductive layers are made from copper and non-conductive layers are made from woven fiberglass and flame resistant epoxy resin binders. PCBs are generally made with interspersed conductive layers of conductive traces that carry signals and layers that are largely continuous sheets. The largely continuous layers serve as grounds for the signal traces and can also carry power. They are sometimes called power planes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Connections may be made to the conductive inner layers, whether those inner layers are signal layers or power planes, using holes <b>18</b> in the PCB. The holes may be plated and/or filled with conductive material such that they make connections between the surface of the PCB and the conductive structures at the inner layers. Components, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may be attached to the holes, such as by soldering. Pads on the surface of the PCB may likewise be attached to conductive structures at the inner layers of the PCB. Connections to the pads enable connections to the inner layers of the PCB.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the PCB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such pads serve as terminals <b>120</b>, which may be coupled to an electrical connector such that PCB <b>100</b> may be connected to another PCB or other subassembly of an electronic system. In this example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, edge <b>110</b> of PCB <b>100</b> contains a plurality of terminals <b>120</b> configured for insertion into a card-edge connector. The terminals <b>120</b> may be signal or power terminals, depending on whether they are connected to signal layers or a power plane inside the PCB. Electrical signals and/or power transmitted or received from the terminals <b>120</b> are conducted throughout the PCB to individual components via traces <b>130</b> and vias <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the terminals, whether for signal or power, have substantially the same width. In some embodiments, power terminals may be wider than signal terminals to increase the power carrying capacity of the card edge interconnection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows PCB <b>200</b> connected to PCB <b>240</b> via card-edge connector <b>220</b>. In this embodiment, PCB <b>200</b> is illustrative of a portion of a power supply unit (PSU) configured for insertion in a card-edge connector via a parallel board (straddle-mount) arrangement. Other arrangements, such as vertically oriented or right-angle oriented connections are also possible. PCB <b>200</b> contains two conductive pads <b>202</b> configured to supply power and six conductive pads <b>204</b> configured to supply signal, although it should be understood that any number of each could be used in alternate embodiments.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The power pads <b>202</b> of PSU <b>200</b> may be on an edge suitable for a contact surface, which may be inserted into a slot <b>224</b> of a card-edge connector <b>220</b> containing power terminals <b>222</b>. In some embodiments, the conductive pads <b>202</b> may comprise a high-conductivity material able to conduct electric current sufficient for applications requiring at least 3000 W of power, and having sufficient rigidity to withstand repeated mating and unmating with a connector. For example, conductive pads <b>202</b> may be surface portions of cladding, such as a layer of Cu that has a thickness of at least 0.14 mm, or at least 0.5 mm, or at least 1 mm, or at least 1.5 mm. The power supply may deliver relatively large currents, such as up to 60 A, 80 A, 100 A, 120 A, 180 A, 200 A or greater.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the power pads <b>202</b> may be wider than the signal pads <b>204</b>. Such a design enables the power pads <b>202</b> to carry more current than the signal pads <b>204</b>, without excessive heating. The larger cross-sectional area of the power pads <b>202</b> provide a lower contact resistance, a lower bulk resistance, and a lower current density, all of which contribute to less heating within the connector when a relatively large amount of current passes through the power pads <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Power terminals <b>222</b> in the card-edge connector may similarly be designed to pass larger amounts of power with an acceptable amount of heating. Current flow is often used as an indication of delivered power, because power and current are related, and heating is proportional to current flow. Acceptable heating may be expressed as temperature rise at a rated current. As a specific example, a connector, or a power terminal within the connector, may have a rated current capacity that reflects the amount of current that will increase the temperature from ambient conditions by a set amount, such as 30&#xb0; C. For example, the heating in the connector may be below this threshold amount when a high current, such as 60 A, 80 A, 100 A, 120 A, 180 A, 200 A or greater in some embodiments is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Card-edge connector <b>220</b> passes electrical signals and/or power between PCB <b>200</b> and PCB <b>240</b>. To do so, card-edge connector <b>220</b> contains a slot <b>224</b> which receives PSU PCB <b>200</b>. This slot can be uniform, if the card to be inserted has a consistent thickness along its insertion edge, or non-uniform if this thickness varies. Once inserted, power terminals <b>202</b> and signal terminals <b>204</b> come into contact with one or more conductive elements <b>222</b> that pass electrical signals and/or power through to PCB <b>240</b>. These elements may be formed of a conductive materials and may be sufficiently robust to allow for the repeated insertion and removal of card edge like that on PCB <b>200</b>. PCB <b>204</b> contains components, of which exemplary components <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> are numbered, which use, condition, or otherwise interact with the electronic signals and/or power transmitted across card-edge connector <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the various functions of these components may require different and incompatible electronic signals and/or power. For example, component <b>242</b> may require 5V whereas component <b>244</b> may require 12V. As such, the designs of PCB <b>200</b>, card-edge connector <b>220</b>, and PCB <b>240</b> are constructed to provide discrete electronic pathways as required.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inventors have recognized that in the card-edge connector embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the full amount of current that is transmitted to PCB <b>240</b> across card-edge connector <b>220</b> is distributed to the power planes of PCB <b>240</b>, creating a high current density in the PCB <b>240</b> adjacent connector <b>220</b>. As such, the amount of current that can be transmitted is limited by both the thickness of each power layer and the number of power layers in the region of PCB <b>240</b> adjacent connector <b>220</b>. Making thicker layers may undesirably increase the size cost and/or manufacturing complexity of the electronic assembly. Adding additional layers may increase the amount of power that can be transmitted to PCB <b>240</b>, however this adds cost, weight, and thickness to an electronic assembly made with the PCB. The number of layers required to supply large currents (e.g., 60-100 Amps, 180-260 Amps, etc.) may therefore be undesirable. In scenarios in which a PCB is designed for possible upgrades that will draw high currents, initial construction with enough power planes to support future high currents may similarly be undesirable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments described herein, a PCB may be designed with fewer power planes than are necessary to carry a designed maximum current. One or more connectors may be mounted to the PCB. When more power than can be carried by the power planes is desired, such a connector may be connected to a conductive interconnect, such as a busbar, that may distribute power to locations on the PCB remote from the one or more connectors. The conductive interconnect may extend in a direction parallel to the PCB.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The one or more connectors may have multiple interfaces, including a first mating interface, which may be configured as a mating interface of a conventional card edge connector. Current may be supplied to the connector through the first mating interface and then distributed through other interfaces of the connector to the PCB directly or to the conductive interconnect, which may pass over the PCB. Splitting the current within the connector reduces the current density in the PCB adjacent the connector.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a PCB <b>300</b> with such a card-edge connector <b>310</b>.

Each of the power conductive elements <b>800</b> may have a set of tails <b>882</b> descending vertically. As such, the first and second sets of fingers, <b>812</b> and <b>822</b>, may be offset from each other by 90 degrees and the second and set of fingers and tails, <b>822</b> and <b>882</b>, may be offset from each other by 180 degrees.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the illustrated embodiment, each of the mating interfaces is shown with three spring fingers of similar dimensions. In other embodiments, the number of spring fingers for some or all of the mating interfaces may be more or less than three. Moreover, in some embodiments, different mating interfaces may have different numbers of spring fingers. Moreover, some or all of the spring fingers may have different dimensions than others. Alternatively or additionally, some or all of the mating and/or mounting interfaces may be shaped differently than as illustrated.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the illustrated embodiment, power conductive elements are held together in subassemblies that are inserted into the connector housing. The power conductive elements may be held together, for example, by subassembly housings <b>910</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, which may be plastic molded around intermediated portions of the conductive elements <b>800</b>, leaving the mating and mounting portions of the conductive elements exposed. Some or all of the power conductive elements may be held in the same housing and there may be one or more subassemblies in a connector. The subassemblies may be inserted into a housing, such as housing <b>402</b>, to form a connector.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the power conductive elements maybe positioned in pairs. Fingers on one conductive element of a pair may have contact surfaces facing the contact surfaces of the other conductive element of the pair. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, both conductive elements of the pairs are held in the same housing <b>910</b>, which establishes a desired spacing between the mating contact surfaces of the conductive element of the pair.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The conductive elements may be positioned such that the contact surfaces of the pairs line opposite sides of a slot that forms a mating interface to receive either an edge of a PCB or a conductive interconnect, such as a busbar. For example, spring fingers <b>940</b> and <b>970</b> are spring fingers on respective power conductive elements of a pair that have opposing contact surfaces. Likewise, spring fingers <b>950</b> and <b>980</b> have opposing contact surfaces. In both instances, the spring fingers may bend towards each other such that a spring force is generated against a component, such as a PCB or bus bar, inserted in the slot between them.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this example, spring finger <b>940</b> and <b>950</b> may be integrally formed from a sheet of metal from which a power conductive element was stamped. Similarly, spring fingers <b>970</b> and <b>980</b> may be integrally formed from a sheet of metal from which a power conductive element was stamped. Each such sheet of metal may be stamped with multiple fingers. Additionally, each such sheet may be stamped with tails, such as tails <b>960</b> and <b>990</b>. Tails <b>960</b>, for example, may be stamped of the same sheet as spring fingers <b>940</b> and <b>950</b> and tails <b>990</b> may be stamped from the same sheet as spring fingers <b>970</b> and <b>980</b>. As such, in some embodiments, spring fingers and tail, <b>940</b>, <b>950</b>, and <b>960</b> may be electrically connected. Likewise, in some embodiments, spring fingers and tail <b>970</b>, <b>980</b>, and <b>990</b> may be electrically connected.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a connector configured for use in a system in which a first portion of the power supplied through a connector may be delivered to a PCB through a mounting interface of the connector and a second portion may be delivered to a remote location on the PCB through a conductive interconnect. The connector <b>1000</b> is here shown with a first mating interface <b>1012</b> and a mounting interface <b>1082</b>, which may be configured as with the first mating interfaces and mounting interfaces as described above. First mating interface <b>1012</b> may be formed, for example, by a slot in housing portion <b>1050</b> lined with spring fingers of conductive elements. Mounting interface <b>1082</b> may be formed with tails of those conductive elements extending from housing portion <b>1050</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">A second mating interface <b>1020</b> may also be provided for mating with a conductive interconnect that distributes a portion of the power supplied through first mating interface <b>1012</b> to a remote location of the PCB to which connector <b>1000</b> is mounted. Second mating interface <b>1020</b> may be formed, as described above in connection with second mating interface <b>420</b>, with a slot in a housing portion <b>1052</b>. The slot may be lined with one or more rows of contact portions of conductive elements. Those conductive elements may be integral with the contact portions of the conductive elements forming first mating interface <b>1012</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In contrast to second mating interface <b>420</b> in which the slot has a vertical orientation, the slot of second mating interface has a horizontal orientation. Accordingly, a conductive interconnect, such as a busbar or cable assembly, is inserted into the second mating interface <b>1020</b> in a horizontal direction. The conductive elements are formed to position contact portions to line this horizontal slot.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the housing connector <b>1000</b> is shaped to provide two slots with this orientation. In the illustrated embodiment, housing portions <b>1050</b> and <b>1052</b> are both elongated in a horizontal direction. The housing portions are illustrated elongated in offset planes, but embodiments with other vertical separation between the elongated portions, and therefore the first and second mating interface, may be constructed.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Dimensions (in millimeters) are noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C</figref>. Those dimensions are illustrative rather than limiting. Other embodiments may have any one or more dimensions differing from the stated dimensions by 10%, 20%, 50% or more.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Having thus described several embodiments, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements may readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Various changes may be made to the illustrative structures shown and described herein. As an example of a possible variation, embodiments of an electronic system were described in which a printed circuit board <b>300</b> was designed to mate with a power supply unit through connector <b>310</b>. In such a configuration, electrical power may be sourced from the power supply unit and used by components on printed circuit board <b>300</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the techniques described herein are applicable to systems in which power flows in either direction through connector <b>310</b> and the techniques are useful with systems to couple power in any direction.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As another example of a variation, the power portion <b>471</b> of a PCB may comprise a blade of conductive material. For example, the power portion <b>471</b> may comprise any of the following: a solid piece of elemental metal having high conductivity (e.g., Cu, Al); a solid piece of an alloy of metals (e.g., a Cu alloy); or a solid plate or core clad with a high-conductivity metal (e.g., a Cu plate clad with Au, a steel plate clad with Cu, a resin plate clad with Cu); or a laminate with layers of high conductivity material interspersed with lower conductivity materials.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Alternative construction techniques for bus bars may also be used. The busbar may be, for example: a solid piece of copper; a core that is clad with a thick layer of copper; a core that is clad with a thick layer of copper and a surface layer of gold; a core that is clad with a thick layer of copper, a layer of silver, and a surface layer of gold; a laminated structure with a thin insulative layer separating two thicker conductive layers; etc. As will be appreciated, the high-conductivity material may be a metal alloy. The core may be made of any material having properties that enable it to be formed into a blade-like shape and that may be clad with another material without adversely reacting with the other (cladding) material. For example, the core may be made of aluminum.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Moreover, a busbar with two portions supporting two electrically separate paths was illustrated to provide an exemplary busbar. Such a busbar may be used, for example, in an electronic device with one high current power circuit. Some electronic devices may have more than one high current power circuit, and may therefore have a busbar with more than two portions, such as 4, 6 or more portions. Each portion of the bus bar may have a mating portion, such as an exposed surface that may be inserted into a card edge connector as pictured above.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, it is not a requirement that the conductive interconnect be a busbar. In some embodiments, one or more cables may form a conductive interconnect. The number of cables may depend on the number of high current circuits in the electronic device. Each cable may be terminated with a mating portion, which may be a separate element, such as a tab terminal, or may be formed by fusing strands of the conductors of the cable into a tab. Such a configuration may be used in connection with a card edge connector. Mating portions that have spring fingers or other structures may be used in some embodiments when the conductive interconnect mates with a connector in a different configuration.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Manufacturing techniques may also be varied. For example, embodiments are described in which power conductive elements are formed into terminal subassemblies, which are then inserted into a connector housing. In some embodiments, power conductive elements may be separately inserted into a connector housing.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Connector manufacturing techniques were described using specific connector configurations as examples. A parallel board, right angle connector, that mates with a card edge was described as an example of a first connector. A second connector was illustrated as a vertical card edge connector. Either or both of these connectors may have other forms, including, for example, backplane connectors, cable connectors, stacking connectors, mezzanine connectors, I/O connectors, chip sockets, etc.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, contact tails were illustrated as posts suitable for a pin in holder solder attachment. However, other configurations may also be used, such as surface mount elements, pressfits, etc., as aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to the use of any particular mechanism for attaching connectors to printed circuit boards.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Terms such as &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; were used to distinguish interfaces of an L-shaped connector. Horizontal and vertical directions may be determined relative to a surface of a printed circuit board to which the connector is mounted or, when the connector is not mounted to the board, the plane that a printed circuit board would occupy. However, such terms are indicate relative direction and the horizontal and/or vertical directions may be determined relative to other reference planes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present disclosure is not limited to the details of construction or the arrangements of components set forth in the foregoing description and/or the drawings.
