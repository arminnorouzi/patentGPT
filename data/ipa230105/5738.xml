Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.

In some examples, a plasma of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or a plasma obtained after mixing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) can be used to remove organic polymers such as photoresist that are not completely etched away in the etching step.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Here, it should be noted that, in some examples, a portion of the substrate is etched during the etching process to expose the substrate material. For example, when the substrate is completely silicon substrate, the etching process will expose a portion of the silicon substrate, and the exposed area of the silicon substrate will be oxidized. In practice, even without follow-up treatment, there is still a natural oxidation, leading to an oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the silicon substrate. For example, for a silicon substrate, a silicon oxide layer is formed on the exposed area of the silicon substrate. However, in the existing process, the thickness of the oxide layer formed in this case cannot be controlled.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Based on this, the present disclosure aims to apply bias power during the flushing process, so as to remove the organic polymers, such as photoresist layers, or other carbon-based products remaining before the flushing process, and at the same time, produce an oxide layer (such as a silicon oxide layer) with a preset thickness on the exposed area of the substrate to meet the thickness requirement. In this way, the problem that the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed substrate cannot be controlled in the prior art is solved, which lays a foundation for improving the yield and meeting different needs of users.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substrate, such as silicon substrate <b>101</b>, has a mask <b>102</b> formed thereon, and a photoresist layer <b>103</b> formed on the mask <b>102</b> for forming a mask pattern. The etching process etches away the non-patterned area of the mask and exposes a portion of the silicon substrate <b>101</b>. Then, the flushing process is performed, and a bias power is applied during the flushing process. In this way, the residual photoresist layer <b>103</b> is removed, and at the same time, an oxide layer, such silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> with a preset thickness is formed on the exposed area of the silicon substrate <b>101</b>. The thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> meets the needs of users. In this way, the problem that the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed substrate cannot be controlled in the prior art is solved, which lays a foundation for improving the yield and meeting different needs of users.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, the present disclosure provides a method for processing a workpiece, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method includes:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Step S<b>201</b>: placing the workpiece on a workpiece support in a chamber, the workpiece includes an substrate, a portion of the substrate is exposed;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a specific example, the workpiece includes at least a substrate and a layer structure formed on the substrate, and the layer structure includes at least an organic polymer remaining from an etching process. In addition, the etching process will expose a portion of the substrate. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substrate, such as silicon substrate <b>101</b>, has a mask <b>102</b> formed thereon, and a photoresist layer <b>103</b> formed on the mask <b>102</b> for forming a mask pattern. The etching process etches away the non-patterned area of the mask and exposes a portion of the silicon substrate <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be noted that the layer structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is only an exemplary illustration. In actual applications, other layer structures may also be used, and is not restricted specifically in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a specific example, the organic polymer may specifically be photoresist remaining after the exposure and development process. Of course, in practical applications, the organic polymer may also be other substances, and is not restricted specifically in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that the chamber may be specifically a processing chamber, or a chamber functioning as a processing chamber and a plasma chamber. That is to say, in practical applications, the present disclosure is applicable to a plasma processing apparatus including separated processing chamber and plasma chamber, and in this case, the workpiece support is put in the processing chamber. Similarly, the present disclosure is applicable to a plasma processing apparatus in which the plasma chamber and the processing chamber are the same chamber. In a specific example, the plasma processing apparatus may be a plasma etching machine.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, it should be noted that the workpiece described in the present disclosure may specifically be a semiconductor device or other devices.

In a specific example, when the process gas is a mixed gas of oxygen and nitrogen, the volume ratio of the two can be adjusted based on the actual situation, and is not restricted specifically in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that in practical applications, when the process gas is a mixed gas, the gases, for example, oxygen and nitrogen, can be mixed first to obtain the mixed gas, and then the mixed gas is injected into the chamber; or, the gases, for example, oxygen and nitrogen can be injected into the chamber one after the other, and the order is not restricted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Step S<b>203</b>: applying a bias power during the flushing process to form an oxide layer with a preset thickness on the portion of the substrate. That is to say, after applying the bias power in the flushing process, not only the purpose of flushing, that is, the removal of residual organic polymers from the previous process, can be achieved, but also an oxide layer with a preset thickness can be formed on the exposed area of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, after the etching process exposes a portion of the silicon substrate <b>101</b>, the flushing process is performed and a bias power is applied during the flushing process. In this way, the residual photoresist layer <b>103</b> is removed, and at the same time, an oxide layer, such silicon oxide layer <b>104</b>, with a preset thickness is formed on the exposed area of the silicon substrate <b>101</b>, and he thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> meets the needs of users.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this way, since the present disclosure can adjust the thickness of the oxide layer generated while removing the organic polymer, it solves the problem that the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed substrate material cannot be controlled in the prior art, and lays a foundation for improving the yield and meeting different needs of users.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a specific example, the mixture has a pressure and the flushing process has a time, and at least one parameter of the bias power, the pressure of the mixture, and the time of the flushing process affects a sensitivity of a thickness of the oxide layer to at least another parameter of the bias power, the pressure of the mixture, and the time of the flushing process. That is to say, after the bias power is applied in the flushing process, the bias power, the pressure of the mixture, and the time of the flushing process can all have an effect on the thickness of the oxide layer, and can also affect the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to other parameters. For example, the bias power affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the pressure of the mixture; the bias power affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the time of the flushing process; the pressure of the mixture affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the bias power; the pressure of the mixture affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the time of the flushing process, etc. therefore, based on the foregoing rules, the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate can be adjusted to meet different needs of users.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a specific example, the pressure of the mixture may specifically refer to the pressure in the chamber where the mixture is located. For example, when implemented on a plasma processing apparatus including separated processing chamber and plasma chamber, the pressure of the mixture may specifically be the pressure in the processing chamber, and the flushing process is implemented in the processing chamber.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a specific example, the bias power acts on the mixture in the chamber to affect the flow of the mixture in the chamber. For example, the bias electrode is arranged under the workpiece support. Based on this, after providing a radio frequency RF power to the bias electrode, a bias power can be generated, thus affecting the flow of the mixture in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a specific example, the sensitivity is a slope value of the thickness of the oxide layer versus at least one parameter of the bias power, the pressure of the mixture, and the time of the flushing process. For example, the sensitivity is a slope value of the thickness of the oxide layer versus the bias power; or the sensitivity is a slope value of the thickness of the oxide layer versus the time of the flushing process; or the sensitivity is a slope value of the thickness of the oxide layer versus the pressure of the mixture. In other words, the sensitivity may specifically be the growth of the oxide layer per unit time or unit bias power.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, it should be noted that those skilled in the art know that in an experiment to test the influence of one parameter on another parameter, other conditions involved in the process (that is, the values of other parameters) need to be fixed. Based on this, in a specific experimental process of the present disclosure, except for the parameters associated with sensitivity, other conditions remain unchanged. For example, if the sensitivity is a slope value of the thickness of the oxide layer versus the bias power, in the determination of the slope value, the thickness of the oxide layer and the bias power are parameters associated with the sensitivity in this experimental process, and other conditions except the thickness of the oxide layer and the bias power remain unchanged. In this way, the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the bias power can be obtained, and lays a quantitative foundation for adjusting the thickness of the oxide layer to obtain an oxide layer with a preset thickness.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a specific example, the pressure affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the bias power. That is to say, a pressure is also applied during the flushing process, and the pressure affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the bias power. In other words, the pressure can affect the sensitivity of the thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to the bias power. Therefore, based on this feature, the time of the flushing process can be adjusted, such as reduced, and at the same time, an oxide layer with a preset thickness can be obtained, which improves the processing efficiency and meets the needs of users. Moreover, compared with the existing technology that cannot control the oxidation thickness, the present disclosure improves the controllability of the process flow to provide an flushing process that meets the requirements of different sensitivity, and further lays the foundation for providing products that meet the different needs of users and enriching the diversity of products.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a specific example, the pressure is the pressure in the chamber where the mixture is located. For example, when implemented on a plasma processing apparatus including separated processing chamber and plasma chamber, the pressure of the mixture may specifically be the pressure in the processing chamber, and the flushing process is implemented in the processing chamber. Of course, when implemented on a plasma processing apparatus in which implemented on a plasma processing apparatus are the same chamber, the pressure is the pressure in the chamber in which the flushing process is implemented.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a specific example, the pressure is decreased from a first pressure value to a second pressure value, to increase the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the bias power from a first sensitivity to a second sensitivity, the first pressure value corresponds to the first sensitivity, and the second pressure value corresponds to the second sensitivity. In other words, the first sensitivity corresponding to the pressure at the first pressure value is greater than the second sensitivity corresponding to the pressure at the second pressure value. Here, the first sensitivity represents the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the change of the bias power when the pressure is at the first pressure value; and the second sensitivity represents the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the change of the bias power when the pressure is at the first pressure value, the first pressure value is any value in the first pressure range, the second pressure value is any value in the second pressure range, and the first pressure value is greater than the second pressure value. That is to say, compared with higher pressure, the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate is more sensitive to the bias power at lower pressure.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a specific example, the pressure of the flushing process can be reduced to increase the sensitivity of the thickness of the silicon oxide layer to the bias power in the flushing process, thereby optimizing the time of the flushing process to meet different process requirements.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a specific example the present disclosure, the value of the pressure ranges from about 5 millitorr (mt) to about 90 millitorr (mt). For example, in some examples, the pressure is about 50 mt, or about 70 mt, or about 10 mt, or about 30 mt, or about 5 mt, or about 90 mt, etc., and the specific value is not restricted in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a specific example, the bias power affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the time of the flushing process. That is to say, adjusting the bias power can adjust the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the time. Therefore, one can adjust the time of the flushing process and at the same time, obtain an oxide layer with a preset thickness. In this way, on the basis of improving the processing efficiency, an oxide layer that meets the thickness requirement is obtained. Compared with the existing technology that cannot control the oxide thickness, the present disclosure improves the controllability of the process flow, can provide an flushing process that meets different sensitivity requirements, and further lays a foundation for providing products that meet the different needs of users.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a specific example, the bias power is increased from a first bias power to a second bias power, to increase the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the time from a third sensitivity to a fourth sensitivity, the first bias power corresponds to the third sensitivity, and the second bias power corresponds to the fourth sensitivity. That is to say, the third sensitivity corresponding to the first bias power is smaller than the fourth sensitivity corresponding to the second bias power. Here, the third sensitivity represents the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the time under the condition of the first bias power; and the fourth sensitivity represents the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the time under the condition of the second bias power, the first bias power is any value in the first bias range, the second bias power is any value in the second bias range, and the first bias power is less than the second bias power. That is to say, compared with smaller bias power, the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate is more sensitive to the bias power at larger bias power.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a specific example of the present disclosure, the value range of the bias power is about 50 watts to about 200 watts. For example, in some examples, the bias power is about 50 watts, or about 200 watts, or about 100 watts, or about 150 watts, etc., and the specific value is not restricted in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a specific example, the bias power is proportional to the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate. Therefore, in a certain range, for example, when the bias power is within a range, increasing the bias power can increase the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate, such as the thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and on the other hand, reducing the bias power can reduce the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate, such as the thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this way, during the flushing process, the control of the thickness of the oxide layer is realized, which lays a foundation for meeting the requirements of different processes.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a specific example, the time also affects the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer to the bias power. That is, adjusting the time can adjust the sensitivity of the thickness of the oxide layer formed on the exposed area of the substrate to the bias power, so as to obtain an oxide layer with a preset thickness. For example, at shorter time, the thickness of the oxide layer is highly sensitive to the bias power, while after a prolonged time, the thickness of the oxide layer is less sensitive to the bias power reduce.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some examples, the pressure and the bias power can be applied to the chamber at the same time, and the order of application is not restricted specifically in the present disclosure.

As discussed in detail below, the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> can also be operated at a lower frequency (for example, about 2 MHz), enabling the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> to be very compact and can fit in the restricted space on top of the dielectric window.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the primary inductive element <b>630</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> may be operated at different frequencies. The frequencies may be sufficiently different to reduce plasma crosstalk between the primary inductive element <b>630</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>640</b>. For example, the frequency applied to the primary inductive element <b>630</b> may be at least about 1.5 times the frequency applied to the secondary inductive element <b>640</b>. In some embodiments, the frequency applied to the primary inductive element <b>630</b> may be about 13.56 MHz, and the frequency applied to the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> may be in the range of about 1.75 MHz to about 2.15 MHz. Other suitable frequencies can also be used, such as about 400 kHz, about 4 MHz, and about 27 MHz. Although the present disclosure is discussed with reference to the primary inductive element <b>630</b> operating at a higher frequency relative to the secondary inductive element <b>640</b>, according to the disclosure provided herein, those skilled in the art should understand that the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> can be operated at a higher frequency, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments, the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> may include a planar coil <b>642</b> and a magnetic flux concentrator <b>644</b>. The magnetic flux concentrator <b>644</b> may be made of ferrite material. Using a magnetic flux concentrator with an appropriate coil can enable the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> to have higher plasma coupling and good energy transmission efficiency, and can significantly reduce its coupling with the metal shield <b>652</b>. Using a lower frequency (for example, about 2 MHz) on the secondary induction element <b>640</b> can increase the skin layer, which also improves the plasma heating efficiency.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some embodiments, the primary inductive element <b>630</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> may have different functions. For example, the primary inductive element <b>630</b> may be used to perform the basic function of plasma generation during ignition and provide sufficient priming for the secondary inductive element <b>640</b>. The primary inductive element <b>630</b> may have couplings to both the plasma and the ground shield to stabilize the plasma potential. The first Faraday shield <b>654</b> associated with the primary inductive element <b>630</b> avoids window sputtering and may be used to provide coupling to the ground shield.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">An additional coil may be operated in the presence of a good plasma priming provided by the primary induction element <b>630</b>, and therefore, the additional coil preferably has good plasma coupling to the plasma and good energy transfer efficiency. The secondary inductive element <b>640</b> including the magnetic flux concentrator <b>644</b> not only provides good magnetic flux transfer to the plasma volume, but also provides good decoupling between the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> and a surrounding metal shield <b>652</b>. The symmetrical driving of the magnetic flux concentrator <b>644</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> further reduces the voltage amplitude between the coil end and the surrounding ground element. This can reduce the sputtering of the dome, but at the same time it will bring some small capacitive coupling to the plasma, which can be used to aid ignition. In some embodiments, a second Faraday shield can be used in combination with the secondary inductive element <b>640</b> to reduce the capacitive coupling of the secondary inductive element <b>640</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the plasma processing apparatus may include a radio frequency (RF) bias electrode <b>660</b> disposed in the processing chamber <b>601</b>. The plasma processing apparatus may further include a ground plane <b>670</b> disposed in the processing chamber <b>601</b> such that the ground plane <b>670</b> is spaced apart from the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> along the vertical direction V. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> and the ground plane <b>670</b> may be disposed in the pedestal <b>604</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> may be coupled to the RF power generator <b>680</b> via a suitable matching network <b>682</b>. When the RF power generator <b>680</b> provides RF energy to the RF bias electrode <b>660</b>, plasma may be generated from the mixture in the processing chamber <b>601</b> to be directly exposed to the substrate <b>606</b>. In some embodiments, the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> may define an RF region <b>662</b> extending along the lateral direction L between the first end <b>664</b> of the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> and the second end <b>666</b> of the RF bias electrode <b>660</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the RF region <b>662</b> may span from the first end <b>664</b> of the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> to the second end <b>666</b> of the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> along the lateral direction L. The RF region <b>662</b> may further extend along the vertical direction V between the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> and the dielectric window <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">It should be understood that the length of the ground plane <b>670</b> along the lateral direction L is greater than the length of the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> along the lateral direction L. In this way, the ground plane <b>670</b> can direct the RF energy emitted by the RF bias electrode <b>660</b> to the substrate <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">It should be noted that in the present disclosure, the use of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in combination with a numerical value is intended to be within ten percent (10%) of the indicated value.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Here, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is only exemplary.
