id="p-0003" num="0002">Exercising is one of the most effective ways to improve the quality of life at any age and in any physical condition. The exercising can be performed in the gym, for example, by a large number of facilities that each constitutes exercising on a different area in the exercising body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One method of exercise is known as Pilates. The purpose of this method is to train the body so that it can perform the daily tasks with a minimum of effort, without unnecessary wear and tear, and without physical injuries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pilates exercises are performed in a number of short repetitions, out of a desire to allow concentration during each repetition and to avoid exhausting the muscle. Pilates largely avoids high impact, high power output, and heavy muscular and skeletal loading. Each Pilates exercise requires stabilization of certain parts, and balanced movement from the other parts. The requirement to maintain maximum stability of certain parts should challenge the stabilizing muscles in that area. The requirement for harmonious movement throughout the range should activate more muscles and not just the muscles accustomed to operating.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pilates practitioners sometimes use a gymnastic ball in their exercises. (From Wikipedia in Hebrew).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the obstacles in home exercising is the size of the exercising facility. A prior art exercising device such as Solo Strength (https://solostrength.com/) comprises a frame attachable to a wall, on which a training rod is installed. As can be seen, it uses a plurality of bars for attaching the frame to a wall. The bars also keep the frame away from the wall, and therefore this space is not usable. Another option is a base to which the frame is connected. In both cases the facility wastes space.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a solution to the above-mentioned and other problems of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a universal gym facility, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a pair of vertical supporting pillars (<b>11</b>), each attachable to a flat vertical object;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">at least one training rod (<b>12</b>) horizontally attachable to the supporting pillars (<b>11</b>); and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">at least one securing facility (<b>20</b>), for securing the training rod (<b>12</b>) to one of the supporting pillars (<b>11</b>).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">According to one embodiment of the invention, the gym facility of claim <b>1</b>, wherein the securing facility (<b>20</b>) comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">a latch (<b>22</b>) rotatable around a hinge (<b>24</b>) connected to a supporting pillar (<b>11</b>), the latch having a flat surface (<b>25</b>); and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0015">a security bolt (<b>21</b>), for retaining the latch into its current position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">According to one embodiment of the invention, at least one end of the training rod (<b>12</b>) is in a form of a polygonal prism, for fitting to the flat surface (<b>25</b>) of the latch, for preventing the training rod to rotate upon securing thereof by the securing facility (<b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">According to another embodiment of the invention, an end of the training rod (<b>12</b>) is in a form of a circular prism, for allowing the training rod to rotate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">The flat object may be a door jamb (<b>10</b>), closet wall, etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">According to one embodiment of the invention, the supporting pillar (<b>11</b>) comprises two parallel panels, connected to each other by spacers (<b>17</b>), thereby allowing hanging on each of the spacers a training accessory (<b>13</b>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) is an anchoring device used for hanging thereon a training accessory (<b>13</b>).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) comprises a TPU coating, for suiting to stress and relaxation exercising.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) comprises a TPU coating, for suiting to stress and relaxation exercising.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) comprises a softening coating, for suiting for Pilates exercises.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) is rotatable around its axis.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">According to one embodiment of the invention, the training rod (<b>12</b>) is fixed to its axis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">According to one embodiment of the invention, one of the panels comprises a plurality of holes longwise for inserting therein one end of a training accessory (<b>13</b>), and another panel comprises a securing facility (<b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">According to one embodiment of the invention, a length of the training rod is adjustable.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">According to one embodiment of the invention, a length of the training rod is fixed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">According to one embodiment of the invention, a length of the supporting pillar is 2.36 meters.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">According to one embodiment of the invention, a length of the supporting pillar is 1.96 meters.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">The reference numbers have been used to point out elements in the embodiments described and illustrated herein, in order to facilitate the understanding of the invention.
