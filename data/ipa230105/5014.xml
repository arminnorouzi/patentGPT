They can give the identity of a person, the time, and their location. But while some services work globally, without regard to network or location on Earth, others are restricted to a specific network and or specific coverage locations. Some services use such technology to provide, for example, interactive network-based driving instructions. Rather than offering a car-based satellite navigation system, such a service uses a phone, usually a cell phone, to send its GPS information periodically to a server, which then uses that information to send maps of the current location, such as a street or other locator, back to the phone. Thus a user may enter (into said device) a target location and the phone can then display and guide the user through a route to the target. Other systems may provide people with auxiliary services such as, for example, a selection of restaurants nearby.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one embodiment, method that can be performed on a system, is provided to take not just a person's time and location into consideration, but also has knowledge of and takes into account their availability, their preferences, their schedule, their purpose for being at their current location, and/or their next goal or stop (not just in terms of location but also in terms of activity).

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, electrical, functional, and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary time-and-location graph <b>100</b>, mapping the travels and activities of a person. Locations are plotted along vertical axis | <b>102</b>, and times are plotted along horizontal axis t <b>101</b>. Way points W<b>0</b>-W<b>8</b>, which are locations where a person has some planned activity that relates to their business or their travel, and meeting segment M<b>1</b> lie along travel segments T<b>0</b>-T<b>6</b>. For example, the travel segment T<b>3</b> between points W<b>3</b> and W<b>4</b> could be when and where a traveler changes planes in O'Hare Airport in Chicago, moving between his arrival gate, which in this example is W<b>3</b>, and his departure gate, which in this example is W<b>4</b>. The traveler arrives on a plane whose flight is travel segment T<b>2</b>, and he must depart on another plane whose flight is travel segment T<b>4</b>. His location, which, in this example, is his current location CL, is on the arrival path into the airport, as indicated by the placement of CL on travel segment T<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a time-and-location graph <b>200</b> that shows the plane-change portion of the trip mentioned as an example in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, above. Current location CL is shown in magnified graph section <b>210</b>. Way point W<b>3</b> could be, for example, gate B<b>17</b>, where the traveler arrives, and way point W<b>4</b> could be gate C<b>4</b>, where he is scheduled to depart. Thus the traveler must walk, in this case, from W<b>3</b> to W<b>4</b>, along travel segment T<b>3</b>. Along this segment lie a coffee shop CS<b>1</b>, for example, or a full-service restaurant FSR<b>2</b>, at certain distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> from point W<b>3</b>. With the predictive context-sensitive awareness system of this invention, the traveler's phone could tell him that he does not have food service on his next flight and could also tell him the location of restaurants CS<b>1</b> and FSR<b>2</b> in the path between gates, basing the selection of these two restaurants for his information on his past preferences. In addition, based on merchant agreements for priority listings, various food merchants in the airport may receive notification of the traveler's future planned and current activity, so in real time/dynamically, or in the future, these merchants could offer the traveler a discount coupon to attract him to their business, or could send him an online menu so he could, for example, view the menu and order food to be ready when he arrives, either for on-site consumption or to go for his next flight. Further, referring to his preferences and past behavior, the system may submit only certain of these offers to him.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally, in one embodiment a real-time/dynamic link to the supplier's inventory system affects which offers are made by suppliers. For example, a caf&#xe9; might have twice the expected inventory of chocolate chip cookies, which can't be sold beyond four hours from time of baking. Based on this inventory level, the supplier system would offer free chocolate chip cookies to passers by until the inventory level reaches the supplier's expected levels again, at which point the offers would stop.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an overview of the architecture of one embodiment of a system <b>300</b>. The anticipatory context and location-sensitive and direction-determination system <b>301</b> is using information coming from many source, such as the business schedule <b>302</b>, the travel schedule <b>303</b>, and the personal preferences and schedule of the traveler <b>304</b>. Information also comes from the GPS information from user's device <b>305</b> (this may be GPS or other equivalent location technology, herein generally referred to as GPS) and real-time service provider information <b>306</b>, which may be provided by any of a large variety of service providers in real time through connections <b>307</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. In other cases this information may be collected in another section of a service platform and provided directly from there. This information may trickle in based on travel schedules, or it may be returned based on requests specific to the travel schedule being examined. This supplier information would include information on the real-time status of inventory levels and the state of the supplier's yield management system. The information is then processed with detailed local information and service provider offers in section <b>310</b>, and the results are processed and are sent as notices to the user or to other members of his business team, family, or other involved persons, or to service providers as required.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment the individual service events that are booked for a user report relevant events it creates to a centralized system. In one embodiment, the structure for the events generated by services include any of multiple parameters, such as the date and time of the event start; the date and time of the event end; the location (address, airport, train station, etc.) where that event starts; the location (address, airport, train station, etc.) where that event ends; the type of travel between destinations, which may include, but is not limited to, such carriers as airplane, car, and train; the location of travel between destinations, which may include, for example, traveling between, at destination, or near destination; people who are sharing this event (for example, if a limo is booked with two passengers, then those two people would be named); availability of people involved in event; and options such as not available or available via such communication means as mobile phone, work phone, home phone, text messaging, email, or instant messenger.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the events also include surrounding time periods affected by this reservation. For example, the fact that a traveler has a flight that is scheduled to depart at 4 p.m. means that he is likely to be traveling to the airport for some period of time before that flight departs and will be unavailable for certain things such as phone calls, email or marketing offers. However, if said traveler has a layover between flights, he may be available to receive offers for restaurants in the B concourse at O'Hare offering discounts to him over his mobile phone. In addition, the user should be able to set preferences for each service that indicate how he would like to be available during specific events. For example, the flight service may allow the user to indicate that during the layover period at an airport, he is available via SMS and email, but not by phone. One embodiment allows for a more detailed availability model controlled in part by the user. One embodiment also allows for a detailed analysis of the dependencies between services. For example, if a user changed his flight leaving from SFO, the system could derive from this event list that he probably also wants to change his airport parking service at SFO.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, if a travel line (time and/or place) is changed due to, for example, a late flight, changed plans, or early or late conclusion of business at a certain stop may include, but are not limited to, notification of affected parties, such as a limo service (to reschedule a pick-up time), family and/or friends, a hotel (to reschedule, cancel, or book reservations), a restaurant (also to reschedule, cancel, or book reservations); and making alternate arrangements, based on known preferences, such as booking a limo instead of a cab, booking an earlier or later flight, including seat reservations, arranging a car rental, presenting public transportation routes and schedules with information about getting via shuttle or train from the airport to the hotel, etc. For example, the system may let the traveler know whether a nearby hotel has early check-in available, thus letting the traveler decide whether to proceed to the hotel and take a shower, or shower at the airport lounge, or go to an offsite restaurant.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One embodiment also coordinates offers from businesses and suppliers, based on knowledge of a traveler's stops and route/path, such as special deals, based on known preferences and past spending from businesses more or less along the traveler's path. Suppliers may send a movie, documents, restaurant menu, etc., for the next flight segment, to pick up at the airport, waiting at the gate, or, in the case of digital items, even directly to user's devices such as a mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA). For example, a traveler may order a movie or other program in flight, so it can be downloaded and ready when the plane lands, waiting on a DVD or ready for transfer to a memory stick. Further, one embodiment sends the traveler messages with information about the airport, such as whether passing through a security checkpoint is required to get to a certain merchant or for changing buildings, etc., or about the availability of services in and out of the airport security zone (i.e., for a quick meeting with local non-traveler, etc.).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With predictive knowledge of future traffic near their establishment at a given time period, suppliers can prepare in various ways, such as, for example, by ordering appropriate amounts of perishable food, by making special offers based on light traffic (deeper discounts) or heavy traffic (discounts on food to go, to reduce crowding on site). Also, the further a merchant is off the route of a traveler, the more of an incentive the merchant may offer to the traveler to go to his establishment, in addition to a low traffic discount.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One embodiment schedules variable intervals of GPS checking, such as every 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 km, etc. Further, the checking interval may depend on the traveler's location and available services. For example, in an airport, precise location is important because of the many services available in the area, while the location of a car traveling across the Mojave Desert is less critical because there are no services for miles.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The installation of microcells on airplanes facilitates cell phone GPS and predictive services as described herein. Further, one embodiment use subsets of microcells (IP addresses), to ascertain the traveler's location very specifically; for example, on a particular flight, or at some other specific location. Thus by checking the traveler's ID and having knowledge of his plans and schedule, one embodiment ensures that he is in the right place at the right time, e.g., at the right gate for the correct flight. Alternative embodiments may apply to other situations besides airplanes, including but not limited to cars, busses, boats, trains etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As the system detects changes or deviations from the predicted itinerary, the offers of service are adjusted accordingly, in one embodiment. For example, if a traveler's flight is cancelled and the traveler is rebooked on a flight early the next morning, the system could offer bookings at nearby hotels.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One embodiment includes countermeasures to prevent unauthorized knowledge of the user's ID, for security purposes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment payment options, such as the use of credit cards such as American Express, VISA, Master Card, etc., and payment services such as PayPal, because they are accepted universally, even by small businesses. Thus, codes for discounts and promotions delivered to the user can be applied to credit card charges.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example travel environment <b>400</b>. It is clear that this travel environment is only exemplary and other kinds of environments are also applicable, including those examples given above, but for purposes of clarity and simplicity the focus shall be on this example environment. Terminal <b>401</b> is a typical commercial airline terminal, with two sets of gates G<b>1</b>-Gn <b>404</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and H<b>1</b>-Hn <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. There is also food court <b>402</b> with a concentration of service providers SP<b>1</b>-SPn <b>403</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Planes P<b>1</b>-Pn come from both sides, as indicated by arrows <b>406</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and <b>407</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. In such an environment, most airline flights are typically to or from a hub terminal, wherein travelers arrive and then leave again on connecting flights within a very short period of time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a graph <b>500</b> of traffic variations at service provider SPx. The traffic quantity is shown on the vertical axis <b>501</b> and the time range is shown on the horizontal axis <b>502</b>. Three example traffic curves are shown: curve C<b>1</b> <b>503</b>, curve C<b>2</b> <b>504</b>, and curve C<b>3</b> <b>505</b>. Each curve has a different peak, or peaks, in the peak area <b>506</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. For example, curve C<b>1</b> has a flat spread, in the case that the arrival and departure of planes is spread over a wider range of time, due perhaps to intentional scheduling and also to early and late arrival of some planes; while curve C<b>2</b> shows a medium peak, with tighter scheduling but also with a few flights being delayed and others being early, resulting in a more condensed peak traffic; and curve C<b>3</b>, due to, for example, schedule changes or weather-related problems in some part of the country, has two very sharp peaks C<b>3</b>P<b>1</b> and C<b>3</b>P<b>2</b>. Depending on various conditions, such as scheduling and weather, as well as the amount and availability of food on the airplanes, the rate of conversion of offers tendered to travelers for goods and services at the terminal into sales may change, because people, if given a choice between having a snack and catching the next flight, will normally opt for catching the next flight. Having an understanding of the rate of conversion and its relation to traffic and weather patterns allows service providers to make more accurate predictions about various items, including but not limited to, conversion rates, offer types, offer upgrades, traffic etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of a process flow <b>600</b> that could be used to analyze the conversions. In process <b>602</b>, a guest arrives at the service provider with an offer (typically, for food or other merchandise, or for a service). In process <b>603</b>, a guest's ID is compared to information stored in database <b>601</b>, which could be a local database, or part of a larger remote database, or two synchronized databases, or some combination of the these. In process <b>604</b> the profile information about the registered guest (i.e., traveler) is extracted from database <b>601</b>, then used to update the profile. In particular, You download the profile to do what ever you do, then you may want to update what it is that you have done (e.g. a new offer), and possibly what the customers reaction to that offer was etc. In process <b>605</b>, an up-sell (upgrade of the offer) may be offered to the guest. At process <b>606</b>, the process branches. If the guest accepts (YES), the process moves to process <b>607</b>, where the transaction takes place and the guest profile is updated in database <b>601</b>, and then to process <b>608</b>, where the process ends. If, in process <b>606</b>, the guest does not accept the up-sell (NO), the process moves to process <b>609</b>, where it again branches. If the guest accepts the original offer (YES), in process <b>610</b> the transaction takes place, the guest profile is updated (in some cases, the supplier database may be updated as well) in database <b>601</b>, and the process moves to process <b>608</b>, where it ends. If the guest does not accept the original offer (NO), the process ends at process <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additional information, including but not limited to, conversion rates by flight, day of the week, season, weather, flight size, flight utilization, etc., may be collected by individual service providers and then pulled together for further analysis and refined prediction models, allowing more targeted offers. Many modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. In some cases, for example, the service providers may have their own systems interface with the system of the present invention. In other cases, a solution may be extended by the operator of such a system, offering a complete solution based on a simple terminal device, or in yet other cases, a system may be offered by a credit card or other business service provider, as part of a larger package.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In yet another aspect of the invention, the information collected from many travelers, and also information collected from airlines and weather observers, etc., can be used to forecast inventory requirements, such as obtaining and preparing fresh food and pulling from storage chilled or frozen food, as well as man power or staffing level requirements, to meet projected demands.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a traffic graph with many of the same elements as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> (see description, above). What has been added are horizontal lines indicating staffing levels SL<b>1</b>-n <b>701</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Thus when traffic peaks to the next line SLn, a higher staffing level would be required. Hence calculations must be made to forecast staffing levels some time ahead of the forecasted peak traffic, because people need notice to come to a work place. In a similar manner, forecasted food requirements must be calculated; for example, how many rolls need to be prepared and baked so there are freshly baked rolls when customers arrive at peak traffic times, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram of a process flow <b>800</b> for calculations required for the types of forecasting discussed above. In step <b>801</b> the system obtains airline data, such as arrival and departure times, both actual (real-time) information and statistical models, as well as usage of the airplane and the airplane model, allowing the system to estimate the number of people expected at a certain time. The data is obtained via communication lines <b>804</b><i>a</i>-<i>n, </i>which may connect to a local or remote database in the system, or to both, or directly to a service provider. The weather data is collected in a similar manner in step <b>802</b>, including, but not limited to, weather data from each flight's point of origin and weather data at the current airport location, because weather experienced at the beginning, during, and end of the flight may impact how travelers feel; whether they are more or less thirsty and/or hungry. Cold and rainy weather may promote the use of warm &#x201c;comfort foods&#x201d; while hot and dry weather promotes lighter foods and cold drinks, smoothies etc. This may also be modified by where travelers go to or come from, as the expectation of weather at the end of a trip, or just experienced weather a short while ago may impact how travelers feel about what food they desire. Large statistical gathering, preferably by demographics as well, may allow to cull meaningful data allowing to make better predictions, and hence reduce potential waste. In step <b>803</b>, data is analyzed from known members, typically the registered travelers using the service (but in some cases, that may include planes, or groups of travelers including non-registered ones etc.) that have a well known track record. This information of these &#x201c;well-known&#x201d; or &#x201c;bell weather&#x201d; travelers can then be extrapolated, particularly in cases of insufficient statistical data for a current event, using also correlation to other information, including, but not limited to, historic data on weather, plane timeliness, plane capacity and usage, etc., some of which may be also stored in DB <b>805</b>. All this information is then used in step <b>806</b> to calculate forecasted curves of required resources (inventory and man power). The system may not calculate just one curve, but multiple curves; for example, one each for multiple types of inventory, one for staffing level, and one each for other similar resources required by the service provider. In step <b>807</b> the actual requirements for each inventory item are calculated, with quantities given in ordering lots; for example, the rolls would be calculated by the tray, or fresh fruit would be calculated by the case, etc. In step <b>808</b>, also according to the curves, the staffing level is likewise calculated, so that if necessary additional workers may be called in as auxiliary staff (not shown). In step <b>809</b>, the process ends.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is clear that many modifications and variations of this embodiment may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the novel art of this disclosure. Additional information, including but not limited to, resource requirements by flight, day of the week, season, weather, flight size, flight utilization, etc., may be collected by individual service providers and then pulled together for further analysis and refined prediction models, allowing more targeted resource predictions.
