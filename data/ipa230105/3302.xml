For example, a piston arrangement may include a piston that is movable within a cylinder. The piston will function to separate two chambers, wherein the volume of each chamber varies depending on the position of the piston. Typically the piston and cylinder are metallic and a seal must be provided between these two components to prevent their contact whilst sealing the chambers, so as to prevent substantial amounts of fluid transferring from one chamber to the other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desired to provide an improved abradable seal that is able to provide an improved indication regarding its failure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure relates to an abradable seal comprising an outer ring arrangement and an energiser for urging the outer ring arrangement against an opposing surface, wherein an outermost surface of the outer ring arrangement defines a sealing surface of the abradable seal; wherein the outer ring arrangement is configured such that after a first period of operation the sealing surface suddenly transitions from having a relatively large surface area to having a relatively small surface area, so as to cause a sudden increase in internal leakage across the seal at the transition.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A sudden transition provides a measured, controlled or predetermined and sudden increase in internal leakage during operation of the seal, namely at the transition between normal and abnormal operation. This can be used to indicate or record the moment at which the seal requires replacing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wording &#x201c;suddenly transitions&#x201d; is used to indicate that the sealing surface does not transition due to, for example, a tapered outer ring. Whilst such an arrangement might transition from a relatively large surface area to a relatively small surface area, it would not do so suddenly, which is the aim of the broadest aspects of the present disclosure. A sudden transition happens due to a substantially instantaneous decrease in the surface area of the sealing surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outer ring arrangement may comprise an abradable outer ring and an inner ring. The inner ring may also be abradable. The inner ring may comprise voids or apertures in its outer circumferential surface, and the sealing surface may transition from having a relatively large surface area to having a relatively small surface area due to the outer ring abrading in use so as to expose the voids or apertures in the inner ring.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The voids or apertures may extend between axial ends of the inner ring. The outer ring may have a uniform axial cross-section or width throughout its circumference, such that the sealing surface of the outer ring may be continuous or unbroken along its circumference.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inner ring may have a non-uniform axial cross-section throughout its circumference, for example due to the voids or apertures that may break the sealing surface at positions around its circumference.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inner ring may have a uniform axial width throughout its circumference, and may have a non-uniform radial width (e.g. due to the voids or apertures).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer ring may comprise a base portion and may comprise two circumferentially continuous side portions extending radially inward from respective axial ends of the base portion. The inner ring may fit within the side portions of the outer ring, such that, optionally, once the base portion wears away in use, the side portions may remain to provide part of the sealing surface after the transition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base portion may act as the sealing surface during the first period of operation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sealing surface may have a substantially constant surface area prior to the transition. The sealing surface may have a substantially constant, albeit smaller surface area after the transition for a given period of time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first period of time may define a period of normal operation of the seal. The transition may define a point of failure of the seal, and/or a point at which the seal requires replacement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The relatively small surface area may be at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% smaller than the relatively large surface area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The outer ring arrangement may be configured such that the transition does not cause catastrophic failure or damage to the abradable seal. For example, the sealing surface after the transition may still provide a sealing function, but it may be diminished slightly due to the smaller sealing surface area. The outer ring arrangement may be configured to provide a sealing function after the transition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a seal assembly comprising: a first component; a second component movable with respect to, and in sealing engagement with the first component; and an abradable seal as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the abradable seal is located between the first component and the second component.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first component may comprise a cylinder. The second component may comprise a piston movable within the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method may comprise: monitoring internal leakage across the abradable seal; and detecting a sudden increase in internal leakage due to the sealing surface transitioning from having a relatively large surface area to having a relatively small surface area.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded, perspective view of an abradable seal;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an axial cross-section through the abradable seal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a circumferential cross-section of the abradable seal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an axial cross-section through the abradable seal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, once the seal has been worn in use.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An abradable seal in accordance with the present disclosure will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a piston <b>10</b> that is arranged to move axially inside a cylinder <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The piston <b>10</b> comprises a shaft <b>12</b>, wherein the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> forms the axis of movement of the piston <b>10</b>. The piston <b>10</b> further comprises a flange <b>14</b> that extends radially from the shaft <b>12</b> to form a concentric disc extending towards the inner surface <b>50</b> of the cylinder <b>20</b> within which the piston <b>10</b> moves. The flange <b>14</b> comprises an outer peripheral surface <b>15</b> arranged to face the inner surface <b>50</b> of the cylinder and having a circumferential groove <b>16</b> therein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An abradable seal <b>100</b> (or abradable seal assembly) is configured to sit within the groove <b>16</b> to provide a sealing function between the piston <b>10</b> and the inner surface <b>50</b> of the cylinder <b>20</b>. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded view such that the abradable seal <b>100</b> is not shown within the groove <b>16</b> so that its components can be clearly seen. The abradable seal <b>100</b> is known as a dynamic seal, in that it provides a sealing function between two or more parts that move relative to each other. In this case the parts comprise the piston <b>10</b> and the cylinder <b>20</b>, wherein the piston <b>10</b> moves within the stationary cylinder <b>20</b>. Thus, the inner surface <b>50</b> of the cylinder <b>20</b> can otherwise be referred to as the opposing surface <b>50</b> of the abradable seal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is envisaged that the abradable seal <b>100</b> could also be provided in a groove that is within the inner surface <b>50</b> of the cylinder <b>20</b>, whilst having the same features as described herein in relation to the abradable seal <b>100</b> being within the flange <b>14</b> of the piston <b>10</b>. In this case, the outer peripheral surface <b>15</b> of the flange may be flat (i.e. may comprise substantially no grooves) and could form the opposing surface <b>50</b> of the abradable seal <b>100</b>. However, the piston <b>10</b> could only move a distance less than the axial length of the outer circumferential surface <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The abradable seal <b>100</b> comprises an abradable outer ring <b>120</b> that is arranged to contact the opposing surface <b>50</b> in use to form a seal between the piston <b>10</b> and the opposing surface <b>50</b>. The outer ring <b>120</b> is designed to wear (or abrade) during use due to friction between the outer ring <b>120</b> and the opposing surface <b>50</b> caused by the piston <b>10</b> moving within the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The abradable seal further comprises an energiser <b>140</b> for urging the abradable outer ring <b>120</b> away from the peripheral surface <b>15</b> of the flange <b>14</b> and against the opposing surface <b>50</b>. The energiser <b>140</b> may be a compressible material, for example an elastomer. Alternatively, the energiser <b>140</b> may be a spring, for example a metallic coil or wave spring. The outer ring <b>120</b> may be compressed when the piston <b>10</b> is initially placed within the cylinder, and act to urge the outer ring <b>120</b> away from the peripheral surface <b>15</b> of the flange <b>14</b> once it is suitably placed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the disclosure, the abradable seal <b>100</b> further comprises an ancillary ring <b>150</b> that is located radially inward from the outer ring <b>120</b>, which is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an axial cross-section of the flange <b>14</b> and the abradable seal <b>100</b>, including the outer ring <b>120</b>, energiser <b>140</b> and ancillary ring <b>150</b>. The outer ring <b>120</b> comprises a base or outermost portion <b>122</b> extending axially to provide an initial or normal sealing surface <b>123</b>, and two side portions <b>124</b> that extend radially inward from axial ends of the base portion <b>122</b>. The base portion <b>122</b>, and thus the sealing surface <b>123</b>, have an axial length L. Thus, initially and during normal operation (defined below) the outer ring <b>120</b> has a U-shaped axial cross-section, which is uniform throughout its circumference.

That is, except for a minimal or negligible reduction in surface area due to the thickness of the seal wearing away (reducing the diameter of the seal and circumference), the first sealing surface area remains constant.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a transition point during operation of the piston <b>10</b>, in which the base portion <b>122</b> and sealing surface <b>123</b> have just worn away. This exposes the chambers referred to above, by removing their outer surface, which was formed by the now-absent base portion <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the normal sealing surface <b>123</b> is no longer present, the abradable seal <b>100</b> is no longer in normal operation. Abnormal operation may be defined herein as any operation of the seal <b>100</b> other than normal operation, or may be defined as operation of the seal <b>100</b> once the normal sealing surface <b>123</b> is worn away.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the illustrated case abnormal operation occurs once the normal sealing surface <b>123</b> wears away. At this point the sealing surface of the abradable seal <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is formed by the upper surfaces <b>125</b> of the two remaining side portions <b>124</b> of the outer ring <b>120</b>, as well as the outer surface <b>156</b> of the projections <b>154</b>. The sealing surface in abnormal operation has a second sealing surface area that, due to the presence of apertures <b>152</b>, is smaller than the first sealing surface area.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that the piston <b>10</b> separates two chambers which are located either side of the flange <b>14</b>, and the abradable seal <b>100</b> is configured to prevent fluid transfer between the chambers as the piston <b>10</b> moves back and forth along the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Typically, however, leakage exists between the two chambers and the amount of leakage is dependent in part on the surface area of the sealing surface. Leakage between chambers may be referred to as &#x201c;internal leakage&#x201d;. Internal leakage and sealing surface area generally have a negative correlation with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present disclosure provides a measured, controlled or predetermined and sudden increase in internal leakage during operation of the seal, namely at the transition between normal and abnormal operation. In the illustrated embodiment, this is achieved through a sudden reduction in the surface area of the abradable seal <b>100</b> at the transition between normal and abnormal operation. It should be noted that the outer ring arrangement still comprises a sealing surface or sealing surface area during abnormal operation, as described above. This means that, whilst the seal may not be fully operational, the transition between normal and abnormal operation does not cause catastrophic failure or damage to the seal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustrated embodiment, use of the apertures <b>152</b> in the ancillary ring <b>150</b> results in a sudden or immediate drop in sealing surface area, during or immediately after the transition from normal to abnormal operation. An operator could monitor or otherwise observe this drop in internal leakage at the transition from normal to abnormal operation, and immediately determine that the seal has failed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed, however, the outer ring arrangement still provides a sealing function during the transition from normal to abnormal operation, in that the side portions <b>124</b> and outer surface <b>156</b> of the outer ring arrangement provide a sealing surface. This allows the exact point at which the seal fails (or requires replacing) to be determined but without also causing damage to the seal <b>10</b>, piston <b>10</b>, cylinder <b>50</b> or other hydraulic parts associated with the seal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The flow between the chambers during normal operation may be represented by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>Q</mi>      <mi>l</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>K</mi>       <mo>(</mo>       <mi>oil</mi>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <mfrac>       <msup>        <mi>j</mi>        <mn>3</mn>       </msup>       <mi>L</mi>      </mfrac>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <mi>&#x394;</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>P</mi>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">where Q<sub>l </sub>represents the internal leakage or flow between chambers of the piston, K represents the frictional coefficient of the oil, j represents the amount of radial movement of the seal, L is the axial length of the sealing surface (see L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and &#x394;P is the pressure difference between the chambers. As is evident, the internal leakage has a negative correlation with the sealing surface area. This is represented by a length in equation (1) since the sealing surface in normal operation is uniform and continuous throughout its circumference.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Once the base portion <b>122</b> of the outer ring <b>120</b> is worn away, the internal leakage between the chambers suddenly increases, and the pressure difference suddenly decreases, due to the smaller surface area of the second sealing surface. The seal will still function, due to the remaining parts of the outer ring <b>120</b> (i.e. the side portions <b>124</b>) and the ancillary ring <b>150</b>.
