id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and methods are described including placing a valve frame within a subject's heart. The valve frame includes a valve frame body that is configured to support the prosthetic valve within the native atrio-ventricular valve, and at least one arm that is configured to extend from a ventricular portion of the valve frame. The at least one arm is deployed among chords of the native atrio-ventricular valve. Subsequently, at least a portion of the valve frame is rotated in a direction in which an interior of the arm faces, such as to modify shapes of the native valve leaflets and the ventricular structures, by recruiting and deflecting at least a portion of the chords. The frame body of the valve frame is then radially expanded, such as to hold the native valve leaflets and the ventricular structures at least partially in the modified shapes. Other applications are also described.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="152.65mm" wi="113.03mm"

The right atrium contracts, pumping the blood through a tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The right ventricle contracts, pumping the blood through a pulmonary semi-lunar valve into the pulmonary artery which splits to two branches, one for each lung. The blood is oxygenated while passing through the lungs, and reenters the heart via the left atrium. The left atrium contracts, pumping the oxygenated blood through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The left ventricle contracts, pumping the oxygenated blood through the aortic valve into the aorta to be distributed to the rest of the body. The mitral valve closes during left ventricle contraction, so that blood is prevented from backflow.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the mitral valve, an approximately circular mitral annulus defines a mitral valve orifice. Attached to the periphery of the mitral annulus are an anterior leaflet and a smaller posterior leaflet. The leaflets are connected to papillary muscles at the bottom of left ventricle by chords. The typical area of the mitral lumen in a healthy adult is between 4 and 6 cm<sup>2</sup>, while the typical total surface area of leaflets is significantly larger, approximately 12 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During diastole (for example, atrial systole), the left atrium contracts to pump blood into the left ventricle through the mitral valve orifice. The blood flows through the orifice, pushing the leaflets apart and into the left ventricle with little resistance. The leaflets of the aortic valve are kept closed by blood pressure in the aorta.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During ventricular systole, the left ventricle contracts to pump blood into the aorta through the aortic valve, the leaflets of which are pushed open by the blood flow with relatively little resistance. The mitral annulus contracts, pushing the leaflets inwards and reducing the area of the mitral valve orifice by about 20% to 30%. The papillary muscles contract, maintaining the tension of the chords and pulling the edges of the leaflets, preventing prolapse of the leaflets into the left atrium. The leaflets are curved into the left ventricle and coapt to accommodate the excess leaflet surface area, producing a coaptation surface that constitutes a seal. The typical height of the coaptation surface in a healthy heart of an adult is approximately 7-8 mm. The pressure of blood in the left ventricle pushes against the ventricular surfaces of the leaflets, tightly pressing the leaflets together at the coaptation surface so that a tight, leak-proof seal is formed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An effective seal of the mitral valve during ventricular systole depends on a sufficient degree of coaptation, in terms of length, area and continuity of coaptation surface. If coaptation surface is insufficient or non-existent, there is mitral valve insufficiency; that is, regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular systole. A lack of sufficient coaptation may be caused by any number of physical anomalies that allow leaflet prolapse (for example, elongated or ruptured chords, or weak papillary muscles) or prevent coaptation (for example, short chords, or small leaflets). There are also pathologies that lead to a mitral valve insufficiency, including collagen vascular disease, ischemic mitral regurgitation (resulting, for example, from myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, or failed/unsuccessful surgical or catheter revascularization), myxomatous degeneration of the leaflets, and rheumatic heart disease. Mitral valve insufficiency leads to many complications including arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac palpitations, chest pain, congestive heart failure, fainting, fatigue, low cardiac output, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pulmonary edema, shortness of breath, and sudden death.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Apart from humans, mammals that suffer from mitral valve insufficiency include horses, cats, dogs, cows, sheep and pigs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is known to use open-heart surgical methods to treat mitral insufficiency, for example by modifying the subvalvular apparatus (for example, lengthening or shortening chords) to improve leaflet coaptation, or by implanting an annuloplasty ring to force the mitral valve annulus into a normal shape.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aortic valves are known to suffer from aortic insufficiency or aortic stenosis. It is known to deploy a prosthetic aortic valve using minimally invasive surgery to replace a malfunctioning native aortic valve. Typically, an expandable frame (for example, a stent or a ring) supporting artificial aortic leaflets is positioned inside the orifice of an aortic valve, typically endovascularly with a catheter passing through the aorta, but also transapically through a hole near the apex of the heart, passing into the left ventricle. The frame is expanded across the aortic annulus, folding and overlying the native aortic valve leaflets, and maintaining the prosthetic aortic valve in place by exertion of an axial force and by adopting an &#x201c;hourglass&#x201d; shape that distributes axial forces on the native aortic valve annulus and the surrounding tissue. Commercially available prosthetic aortic valves include the Lotus&#x2122; by Sadra Medical (Campbell, Calif., USA) and the CoreValve&#x2122; by Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minn., USA).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A challenge to deployment of a prosthetic mitral valve, analogous to a prosthetic aortic valve, is retention of the prosthesis in place during ventricular systole. Unlike the aortic valve annulus that constitutes a stable anchoring feature, especially when calcified, the mitral valve annulus is not a sufficiently stable anchoring feature (less than half of the mitral valve annulus is of fibrotic tissue) and is dynamic (changing size and shape as the heart beats). Further, unlike the aortic valve that is open during ventricular systole, the mitral valve must withstand the high pressures in the left ventricle caused by contraction of the left ventricle during ventricular systole, pressures that tend to force a mitral valve prosthesis deployed across a mitral valve annulus into the left atrium.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to prosthetic heart valves, and in particular to prosthetic mitral valves.

Upon perusal of the description and figures present herein, one skilled in the art is able to implement the teachings of the invention without undue effort or experimentation.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to the fixation and functional deployment of a prosthetic mitral valve within a functioning heart using tension applied to the chords of the mitral valve to recruit native valve leaflets into the fixating mechanism and/or functional characteristics of the valve.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments of the invention, the chords and/or leaflets of the native mitral valve are pulled into and maintained under tension by capturing arms of the prosthetic mitral valve frame. In some embodiments, arms are structures, attached to the frame, which engage the native mitral valve chords and recruit them to a role in fixation of the prosthetic mitral valve. In some embodiments, arms are elongated structures deployed inside the ventricle. In some embodiments, arms are basally attached to portions of frame, and protrude outward from a core region of the frame to regions where they encounter the chords of the native mitral valve. In some embodiments, tensioning of the chords is at least in part by their displacement and/or by deflection of their shape as arms extend to within regions traversed by the chords.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, tensioning of the chords involves rotation of the arms with respect to the ventricle during frame deployment, by which chords encountered by the arms are captured (grasped). In some embodiments, tensioning of the chords shortens the distance between their attachment points by, for example, 2 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, or another distance in between. In some embodiments, the percentage of chords captured is 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, or 100%. In some embodiments, the independent percentage of chords captured in one or more of the primary, secondary, and tertiary chordae is 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, or 100%.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments of the invention, the movement of and/or development of tension in captured chords is assisted by protrusions on the arms and/or structures associated with the arms such supporting struts and/or rims. Potentially, protrusions, for example, restrain chords to the arms under tension by preventing their free movement; and/or assist in positioning the chord so that it pulls the native valve leaflets into position for use in frame fixation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, tension on the chords is transmitted through the frame of the prosthetic mitral valve to play a role in fixation at other locations on the frame. For example, in some embodiments members of the frame located in the atrium are pressed against the atrial wall by rotational and/or tension forces transmitted through the frame from captured and tensioned native valve chords.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to trapping and/or holding the leaflets of the native mitral valve in a partially closed configuration around an aperture of the implanted prosthetic valve. In some embodiments, the native leaflets are positioned to form an at least partial seal around the aperture of the implanted prosthetic valve which contains the valve mechanism. In some embodiments, tension on the chords is used to pull the native valve leaflets into a configuration which is at least partially closed around the prosthetic mitral valve frame. In some embodiments, the length of close of axial association of the native valve leaflets along the prosthetic mitral valve frame is in a range between 2 mm and 40 mm; for example, 2 mm to 40 mm, 2 mm to 10 mm, or 5 mm to 20 mm. In some embodiments, native valve leaflets are maintained in a partially closed position at least in part by continued tension on the chords. In some embodiments, increased tension on the chords, for example during contraction of the left ventricle, acts to further close the native valve leaflets around the prosthetic mitral valve, and in particular, the prosthetic mitral valve mechanism.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments of the invention, native valve leaflets are maintained in a partially closed position at least in part by direct interactions with frame components in the atrial and/or ventricular compartments of the heart. In some embodiments, the leaflets are pressed between atrial and ventricular frame parts. In some embodiments, the structural members of the frame press the leaflets against one or more layers of material, such as a fabric, which covers at least a portion of the frame. In some embodiments, the atrial and ventricular mitral valve frame parts comprise projections which pierce the leaflets, thereby holding them in position.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to the deployment of a prosthetic mitral valve, and in particular the frame of a prosthetic mitral valve, where at least one frame component is rotated during deployment. In some embodiments, the frame is inserted into the heart in a compact (for example, crimped) condition, for example, contained within a catheter deployment system. In some embodiments, the frame is deployed in stages, for example, a ventricular stage and an atrial stage.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments of the invention, ventricular structures comprising grasping arms undergo a conformational change during deployment which moves them to their functional position; for example by an expansion from a central core, or by assuming a curvature. In some embodiments, the conformational change is in response to a triggering motion and/or other deployment force exerted through the catheter deployment system.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, expansion is triggered by the retraction of an overtube which otherwise maintains the compact configuration of the ventricular part.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments of the invention, a rotation component of the catheter deployment system attaches to and rotates ventricular structures of the prosthetic mitral valve frame, including arms. In some embodiments, rotation recruits chords into frame fixation. In some embodiments, the catheter deployment system is configured to maintain attachment, for example, through an attachment fork, even while the ventricular part structures undergo expansion. In some embodiments, the rotation component continues to exert force to maintain the rotated position while atrial part expansion and deployment occurs. In some embodiments, the fork of the rotation component is provided with a mechanism to allow release of the frame once deployment of the mitral valve frame parts reaches a particular stage of completion. Optionally, rotation is confined to a rotational component subsystem of the catheter deployment system and the prosthetic mitral valve parts affixed to it.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to safe deployment of a prosthetic mitral valve, and in particular limitation and control of rotation of a prosthetic mitral valve frame component during deployment. In some embodiments of the invention, a rotation control is provided with a limited range of deployment available. In some embodiments, rotation of the prosthetic mitral valve frame is coupled to the rotation control through a device which does not transmit more than a limited maximum force and/or amount of rotation to the rotating prosthetic parts.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to connecting the atrial and ventricular parts of the prosthetic mitral valve frame. In some embodiments parts are connected before deployment. In some embodiments, parts connect with one another as a part of deployment, for example during or as a result of part expansion or rotation. In some embodiments, parts are connected after deployment. In some embodiments where parts are connected during or after a phase of deployment, only a part of the prosthetic mitral valve frame rotates during deployment.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments of the invention, parts are connected by shapes which interlock. For example, in some embodiments an atrial frame part expands inside a ventricle frame part, assuming a shape that forces the two parts to maintain a tight physical association. In some embodiments, shapes project from one or both parts, and interfere with one or more structural or other members of the mating part. In some embodiments, deployment expansion is accompanied by movements and/or shape changes which create locking associations between frame parts.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments of the invention, parts comprise one or more connection apertures. In some embodiments, apertures are connected by suturing. In some embodiments of the invention, parts are connected through apertures by one or more fitted pieces and/or piece assemblies such as screws and nuts. In some embodiments of the invention, regions of connecting contact between parts are protected by intervening soft material; for example, fabric, silicone elastomer, or a plastic polymer.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to flexibility of the frame of the implanted prosthetic mitral valve. In some embodiments, a portion of the frame, for example, a middle portion of the atrial part, is provided with elastic members which compress upon receiving a dynamic force&#x2014;for example, due to the contraction of the atrium&#x2014;and expand again when the force is no longer exerted. Potentially, dynamic adjustment in size helps maintain fixation contact and sealing throughout the heartbeat cycle while permitting the heart a fuller range of its original dynamic pumping motion. Depending on the specific frame member and the forces it receives, elastic motion may be through a range, for example of 1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm or a range in between.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Overview of Some Embodiments of the Invention Characteristics of Environment and Operation</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0113">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to a prosthetic mitral valve comprising two frame parts, an atrial part and a ventricular part. The frame parts are provided with multiple structural aspects directed toward maintaining fixation of the prosthetic mitral valve within the dynamic environment of the living heart. Knowledge of the relationship of the structures of the frame to the tissues of the heart helps promote an understanding of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the prosthetic mitral valve is properly deployed, the atrial part is deployed inside a left atrium surrounding the mitral valve annulus, with a proximal portion thereof passing into (and in some embodiments through) the mitral valve annulus. The ventricular part of the prosthetic mitral valve deploys inside the left ventricle and grasps the chords and/or leaflets of the mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the atrial part of the prosthetic mitral valve has a diameter larger than that of the native mitral valve orifice.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments, the ventricular part of the prosthetic mitral valve grasps the native mitral valve chords and/or leaflets by arms. Grasping recruits the native chords, and leaflets are recruited to seal the space between the native and the prosthetic mitral valve. In some embodiments, chords and/or leaflets are rotated around the mitral valve axis by rotating at least a part of the prosthetic mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some embodiments, the atrial and/or the ventricular parts exert axial forces preventing movement of the prosthetic mitral valve into the left atrium. In some embodiments, the atrial and the ventricular parts exert axial forces preventing rotational movement of chords and leaflets.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, at least the atrial part is at least partially sheathed in an expandable gripping sheath which the expanded atrial part presses against the native leaflets when deployed. Potentially, this provides an advantage for secure gripping of the native leaflets. In some embodiments, one or more of the atrial part and the ventricular part are provided with barbs which partially or fully penetrate tissue, for example a native valve leaflet, when deployed. Potentially, this provides an advantage for secure positioning of the prosthetic valve.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Prosthetic Mitral Valve Frame</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a prosthetic mitral valve suitable for deployment in a mammalian heart. The prosthetic mitral valve of these embodiments comprises a frame functionally associated with the valve mechanism. In some embodiments of the invention, the frame comprises two major structural parts, atrial and ventricular. In particular, there is provided:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">a. an atrial part defining a prosthetic mitral valve lumen and having a proximal portion; the atrial part having a deployed configuration configured for deployment inside a left atrium of a heart wherein its proximal portion passes into the mitral valve annulus of the heart; and</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">b. a ventricular part, configured for deployment in a left ventricle of a heart, including arms for grasping the chords and/or leaflets of the mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The association of the two parts with each other and with the heart comprises a portion of their function.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments of the invention, in the deployed configuration the atrial part of the prosthetic mitral valve is shaped with an inverted shoulder, having a narrower (axial dimension) proximal portion and a wider (axial dimension) distal portion. When properly deployed in a heart, the shoulder of the wider distal part rests against the inner walls of the left atrium in proximity of the native mitral valve annulus, preventing the prosthetic mitral valve from moving into the left ventricle. When deployed in a heart, the proximal portion passes into the mitral valve annulus, and in some embodiments into the left ventricle, and in some embodiments even past the edges of the native mitral valve leaflets.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments of the invention, in the deployed configuration the ventricular part of the prosthetic mitral valve is torus-shaped and includes at least one arm stemming radially. In some embodiments, arms are the structural members which recruit the chords of the native mitral valve into association with the prosthetic mitral valve, providing potential advantages as described herein.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some embodiments of the invention, deployed arms project radially outward from the ventricular part and are shaped to contact the native chords and/or leaflets of the mitral valve. When rotated, the arms further induce a torsion force on these parts of the mitral valve, securing them in a rotated position.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some embodiments, the arms are adapted to grasp the native chords so that the contact between arm and chord when deployed is near the radial periphery of the mitral valve annulus, for example within 5 mm, within 3 mm, or within 1 mm. Potentially, grasping at a further distance increases the moment arm exerting force to keep the prosthetic valve in position.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, the arms are adapted to grasp the native chords so that the region of contact between arm and chord is rotationally displaced from the place at which the chord joins the native valve leaflet, relative to an axis of rotation running perpendicularly through the mitral valve annulus. The relative angle of contact and juncture is, for example, at least 30 degrees, at least 45 degrees, at least 75 degrees, or at least 125 degrees. Potentially, a larger angular distance between the grasping juncture and the attachment juncture of the chord assists in pulling the leaflet across a larger surface area of the mitral valve annulus. Potentially, this provides a better seal for the valve.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">It is a potential advantage for the ventricular part to have relatively small axial dimensions in the deployed configuration. A low profile when deployed inside a left ventricle helps avoid interferences with left ventricle functioning such as, example, partial occluding or causing turbulence in the vicinity of the aortic valve.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Connecting of the Two Frame Parts</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, the atrial and ventricular parts of the prosthetic mitral valve frame are part of single unit and are physically connected, for example by their proximal ends. In some embodiments, connections between frame parts play multiple roles in fixation; and, in particular, help achieve fixation which takes advantage of structures of the heart including the native valve leaflets and/or chords.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Physical connection may be accomplished before and/or after deployment, for example, by suture and/or screw; or during deployment, for example by the use of elements which interlock as a result of deployment expansion.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the distance between the peripheral (axial dimension) parts of the atrial and ventricular parts is predetermined to tightly seize the tissue (for example, leaflets and/or fibrous ring) in proximity of a native mitral by applying an axial force.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, the atrial part and the ventricular part of the prosthetic mitral valve are two physically separate components.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, the atrial part and the ventricular part are configured for mutual fixation in the deployed configurations. When each part is in a deployed configuration and the prosthetic mitral valve is properly deployed in a heart, the two parts can be fixed one to the other. In some embodiments, the configuration comprises the presence of eyelets, gaps, tabs, or other apertures and/or protrusions allowing mutual fixation with the help of an additional component of a type including, for example, suture thread, screw-and-nut, attachment rings, and/or ties.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the atrial part and the ventricular part are mateable in the deployed configuration; that is to say, the atrial part includes one or more mating features configured to engage one or more mating features in the ventricular part. In some such embodiments, at least one of the atrial part and the ventricular part includes bending mating features, configured to receive a bend upon mating of the atrial part and the ventricular part. In some embodiments, the atrial part and the ventricular part engage one another with protrusions which restrict their relative movements.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Valve Mechanism</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the atrial part of the prosthetic mitral valve includes a valve mechanism, comprising at least one or more valve members which restrict blood flow in so that it is one-way through the valve in the direction from the heart left atrium to the heart left ventricle. The valve mechanism is functionally associated with the prosthetic mitral valve lumen so that the one or more valve members operate. In some embodiments, association is by, for example: suturing, gluing, dip molding, and/or crimping. In some embodiments, the ventricular part and/or the atrial part are provided with attachment structures adapted to participate in securing the valve mechanism.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The valve mechanism is suitable for functioning as a mitral valve. As such, it prevents flow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium through the prosthetic mitral valve lumen during ventricular systole but allows flow of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle during diastole (for example, atrial systole).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some embodiments, the prosthetic valve is a mechanical valve designed to be deployed by open heart surgery. Not necessarily limiting examples of mechanical values include a bileaflet-mechanism (St. Jude mechanism), a caged-ball mechanism (for example, Starr-Edwards mechanism), or a tilting-disc mechanism (for example, Bjork-Shiley mechanism). In some embodiments, for example, for minimally invasive deployment, the valve mechanism is a leaflet-valve mechanism known in the art including at least two leaflets, or least three leaflets, for example, Lotus&#x2122; or CoreValve&#x2122; mentioned above. In some embodiments, the valve mechanism is inside the prosthetic mitral valve lumen. In some embodiments, the valve mechanism is more particularly in the prosthetic mitral valve lumen of the connecting part such that, when deployed, the valve mechanism is located across the native mitral valve annulus and/or inside the left heart ventricle. Optionally, for example when deployed during an open-heart surgical procedure, the valve mechanism is secured to the valve frame after the frame is deployed.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Typically, artificial valve mechanisms, including leaflet-valve mechanisms are configured so as not to be subject to prolapse into a left atrium as can happen with native mitral valve leaflets. In some embodiments where a valve mechanism includes leaflets that are potentially subject to prolapse, the prosthetic mitral valve optionally includes a prolapse-preventing component, for example as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0065554 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0138745 or as implemented in the Endovalve&#x2122; (Endovalve Inc., Princeton, N.J., USA). In some embodiments where a valve mechanism includes leaflets that are potentially subject to prolapse, the prosthetic mitral valve optionally includes a prolapse-preventing component that is substantially an artificial chord, for example as described in International Application Publication No. 2009/134701.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">As noted above, pericardial trileaflet valve mechanism can be disposed inside lumen of prosthetic mitral valve. The valve mechanism is oriented in a direction so that when the atrial part is in a deployed configuration, the valve mechanism is functional. A functional valve mechanism allows the flow of blood from distal end to proximal end through the lumen, and blocks the retrograde flow of blood from proximal end to distal end through the lumen. In such a way, valve mechanism is functionally associated with lumen in a manner suitable for functioning as a mitral valve.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Dynamic Conformation</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, the atrial part of the prosthetic mitral valve is configured, in the deployed configuration, to dynamically conform to the native mitral valve annulus and to the atrial walls in proximity of a native mitral valve of a heart in which deployed. Dynamic conformation provides potential advantages for maintaining fixation mechanisms which rely on connections to structures of the pumping heart.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, in an unconfined environment, the expanded part is slightly wider in the radial dimension than the native mitral valve annulus and/or atrial walls of the heart against which it presses when implanted. In some embodiments, the implanted atrial part radially expands to press against the atrial walls and the native mitral valve annulus.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">As the heart beats, the shape and dimensions of the atrial walls and of the native mitral valve annulus change. In some embodiments, the atrial part dynamically conforms to these changes. Dynamic conformation potentially provides an advantage by permitting less impeded natural movement of the heart.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, the atrial part is provided with one or more elastic structures, such as springs, adapted to resiliently conform to the atrial walls and/or native mitral valve annulus. A potential advantage of such elastic structures is to allow pressing contact between the prosthetic valve and native structures, without impeding natural pumping motions of the heart.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Expandable Upper and Lower Parts</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, the atrial and ventricular parts are outwardly radially expandable from a compact delivery configuration, for example, a crimped configuration, to the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, compact delivery allows minimally invasive entry to the heart. In some embodiments, expansion following compact delivery is functions as part of the implantation procedures which establish good device fixation.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the atrial and ventricular parts have a larger outer radius in the deployed configuration than in the delivery configuration. A potential advantage of post-delivery expansion is compatibility with minimally-invasive deployment of the prosthetic mitral valve, for example, transapically, transfemorally, or transseptally. In some embodiments, delivery is with the use of a catheter deployment system such as a delivery catheter or similar.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some such embodiments, the parts are expandable from the delivery configuration to the deployed configuration by application of a radially outwards force to an inner surface thereof, for example, with a catheter-mounted balloon.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, the parts are self-expanding from the delivery configuration to the deployed configuration.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Arms</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, the arms are outwardly radially expandable from a compact delivery configuration to the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, arms are self-expanding from a delivery configuration to a deployed configuration. In some embodiments, deployment of arms after insertion into the vicinity of the native mitral heart valve allows the arms to insert in among the native chords of the heart. One potential advantage of this is to place the arms in a position to recruit chords for device fixation.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Optionally, the arms expand as part of the expanding ventricular part. Additionally or alternatively, the arms deploy at least in part independently of the expanding ventricular part; for example, by bending around the axis of the ventricular part.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the arms protrude outward from a core region of the frame to regions where they encounter the chords of the native mitral valve. In some embodiments, they are shaped to grasp the native chords and/or leaflets of the mitral valve, for example by being shaped with hooks and/or protrusions.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">According to some exemplary embodiments of the invention, the grasping shapes of the arms are engaged with the native chords and/or leaflets of the mitral valve by a rotation of the ventricular part. When the ventricular part is rotated, arms grasp the native chords and leaflets, causing at least portions of them to rotate around the mitral valve axis.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some embodiments, in a deployed configuration, arms are connected to the proximal end of the ventricular part by spokes. In some embodiments, the arms and spokes are supported by an annular rim. Potentially, the use of a spoked rim allows arms to be shorter. A shorter arm is potentially reduced in susceptibility to bending forces. A less flexible arm potentially provides firmer control of chords that it grasps. Potentially, the rim may serve as a limit on the movement of captured chords along the length of the arm. In some embodiments, the base end of an arm is held close to the chords when the frame is deployed, for example by a rim with a sufficiently wide deployed diameter. Optionally, such an arm is just long enough to form a chord-catching protrusion; for example 1 mm long, 3 mm long, or 5 mm long.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments of the invention, arms have a shape which assists in producing and/or maintaining tension on the chords. In some embodiments, arms are provided with one or more protruding members and/or other interruptions along their length. A potential advantage of a protruding member and/or other interruption along the length of an arm is to prevent a chord from slipping freely along the arm body to lower its tension as the arm is rotated against it during deployment, and/or after deployment. In some embodiments of the invention, arms are provided with a hook, which includes a terminal projection optionally reaching back in the central radial direction, the length of the back projection being, for example 1 mm, 3 mm, or 5 mm. In some embodiments, a surface of the hook is sloped away from a direction of rotation toward the open end of the hook, with a slope that is, for example, less than 60 degrees off the tangent of the circumference of the direction of rotation.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, the arm body itself is shaped so that tension in the chords is developed and/or maintained. A potential advantage of such a design is to increase the locking force on the support components of the prosthetic valve, for example, by transmitting rotational force to atrial components so that they are pushed into closer contact with the atrial wall.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to the embodiment, arms have, for example, a T shape, an L shape, a curved shape, or a hook shape. One description common to these shapes is of having a body, which in some embodiments serves to &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; a region of chords, particularly as it rotates, and at least one cross-member, which in some embodiments serves to control the position of contact with the arm. It should be noted that in some embodiments, even the static extension of the arm into a region of chords is sufficient to encompass a wide angle of chords in the shadow of the arm. In some embodiments, the arm angles across, for example, 10 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, or 60 degrees from its base to its point of maximum extension, around an axis passing through the native mitral valve aperture.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Delivery Device for a Prosthetic Mitral Valve</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, the prosthetic mitral valve is deployed using, for example, open-heart surgery or minimally-invasive surgery. In some embodiments, a catheter deployment system is used such as a flexible catheter that enters the left ventricle through the vasculature and the aorta. In some embodiments, the catheter deployment system comprises a catheter that enters the left atrium through the roof of the left atrium. In some embodiments, a catheter deployment system is used comprising a catheter that approaches the left atrium through the pulmonary vein, as in Endovalve&#x2122; by Micro Interventional Devices, Inc. (Bethlehem, Pa., USA) and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,621,948; 7,753,949; 8,070,802 B2; and U.S. patent application Ser.

During the conformational changes which lead to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref> from an initially compacted form, some chords may have been transiently deflected (not shown). In some embodiments, the extension of an arm <b>34</b> into the region of the chords of the mitral valve is itself generative of tensile forces within one or more chords acting on the prosthetic valve frame. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref>, several chord positions, including deflected chord positions <b>88</b>, <b>86</b>, are displaced from their undeflected configuration as a result of arm <b>34</b> extension. Potentially (and whether or not insertion alone results in a net torque on arm <b>34</b> within the plane of the exemplary drawing), a component of the tension forces acting on displaced chords acts, for example, to recruit the leaflets of the native mitral valve into closer association with the prosthetic valve frame.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>C</figref>, the arm <b>34</b> has been rotated clockwise.

Optionally a self-expanding arm <b>34</b> may be preset to initially expand more radially, so that it inserts among the chords, for example to position <b>77</b>. In some embodiments, as conformational changes continue, the arm receives an angular displacement, so that it moves, for example, toward position <b>76</b>.

In some embodiments of the invention, partial removal of restraints on atrial part deployment results in functional deployment of the prosthetic valve mechanism in the still-beating heart, without attachment of the atrial part <b>35</b> to the ventricular part <b>32</b>. Potentially, this allows a longer period for deployment operations which manipulate the ventricular part; for example, to more thoroughly engage the arms with the chords. In some embodiments, after the ventricular part is fully positioned, remaining restraints on the deployment of the atrial part <b>35</b> are removed.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">In some embodiments, separation of the prosthetic valve frame into a separate ventricular part <b>32</b> and atrial part <b>35</b> allows the parts to be packaged more compactly for delivery.

After deploying the ventricular part (not depicted here), rotation initiated at a proximal end of the rotation component <b>45</b> induces rotation of at least the ventricular part around the mitral valve axis. In some embodiments of the invention, rotation component <b>45</b> includes a sensor measuring the torque force being applied to chords and leaflets. In some embodiments, rotation component <b>45</b> includes indexes of the rotation angle <b>46</b> and/or torque force <b>29</b> being applied. In some embodiments, the rotation angle and torque force are predetermined by the design of the rotation component. In some embodiments, rotation itself is induced by direct manipulation of a rotating component (for example, a proximal end of rotation component <b>45</b>). In some embodiments, rotation is induced by triggered coupling of an internal actuation energy source, for example, a tensioned spring, to rotation component <b>45</b>.

To protect against damage to tissue during deployment, it is potentially an advantage to provide a clutch mechanism which acts as a stopper to prevent the rotational force applied during capture of the valve chords from exceeding a predetermined limit.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">In some embodiments, force exerted above the threshold results in an internal slippage of the rotation component mechanism. In some embodiments, shaft <b>705</b> of the rotation component <b>45</b> is coupled to the ventricular part <b>32</b> of, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, with the result that shaft <b>705</b> and ventricular part <b>32</b> rotate together. Optionally, coupling is through fork <b>70</b>. In some embodiments, the rotation of shaft <b>705</b> is initiated by rotation of twisting control <b>710</b>, for example, at the hands of a surgeon performing the deployment operation.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">In some embodiments of the invention, coupling between shaft <b>705</b> and twist control <b>710</b> is mediated through twist safety spring <b>720</b>, and twist adaptor <b>730</b>. Twist safety spring <b>720</b> is fixedly connected to a part of twist control <b>710</b>, and moves with it at the connected region. In some embodiments, twist control <b>710</b> has an interior lumen. Optionally, the connected region is on the wall of this interior lumen. In some embodiments, at least a portion of twist adaptor <b>730</b> occupies the interior lumen of twist control <b>710</b> along with twist safety spring <b>720</b>. In some embodiments, twisting adaptor <b>730</b> is fixedly and/or fittingly connected to shaft <b>705</b>, for example by glue and/or a pressure fit. In some embodiments, twisting adaptor <b>730</b> surrounds a portion of the length of shaft <b>705</b>.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">In some embodiments, at least a portion of twist adaptor <b>730</b> contacts an unfixed portion <b>724</b> of twist safety spring <b>720</b>. Optionally, unfixed spring portion <b>724</b> presses toward twist adaptor <b>730</b> due to the elasticity of the spring. Optionally, the unfixed portion <b>724</b> is the free end of the spring.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">At the region of contact, twist adaptor <b>730</b> further comprises a section of one or more d&#xe9;tentes, for example, ratchet teeth, <b>740</b>. Optionally, the section of ratchet teeth, <b>740</b> is curved. At least a part of unfixed spring portion <b>724</b> inserts in between at least one pair of teeth in the section of ratchet teeth <b>740</b>, or optionally into the holding region of another d&#xe9;tente structure such as a notch.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">In some embodiments of the invention, when twisting control <b>710</b> is rotated, a force is transmitted to ratchet teeth section <b>740</b> through the contact with twist safety spring <b>720</b>. If the forces acting to oppose the rotation of twist adaptor <b>730</b> are sufficiently small, then twist adaptor <b>730</b> also rotates. As a consequence, connected components including, for example, shaft <b>705</b>, fork <b>70</b>, and ventricular part <b>32</b>, also rotate. During successful deployment, this is the rotation that brings the arms <b>34</b> into contact with valve chords <b>22</b>, grasping them, and thereby producing tension which potentially assists in maintaining the position of the fully deployed implanted valve.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">In some embodiments of the invention, as rotation continues, the opposing force acting back toward twist adaptor <b>730</b> increases, for example until a good contact is made between the leaflet and the wall of the valve. In some embodiments, if rotation continues, exerting force beyond a certain required threshold, the opposing force is sufficient to cause slippage at the d&#xe9;tente mechanism. The stretching force intended may be, for example, 2 cNm, 5 cNm, 10 cNm, 15 cNm, or any value in between, or a greater or lesser value, as determined to be appropriate for the conditions of deployment. In some embodiments, ratchet teeth section <b>740</b> ceases to follow the movement of twist safety spring <b>720</b>. Instead, unfixed portion <b>724</b> of the spring rises from between the teeth of ratchet teeth section <b>740</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>D</figref>). When it has risen far enough, the teeth no longer restrain the spring, and the spring slips along, for example, to the next pair of teeth. Optionally, this produces an audible click and/or tactile vibration. Optionally, ratchet teeth are set next to one another in series so that more than one slip position is provided.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Potentially, the sound and/or feel of the slipping spring serve as a warning to the surgeon that control force beyond the preset threshold has been supplied. Optionally, a stop is provided which is encountered during rotation at a preset angle corresponding to a target level of rotation. When the stop is encountered, additional rotation force is transmitted to the stop, and is not transmitted to elements of the catheter deployment system in proximity to the heart.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">It should be noted that operation of the safety mechanism does not depend on all specifics of the above-described embodiment. For example, the insertion of the twist adaptor <b>730</b> into a lumen of the twist control <b>710</b> could be inverted so that the twist control <b>710</b> instead inserts into a lumen of the twist adaptor <b>730</b>. Similarly, curved section of ratchet teeth could be convex, as shown, but could also be arranged along the inner wall of a lumen. The location of the twist safety spring attachment is optionally on an outer wall of an inner component. In some embodiments, the twist safety spring is replaced by another mechanism which holds a position within a d&#xe9;tente with a calibrated force, for example, a spring-loaded probe tip.
