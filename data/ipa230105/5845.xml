The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing of a semiconductor device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known loss free package (LFPAK) semiconductor device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,800B2. A semiconductor die is mounted to a lead frame with leads. Wires couple the semiconductor die to the leads. The wires, the semiconductor die and most of the lead frame are then encapsulated in a molding material. The molding material is then shaped. The formed semiconductor die package includes a molded body that has leads extending laterally away from the molded body. The semiconductor die package is mounted onto a circuit board.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As consumer electronics (e.g., cell phones, laptop computers, etc.) continue to decrease in size, there is an ever increasing demand for thinner electronic devices and thinner electronic components. In addition, the heat dissipation properties of a semiconductor die package should be improved. For example, power semiconductor devices such as vertical MOSFETs (metal oxide field effect transistors) can generate a significant amount of heat. For high output power applications (e.g., more than 60 Watts), special packaging is required to remove heat from the power transistor to prevent overheating. Overheating can also degrade the operational characteristics of a power transistor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment described in the above mentioned patent a semiconductor die package comprises: (a) a semiconductor die comprising a first surface, a second surface, and a vertical power MOSFET having a gate region and a source region at the first surface, and a drain region at the second surface; (b) a drain clip having a major surface and being electrically coupled to the drain region; (c) a gate lead electrically coupled to the gate region; (d) a source lead electrically coupled to the source region; and (e) a non-conductive molding material encapsulating the semiconductor die, wherein the major surface of the drain clip is exposed through the non-conductive molding material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment of the above mentioned patent a semiconductor die package comprises: (a) a semiconductor die comprising a first surface, a second surface, and a vertical power MOSFET having a gate region and a source region at the first surface, and a drain region at the second surface; (b) a drain clip having a major surface and being electrically coupled to the drain region; (c) a drain lead electrically coupled to an end of the drain clip; (d) a gate lead electrically coupled to the gate region; (e) a source lead structure including at least one source lead and a protruding region having a major surface, and a die attach surface opposite the major surface of the source lead structure, the die attach surface being electrically coupled to the source region; and (f) a non-conductive molding material encapsulating the semiconductor die, wherein the major surface of the drain clip is exposed through the non-conductive molding material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another known semiconductor device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The device comprises an inverted MOSFET package, with an exposed drain tab on the top of the device with gull wing leads.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also known in the art are semiconductor packages combining several semiconductor components into a single package so to simplify circuit design, reduce costs, and provide greater efficiency and improved performance by keeping related and dependent circuit components in close proximity. These integrated multi-chip device packages facilitate application integration and greater electrical and thermal performance compared to using discrete components. This trend towards greater circuit integration has resulted in the development and use of the power quad flat no-lead (PQFN) package, which can comprise a multi chip module (MCM) in larger form factors such as 12 mm by <b>12</b> mm. By exposing large surface area die pads on the bottom surface of the PQFN package, performance is optimized for high power density circuit applications requiring efficient thermal dissipation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One of the advantages of the PQFN package is the low cost of fabrication, as a simple low cost leadframe is utilized for the base material rather than expensive multi-layered substrates. However, as a result of this single layer configuration, electrical wiring and routing becomes a particular challenge, particularly for larger and more complex multi chip modules supported by the 12 mm by 12 mm form factor. Package designs directly interconnecting power devices such as power MOSFETs and IGBTs using multilayer substrates are not possible using simple single layer lead frames. Since much of the top surface electrical interconnects must be by wirebonds, wire layouts must be carefully designed to prevent wire shorting. While increasing package thickness may reduce the risks of wire shorting, this is often undesirable for maintaining package reliability as the risk of package cracking may increase.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various example embodiments are directed to the disadvantage as described above and/or others which may become apparent from the following disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of this invention a semiconductor device comprises a leadframe, a die attached to the leadframe using a first solder, a source clip and a gate clip attached to the die using a second solder, and a drain clip attached to the leadframe.

A semiconductor device <b>100</b> comprises a leadframe <b>102</b>, a die <b>106</b> attached to the leadframe <b>102</b> via a first solder <b>104</b>, and a source clip <b>110</b>, and a gate clip <b>119</b> attached to the die <b>106</b> via a second solder <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">The semiconductor device <b>100</b> further comprises a mold <b>120</b>, wherein the mold is arranged so that a source <b>110</b>, gate <b>119</b> and a drain <b>114</b> of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> are partially exposed on a first side <b>124</b>a of the semiconductor device <b>100</b>. A partially exposed part of the source clip <b>110</b> is marked with the reference number <b>122</b>. The leadframe <b>102</b> is acting as an exposed drain <b>112</b> of the semiconductor device, and this exposed drain <b>112</b> is on a second side <b>124</b> of the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">Such a semiconductor device is inverted, so that the source <b>110</b>, the gate <b>119</b> and the drain <b>114</b> are positioned on the bottom of such a semiconductor device <b>100</b> and wherein the leadframe <b>102</b> is positioned on the top of such semiconductor device <b>100</b>, which the leadframe <b>102</b> is the exposed drain <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0039">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the leadframe <b>102</b> is comprising a dual bending <b>116</b>, also called a dual step, at the end where the partially exposed drain <b>114</b> is located. The drain can be made of copper. Advantage of such a dual bending <b>116</b> is that the partially exposed drain <b>114</b> will contribute to an uncontrolled coplanarity due to spring back return and inconsistency of leads coplanarity with package surface. This is critical for moulding process. Controlling the coplanarity against the package surface of bended tip of the die paddle is also hard to control due to multiple tolerance to combine such as cutting the exposed lead tip followed by bending. An alternative way of controlling this is by flat leads, i.e. a single step continuous Cu with partially exposed flat leads. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, reference sign <b>130</b>. The usage of the above described dual step forming is recommended so to form the drain exposed on both top and bottom of the package much easier to manufacture. A dual step forming will have a better control as spring back return during forming will be avoided, normally brought by reaction of variability of radius applied on the bending.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0040">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the source clip <b>110</b> and/or gate clip <b>119</b> comprise a half cut locking (a half cut locking for source clip is marked with the reference number <b>118</b>, a half cut locking for gate clip is marked with the reference number <b>118</b><i>b</i>), which half cut locking can be preferably about 50% of copper material thickness, and which half cut locking is/are located on the side of the source clip and/or gate clip, formed as a wing. Having such half cut locking <b>118</b>/<b>118</b><i>b, </i>significantly improve the reliability of the manufacturing process of such a semiconductor device, since partially exposing source and drain terminals without locking features will result to package crack during clip and package singulation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">Since partial embedding of source and drain terminals will guarantee fillet formations on the lead terminal sides, the effectivity of this also depends on how the clips are locked on the plastic, thus additional half cut feature, formed like a wing, located on the sides of the clips were added.
