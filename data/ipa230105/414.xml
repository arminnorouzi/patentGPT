In particular, the instant disclosure relates to flexible planar catheters or basket catheters including a plurality of electrodes positioned in a high-density array.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Catheters have been used for cardiac medical procedures for many years. Catheters can be used, for example, to diagnose and treat cardiac arrhythmias, while positioned at a specific location within a body that is otherwise inaccessible without a more invasive procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional mapping catheters may include, for example, a plurality of adjacent ring electrodes encircling the longitudinal axis of the catheter and constructed from platinum or some other metal. These ring electrodes are relatively rigid. Similarly, conventional ablation catheters may comprise a relatively rigid tip electrode for delivering therapy (e.g., delivering RF ablation energy) and may also include a plurality of adjacent ring electrodes. It can be difficult to maintain good electrical contact with cardiac tissue when using these conventional catheters and their relatively rigid (or nonconforming), metallic electrodes, especially when sharp gradients and undulations are present.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When mapping a cardiac muscle, the beating of the heart, especially if erratic or irregular, makes it difficult to keep adequate contact between electrodes and tissue for a sufficient length of time. These problems are exacerbated on contoured, irregular, or trabeculated surfaces. If the contact between the electrodes and the tissue cannot be sufficiently maintained, quality lesions or accurate mapping are unlikely to result.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During electrophysiology mapping, a clinician may require two mapping catheters to fully diagnose a cardiac condition such as an arrhythmia and/or to verify an efficacy of a treatment regimen. A clinician may use a global mapping catheter to conduct a general electrophysiology mapping of a cardiac chamber (e.g., left atrium). For areas of interest (e.g., pulmonary veins), the clinician may further use a regional mapping catheter to conduct a more granular electrophysiology mapping of the area of interest.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing discussion is intended only to illustrate the present field and should not be taken as a disavowal of claim scope.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The instant disclosure relates to high-density mapping catheters for diagnosing, for example, cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, the instant disclosure relates to both planar and basket type end effectors coupled to a distal end of a catheter shaft.

The elongated catheter shaft includes a proximal end and a distal end, and defines a longitudinal axis. The flexible, planar array is coupled to the distal end of the catheter shaft. The planar array conforms to tissue, and includes two or more struts extending substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis and lying in a common plane. Each of the struts have a plurality of electrodes mounted thereon. The planar array has an adjustable relative spacing between the struts and thereby a variable areal density of the plurality of electrodes. In more specific embodiments, the planar array operates in a first configuration where the plurality of electrodes are equally spaced along both a length of each strut and across adjacent struts, and a second configuration where the spacing of the electrodes across adjacent struts is increased.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a basket catheter that includes an elongated catheter shaft, a flexible basket catheter, and a plurality of electrodes. The elongated catheter shaft includes a proximal end and a distal end. The flexible basket catheter includes a plurality of splines, and is coupled to the distal end of the catheter shaft and conforms to tissue. The plurality of electrodes are mounted to the splines. The basket catheter has adjustable relative spacing between the splines and thereby a variable areal density of the plurality of electrodes. In specific embodiments, the splines operate in a global electrophysiology mapping configuration with the plurality of splines equally distributed circumferentially about a longitudinal axis of the

the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure including aspects defined in the claims. In addition, the term &#x201c;example&#x201d; as used throughout this application is only by way of illustration, and not limitation.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The instant disclosure relates to high-density mapping catheters for diagnosing, for example, cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, the instant disclosure relates to both planar and basket type end effectors coupled to a distal end of a catheter shaft. The planar and basket type end effectors may include an array of electrodes to facilitate electrophysiology mapping of tissue in contact with the electrodes. Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to flexible, mapping catheters with adjustable electrode array densities. The variable electrode array density facilitates variable granularity of an electrophysiology map.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In existing electrophysiology mapping basket catheters, splines comprising the basket are fixed radially relative to adjacent splines with respect to a longitudinal axis. The inter-spline spacing of electrodes is substantially controlled by expansion size of the basket and/or tissue contact related deflection. Moreover, the inter-spline electrode spacing may further be dependent upon the extent of deployment from a sheath. In these cases, the clinician has minimal control of the radial spacing of the splines or the resulting spacing between inter-spline electrode pairs. As a result, a clinician may not be able to generate an electrophysiology map with either the desired granularity or global frame. Aspects of the present disclosure facilitate clinician controlled rotation of one or more of the splines within a basket catheter about a longitudinal axis. By controlling the relative position of one or more of the splines within the basket catheter, the clinician may create high-density and/or low-density electrode regions across the basket catheter. For example, in some applications it may be desirable to acquire additional electrophysiology information between splines. By moving an additional spline therebetween, mapping fidelity is greatly improved. Moreover, such basket catheter adjustability may further benefit advanced electrophysiology mapping implementations such as orientation independent sensing/omnipolar technology (which is discussed in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While some embodiments of a basket catheter in accordance with the present disclosure may have all of the splines of the basket independently movable relative to the other splines, the adjustability of one or two splines with the remaining splines being static may be sufficient for many finer granularity electrophysiology mapping applications. Once the splines of the basket catheter are placed into a high-density configuration, a clinician may maneuver the high-density region of the basket catheter into contact with target tissue for enhanced mapping.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In yet other embodiments, individual splines of the basket catheter may not be adjustable. Instead, the splines may be unevenly distributed circumferentially to create high and low density electrode array regions. To conduct a global electrophysiology mapping of a cardiac chamber, for example, electrodes on only certain splines of the basket may be sampled (e.g., electrodes on the splines which are evenly distributed about the basket). In use, a clinician may rotate the basket catheter to orient a high-density electrode array region of the basket catheter with a tissue region of interest to conduct a regional electrophysiology mapping.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to electrophysiology mapping catheters such as planar arrays. In such embodiments, struts of the planar array may be laterally adjustable to facilitate variable electrode array density. For example, a central strut of the planar array may facilitate a pull wire that extends between a distal portion of the planar array and a catheter handle. In response to actuation by a clinician, the pull wire draws the distal portion of the planar array proximally, causing the struts to bulge laterally outward from a static position. As a result, the intra-electrode spacing across the struts is increased facilitating global electrophysiology map. Where a regional map with enhanced fidelity is desired, the pull wire may be released and the planar array will return to its static configuration with decreased intra-electrode spacing across adjacent struts.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To conduct an electrophysiology mapping of a cardiac muscle, pacing is conducted. During the pacing procedure, adjacent electrodes are assigned to bipole pairings, and each bipole pair samples the electrical characteristics of the tissue in between the pair. The resulting electrical signals are received and processed by controller circuitry. The controller circuitry develops an electrophysiology mapping by associating the signal samples from each bipole pair with a location of the tissue sampled by the bipole pair. The electrogram from each bipole pair may be analyzed and various electrical characteristics may be visually indicated on an electrophysiology map by color-coding (or other visual indication scheme, e.g., shading, patterning, etc.). In some embodiments, the color-coding may be based on the electrogram voltage at each location (e.g., mean, average, max, etc.). In other embodiments, the number of times the electrical signal exceeds a threshold voltage (or a voltage slope changes signs) during a sampling window may be visually displayed on the map. In yet other embodiments, total energy sampled during a time window may be displayed. Various other methods of fractionation accounting are known, and may be used as one or more factors of the resulting color-code displayed on the electrophysiology map.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward electrophysiology mapping catheters with adjustable, but known, spacing between electrodes which form bipole pairs for electrophysiology mapping. More advanced embodiments of the present disclosure may utilize orientation independent sensing/omnipolar technology (&#x201c;OIS/OT&#x201d;) and related algorithms. OIS/OT and related algorithms are discussed in more detail in U.S. Provisional Appln No. 61/944,426 filed 25 Feb. 2014; U.S. patent application Ser.

As the relative motion of the splines is known, the distance between the electrodes on adjacent splines may also be determined. As the electrode spacing between bipole pairs in both lateral and longitudinal directions is known, advanced algorithms such as OIS/OT may be applied to signals received from adjustable basket catheters in accordance with the present disclosure. Similarly, in a planar array, in accordance with the present disclosure, the electrode spacing along the struts are constant and known, but the clinician may adjust the distance between electrodes across the struts.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some specific aspects of the present disclosure a basket catheter including 8 splines is disclosed. Each of the splines is comprised of a shape memory material which returns to a semi-circular shape upon exiting an introducer. Each of the splines, in a first configuration, are equally distributed circumferentially about the basket relative to the other splines. When expanded, the 8 splines form a substantially spherical-shaped basket. Each of the splines include a row of electrodes extending along a length of the splines. The electrodes may be evenly distributed along the length of the splines, or unevenly distributed along the length of the splines for specialized applications. For example, the distribution of the electrodes may be weighted toward a distal end of the basket where the basket catheter is intended, for example, to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias. Many cardiac arrhythmias are triggered by stray electrical signals emanating from one or more of the pulmonary veins. Presuming a transseptal approach to the left atrium, the distal end of the basket, including its high-density of electrodes, would be orientated with the pulmonary veins.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some specific aspects of the present disclosure, a planar array catheter including 5 struts is disclosed. Each of the struts may be aligned with, and extend parallel to, a longitudinal axis of the catheter shaft. Each strut is coupled to the other struts of the planar array at proximal and distal ends. The struts each include a row of electrodes extending along a length of the struts. The electrodes are evenly distributed along the length of the struts and between adjacent struts of the planar array. In some specific embodiments of an electrophysiology planar array catheter in accordance with the present disclosure, the planar array may include 8 struts, each strut having 8 electrodes extending along a length of the struts with 2 millimeter (&#x201c;mm&#x201d;) spacing. The spacing between electrodes on adjacent struts also being 2 mm. However, lateral actuation of one or more of the struts along a longitudinal axis of the catheter shaft will increase the electrode spacing in a low-density electrode array region configuration to 4 mm and decrease the electrode spacing in a high-density electrode array configuration to 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Known spacing between adjacent electrodes in an array (in two or more directions) facilitates simplified and robust OIS/OT-like assessments of orientation-specific electrical characteristics of myocardial tissue, for example. In some embodiments, known spacing directly permits 2-directional assessments of electrical activation direction and maximum voltage amplitude of sampled tissue. Moreover, known electrode spacing allows for the use of diagonal bipole pairs. Two diagonal bipole pairs, which are orthogonal relative to each other, measure the electrical characteristics of the same tissue region. The variation in readings between the orthogonal bipole pairs may be attributed to orientation-specific electrical characteristics of the contacted tissue. Embodiments of the present disclosure may further facilitate reduced complexity decimation by skipping intermediate electrodes, and forming bipole pairs with larger electrode spacing configurations than created by adjacent electrodes in the array. Decimation may be used to determine electrical characteristics of tissue at a less granular resolution. Further, a clinician may assess situational performance of the planar array at various bipole spacings. In various embodiments, consistent with the present disclosure, adjacent bipole pairs may have various spacings, and be oriented in such a way as to facilitate various spatial orientations relative to one another. Decimation may be used in conjunction with, or independent of, mechanical adjustment of the intra-electrode spacing across splines/struts, as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The benefits of known electrode spacing along two or more perpendicular directions include a simplified computation of the electric field vector based only on average bipole voltages in the x, y directions. Known electrode spacing may also facilitate OIS/OT-like methods that generate bipolar electrogram signals at various orientations with respect to wavefronts, so that a clinician may employ arbitrary catheter orientations. Finally, the known electrode spacing of the array facilitates a balanced and integrated view of voltage, fractionation, and/or activation patterns, which may be readily sampled from adjacent electrodes with known spacing. This information may then be used to compute a divergence and curl (i.e., to detect/locate foci and rotor cores from activation directions).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The electrodes disclosed herein may be ring electrodes, and/or printed (spot) electrodes on substrates (e.g., flexible circuit boards). Advantageously, printed electrodes may be spaced more closely than ring electrodes. In some embodiments, for example, printed electrodes spaced 0.1 mm apart may be deployed in a planar array catheter. More typically, ring electrodes and printed electrodes may be spaced 0.5 mm to 4 mm apart. It has been found that such electrode spacing facilitates desirable electrophysiology mapping granularity in a number of cardiovascular applications, for example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Short interelectrode spacing (e.g., 2 mm&#xd7;2 mm) may be desirable to sample electrical characteristics of tissue (e.g., voltages) indicative of ablation line gaps. In testing, embodiments of the present disclosure, with short interelectrode spacings within the electrode array, detected ablation line gaps via the sampling of low voltage paths between lesions only separated by a few millimeters. Prior art electrophysiology mapping arrays, which lack the high-density electrode array (and OIS/OT algorithm-based electrogram signal processing of the present disclosure), are not capable of detecting such minute ablation line gaps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward planar array catheters and basket catheters for electrophysiology mapping. More specifically, many embodiments of the present disclosure utilize printed circuit boards (e.g., flexible printed circuit boards) to (partially) form the planar array struts and/or basket splines. Further, aspects of the present disclosure include a plurality of electrodes positioned along the planar array struts and/or basket splines. In such embodiments, the planar array struts and/or basket splines may have electrodes conductively coupled to the flexible circuit board(s). The independently addressable electrodes facilitate electrophysiology measurements of tissue, in contact with the electrodes. In many embodiments, processing circuitry samples bipole pairs of electrodes, which are orthogonal relative to one another, to determine orientation independent electrical characteristics of the tissue. It is desirable for the distance between bipole pairs of electrodes to be known to facilitate enhanced electrogram fidelity. This known positioning of electrodes on a flexible circuit board may be accomplished by existing circuit board assembly techniques (e.g., surface mount technology component placement systems, commonly referred to as &#x201c;pick-and-place&#x201d; machines and circuit board printing techniques). Moreover, adjustability of the planar array struts and/or basket splines relative to one another must be controllable in such a manner that known spatial positioning of the electrodes across struts/splines is known.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Conventional mapping catheter designs employ bipole electrode configurations to detect, measure, and display electrical signals from the heart. However, such conventional mapping catheter designs may be prone to error associated with the orientation of the bipole electrode pairs relative to an electrical wavefront of the heart, and result in displayed signals and mapping results that may be orientation dependent, and may not actually reflect the true (or desired) tissue properties. To mitigate this risk, aspects of the present disclosure are directed to signal processing techniques which may sample a plurality of bipole electrode pair configurations, with varying orientations, to produce accurate electrophysiology mapping results. To facilitate such signal processing techniques, electrophysiology mapping catheters consistent with the present disclosure (e.g., planar array, and basket) may utilize bipole pairs of electrodes with known spacings and varying orientations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Bipole pair arrangements, such as those aligned with an activation direction of the electrical signals within the heart, show large amplitude signals reflecting depolarization traveling through normal or near normal tissue in contact with the bipole electrodes. Other alignments of the bipole pairs, for example, where the bipole pairs are aligned perpendicular to an activation direction of the electrical signals, or near scar tissue, may show lower amplitude fractionated signals. Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to OIS/OT-like signal processing algorithms which separate signal amplitude and signal directionality despite poorly controlled catheter-wavefront orientation of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, a first bipole pair of electrodes samples an electrical signal passing through the contact tissue in an x-orientation, and a second bipole pair of electrodes samples a second electrical signal passing through the contact tissue in a y-orientation. Signal processing circuitry may then be used to determine the true electrical signal for that location. The two bipole pairs, though substantially in the same location and in contact with the same tissue volume, may sample different electrical characteristics of the tissue due to the directionality of the electrical activation wavefronts traveling through the heart. For example, the electrical activation wavefronts that typically emanate from a sinoatrial node, and atrioventricular node. However, interfering electrical signals may also emanate from one or more of the pulmonary veins (e.g., arithmetic foci in the pulmonary vein(s)).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Importantly, to facilitate determination of important electrical characteristics of the tissue, the distance between a first bipole pair and the distance between a second bipole pair must be known.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The use of high-density electrode arrays, disclosed herein, facilitates the sampling of voltage measurements, for example, that are independent of effects associated with relative orientation of the catheter and electrical wavefront, making electrophysiology mapping of a cardiac muscle (and scar borders) much more reliable and precise. Moreover, embodiments of the present disclosure benefit from the collection of electrical signal timing information which is substantially independent from the electrode distribution. The high-density array of electrodes may also be used to verify sampled electrical signals from bipole pairs, by comparing the sampled electrical signal with other electrical signals sampled from adjacent (or nearby) bipole pairs. The regular spacing of electrodes in the high-density array further improves the accuracy of various metrics which are output from the OIS/OT algorithms and/or other signal processing techniques; for example, the En value (the estimate of the perpendicular bipole signal), an output of the Laplace equation, activation direction, conduction velocity, etc. Such aspects of the present disclosure are discussed in more detail in U.S. Provisional Appln No. 61/944,426 filed 25 Feb. 2014; U.S. patent application Ser.

The basket <b>101</b> is comprised of a plurality of splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>which are coupled to a catheter shaft <b>105</b> at a proximal end and to a distal cap <b>115</b> (or one another) at a distal end. While the present embodiment presents a basket comprised of eight splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8</sub>, basket catheters with three or more splines are readily envisioned, with the design depending on an intended clinical application and desired electrophysiology mapping granularity. To facilitate expansion/contraction of the basket, a deployment member <b>120</b> extends along a longitudinal axis of the basket. The deployment member <b>120</b> in some embodiments may be a pull-wire which extends between a catheter handle and a distal cap <b>115</b>. Actuation of the pull-wire causes expansion/contraction of the basket. In other embodiments, the deployment member <b>120</b> may be a lumen which is actuated by a manipulator on the catheter handle to expand/contract the basket. In yet further embodiments, the splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>may be comprised of a shape-memory alloy (e.g., nitinol) which returns to a semi-circular shape after exiting an introducer, negating the need for a deployment member <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present embodiment, each of the splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>includes a plurality of electrodes <b>111</b><sub>1-N </sub>distributed about a length of each spline. While the embodiment presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-G</figref> depicts electrode <b>111</b><sub>1-N </sub>regularly distributed along the length of each spline, other embodiments may include unevenly distributed electrodes along the splines. For example, in pulmonary vein electrophysiology mapping applications, only a distal portion of the basket may be in contact with tissue proximal the pulmonary veins. Accordingly, a distribution of electrodes <b>111</b><sub>1-N </sub>may be weighted toward a distal end of the basket <b>101</b> to facilitate enhanced electrophysiology mapping granularity in proximity to the pulmonary veins.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electrodes <b>111</b><sub>1-N </sub>may be used in various bipole configurations to facilitate measurement of electrical characteristics of tissue in contact with the electrodes. Orthogonally-oriented bipole pair combinations are capable of measuring the unique orientation specific electrical characteristics of the tissue in two orthogonal orientations. A first bipole pair may include a pair of electrodes <b>111</b> along a length of a spline <b>110</b>, facilitating the collection of tissue electrical characteristic data in an orientation substantially parallel with the catheter's longitudinal axis. A second, orthogonal bipole pair may extend laterally across adjacent splines <b>110</b>, facilitating the collection of tissue electrical characteristic data in an orientation substantially transverse to the catheter's longitudinal axis. To facilitate collecting this electrical data, these bipole electrode pairs may be independently addressable by signal processing circuitry. The signal processing circuitry analyzes the received signals from the two sets of bipole pairs to determine orientation independent electrophysiology information of the tissue in contact with the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In various embodiments consistent with the present disclosure, the splines <b>110</b> may be formed from flexible electronic circuit boards with each of the electrodes <b>111</b> coupled thereto and communicatively coupled to signal processing circuitry via electrical traces that extend along interior or exterior layers of the flexible printed circuit board. In some specific embodiments, each of the splines <b>110</b> may consist of nitinol. In such embodiments, the flex circuit may be either bonded directly to the nitinol, or, alternatively, the flex circuit may be directly bonded to pebax tubing which houses the nitinol spline internally.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the electrodes <b>111</b> may be 0.8 millimeters in diameter with a total surface area of 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. The electrodes <b>111</b> on the basket catheter <b>101</b> need not be uniform in size and shape. For example, embodiments consistent with the present disclosure may include smaller size electrode(s) (e.g., 0.8 mm in diameter) for electrophysiology mapping, and larger size electrode(s) that may be capable of both electrophysiology mapping and have a large enough impedance to facilitate localization in an impedance or hybrid-based catheter navigation system (e.g., MediGuide&#x2122; System, and/or EnSite NavX&#x2122; system). In one particular embodiment, the smaller electrophysiology mapping electrodes may be coupled to an external-facing surface of the splines for direct contact with tissue, with larger, non-contact navigation electrodes coupled to an internal-facing surface of the splines <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">While it may be desirable in some embodiments to have equal spacing between all of the electrodes <b>111</b> both on a spline <b>110</b> and between splines, knowledge of the relative spacing between each of the electrodes which form bipole pairs is sufficient to accurately capture orientation-specific electrical characteristic data of tissue in contact with the electrodes. In some specific embodiments, an edge-to-edge spacing for one or more of the bipole pairs of electrodes may be between 2-2.5 millimeters. In yet other specific embodiments, center-to-center spacing of the electrodes in a bipole pair may be between 0.5-4 millimeters.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some specific embodiments, some of the electrodes <b>111</b> on the basket <b>101</b> may be multi-purpose, while other electrodes are single-purpose. For example, some of the electrodes may function as both navigation and electrophysiology mapping electrodes, others may function only as electrophysiology mapping electrodes, and yet other electrodes may function only as navigation electrodes.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, four splines <b>110</b><sub>1,3,5,7 </sub>are rotated relative to the remaining four splines <b>110</b><sub>2,4,6,8 </sub>to create high-density array regions <b>112</b><sub>1-2</sub>. The high-density array regions may be used for regional mapping of areas of interest. Global mapping of a cardiac chamber, for example, is often followed by regional mapping using another catheter. The present basket catheter <b>101</b>&#x2032; is capable of performing both global and regional mapping operations by adjusting the electrode array density in the high-density array regions <b>112</b><sub>1-2</sub>. Actuation of the moveable splines <b>110</b><sub>1,3,5,7 </sub>may be accomplished via a clinician's input on a catheter handle. Upon completion of a regional electrophysiology mapping, the moveable splines <b>110</b><sub>1,3,5,7 </sub>may be returned to evenly circumferentially distributed positions for global mapping (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). In various embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more of the splines <b>110</b> may be rotatably adjusted to facilitate more or less electrode array density.

In the present embodiment, equal spacing of each of the eight splines <b>110</b> results in an offset, OA, between the splines of approximately 45&#xb0;. The basket catheter <b>101</b> may take such a configuration in order to conduct a global electrophysiology mapping of a region (e.g., cardiac chamber). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the known angle between the splines <b>110</b> further facilitates a known distance relationship between electrodes <b>111</b><sub>1-N</sub>.

The high-density array regions <b>112</b><sub>1-2 </sub>exhibit angle, &#x3b8;<sub>C</sub>, between splines of approximately 30&#xb0;, in one example. Where even further mapping granularity for the high-density array regions <b>112</b><sub>1-2 </sub>is desired, the angle, &#x3b8;<sub>C</sub>, between the splines may be further decreased. In some specific embodiments, it may be desirable to achieve distances between electrodes <b>111</b><sub>1-N </sub>on adjacent splines of 0.5 millimeters, or less.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, rotational actuation of one or more of splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>may be accomplished, for example, by rotating one or more shafts <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, and <b>109</b>. The shafts may extend a length of the catheter and may be coupled to controls on a catheter handle. In some embodiments, one or more splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>may be static, while other splines may be rotatably actuated. For example, catheter shaft <b>105</b> and inner shaft <b>109</b> may be statically coupled to a catheter handle. Accordingly, splines <b>110</b><sub>2,4,6,8 </sub>maintain a relative angular configuration relative to the catheter assembly, and may not be rotated without rotating the entire assembly. In other embodiments, one or both of catheter shaft <b>105</b> and inner shaft <b>109</b> may be rotatably actuated facilitating the adjustment of splines <b>110</b><sub>2,4,6,8</sub>. A first intermediate shaft <b>106</b> coupled to splines <b>110</b><sub>3,7</sub>, and second intermediate shaft <b>107</b> coupled to splines <b>110</b><sub>1,5 </sub>may be rotatably actuated by a clinician at the catheter handle.

By independently adjusting the angular position of the splines relative to one another, a clinician may modify the resolution of an electrophysiology map. For example, after conducting an initial global electrophysiology mapping of a cardiac chamber, a clinician may further refine the resolution of the electrophysiology map in a region of interest by moving additional splines into the interest region (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the adjustment of each of the splines <b>110</b><sub>1-8 </sub>may be independent of the others.
