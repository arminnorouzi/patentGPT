DRM provides functions such as prevention of illegal copying of data and restriction to the number of times copying is allowed. DRM enables providers of copyrighted materials such as authors, publishers, and libraries to provide copyrighted data to users. On the other hand, since services utilizing DRM use a dedicated system specific to each service provider, it becomes costly to develop, operate, or manage such services. Further, since the services utilizing DRM manage the copyright for each service independently from other services, it has been difficult to transfer data to another service or transfer data to the third party. For example, the user is required to specify a specific provider from which an e-book is to be purchased. It has been inconvenient for the user, since registration processing for the user, an application to be used, or a fee system differs between different services or service providers.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In view of the above, the network system <b>1</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> transfers ownership of the item (for example, an e-book), which is a right to use the item, and managed on the blockchain <b>8</b>.

In such case, the service provider operating the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> is a power retailer (intermediary agent) that intermediates transfer of ownership of electricity between a power producer such as an electric power company and a user as a consumer. The user and the service provider carry out transaction of an asset (i.e., exchange of ownership of electricity), based on data indicating an amount of electricity (the power production amount and the power consumption amount) managed on the blockchain <b>8</b>. The service provider may also service as a certificate issuing company that issues a certificate, or an intermediate agent that issues a certificate on behalf of a certification authority. The certificate, which may be electronic data, certifies an amount of electricity (consumed power) and/or a production method of electricity. For example, the production method of electricity indicates that electricity is produced from either or any combination of particular renewable energy, such as solar light, wind power, biomass, geothermal heat, hydroelectric power, solar heat, heat in the atmosphere, or other heat existing in the nature.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In comparison with power generation using fossil fuels such as oil, coals, and liquefied natural gases, power generation using renewable energies hardly emits CO<sub>2 </sub>that causes global warming. Therefore, among resources used for power production, renewable energies are environmentally friendly energy sources. In view of this, to prove a transaction of electricity produced from renewable energy, a certificate (electronic data of certificate) is used, which has been issued by a certification authority such as a certificate issuing company approved by a national or local public institution. The certificate of electricity is referred to as, for example, a green power certificate. For example, in case the user is a certain company, the company can apply for issuance of a certificate and use the issued certificate to prove creation of an added value to the environment, thus improving the brand credibility. In such case, the item to be exchanged is electricity, which is produced by an electric power producer such as an electric power company and provided (intermediated) by a service provider. The accompanying data accompanying the electricity as the item to be exchanged is the certificate of electricity.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In example operation, the communication unit <b>71</b> of the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> receives, for example, a transaction (exchange) request for electricity from the communication terminal <b>10</b> of the user A.

The data update notification includes various kinds of information indicated in the asset information updated at S<b>118</b>. Accordingly, the communication unit <b>71</b> of the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> receives the data update notification transmitted from the node <b>80</b>. The data manager <b>75</b> of the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> updates the user information registered in the user management DB <b>7005</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>) (S<b>122</b>).

Further, the communication unit <b>81</b> transmits a data update notification indicating that the data registered in the blockchain <b>8</b> has been updated, to the communication terminal <b>10</b> (S<b>123</b>). The data update notification includes the access key issued at S<b>114</b> and the provider information received at S<b>117</b>.

Hereinafter, variations of the above-described embodiments will be described. The examples described below illustrate the case in which the item to be exchanged (transaction item) is not electronic data but a tangible commodity.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an outline of processing performed by the network system according to a variation of the second embodiment. The network system <b>1</b><i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> is a system in which a service provider provides a user with an electronic key, which is an example of accompanying data that accompanies an item to be exchanged, in exchange of the item.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">One example is the case where the item to be exchanged is a space, such as a room. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, in such example, the user A uses an electronic key to enter and leave a building, or any room in the building, such as an apartment. At this time, the user A operates the communication terminal <b>10</b> to acquire electronic key data used for unlocking an electronic lock, from the service provider. The electronic key data is, for example, accompanying data accompanying the item to be exchanged, such as the building or each room in the building.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">Another example is the case where the item to be exchanged is any item to be shared by a plurality of users, for example, a vehicle. In such case, the user A operates the communication terminal <b>10</b> to acquire electronic key data used for unlocking an electronic lock for using the shared item from the service provider, as accompanying data accompanying a transaction (sharing) of the item to be shared. The item to be shared is any item, which could be even a service or information, which a plurality of persons or organizations use in common. Further, the item to be shared is not limited to a vehicle, but may be an electronic device such as a PC shared by a plurality of users, a space such as a conference room or a place. Examples of the vehicle include a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle, and a wheelchair. The detailed processing will be described below.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">Example operation for any of the above-described examples is described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. In this specific example, the service provider is a business operator A.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0192">The communication terminal <b>10</b> of the user A transmits a request for purchasing or renting the item to be exchanged (transaction item) to the blockchain <b>8</b> (S<b>1</b><i>c</i>). Next, the blockchain <b>8</b> transmits the request transmitted from the communication terminal <b>10</b> to the service provider apparatus <b>70</b>, operated by the business operator A that handles the item that is requested (S<b>2</b><i>c</i>).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0193">Next, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> transmits an update request for updating the asset information to the blockchain <b>8</b> (S<b>3</b><i>c</i>). Then, the blockchain <b>8</b> updates the information on the owner or the user of the item to be exchanged, from among the registered asset information (S<b>4</b><i>c</i>). In this way, the owner or user of the item to be exchanged is changed from the business operator A to the user A. The blockchain <b>8</b> transmits an access key of the requested item to be exchanged, to the communication terminal <b>10</b> as a request source (S<b>5</b><i>c</i>).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0194">Then, the user A accesses the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> of the business operator A by using the access key transmitted from the blockchain <b>8</b> to acquire the electronic key data of the item for which purchase or rental has been requested (S<b>6</b><i>c</i>). By registering the acquired electronic key data for the electronic key for the particular item, the communication terminal <b>10</b> allows the user to enter or leave a building, which is an example item to be exchanged, or allows the user to use the item to be shared. The communication terminal <b>10</b> may additionally have a function as an electronic key. As described above, in response to the request for exchange (i.e., purchase or rental) of the item from the user A, at the network system <b>1</b><i>c, </i>the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> transmits the accompanying data of the item, such as the electronic key, to the communication terminal <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0195">In alternative to the electronic key, any other electronic data may be used as the accompanying data accompanying the item exchanged, for example, as described below.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0196">In the network system <b>1</b><i>cc </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, in response to a request from the communication terminal <b>10</b>, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> transmits electronic data (accompanying data) accompanying the item exchanged (transaction item), such as an instruction manual of the item exchanged, to the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The item to be exchanged, such as a product for transaction, is delivered from the service provider to the user A, by any means such as by shipping or hand. When the transaction with the user A for the item to be exchanged is concluded, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> may transmit accompanying data such as a contract or an instruction manual of the item exchanged to the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> further causes delivery of the item exchanged to the user A, for example, by shipping or hand. Since the processing from S<b>1</b><i>cc </i>to S<b>6</b><i>cc </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> is similar to the processing from S<b>1</b><i>c </i>to S<b>6</b><i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, the description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0197">As described above, the network systems <b>1</b><i>c </i>and <b>1</b><i>cc </i>according to the variations of the embodiments each carries out transactions of the use right of the item exchanged on the blockchain <b>8</b>, and transmits the accompanying data of the item exchanged from the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> to the communication terminal <b>10</b>. Thus, even when the item to be exchanged (transaction item), or the accompanying data, needs to be delivered physically, reliable transaction is made possible.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0198">As described above, according to one or more embodiments, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> communicates with the blockchain <b>8</b> that stores information on a use right of an item to be exchanged (for example, an electronic book) provided by a service provider. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> receives a transaction request of the item to be exchanged, provided by the service provider, from the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> further transmits a request to change the use right of the item to be exchanged to the blockchain <b>8</b>. Then, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> provides the item to be exchanged, or accompanying data accompanying the item to be exchanged, to the communication terminal <b>10</b> of the user having the use right that is transferred in response to the change request. In this way, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> uses information on the use right of the item to be exchanged, managed on the blockchain <b>8</b>, so as to improve operability in processing exchange of the item between the service provider and the user. Through use of the blockchain <b>8</b> having high tamper resistance in exchange (transaction), the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> can reduce the burden in managing the item to be exchanged, or increase the reliability of data related to the user of the item to be exchanged.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0199">Further, for the service provider apparatus according to an embodiment, the item to be exchanged is, for example, electronic data provided by the service provider. The use right is, for example, a right to access the electronic data. The change request transmitted to the blockchain <b>8</b> includes user identification information (for example, a user ID) for identifying a user who uses the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The use right for using the item to be exchanged is assigned to a user identified with the user identification information. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> allows the blockchain <b>8</b> to manage information on the user having the right to access the electronic data, thus allowing only the user having the access right to view the electronic data.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0200">Further, at the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> according to an embodiment, the change request transmitted to the blockchain <b>8</b> includes time period information indicating a time period during when the use of the item to be exchanged is allowed, such as a time when use of the item expires. The use right of the item to be exchanged is assigned to the user identified with the user identification information (for example, the user ID) until the use time period, indicated by the time period information, elapses. Accordingly, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> is able to manage the use right and the use period of the item to be exchanged using the blockchain <b>8</b>, thus allowing the user to rent the item to be exchanged.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0201">Further, according to one or more embodiments, a network system <b>1</b> (<b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>aa, </i><b>1</b><i>b</i>) includes a service provider apparatus <b>70</b> capable of communicating with a blockchain <b>8</b> that stores information on a use right of an item to be exchanged, provided from a service provider, and a communication terminal <b>10</b> capable of communicating with the service provider apparatus <b>70</b>. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> receives a transaction request of the item to be exchanged, provided by the service provider, from the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The service provider apparatus <b>70</b> further transmits a request to change the use right of the item to be exchanged to the blockchain <b>8</b>. Then, the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> provides the item to be exchanged, or accompanying data accompanying the item to be exchanged, to the communication terminal <b>10</b> having the use right, due to the change made in response to the change request. The communication terminal <b>10</b> transmits an acquisition request for acquiring an item to be exchanged. The communication terminal <b>10</b> acquires the item to be exchanged, or accompanying data accompanying the item to be exchanged, provided from the service provider apparatus <b>70</b>, in response to the acquisition request. Accordingly, the network system <b>1</b> (<b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>aa, </i><b>1</b><i>b</i>) manages information on the use right of the item to be exchanged using the blockchain <b>8</b>. This improves operability in processing exchange (transaction) between the service provider apparatus <b>70</b> and the communication terminal <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0202">Furthermore, according to one or more embodiments, the network system includes a service management apparatus <b>30</b> (an example of a management apparatus) that manages exchange (transactions) between the plurality of communication terminals <b>10</b> (<b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b</i>). The service management apparatus <b>30</b> receives a transaction request from the communication terminals <b>10</b><i>b. </i>The service management apparatus <b>30</b> then receives an approval notification that approves the transaction request from another communication terminal <b>10</b><i>a </i>operated by a user having a right to use the item to be exchanged. In response to the approval notification, the service management apparatus <b>30</b> transmits a change request for changing the use right of the item to be exchanged, to the blockchain <b>8</b>. As described above, by using the information managed on the blockchain <b>8</b>, the network system <b>1</b><i>aa </i>is able to carry out, not only a transaction between a user and a service provider, but also a transaction between a plurality of users, while keeping reliability at a sufficient level.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0203">According to one or more embodiments, a node <b>80</b> on the blockchain <b>8</b> that manages use right of an item to be exchanged between a service provider apparatus <b>70</b> and a communication terminal <b>10</b>, is provided. The node <b>80</b> receives identification information (for example, a hash value) of the item to be exchanged, from the service provider apparatus <b>70</b>. The node <b>80</b> generates asset information indicating the received identification information, and the use right of the item to be exchanged that is associated with the received identification information. Further, the node <b>80</b> receives, from the service provider apparatus <b>70</b>, a change request for changing the right to use the item to be exchanged. The change request includes user identification information for identifying a user who uses the communication terminal <b>10</b>. The node <b>80</b> changes the use right, indicated in the generated asset information, to indicate the user identified with the user identification information included in the received change request. Accordingly, the node <b>80</b> manages the right to use the item to be exchanged, between the user and the service provider, on the blockchain <b>8</b>. This can improve operability and reliability in processing exchange (transactions) between the user and the service provider.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0204">Each of the functions of the embodiments described above can be implemented by one or more processing circuits or circuitry.
