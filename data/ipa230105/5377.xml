Some of these modern robots are manned while others are unmanned, in particular, a variety of unmanned vehicles include unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), unmanned spacecraft and the like. The use of unmanned vehicles has grown in recent years and these unmanned vehicles are employed in a wide variety of applications, including both military and civilian uses.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One focus in the field of robotics is in the improvement of autonomy, which often includes multiple aspects of robot operation. These aspects of robot operation include automatic control of a given robot to support remote human control. Another aspect is optimization systems (and associated methods) to determine how, for a given robot or set of robots, tasks should be ordered and/or allocated. And yet another aspect of robot operation is automatic, real-time or near real-time data processing, and exploitation in support of automatic route planning, mission execution and other activities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite advancements, existing autonomy systems are typically configured to address only one aspect of these activities, thereby focusing its design of the underling autonomy algorithms and software architecture on a narrow mission set. This limits the extensibility of existing autonomy systems. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to improve existing systems to enhance their efficiency and operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore it would be desirable to have a system and method that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Example implementations of the present disclosure are directed to conflict detection and avoidance along a current route of a robot. Some example implementations use an algorithm of conditional statements to select a maneuver to avoid a conflict, in a manner that complies with applicable right-of-way rules and minimizes confusion by other traffic in the robot's environment. In the context of an aerial vehicle subject to rules and constraints defined by an appropriate air navigation service provider such as the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, these right-of-way rules may be the same as or similar to those expressed in 14 C.F.R. 91.113. In some cases of conflict between two aerial vehicles, the right-of-way rules may generally specify that the less capable one of the aerial vehicles has right-of-way. In some examples in which one of the aerial vehicles is a small unmanned aerial vehicle, the right-of-way rules may specify that the small unmanned aerial vehicle yields the right of way to other aerial vehicles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure thus includes, without limitation, the following example implementations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some example implementations provide an apparatus for detecting and avoiding conflict along a current route of a robot, the apparatus comprising: a memory configured to store computer-readable program code; and processing circuitry configured to access the memory, and execute the computer-readable program code to cause the apparatus to at least: access or determining trajectories of the robot and a nearby moving object forward in time from respective current positions of the robot and the nearby moving object; detect a conflict between the robot and the nearby moving object from a comparison of the trajectories; select a maneuver to avoid the conflict, including: determine a plurality of angles that describe the conflict, the plurality of angles including a first angle at which the robot observes the moving object, and either a second angle at which the moving object observes the robot, or a third angle between the trajectories at a crossing point of the trajectories; and evaluate the plurality of angles to select the maneuver to avoid the conflict; and output an indication of the maneuver for use in at least one of guidance, navigation or control of the robot to avoid the conflict.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some example implementations provide a method of detecting and avoiding conflict along a current route of a robot, the method comprising: accessing or determining trajectories of the robot and a nearby moving object forward in time from respective current positions of the robot and the nearby moving object; detecting a conflict between the robot and the nearby moving object from a comparison of the trajectories; selecting a maneuver to avoid the conflict, including: determining a plurality of angles that describe the conflict, the plurality of angles including a first angle at which the robot observes the moving object, and either a second angle at which the moving object observes the robot, or a third angle between the trajectories at a crossing point of the trajectories; and evaluating the plurality of angles to select the maneuver to avoid the conflict; and outputting an indication of the maneuver for use in at least one of guidance, navigation or control of the robot to avoid the conflict.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some example implementations provide a computer-readable storage medium for detecting and avoiding conflict along a current route of a robot, the computer-readable storage medium being non-transitory and having computer-readable program code stored therein that, in response to execution by processing circuitry, causes an apparatus to at least: access or determining trajectories of the robot and a nearby moving object forward in time from respective current positions of the robot and the nearby moving object; detect a conflict between the robot and the nearby moving object from a comparison of the trajectories; select a maneuver to avoid the conflict, including: determine a plurality of angles that describe the conflict, the plurality of angles including a first angle at which the robot observes the moving object, and either a second angle at which the moving object observes the robot, or a third angle between the trajectories at a crossing point of the trajectories; and evaluate the plurality of angles to select the maneuver to avoid the conflict; and output an indication of the maneuver for use in at least one of guidance, navigation or control of the robot to avoid the conflict.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description together with the accompanying figures, which are briefly described below.

A feature described as being above another feature (unless specified otherwise or clear from context) may instead be below, and vice versa; and similarly, features described as being to the left of another feature else may instead be to the right, and vice versa. Also, while reference may be made herein to quantitative measures, values, geometric relationships or the like, unless otherwise stated, any one or more if not all of these may be absolute or approximate to account for acceptable variations that may occur, such as those due to engineering tolerances or the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, unless specified otherwise or clear from context, the &#x201c;or&#x201d; of a set of operands is the &#x201c;inclusive or&#x201d; and thereby true if and only if one or more of the operands is true, as opposed to the &#x201c;exclusive or&#x201d; which is false when all of the operands are true. Thus, for example, &#x201c;[A] or [B]&#x201d; is true if [A] is true, or if [B] is true, or if both [A] and [B] are true.

As used herein, a robot is a machine designed and configurable to execute maneuvers in its environment. The robot may be manned or unmanned. The robot may be fully human-controlled, or the robot may be semi-autonomous or autonomous in which at least some of the maneuvers are executed independent of or with minimal human intervention. In some examples, the robot is operable in various modes with various amounts of human control.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A robot designed and configurable to fly may at times be referred to as an aerial robot. A robot designed and configurable to operate with at least some level of autonomy may at times be referred to as an autonomous robot, or an autonomous aerial robot in the case of an autonomous robot that is also designed and configurable to fly. Examples of suitable robots include aerobots, androids, automatons, autonomous vehicles, explosive ordnance disposal robots, hexapods, industrial robots, insect robots, microbots, nanobots, military robots, mobile robots, rovers, service robots, surgical robots, walking robots and the like. Other examples include a variety of unmanned vehicles, including unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), unmanned spacecraft and the like. These may include autonomous cars, planes, trains, industrial vehicles, fulfillment center robots, supply-chain robots, robotic vehicles, mine sweepers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one type of robot, namely, a UAV <b>100</b>, that may benefit from example implementations of the present disclosure. As shown, the UAV generally includes a fuselage <b>102</b>, wings <b>104</b> extending from opposing sides of the UAV in a mid-section of the fuselage, and an empennage or tail assembly <b>106</b> at a rear end of the fuselage. The tail assembly includes a vertical stabilizer <b>108</b> and two horizontal stabilizers <b>110</b> extending from opposing sides of the UAV. Rotors <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are mounted to respectively the wings and the end of the tail assembly for lifting and propelling the UAV during flight.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>200</b> according to some example implementations of the present disclosure. The system may include any of a number of different subsystems (each an individual system) for performing one or more functions or operations. As shown, in some examples, the system includes a control station <b>202</b> and one or more robots <b>204</b> (e.g., one or more UAVs <b>100</b>). The control station provides facilities for communication with or control of the one or more robots, such as by wired or wireless data links directly or across one or more networks <b>206</b>. In some examples, the control station may be a ground station, and not in all cases control the robots. In this regard, the control station may be configured to monitor the robots. The control station may initiate mission, but the control station may not control the robots to maneuver. At times, then, the control station may enable or provide a distributed network/server of software functions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The robot <b>204</b> includes a robot management system (RMS) <b>208</b> and a mission management system (MMS) <b>210</b>. The RMS is a robot-specific subsystem configured to manage subsystems and other components of the robot. These subsystems and other components include, for example, maneuver controls, landing gear, onboard environmental systems, electrical, pneumatic and hydraulic systems, communications systems, navigation systems and other subsystems and components for controlling operation and maneuvering of the robot. The RMS is configured to accept maneuver commands such as waypoints and/or steering commands, and control the robot to follow those maneuver commands. In the context of a vehicle, the RMS is at times referred to as a vehicle management system (VMS).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The MMS <b>210</b> is a subsystem configured to manage missions of the robot <b>204</b>. A mission is a deployment of the robot (one or more robots) to achieve one or more mission objectives. A mission may be decomposed into maneuvers of the robot with optional sensor and/or effector scheduling, and the MMS may execute tasks to manage the robot to execute maneuvers with specific parameters and capabilities. The MMS <b>210</b> includes subsystems to process sensor data to situational awareness, plan tasks for the robot <b>204</b> (or multiple robots), coordinate with teams to assign tasks, execute assigned tasks. The MMS is also configured to interface with the RMS <b>208</b>, and in some examples the control station <b>202</b>.

The flexibility of the MMS enables an operator to code it once, but to apply it anywhere. The MMS may therefore be applied to virtually any robot that applies, or benefits from, autonomy. The MMS may include an adaptable autonomy architecture that is applicable to a variety of robots, including those identified above. A benefit of the MMS is therefore not only in the specific contents, but also in the specific details of the architecture, its subroutines, and in the interfaces between those subroutines and other systems/devices that support rapid extensibility and adaptability of the MMS to a variety of domains.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> more particularly illustrates the MMS <b>210</b> according to some example implementations of the present disclosure.

For example, the MMS may use the interface subsystem <b>302</b> to interface with various sensors onboard the robot, the RMS <b>208</b>, the control station <b>202</b> and/or other robots. The MMS may use the situational awareness subsystem <b>304</b> to acquire sensor data and maintain an awareness of the state of the environment in which the robot is operating.

The MMS may likewise use the mission planning subsystem to dynamically replan a mission in which changes to the mission are made in real-time or near real-time as the mission is executed. The MMS may use the mission coordination subsystem <b>308</b> to coordinate the plurality of tasks of the mission with other robots and users, where agreed-upon tasks may then be executed by the MMS using the mission execution subsystem <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some example implementations of the present disclosure, the MMS <b>210</b> is also configured to implement software functionality or functionalities (at times referred to as services) during a mission to provide the robot <b>204</b> with conflict detection and avoidance capabilities.

In some examples, the current route for the robot is described by a route command, a flight plan (for an aerial robot) and/or a mission route; and in some of these examples, the trajectory of the robot is determined using the route command, the flight plan and/or the mission route.
