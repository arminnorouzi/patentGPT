The memory device includes a plurality of memory cells, and one memory cell includes a first transistor and a second transistor. One of a source and a drain of the first transistor is electrically connected to a gate of the second transistor through a node SN. Data written through the first transistor is retained at the node SN. When an OS transistor is used as the first transistor, formation of a storage capacitor is not needed. A region with a low dielectric constant is provided outside the memory cell, whereby noise from the outside is reduced and stable operation is achieved.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

One embodiment of the present invention relates to a driving method thereof, or a manufacturing method thereof.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this specification and the like, a semiconductor device generally means a device that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics. A memory device, a display device, an electro-optical device, a power storage device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic device include a semiconductor device in some cases. In addition, a memory device, a display device, an electro-optical device, a power storage device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic device can be also referred to as a semiconductor device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A silicon-based semiconductor material is widely known as a semiconductor thin film that can be used in a transistor, and as another material, an oxide semiconductor (OS) has attracted attention. Examples of oxide semiconductors include not only single-component metal oxides, such as indium oxide and zinc oxide, but also multi-component metal oxides. Among the multi-component metal oxides, in particular, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide (hereinafter also referred to as IGZO) has been actively studied.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the studies on IGZO, in an oxide semiconductor, a CAAC (c-axis aligned crystalline) structure and an nc (nanocrystalline) structure, which are not single crystal nor amorphous, have been found (see Non-Patent Documents 1 to 3). In Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2, a technique for fabricating a transistor using an oxide semiconductor having the CAAC structure is disclosed. Moreover, Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5 disclose that a fine crystal is included even in an oxide semiconductor which has lower crystallinity than an oxide semiconductor having the CAAC structure or the nc structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, a transistor which includes IGZO as an active layer has an extremely low off-state current (see Non-Patent Document 6), and an LSI and a display utilizing the transistor characteristics have been reported (see Non-Patent Documents 7 and 8).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A variety of semiconductor devices utilizing a transistor including an oxide semiconductor in its channel formation region (hereinafter also referred to as an &#x201c;OS transistor&#x201d; or an &#x201c;OS-FET&#x201d;) have been proposed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 1 discloses an example of using an OS transistor for a memory cell (memory element) of a memory device. Since the OS transistor has an extremely low current-state current (also referred to as &#x201c;off-state current&#x201d;) that flows between a source and a drain in an off state, the memory device can have a small or no storage capacitor. With a small or no storage capacitor, a highly integrated memory device can be achieved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">REFERENCE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2012-256400</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0010">[Non-Patent Document 1] S.

However, the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to description of the following embodiments and examples.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">Note that in the structures of the present invention described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and description thereof is not repeated. Furthermore, the same hatch pattern is used for the portions having similar functions, and the portions are not especially denoted by reference numerals in some cases.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">Note that in each drawing described in this specification, the size, the layer thickness, or the region of each component is exaggerated for clarity in some cases. Therefore, they are not limited to the illustrated scale.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">Note that in this specification, a high power supply potential and a low power supply potential are sometimes referred to as an H level (also referred to as &#x201c;VDD&#x201d; or an &#x201c;H potential&#x201d;) and an L level (also referred to as &#x201c;VSS&#x201d; or an &#x201c;L potential&#x201d;), respectively.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">Note that voltage refers to a difference between potentials of two points, and a potential refers to electrostatic energy (electric potential energy) of a unit charge at a given point in an electrostatic field. In general, a difference between a potential of one point and a reference potential (e.g., a ground potential) is merely called a potential or voltage, and a potential and voltage are used as synonyms in many cases. Therefore, in this specification and the like, potential is interchangeable with voltage and voltage is interchangeable with potential unless explicitly stated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">In this specification, the embodiments and the examples described below can be combined as appropriate. In addition, in the case where a plurality of structure examples are described in one embodiment, some of the structure examples can be combined as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">In this specification and the like, a metal oxide is an oxide of metal in a broad sense. Metal oxides are classified into an oxide insulator, an oxide conductor (including a transparent oxide conductor), an oxide semiconductor, and the like. For example, in the case where a metal oxide is used in a semiconductor layer of a transistor, the metal oxide is referred to as an oxide semiconductor in some cases. In the case where an OS transistor is mentioned, the OS transistor can also be referred to as a transistor including a metal oxide or an oxide semiconductor. In this specification and the like, a metal oxide containing nitrogen is also referred to as a metal oxide in some cases.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">Unless otherwise specified, transistors described in this specification and the like are enhancement (normally-off) n-channel field-effect transistors.

When the highly purified sputtering gas is used for the deposition, entry of moisture or the like into the oxide semiconductor layer can be prevented as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0205">Furthermore, in the case where the oxide semiconductor layer is formed by a sputtering method, moisture in a deposition chamber of a sputtering apparatus is preferably removed as much as possible. For example, with an adsorption vacuum evacuation pump such as a cryopump, the deposition chamber is preferably evacuated to be a high vacuum state (to a degree of approximately 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>Pa to 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa). In particular, the partial pressure of gas molecules corresponding to H<sub>2</sub>O (gas molecules corresponding to m/z=18) in the deposition chamber in the standby mode of the sputtering apparatus is preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa, further preferably lower than or equal to 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>Pa.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">[Metal Oxide]</heading><p id="p-0200" num="0206">By changing the composition of elements contained in a metal oxide, a conductor, a semiconductor, and an insulator can be formed separately.

Examples of a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a CAAC-OS, a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, an nc-OS (nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor), an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0211">The CAAC-OS has c-axis alignment, a plurality of nanocrystals are connected in the a-b plane direction, and its crystal structure has distortion.

Furthermore, a pentagonal or heptagonal lattice arrangement, for example, is included in the distortion in some cases. Note that it is difficult to observe a clear crystal grain boundary (also referred to as grain boundary) even in the vicinity of distortion in the CAAC-OS. That is, formation of a crystal grain boundary is inhibited by the distortion of a lattice arrangement. This is because the CAAC-OS can tolerate distortion owing to a low density of arrangement of oxygen atoms in the a-b plane direction, an interatomic bond length changed by substitution of a metal element, and the like.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0213">Furthermore, the CAAC-OS tends to have a layered crystal structure (also referred to as a layered structure) in which a layer containing indium and oxygen (hereinafter referred to as an In layer) and a layer containing the element M, zinc, and oxygen (hereinafter referred to as an (M,Zn) layer) are stacked. Note that indium and the element M can be replaced with each other, and when the element M in the (M,Zn) layer is replaced with indium, the layer can also be referred to as an (In,M,Zn) layer. Furthermore, when indium in the In layer is replaced with the element M, the layer can be referred to as an (In,M) layer.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0214">The CAAC-OS is a metal oxide with high crystallinity. By contrast, in the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the crystal grain boundary is less likely to occur because it is difficult to observe a clear crystal grain boundary. Furthermore, entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like might decrease the crystallinity of a metal oxide, which means that the CAAC-OS is a metal oxide including few impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies). Thus, a metal oxide including a CAAC-OS is physically stable. Therefore, the metal oxide including a CAAC-OS is resistant to heat and has high reliability.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0215">In the nc-OS, a microscopic region (for example, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, in particular, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm) has a periodic atomic arrangement. Furthermore, there is no regularity of crystal orientation between different nanocrystals in the nc-OS. Thus, the orientation in the whole film is not observed. Accordingly, the nc-OS cannot be distinguished from an a-like OS or an amorphous oxide semiconductor depending on the analysis method.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0216">Note that In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide (hereinafter referred to as IGZO) that is a kind of metal oxide containing indium, gallium, and zinc has a stable structure in some cases by being formed of the above-described nanocrystals.

In order to reduce the carrier density of the metal oxide, the concentration of impurities in the metal oxide is reduced so that the density of defect states can be reduced. In this specification and the like, a state with a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic state.

In addition, in order to reduce the impurity concentration in the metal oxide, the impurity concentration in an adjacent film is also preferably reduced.

Thus, a transistor using a metal oxide that contains an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal for its channel formation region is likely to have normally-on characteristics. Therefore, it is preferable to reduce the concentration of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal in the metal oxide. Specifically, the concentration of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal in the metal oxide obtained by SIMS is set lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0227">Hydrogen contained in a metal oxide reacts with oxygen bonded to a metal atom to be water, and thus forms an oxygen vacancy in some cases. Moreover, when the channel formation region of the metal oxide includes oxygen vacancies, the transistor tends to have normally-on characteristics. Entry of hydrogen into the oxygen vacancy generates an electron serving as a carrier in some cases. Furthermore, in some cases, bonding of part of hydrogen to oxygen bonded to a metal atom causes generation of an electron serving as a carrier.

With use of the thin film, the stability or reliability of the transistor can be improved. Examples of the thin film include a thin film of a single-crystal metal oxide and a thin film of a polycrystalline metal oxide. However, to form the thin film of a single-crystal metal oxide or the thin film of a polycrystalline metal oxide over a substrate, a high-temperature process or a laser heating process is needed. Thus, manufacturing cost is increased, and throughput is decreased.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0230">Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2 have reported that an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide having a CAAC structure (referred to as CAAC-IGZO) was found in 2009.

In the thin film of IGZO having low crystallinity, crystalline IGZO with a size of approximately 1 nm was observed even before electron beam irradiation. Thus, here, it has been reported that the existence of a completely amorphous structure could not be observed in IGZO. In addition, it has been shown that the thin film of CAAC-IGZO and the thin film of nc-IGZO each have higher stability to electron beam irradiation than the thin film of IGZO having low crystallinity.

For example, a low-power-consumption CPU applying a characteristic of low leakage current of the transistor using a metal oxide is disclosed (see Non-Patent Document 7).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0234">Furthermore, application of a transistor using a metal oxide to a display device that utilizes the characteristic of a low leakage current of the transistor has been reported (see Non-Patent Document 8). In the display device, a displayed image is changed several tens of times per second. The number of times an image is changed per second is referred to as a refresh rate. The refresh rate is also referred to as drive frequency. Such high-speed screen change that is hard for human eyes to recognize is considered as a cause of eyestrain. Thus, it is proposed that the refresh rate of the display device is lowered to reduce the number of times of image rewriting. Moreover, driving with a lowered refresh rate can reduce the power consumption of the display device. Such a driving method is referred to as idling stop (IDS) driving.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0235">The discovery of the CAAC structure and the nc structure has contributed to an improvement in electrical characteristics and reliability of a transistor using a metal oxide having the CAAC structure or the nc structure, a reduction in manufacturing cost, and an improvement in throughput. Furthermore, applications of the transistor to a display device and an LSI utilizing the characteristics of a low leakage current of the transistor have been studied.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="2">[Deposition Method]</heading><p id="p-0230" num="0236">An insulating material for forming the insulating layer, a conductive material for forming the conductive layer, or a semiconductor material for forming the semiconductor layer can be formed by a sputtering method, a spin coating method, a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method (including a thermal CVD method, an MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, a PECVD (Plasma Enhanced CVD) method, a high density plasma CVD method, an LPCVD (low pressure CVD) method, an APCVD (atmospheric pressure CVD) method, and the like), an ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) method, or an MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) method, or a PLD (Pulsed Laser Deposition) method, a dipping method, a spray coating method, a droplet discharging method (e.g., an inkjet method), or a printing method (e.g., screen printing or offset printing).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0237">By a plasma CVD method, a high-quality film can be obtained at a relatively low temperature. With use of a deposition method that does not use plasma at the time of deposition, such as an MOCVD method, an ALD method, or a thermal CVD method, damage is not easily caused on a surface where the film is deposited. For example, a wiring, an electrode, an element (e.g., a transistor or a capacitor), or the like included in a memory device might be charged up by receiving charges from plasma. In that case, accumulated charges might break the wiring, electrode, element, or the like included in the memory device. By contrast, in the case of a film formation method not using plasma, such plasma damage is not caused; thus, the yield of memory devices can be increased. Moreover, since plasma damage during film formation is not caused, a film with few defects can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0238">In an ALD method, one atomic layer can be deposited at a time using self-regulating characteristics of atoms. Thus, the ALD method has advantages such as deposition of an extremely thin film, deposition on a component with a high aspect ratio, deposition of a film with a small number of defects such as pinholes, deposition with good coverage, and low-temperature deposition. Furthermore, the ALD method includes a PEALD (plasma enhanced ALD) method using plasma. The use of plasma is sometimes preferable because deposition at lower temperature is possible. Note that a precursor used in the ALD method sometimes contains impurities such as carbon. Thus, in some cases, a film provided by the ALD method contains impurities such as carbon in a larger amount than a film provided by another deposition method. Note that impurities can be quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0239">Unlike a film formation method in which particles ejected from a target or the like are deposited, a CVD method and an ALD method are film deposition methods in which a film is deposited by reaction at a surface of an object. Thus, a CVD method and an ALD method are film deposition methods that enable favorable step coverage almost regardless of the shape of an object. In particular, an ALD method has excellent step coverage and excellent thickness uniformity and thus is suitable for covering a surface of an opening with a high aspect ratio, for example. On the other hand, an ALD method has a relatively low deposition rate, and thus is preferably used in combination with another film deposition method with a high deposition rate, such as a CVD method, in some cases.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0240">Each of a CVD method and an ALD method enables the composition of a film that is to be deposited to be controlled with a flow rate ratio of source gases. For example, by each of a CVD method and an ALD method, a film with a certain composition can be deposited depending on the flow rate ratio of the source gases. Moreover, with each of a CVD method and an ALD method, by changing the flow rate ratio of the source gases while depositing the film, a film whose composition is continuously changed can be formed. In the case of forming a film while changing the flow rate ratio of the source gases, as compared with the case of forming a film with use of a plurality of deposition chambers, the time taken for the film formation can be shortened because the time taken for transfer and pressure adjustment is omitted. Thus, memory devices can be manufactured with improved productivity in some cases.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">&#x3c;Low Dielectric Region (LDR)&#x3e;</heading><heading id="h-0034" level="2">[Structure Example]</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0241">Next, structure examples of the LDR <b>221</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.

Thus, for the working memory, high speed operation and high rewriting endurance are required.
