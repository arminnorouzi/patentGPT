In other words, the moving route can be intuitively ascertained while the guide point is being approached.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, on the display screens <b>2</b>AA and <b>2</b>AB, at least a road <b>22</b> on the map is displayed at brightness visually recognizable by the driver, and the guide line <b>20</b> is displayed at brightness higher than that of the road <b>22</b> and in a color different from that of the road <b>22</b>, whereby the moving route can be intuitively ascertained.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the guide line <b>20</b> is displayed to be of a fixed width relative to the width of the road <b>22</b>. Thus, similarly for the road <b>21</b>, the farther the guide line <b>20</b> is, the narrower the guide line <b>20</b> is made to correspond to the road <b>22</b>, whereby the moving route is made easily recognizable.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the display screens <b>2</b>AA and <b>2</b>AB display a one's own vehicle mark <b>23</b> indicating the position of the vehicle of one's own, a destination mark <b>24</b> indicating a destination if the destination exists on the map, and also a mark corresponding to a well-known point (e.g., a holiday resort or sight-seeing area), if there is any on the map.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, on the display screens <b>2</b>AA and <b>2</b>AB, places (such as vacant land between roads or farmland) where no major buildings or the like is existent are displayed at brightness lower than that of the road <b>22</b>, whereby visibility of forward view is further improved.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, a major building <b>25</b> is displayed at brightness higher than that of the road <b>22</b> but lower than that of the guide line <b>20</b>.

Alternatively, the scale may be continuously increased as the distance to the guide point is decreased.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Here, the second display switching determination distance TH<b>2</b> may be a fixed value or a distance instructed by the driver, and may be set to correspond to the scale instructed by the driver or may be set in accordance with the degree of congestion in the surroundings.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, when the map is displayed with the scale increased in this way, and the distance to the guide point reaches a road display switching distance (e.g., 100 m), which is less than the first display switching determination distance TH<b>1</b>, and is of a distance before reaching the second display switching determination distance TH<b>2</b>, the display control unit <b>3</b> reduces the brightness of the road <b>22</b> on the map in conjunction with the increase in the scale of the map. Further, in contrast with this, the brightness is increased for an area between the roads <b>22</b>, whereby the high brightness and the low brightness relationship between the road-to-road area and the road <b>22</b> is reversed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The above reduction and increase in the brightness may not be in conjunction with the stepwise increase in the scale of the map, but the brightness may be gradually varied as the guide point is approached. Further, the road display switching distance can be set variously within a range of the first display switching determination distance TH<b>1</b> or less.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, by reducing only the brightness of the road <b>22</b> and not increasing the brightness of the area between the roads <b>22</b>, the high brightness and the low brightness relationship may be reversed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As a result, with the navigation device <b>1</b>, the visibility of the scenery ahead can further be increased when the guide point is approached, and the point for a right turn, a left turn, etc., can be ascertained more surely.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The scale is increased in this way, and as indicated by reference numerals <b>2</b>AE and <b>2</b>AF, when the distance to the guide point becomes less than or equal to the second display switching determination distance TH<b>2</b>, the increase of the scale is stopped, and a mark <b>27</b> indicating a path at the guide point is displayed at a display place of the guide line <b>20</b> (i.e., an AR display step).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, the mark <b>27</b> is a mark in which an arrow <b>27</b>B is placed at one end of a strip-shaped part <b>27</b>A.

Alternatively, the display may be performed by a color different from that of the guide line.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">By this feature, it is possible to display the path while reducing a sudden change in the display due to a start of the display of the mark <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The display control unit <b>3</b> displays the mark <b>27</b> in this way, and when the guide point is further approached, the brightness of the guide line <b>20</b> is gradually reduced and the display of the guide line <b>20</b> is stopped, whereby only the mark <b>27</b> is displayed (display screen <b>2</b>AF). This feature also enables the path to be even more reliably ascertained. The scale is configured such that when only the mark <b>27</b> is displayed as described above, parts other than the road <b>22</b> are not displayed. Therefore, the forward view is in no way obstructed in the parts other than the mark <b>27</b>, and the visibility is further improved.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The display control unit <b>3</b> displays the mark <b>27</b> in this way and causes the size of the mark <b>27</b> to be varied to correspond to a change in the position of the vehicle of one's own, and further changes, when the direction of travel changes, the direction of the mark <b>27</b> to correspond to this change. When the change in the direction of travel is complete, by displaying display screens <b>22</b>AA to <b>22</b>AF as described above according to a distance to the next guide point, display of a display screen is gradually started by, for example, fade-in processing.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the above configuration, until a distance to a guide point reaches a first display switching determination distance, a map is displayed on a fixed scale in the form of a bird's-eye view overlooking ahead of a vehicle, and a moving route is displayed on this map by a guide line; when the distance to the guide point becomes less than or equal to the first display switching determination distance, the scale is increased as the guide point is approached; and when the distance to the guide point becomes less than or equal to a second display switching determination distance, the increase of the scale is stopped and a mark indicating a path is displayed at a display place of the guide line. By this feature, while the guide point is being approached, the moving route can be ascertained intuitively by a wide-area map, and by use of a map in which the scale is increased as the guide point is approached, approach to the guide point can be intuitively ascertained by the driver without placing a burden on the driver caused by the switching of the display. Furthermore, when the guide point is approached, a change of the path can be confirmed from a mark on the map. By this feature, it is possible to effectively avoid an increase in a burden on the driver caused by the switching of the display, and the point for a right turn, a left turn, etc., can be surely and intuitively ascertained.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, as the guide line is displayed to be of a fixed width relative to the width of the road on the map, it is possible to make the moving route easily recognized.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, since the mark is a mark in which an arrow is placed at one end of a strip-shaped part, and the width of the strip-shaped part is displayed to be of the same width as the guide line, the path can be displayed while effectively avoiding a sudden change in the display. Also, after that, the display of the guide line may be stopped and only the mark may be displayed, whereby an increase in a burden on the driver can be further reduced, and a change of the path can be reliably ascertained.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, in a configuration in which an image is displayed by a virtual image in a space ahead of the driver such that the driver can visually recognize the scenery ahead, at least the road on the map is displayed at brightness visually recognizable by the driver until a distance to the guide point reaches the first display switching determination distance, and when the distance becomes less than or equal to the first display switching determination distance, the brightness of at least the road is reduced. By this feature, visibility of the scenery ahead can be increased, and the point for a right turn, a left turn, etc., can be ascertained more surely.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">[Other Embodiments]</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Specific configurations suitable for the implementation of the present invention have been described in detail above.
