poses health hazards.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the result of the Corona virus pandemic (Covid19), CDC issued a recommendation of social distancing, limiting social gatherings and use of facial masks. Social fear and businesses were highly affected. The use of facial masks, although an effective means of protection from the virus and alienated particles, such as dust and pollen prove taxing. Heat permeates from intake and out take breathing. Thus, becomes problematic during daily exercise, routines, and daily schedules.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">My proposed invention focuses on the nostrils or the nose region. Leaving the mouth clear to talk, eat, drink and or smoke, as examples.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By creating a healthier avenue for breathing and focusing on the nostrils where they bifurcate to the external openings. The nostrils either of the two external openings of the nasal cavity admits oxygen to the lungs and smells to the olfactory nerves will have a mask to help filter contaminants and/or alienate debris.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This proposed safety nose mask will have a ventilator outtake valve located below the openings of the nostrils. The ventilator will prevent the collection of outtake heat, thus creating a cooler and comfortable breathing experience. As it is known, breathing of ones own carbon dioxide is a slow poison and will show some problematic effect on ones health.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the following detailed portion of the present description.

The proposed PPE not only provides protection from alienated particles like dust debris, pollen, and/or exposure from foreign viruses. But, it also allows the user in having complete usage of the persons mouth. For example, with the proposed PPE, an individual could have dinner, attend sport events, have doctor or dental visits, and use in construction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following description shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the proposed PPE has facial adhesive wings depicted in illustration <b>101</b>.

Material based on breathing ventilator in market today, a rubberized thin material with flexibility. This will allow the passage of hot respiratory air to vent out, allowing comfortable breathing and eliminate the intake of carbon dioxide into the lungs and blood streams. Inhalation at low concentrations are not harmful. Higher concentrations can affect respiratory function and because excitation followed by depression of the central nervous system. A high concentration can displace oxygen in the air. &#x201c;Carbon dioxide poisoning&#x201d;.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
