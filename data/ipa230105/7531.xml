apparatuses to each other using a wireless signal transmission method, and WLAN technology may be based on the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard. The 802.11 standard has evolved into 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax standards, and may support a transmission rate of up to 1 Gbyte/s based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the 802.11ac standard, data may be simultaneously transmitted to multiple users through a multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) technique. The next evolution after 801.11ac is 802.11be and will be called extremely high throughput (EHT), and the next-generation protocol standard after EHT will be called EHT+. The EHT+ standard intends to implement 6 GHz unlicensed frequency band support, bandwidth utilization of up to 320 MHz per channel, introduction of hybrid automatic repeat and request (HARQ), and support for up to 16&#xd7;16 MIMO. Through these features of EHT+, the next-generation WLAN system is expected to effectively support low latency and high-speed transmission like new radio (NR), a 5G technology.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an aspect to provide an apparatus and method for efficient channel sounding in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of one or more example embodiments, there is provided a method comprising generating a first aggregated physical layer protocol data unit (PPDU) including a first null data packet (NDP) based on an extremely high throughput (EHT) protocol standard and a second NDP based on an EHT+ protocol standard, which is a next generation of the EHT protocol standard;
