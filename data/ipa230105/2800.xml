One aspect of spectrochemical analysis, known as spectroscopy, involves interaction of radiant energy with the material of interest. The particular methods used to study such matter-radiation interactions define many sub-fields of spectroscopy. One field in particular is known as absorption spectroscopy, in which the optical absorption spectra of liquid substances are measured. The absorption spectra is the distribution of light attenuation (due to absorbance) as a function of light wavelength. In a simple spectrophotometer the sample substance which is to be studied is placed in a transparent container, also known as a cuvette or sample cell. Electromagnetic radiation (light) of a known wavelength, &#x3bb;, (i.e. ultraviolet, infrared, visible, etc.) and intensity I is incident on one side of the cuvette. A detector, which measures the intensity of the exiting light, I, is placed on the opposite side of the cuvette. The length that the light propagates through the sample is the distance d. Most standard UV/visible spectrophotometers utilize standard cuvettes which have 1 cm path lengths and normally hold 50 to 2000 &#x3bc;L of sample. For a sample consisting of a single homogeneous substance with a concentration c, the light transmitted through the sample will follow a relationship know as Beer's Law: A=&#x3b5;cl where A is the absorbance (also known as the optical density (OD) of the sample at wavelength &#x3bb; where OD=the &#x2212;log of the ratio of transmitted light to the incident light), &#x3b5; is the absorptivity or extinction coefficient (normally at constant at a given wavelength), c is the concentration of the sample and &#x201c;l&#x201d; is the path length of light through the sample.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Spectroscopic measurements of samples are widely used in various fields. Often the species of interest in a sample is highly concentrated. For example, certain biological samples, such as proteins, DNA or RNA are often isolated in concentrations that fall outside the linear range of the spectrophotometer when absorbance is measured. Therefore, dilution of the sample is often required to measure an absorbance value that falls within the linear range of the instrument. Frequently multiple dilutions of the sample are required which leads to both dilution errors and the removal of the sample diluted for any downstream application. It is, therefore, desirable to take existing samples with no knowledge of the possible concentration and measure the absorption of these samples without dilution.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multiple sample cuvettes may solve the problem of repetitive sampling. However, this approach still requires the preparation of multiple sample cuvettes and removes some samples from further use. Furthermore, in most spectrophotometers the path length, &#x201c;l&#x201d;, is fixed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another approach to the dilution problem is to reduce the path length in making the absorbance measurement. By reducing the measurement path length, the sample volume can be reduced. Reduction of the path length also decreases the measured absorption proportionally to the path length decrease. For example, a reduction of path length from the standard 1 cm to a path length of 0.2 mm provides a virtual fifty-fold dilution. Therefore, the absorbance of more highly concentrated samples can be measured within the linear range of the instrument if the path length of the light travelling through the sample is decreased. There are several companies that manufacture cuvettes that while maintaining the 1 cm or 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>dimension of standard cuvettes decrease the path length through the sample by decreasing the interior volume. By decreasing the interior volume, less sample is required and a more concentrated sample can be measured within the linear range of most standard spectrophotometers. While these low volume cuvettes enable the measurement of more concentrated samples, the path length within these cuvettes is still fixed. Thus, if the sample concentration falls outside the linear range of the spectrophotometer the sample still may need to be diluted or another cuvette with an even smaller path length may be required before an accurate absorbance reading can be made.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing listing is intended to be exemplary rather than exhaustive, and those of skill in the art will appreciate that other aspects and embodiments not described above are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure, in its various aspects, provides methods, systems, and devices for determining the concentration of cell metabolites in cell culture fluid.

In another example, a concentration of glucose in cell culture fluid may reflect a growth condition of the cell culture fluid. Monitoring the concentration of a species of interest may thus be valuable for practitioners to monitor performance of a sample and/or to determine procedures necessary to maintain optimum conditions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, determination of a concentration of a species of interest at a discrete point in time may be difficult due to the presence of impurities and/or other molecules in the sample, which may contribute to background noise.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, standard spectrophotometric analysis requires an offline step, wherein a subsample of a sample is removed from a process and analyzed independently. However, removal of the sample for analysis presents risk of contamination, requires significant time and effort on the part of a practitioner, and is limited in its ability to generate real-time estimations of a concentration of a species during a process. If the sample is highly concentrated such that measured absorbance values fall outside the linear range of a spectrophotometric analysis, the sample may need to be diluted or a cuvette with a smaller path length found. Each of these steps may present further risks of contamination and delays to analysis.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Methods and systems described herein may allow for estimation of a concentration of a species of interest without sample dilution, without removal of impurities, and/or without interference to a process flow. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, methods and systems may pertain to offline and/or inline determination of species concentration with respect to a feed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, a flow-through variable path length spectrophotometer <b>1</b> may be used to estimate a concentration of a species of interest by measuring differences in absorbances between non-treated and treated samples <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A non-treated feed or sample <b>2</b> may comprise, in many embodiments, a cell culture fluid. A treatment may be, in various embodiments, installed in fluid communication with a feed and with a flow-through variable path length spectrophotometer <b>1</b>. The flow-through variable path length spectrophotometer <b>1</b> may be installed in fluid communication with prior and/or subsequent processing of a feed. Accordingly, absorbance measurements of the effect of the treatment may be an inline measurement, not requiring removal of a sample from a process flow. Alternatively, absorbance measurements may be performed offline.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In various embodiments, a treatment may comprise adding or depleting a species of interest from a sample, for example, via a filtration system or chromatography column. In some embodiments, a treatment may include an affinity column <b>6</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. An affinity column <b>6</b> may be configured to deplete a species of interest from a feed. Accordingly, the treated sample may comprise the filtrate. For example, a species of interest may be Protein A. In various examples, an affinity column <b>6</b> may be a Protein A affinity column configured to deplete Protein A from a feed. In many embodiments, an affinity column <b>6</b> may be configured to operate for at least 500 cycles, and/or until it loses 60% of its capacity. In some embodiments, an affinity column <b>6</b> may be configured to operate for at least 300-700 cycles, or any iterative number of cycles in between. In some embodiments, an affinity column <b>6</b> may be configured to operate until it loses 40-80% of its capacity, or any iterative percentage in between. In examples wherein a species of interest is LDH, a treatment may be an LDH affinity column, for example, comprising &#x3b5;-aminohexanoyl-NAD+.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, or additionally, a treatment may comprise a mixer <b>8</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which may be used, for example, to mix a feed of interest with one or more reagents, additional feeds, or additional species. At least one reagent, additional feed, or additional species may effect a change in the concentration of the species of interest. In many embodiments, at least one reagent, additional feed, or additional species may react with the species of interest so as to generate a product with a distinguishable absorbance within a linear range corresponding to standards of a spectrophotometer. For example, a reaction may result in a dye with a known absorbance, such as quinoneimine dye, which may be observable at 550 nm.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one non-limiting example embodiment, the variable pathlength spectrophotometer <b>1</b> and associated software of U.S. Pat. No. 9,046,485 to Salerno et al. (hereinafter &#x201c;Salerno '485&#x201d;), incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, may be used. For example, the flow-through system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and described in column 10, lines 39-65 of Salerno '485 may be used in conjunction with methods presently disclosed as flow cell spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It will be understood that one or more pumps (not shown) may be used to control flow in and/or out of any of the inlet or outlet of the feed lines described herein. For example, a flowrate, flux, pressure, viscosity, or the like of a fluid at a feed line may be adjusted by controlling one or more pumps by a frequency, speed, force, stroke length, pressure adjustment, or the like. It will be understood that flow through any of the feed lines described herein may be adjusted manually or automatically, for example, via a controller (not shown).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Spectrophotometer settings and/or standards, such as a wavelength and/or pathlength for a reading, may be determined prior to an absorbance reading of the contents of a flow cell. In many examples, standards may be determined according to slope spectroscopy standard determination methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,830,778 of Salerno et al. (hereinafter &#x201c;Salerno '778&#x201d;), incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. For example, absorbance readings may be recorded while moving a probe relative to a sample. Settings of wavelength and pathlength may be set for a feed of interest offline and/or prior to commencement of a treatment of the feed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternatively, or additionally, a wavelength may be determined based upon a known industry standard or characteristic of a desired reaction product. For example, a feed containing glucose may be analyzed at a wavelength of 505 nm based on (a) an ability of 4-(p-benzochinone-monoimino)-phenazone to be registered at a wavelength of 505 nm, and (b) on an intent to generate said 4-(p-benzochinone-monoimino)-phenazone using the glucose-containing sample using reagents comprising glucose oxidase, peroxidase, 4-aminophenazone, and phenol. In non-limiting examples, fluid feeds as described herein may be analyzed at 280 nm, 340 nm, 505 nm, or 550 nm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Based on determined standards for a feed corresponding to a species of interest, a wavelength and pathlength may be set for a flow cell spectrometer, or a flow-through variable pathlength spectrophotometer, fluidly connected to a feed line comprising a non-treated sample. Absorbance may be measured for the feed over time.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Subsequently, absorbance may be measured for a treated feed. In some embodiments, a non-treated feed may be redirected upstream of the spectrophotometer to a treatment, which may be either rejoined or separately joined in fluid communication with the flow cell of the spectrophotometer.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, in an offline mode as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a feed line containing a species of interest may split into a first path <b>2</b> without a filtration component and a second path <b>4</b> with a treatment. The split feed line may be configured to allow flow through only a single path at a time, for example, through alternative direction by one or more valves <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>or switches. The first and second paths <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> may each be coupled to a flow cell of a flow-through variable length spectrophotometer <b>1</b>. According to various embodiments described herein, a split feed line may first be configured to pass fluid flow of a sample through the first path, and absorbance readings may be taken thereof.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Subsequently, for example, upon an occurrence of a predicted behavior of the absorbance readings over time or at a predetermined time point, flow may be redirected from the first path <b>2</b> to the second path <b>4</b> comprising the treatment. In many embodiments, a treatment may comprise a chromatography column. For example, a predicted behavior of the absorbance readings may comprise a stabilization or plateau of the readings. The treatment may affect the concentration of a species of interest within the feed. For example, the filtration component may be an affinity column <b>6</b> configured to substantially remove the species of interest from the feed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The filtrate may pass through the flow cell of the flow-through variable length spectrophotometer <b>1</b>, and absorbance readings may be observed thereof. Based on a respective occurrence of a predicted behavior of the absorbance readings over time or at a respective predetermined time point, as described above, absorbance readings may be compared between the respective feed flows through the first and second paths <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>. In some embodiments, a fit line or predictive model may be applied to the absorbance readings of the feed through the first path, and an absorbance reading of the feed through the second path may be compared to a predicted point of the fit line or predictive model.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an exemplary inline mode as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first outlet comprising a feed of a species of interest and a second outlet <b>5</b> comprising at least one reagent may feed into a mixer or a mixing chamber <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b></figref> further comprise systems and methods with mixing chambers <b>8</b> as described herein. The first and second outlets may be independently operable and unidirectional, for example, to prevent backflow of a reagent through the first outlet. The mixing chamber <b>8</b> may facilitate interaction of the feed of the species of interest <b>2</b> with the at least one reagent <b>5</b>. In some embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>8</b> may comprise one or more mechanisms suitable for effecting and/or expediting a reaction between the feed of the species of interest <b>2</b> with the at least one reagent <b>5</b>. For example, the mixing chamber <b>8</b> may comprise, in various embodiments, a stirring mechanism.

Absorbance readings may be observed for the sample over time. Subsequently, for example, upon an occurrence of a predicted behavior of the absorbance readings over time or at a predetermined time point, flow of at least one reagent <b>5</b> may be begun through the second outlet into the mixing chamber <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The feed of the species of interest <b>2</b> and the at least one reagent <b>5</b> may be mixed in the mixing chamber <b>8</b>.

In other words, a first absorbance value corresponding to a non-treated feed may be compared to a second absorbance value corresponding to a treated feed. A third absorbance value corresponding to the difference between the first and second absorbance values may be used to determine the concentration of a species of interest in the non-treated feed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The measurement and comparison of multiple absorbance values between treated and non-treated feeds may reduce concern over the quantitative accuracy of single readings due to the presences of impurities, as each treated and non-treated feed may be expected to contain similar or the same impurities.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">After collection of measurements for determination of concentration of a species of interest in a feed, feeds may be redirected to an original process flow without interruption of the feeds. For example, in the exemplary offline model described above, feed may be switched from the second path with the filtration component to the first path without the filtration component. In the exemplary inline model described above, reagent flow through the second outlet may be stopped.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be understood that systems described herein may comprise one or more additional feeds or components coupled to the flow cell of a flow-through variable pathlength spectrophotometer or to an inlet thereof, which may, for example, be useful for washing or cleaning the flow cell or an inlet thereof. Accordingly, risk of contamination by a species of interest and resulting misleading absorbance readings may be decreased during readings for a feed in which the concentration of the species of interest has been depleted.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">While many examples described herein are described with respect to downstream processing steps, it will be readily understood that methods and/or systems may be implemented in upstream processes.
