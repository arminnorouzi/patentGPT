Oscillating toothbrushes have a handle that houses an electric motor, and a shaft extending from the handle that oscillates at relatively high frequencies at around 2,500 to 10,500 strokes per minute. A toothbrush attachment having a shaft and a movable head is connected to the electric toothbrush shaft, and a mechanism within the toothbrush attachment translates the oscillating motion of the toothbrush shaft into an oscillating rotating motion of the toothbrush attachment head, which is usually set at a right-angle to the shaft. Modern oscillating toothbrushes are designed to minimise vibration of the toothbrush attachment, such that the attachment shaft is relatively stationary compared with the toothbrush handle. The attachment head with the bristles oscillates at right angles relative to the attachment shaft and handle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another type of electric toothbrush is a vibrating electric toothbrush, which are often referred to as sonic toothbrushes. These sonic toothbrushes typically vibrate at a much higher frequency than the oscillations of oscillating toothbrushes at around 20,000 to 30,000 strokes per minute. Toothbrush attachments for sonic toothbrushes do not have a separate moving head, and the entire toothbrush attachment vibrates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various attachments are known for adapting electric toothbrushes for purposes other than cleaning teeth, such as sexual stimulation and/or massage. These attachments generally translate the motion of the toothbrush (either oscillation or vibration) into the same type of motion of the attachment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 10,028,883 discloses a sexual pleasure device that comprises a sleeve that is removably installable on a toothbrush having a source of vibration. A sleeve attachment may be relatively ineffective when used with an oscillating toothbrush.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, a relatively rigid head is positioned directly on the toothbrush shaft. The motion of the shaft (either oscillation or vibration) is translated directly to the rigid head to provide an oscillating or vibrating device (depending on the type of toothbrush). The movement of a rigid attachment may be too harsh for the attachment to be used directly on a user's skin, especially when used with an oscillating toothbrush.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 7,186,226 and US 2008/0221387 disclose massage attachments for electric toothbrushes with similar mechanisms to an oscillating toothbrush attachment. The attachments have oscillating heads with a textured or smooth surface instead of bristles. This type of attachment can only be used with an oscillating toothbrush, and the attachment does not vibrate significantly when used with a modern electric toothbrush. The attachment head oscillates through a narrow arc (similar to an oscillating toothbrush head), which may not be an optimal movement for providing sexual stimulation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this specification where reference has been made to patent specifications, other external documents, or other sources of information, this is generally for the purpose of providing a context for discussing the features of the invention.

When the head <b>226</b> oscillates, the rotatable connection <b>280</b> rotates relative to the sleeve <b>238</b> and the flexible region <b>230</b> flexes. The relative degrees of rotation and flex can be adjusted by changing the tolerance of the fit of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> on the sleeve <b>238</b>, and the material properties of the flexible portion. A relatively loose fit of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> on the sleeve <b>238</b> would provide a greater degree of rotation of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> relative to the sleeve <b>238</b> than a relatively tight fit of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> on the sleeve <b>238</b>. A relatively tight fit of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> on the sleeve <b>238</b> would provide a greater degree of flex of the flexible portion <b>230</b> than a relatively loose fit of the rotatable connection <b>280</b> on the sleeve <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, the rotatable connection <b>280</b> may not comprise a flexible region <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In an embodiment, the rotatable connection <b>280</b> is formed from a flexible material, such as an elastomeric material, that enables the rotatable connection <b>280</b> to be removed from the shaft. This enables the head <b>226</b> to be removed for cleaning, and enables a user to replace the head <b>226</b> with an alternative head design.
