According to various aspects of the device, an appliance includes an outer cabinet <b>14</b> having a front aperture <b>20</b> for accessing a processing space <b>22</b>. The processing space <b>22</b> is typically within a rotating drum <b>24</b>, through which a processing media moves fluidly therethrough. The processing media can be a liquid media, a gaseous media, or a combination thereof. The door <b>12</b> is attached to the outer cabinet <b>14</b> and selectively engages the front aperture <b>20</b> in a closed position <b>18</b> of the door <b>12</b> to enclose the processing space <b>22</b>. A hinge <b>26</b>, also referred to herein as the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b>, includes a cabinet mount <b>28</b> that is attached to the cabinet <b>14</b> and includes a stop <b>30</b> that defines the open position <b>16</b> of the door <b>12</b>. A hinge pin <b>32</b> extends through the cabinet mount <b>28</b> to define a rotational axis <b>34</b> of the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b>. A sheet metal flange <b>36</b> is press fit onto the hinge pin <b>32</b> and is fixedly attached to the door <b>12</b>. The sheet metal flange <b>36</b> is wrapped around the hinge pin <b>32</b>, typically via press fitting, and is attached to the door <b>12</b> via fasteners <b>38</b>. The hinge pin <b>32</b> includes a protrusion <b>40</b> that selectively engages the stop <b>30</b> of the cabinet mount <b>28</b> when the door <b>12</b> is in the open position <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the door <b>12</b> is in the closed position <b>18</b>, various locking mechanisms <b>50</b> can be used to secure the door <b>12</b> in the closed position <b>18</b> with respect to the cabinet <b>14</b> for enclosing the processing space <b>22</b>. This allows for the articles being processed and the processing media to be contained within the processing space <b>22</b>. One or more controllers <b>52</b> can be used for operating this locking mechanism <b>50</b> and allowing the door <b>12</b> to be moved from the closed position <b>18</b> to the open position <b>16</b>. In the open position <b>16</b>, the hinge pin <b>32</b>, which is attached to the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>, rotates about the rotational axis <b>34</b> relative to the cabinet mount <b>28</b>. As will be described more fully below, portions of the hinge pin <b>32</b> engage integral features incorporated within the cabinet mount <b>28</b> that form the stop <b>30</b> to define the open position <b>16</b> of the door <b>12</b> and prevent over rotation of the door <b>12</b> beyond the open position <b>16</b>. In addition, use of the integral stop <b>30</b> that is incorporated within the hinge pin <b>32</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b> minimizes eccentric rotational forces that are exerted on the hinge <b>26</b> when the door <b>12</b> is moved to the open position <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To assist in confining moment forces to the engagement between the hinge pin <b>32</b> and the integral stop <b>30</b> included within the cabinet mount <b>28</b>, the cabinet mount <b>28</b> includes a bushing <b>60</b> that is secured within a borehole <b>62</b> of the bracket portion <b>64</b> of the cabinet mount <b>28</b>. The hinge pin <b>32</b> extends through a central bore <b>66</b> of the bushing <b>60</b> and is rotationally operable within the bushing <b>60</b> between the open and closed positions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.

As discussed above, each bracket <b>90</b> of the bracket portion <b>64</b> typically includes a dedicated bushing <b>60</b> that is secured within the borehole <b>62</b> for each bracket <b>90</b> of the bracket portion <b>64</b>. After the bushing <b>60</b> is placed, the hinge pin <b>32</b> is inserted within the central bore <b>66</b> of the bushing <b>60</b> (step <b>504</b>). In inserting the hinge pin <b>32</b>, opposing ends <b>82</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b> extend outward from the bracket portion <b>64</b> and the bushing <b>60</b>. In addition, the hinge pin <b>32</b> includes a cam member <b>170</b> that is fixedly attached to the hinge pin <b>32</b> and rotates with the hinge pin <b>32</b>. After inserting the hinge pin <b>32</b>, an abutment portion <b>174</b> of the cam member <b>170</b> is located to selectively engage a stop <b>30</b> of the bracket portion <b>64</b> to define the open position <b>16</b> of the hinge <b>26</b> (step <b>506</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In locating the abutment portion <b>174</b> of the cam member <b>170</b>, the spacer portion <b>172</b> of the cam member <b>170</b> is positioned to one side of the bracket <b>90</b> and the end flange <b>68</b> of the bushing <b>60</b> is positioned at the opposing side of the bracket <b>90</b>. In this manner, the spacer portion <b>172</b> of the cam member <b>170</b> and the end flange <b>68</b> of the bushing <b>60</b> space apart the various components of the hinge <b>26</b> to prevent direct engagement of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> with the cabinet mount <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>22</b> and <b>24</b></figref>, according to the method <b>500</b>, a step <b>508</b> includes locating attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> on or proximate the opposing ends <b>82</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b>. In locating the attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>, the cam member <b>170</b> is located between the bracket portion <b>64</b> and one of the attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>. In this manner, the cam member <b>170</b> also serves as the washer <b>70</b> for the hinge assembly that separates the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> from the cabinet mount <b>28</b>. After the attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>, in the elongated state <b>188</b>, are located proximate the ends of the hinge pin <b>32</b>, the attachment members <b>80</b> are press fit onto the opposing ends <b>82</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b> to fixedly secure the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> to the hinge pin <b>32</b> and also fixedly secure the bushing <b>60</b> to the cabinet mount <b>28</b> (step <b>510</b>). As discussed herein, the press fit operation defines the secured state <b>192</b> of the attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">After the press fitting of the attachment members <b>80</b> onto the opposing ends <b>82</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b> is complete, the cabinet mount <b>28</b> of the hinge <b>26</b> is attached to the appliance cabinet <b>14</b> (step <b>512</b>). The sheet metal flange <b>36</b> is also attached to the door <b>12</b> (step <b>514</b>). Again, these attachments are typically accomplished through various fasteners <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to various aspects of the device, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>24</b></figref>, the press fitting operation that secures the attachment members <b>80</b> of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> to the opposing ends <b>82</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b> is accomplished through a mechanism that bends or wraps the attachment members <b>80</b> from the elongated state <b>188</b> that is characterized by a generally linear position to the press fit hinge position that secures the attachment members <b>80</b> to the hinge pin <b>32</b> in the secured state <b>192</b>. This press fit operation occurs after the hinge pin <b>32</b>, the bushing <b>60</b> and the cam member <b>170</b> or washer <b>70</b> are located relative to one another. The press fit operation serves to secure these portions of the device together to provide a robust rotational engagement that forms the hinge <b>26</b> for operating the door <b>12</b> between the open and closed position <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Typically, the door <b>12</b> will be used for a horizontal axis washing machine where the door <b>12</b> rotates about the rotational axis <b>34</b> that is either vertical or near vertical. Accordingly, when the door <b>12</b> is away from the closed position <b>18</b>, certain moment forces are exerted upon the hinge <b>26</b> as the door <b>12</b> hangs from the hinge <b>26</b> in the open position <b>16</b> or one of the intermediate positions that is away from the closed position <b>18</b>. The robust configuration of the hinge <b>26</b>, as described herein, accommodates these moment forces to prevent sagging or other downward deflection of the door <b>12</b> over time. In addition, when the door <b>12</b> is moved to the open position <b>16</b> and certain abuse loads are placed upon the door <b>12</b>, these abuse loads are placed directly upon the hinge pin <b>32</b> and the integral stop <b>30</b> that is formed between the hinge pin <b>32</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b>. Accordingly, these abuse forces are generally directed through more robust components of the hinge <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In forming the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>, the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> is typically stamped, cut or otherwise formed out of a sheet of sheet metal and then formed into the desired configuration through an additional stamping process or other similar forming processes that produce the various undulations and support flanges that are formed within the sheet metal flange <b>36</b>. Using this forming operation, the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> can be formed through the use of minimal materials as well as a minimal amount of time and resources.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to various aspects of the device, the configuration of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b> are similar in each configuration of the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b> described herein. The engagement between the hinge pin <b>32</b>, the bushing <b>60</b> and the washer <b>70</b> can vary between the various aspects of the device. In this manner, the integral stop <b>30</b> that is formed between the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b> can be defined by the configuration of the hinge pin <b>32</b>, the bushing <b>60</b> and the washer <b>70</b> that are used to separate the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b> from one another. In addition, the hinge pin <b>32</b>, the bushing <b>60</b> and the washer <b>70</b> also serve to align the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b> and the cabinet mount <b>28</b> with one another to provide for rotation of the door <b>12</b> around the rotational axis <b>34</b> of the hinge pin <b>32</b>. This configuration of the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b> provides robust engagement between the door <b>12</b> and the outer cabinet <b>14</b> that is able to significantly resist conventional loads as well as certain abuse loads that are placed on the door <b>12</b> over the life of the appliance. In addition, the use of the sheet metal flange <b>36</b> in combination with the integral stop <b>30</b>, provides for a more efficient use of time and resources in manufacturing the sheet metal hinge <b>10</b> and the appliance in general.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, an appliance includes an outer cabinet having a front aperture for accessing a processing space.
