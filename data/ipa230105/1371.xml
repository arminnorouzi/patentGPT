In some instances, mechanical properties are achieved through copolymerization, blending and additives.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some instances, polyolefins are produced by gas-phase polymerization. In some instances, the processes are fluidized-bed gas-phase processes, wherein the polymer is produced in a vertical cylindrical zone. In some instances, the reaction gases exiting the reactor are taken up by a compressor, cooled, and sent back with make-up monomers and hydrogen to the bottom of the bed through a distributor. In some instances, entrainment of solid to the gas is limited by dimensioning the upper part of the reactor, where the gas velocity is reduced. The flow rate of the circulating gas is set to assure a velocity within a range above the minimum fluidization velocity and below the &#x201c;transport velocity&#x201d;. In some instances, the heat of reaction is removed by cooling the circulating gas. In some instances, the catalyst components are continuously fed into the polymerization vessel. In some instances, the composition of the gas-phase controls the composition of the resulting polymer. However, and in some instances, fluidized-bed processes do not control adequately the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polymers nor the comonomer compositions of the resulting polymers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a general embodiment, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for carrying out a catalytic gas-phase olefin polymerization having<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">at least a first polymerization zone, adapted and arranged for growing polymer particles to flow upward under fast fluidization or transport conditions, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">at least a second polymerization zone, adapted and arranged for the growing polymer particles to flow downward; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">a gas/solid separation zone having a cylindrical shape;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">wherein</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">the second polymerization zone has an upper part being connected to the separation zone, a lower part being connected to the upper part, and a line for feeding a gas, a liquid, or a combination of both into</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0010">the second polymerization zone;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0011">the first polymerization zone being connected to the separation zone by a connecting part; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0012">the lower part of the second polymerization zone being connected to the lower part of the first polymerization zone by a connecting part;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0013">wherein the ratio of the diameter D01 of the separation zone to the diameter D03 of the upper part of the second polymerization zone is 1.02 to 1.5;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0014">wherein the ratio of the height H01 of the separation zone to the diameter D01 of the separation zone is 2.5 to 4.5; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0015">wherein the ratio of the diameter D03 of the upper part of the second polymerization zone to the diameter D04 of the lower part of the second polymerization zone is 1.2 to 2.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0016">In some embodiments, the ratio of the diameter D01 of the separation zone to the diameter D03 of the upper part (5) of the second polymerization zone is 1.02 to 1.5, alternatively 1.05 to 1.4, alternatively 1.08 to 1.3.

In some embodiments, selection of the ratio of the diameter D01 of the separation zone (<b>4</b>) to the diameter D03 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) provides an efficient gas/solid separation in the separation zone (<b>4</b>), thereby ensuring separation of the gas mixture in the first polymerization zone (<b>1</b>) from the gas within the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0049">In some embodiments, and independently from the polymerization capacity of the apparatuses, the height H05 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) is 5000 to 10000 mm, alternatively 6000 to 8000 mm, alternatively 6800 to 7200 mm. In some embodiments, the height of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) provides enough powder residence time for a gas separation and enough room for level control and variation at the same time without affecting the efficiency of the gas/solid separation zone (<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0050">In some embodiments, selection of the height of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) and the diameter D03 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) minimize the risk of an overflow of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) and of harm to the separation efficacy of the separation zone (<b>4</b>). In some embodiments, the ratio H05/D03 of the height H05 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) and the diameter D03 of said upper part (<b>5</b>) is 2 to 4, alternatively 2 to 3.8, alternatively 2 to 3.6.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0051">In some embodiments, the ratio D03/D04 of the diameter D03 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) and the diameter D04 of the lower part (<b>6</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) is 1.2 to 2, alternatively 1.3 to 1.8, alternatively 1.4 to 1.7. In some embodiments, a much lower velocity of the solid in the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) is maintained than in the lower part (<b>6</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>), thereby avoiding fluidization which would prevent the barrier from being effective.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0052">In some embodiments, the separation zone (<b>4</b>) has a cylindrical shape, that is, the diameter D01 of the separation zone (<b>4</b>) is constant over the entire height H01 of the separation zone (<b>4</b>).

As used herein, the term &#x201c;constant diameter&#x201d; refers to a diameter, which deviates from a given value by less than 5%, alternatively less than 2%, alternatively less than 0.5%, alternatively less than 0.1%.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0053">In some embodiments, the separation zone (<b>4</b>) and the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) are connected by a first connecting part (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) having a height H02 wherein the diameter of the connecting part (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) constantly decreases from the diameter D01 of the separation zone (<b>4</b>) to the diameter D03 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>). In some embodiments, the diameter of the connecting part (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) constantly decreases over the total height H02 of the connecting part (<b>7</b><i>a</i>). In some embodiments, the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) and the lower part (<b>6</b>) of the second polymerization zone are by a second connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>) having a height H06 wherein the diameter of the connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>) constantly decreases from the diameter D03 of the upper part (<b>5</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) to the diameter D04 of the lower part (<b>6</b>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>). In some embodiments, the diameter of the connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>) constantly decreases over the total height H06 of the second connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0054">In view of the decrease in diameter, the first connecting part (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) and the second connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>) of the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) each has a conical and/or tronco-conical shape and an associated angle A01 and A02, respectively.

In some embodiments, the angle A02 of the second (tronco-)conically shaped connecting part (<b>7</b><i>b</i>) is 5 to 25&#xb0;, alternatively 8 to 20&#xb0;, alternatively 10 to 15&#xb0;. It is believed that a smooth downward flow of the polymer through the second polymerization zone (<b>2</b>) is ensured when the angles A01 and A02 are kept within the set limits, and stagnation of the polymer powder is reduced.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0055">Within the MICR technology, the separation of the multiple reaction zones is achieved when a barrier gas, a barrier liquid, or a combination thereof prevents the gas mixture of one reaction zone from entering another reaction zone.
