While moving or rotating the 3D model displayed on the screen, the operator is to correctly determine and select faces, edges, or vertices as elements to be associated with the dimension. Thus, creating the dimension in a manner correctly associated with the elements of the 3D model takes more time and effort than creating the dimension in a two-dimensional (2D) drawing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In response to the above issue, an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a dimension creation device and others that can efficiently create a dimension correctly associated with elements of a 3D model.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the above objective, a dimension creation device according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes element selection means for selecting a first target element and a second target element from elements of a three-dimensional model, direction indication means for indicating a direction of a dimension to be created, and dimension creation means for creating, when the element selection means selects a vertex or an edge as each of the first target element and the second target element and the three-dimensional model includes (i) a first orthogonal face including the first target element and orthogonal to the direction indicated by the direction indication means and (ii) a second orthogonal face including the second target element and orthogonal to the direction indicated by the direction indication means, the dimension between the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face in the direction indicated by the direction indication means in a manner associated with the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The structure according to the above aspect of the present disclosure selects a first target element and a second target element from elements of a 3D model, indicates a direction of a dimension to be created, and creates, when a vertex or an edge is selected as each of the first target element and the second target element and the 3D model includes a first orthogonal face including the first target element and orthogonal to the indicated direction and a second orthogonal face including the second target element and orthogonal to the indicated direction, the dimension between the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face in the indicated direction in a manner associated with the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face.

The dimension creation device <b>10</b> is a three-dimensional (3D) CAD device and is also an information processing device that assists in designing an object having a solid shape using a computer. Examples of an object to be designed include a product in the manufacturing process and an element of the product.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The dimension creation device <b>10</b> assists in creating a dimension between two elements included in elements of a 3D model. The 3D model herein refers to a model representing a solid shape of an object to be designed. The elements of the 3D model indicate faces, edges, and vertices forming a solid shape of a 3D model. The dimension between two elements indicates the distance, or more specifically, the length between two elements.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a 3D model M<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the shape of the 3D model M<b>1</b> in a two-dimensional (2D) plane when viewed in three directions including the X-direction, the Y-direction, and the Z-direction.

More specifically, when viewed in the X-direction, the 3D model M<b>1</b> is rectangular. When viewed in the Y-direction, the 3D model M<b>1</b> is trapezoidal, with the face S<b>2</b> being a slope.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The dimension creation device <b>10</b> creates dimensional information indicating the dimension between two elements selected by an operator from multiple faces, multiple edges, and multiple vertices included in the 3D model M<b>1</b>, and annotates the 3D model M<b>1</b> with the created dimensional information.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The dimensional information created for the 3D model M<b>1</b> by the dimension creation device <b>10</b> is read with software including computer aided manufacturing (CAM) or computer aided testing (CAT), and used for automatically creating a processing program or a measurement program. For example, a computer numeric control (CNC) 3D measuring device can automatically create a measurement program. More specifically, the measuring device can specify, from the dimensions provided to the 3D model M<b>1</b>, two faces associated with the dimensions, and automatically generate an operation path of the measuring device that performs 3D measurement of the faces.

When the 3D model M<b>1</b> is determined to include both the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face, the dimension creator <b>140</b> creates the dimension between the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face in the direction indicated by the direction indicator <b>130</b> in a manner associated with the first orthogonal face and the second orthogonal face.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the dimension is indicated in a drawing, the target elements indicated by the dimension are normally expected to be faces, edges, or vertices with a higher likelihood in the stated order. Thus, the dimension is associated with faces irrespective of vertices or edges selected as the target elements.

The distance between the edges R<b>1</b> and R<b>3</b> and the distance between the edges R<b>5</b> and R<b>7</b> are the same as the distance between the faces S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b>, and thus can be uniquely determined when the distance between the faces S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> is determined.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an inspection process, the distance between the faces S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> is measured in accordance with the above expectation.

When elements to be associated with the indicated dimension is unchanged from the edges R<b>1</b> and R<b>3</b> selected as the target elements without the faces S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> being associated with the dimension, the intended faces S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> are not measured in a measurement program created with the dimensional information read by software with CAT.
