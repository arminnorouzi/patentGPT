More specifically, this disclosure is directed to self-adaptive scheduled lighting control devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Until recently, the brightness of electric lights was only controlled by electromechanical means. Specifically, a potentiometer, rheostat, or a special three-position luminaire was used to reduce the power consumption of the light bulb. However, these technologies were designed for, and only worked well with, traditional incandescent bulbs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent developments in lighting technology produced many new lighting products incorporating solid-state technology within the bulb. Compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs used miniaturized switching power supplies and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are themselves solid-state electronic devices. Early CFL and LED bulbs were not designed to accommodate the variable voltage supplied by conventional dimmers, and did not work well. Newer CFL and LED bulbs are designed to accommodate conventional dimmers, but the user must still walk across the room and adjust the lights manually.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Simultaneously, developments in expensive wireless technology have produced so-called &#x201c;smart&#x201d; LED bulbs, which use integral wireless communications to control the output of the LEDs in the bulb by communicating with a wireless computing device, such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. These smart bulbs allow the user to remotely change the brightness and/or color of their smart LED bulbs, but the technology cannot be used with conventional bulbs. The technology still requires manual intervention by the user when a change is desired, rather than anticipating the user's desire and changing the lighting independently. Accordingly, a need exists for a new self-adaptive scheduled lighting control aimed at overcoming the limitations associated with the prior art solutions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lighting control device is disclosed. The lighting control device includes a microcontroller, at least one wireless transceiver operatively connected to the microcontroller, at least one dimmer operatively connected to the microcontroller, at least one powered lighting output operatively connected to the at least one dimmer, at least one environmental sensor operatively connected to the microcontroller, and at least one input device operatively connected to the microcontroller. The microcontroller is configured to obtain environmental data from the at least one environmental sensor, obtain input data from the at least one input device, transmit the environmental data and the input data to an external server, obtain from the external server a lighting operating schedule based on the environmental data and the input data, execute the lighting operating schedule by controlling one or more smart bulbs via the at least one wireless transceiver and/or controlling the current output to the at least one powered lighting output via the at least one dimmer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A system is also disclosed for controlling lighting devices. The system includes a lighting control device, an external server, a computing device, and one or more lights. The lighting control device is configured to obtain environmental data from at least one environmental sensor, obtain input data from at least one input device, transmit the environmental data and the input data to the external server, obtain a lighting operating schedule from the external server based on the environmental data and the input data, and execute the lighting operating schedule from the external server. The computing device is configured to obtain user input and transmit the user input to the lighting control device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A computer-implemented method is also disclosed for controlling illuminating devices. The method includes the steps of: obtaining environmental data from at least one environmental sensor, obtaining input data from at least one input device, transmitting the environmental data and the input data to an external server, obtaining a lighting operating schedule from the external server based on the environmental data and the input data from the external server, executing the lighting schedule by controlling one or more smart bulbs via the at least one wireless transceiver and/or controlling the current output to the at least one powered lighting output via at least one dimmer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A computer-implemented method is also disclosed for generating a new lighting operating schedule. The method includes the steps of: obtaining environmental data and input data from one or more lighting control devices, weighting the obtained environmental data and input data, and generating a new lighting operating schedule based on a preexisting lighting operating schedule and the environmental data and the input data. The new lighting operating schedule defines the lighting intensity and/or the lighting color for one or more lights as a function of time. The new lighting operating schedule includes a modified version of the preexisting lighting operating schedule which incorporates the weighted environmental data and input data.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary computing system in accordance with one example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary lighting control device, in accordance one example of with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary lighting control system illustrating components involved in the system's data management, in accordance with one example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary logic module for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrating its functional elements, in accordance one example of with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary logic for a lighting control device software or firmware, in accordance with one example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary process flow for generating lighting control schedules in a lighting system, in accordance with one example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary logic for temporarily interrupting the scheduled operation of a lighting control device software or firmware, in accordance with one example of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">To facilitate an understanding of the principals and features of the disclosed technology, illustrative embodiments are explained below.

At <b>508</b>, the device obtains current settings for user input data, from both the analog controls on the lighting control device and any digital smart-bulb settings.

Such a distant bulb may thus be adjusted from maximum to minimum brightness in response to minor changes in the user's preferred ambient light levels. For example, if the sensor indicates that the room should be brighter, it may increase the distant bulb's brightness by 10%. However, the overall brightness in the room detected by the sensor would be essentially unchanged, so the sensor may again increase the distant bulb's brightness by 10%. Again, the detected brightness in the room remains essentially unchanged. This effect creates an undesirable underdamped feedback loop. The underdamped feedback loop results in distant bulbs always being at either maximum or minimum brightness. The feedback loop can be corrected by calibrating the effect of each bulb on the overall brightness detected by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the device implements a calibration routine during initial setup. This calibration routine brightens and dims each connected bulb and determines its overall effect on the sensor. It then assigns an influence value for the bulb relative to the other bulbs. Thus, a distant bulb which does not directly &#x201c;see&#x201d; the sensor would have a low influence value and a nearby bulb directly in front of the sensor would have a high influence value. The device determines the degree to which each bulb should be adjusted based on these influence values.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the user determines a maximum difference for each bulb between the user's preferred settings and the actual output of the bulb. In another embodiment, the system adjusts each bulb in sequence, one at a time, and then uses the sensor feedback to determine whether or not the cumulative adjustment of all the controlled bulbs has attained the desired effect, then makes further adjustment based on the results.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary process flow <b>600</b> for generating lighting control schedules in a lighting control system.

At <b>604</b> the server sorts all of the monitoring data received from a plurality of lighting control devices into records received from each individual lighting control device.

The analysis compares new records to previously received data from the lighting control device and to previously transmitted lighting schedules. At <b>608</b> the server generates a new lighting schedule for each lighting control device for which new monitoring data is available. The new lighting schedules are based on previously transmitted lighting schedules, previously received monitoring data from the lighting control device, and the newly received monitoring data from the lighting control device. The newly received monitoring data is weighted relative to the previously received monitoring data and the transmitted lighting schedule is modified to more closely reflect the weighted data. At <b>610</b> the newly generated lighting schedule is stored in a database. At <b>612</b> the server obtains requests for new future lighting schedules.

In some embodiments, this step may not be required. It may be required if, for example, the user changed brightness settings using an application on a wireless device. The device may immediately interrupt scheduled operation <b>706</b> while the brightness is fine-tuned to implement the user change <b>708</b>.
