application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 21315089.9 filed on May 26, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">The present invention relates to radically polymerizable compositions with a cumene hydroperoxide redox initiator system which contains oligomeric cumene hydroperoxide derivatives. The compositions are particularly suitable as dental materials, for example as prosthesis materials, cements, adhesives and composites for direct fillings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0003">The main areas of use of polymers in the dental field are removable prosthetics (e.g., teeth and prosthesis base materials) and fixed prosthetics (e.g., veneering materials, crowns or cements), filling materials (e.g., direct or indirect filling composites, luting cements or adhesives) and auxiliary materials (e.g., impression materials). The polymers are usually obtained by radical polymerization of suitable compositions which contain a polymerizable organic matrix, usually a mixture of monomers, initiator components and stabilizers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Methyl methacrylate (MMA) (prosthesis materials), mixtures of functionalized monomers, such as e.g., 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), or acid-group-containing adhesive monomers, such as e.g., 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), with dimethacrylates (adhesives) or mixtures which contain exclusively dimethacrylates (composite cements and filling composites) are usually used as monomers. Dimethacrylates often used are 2,2-bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropyl)phenyl]propane (bis-GMA) and 1,6-bis-[2-methacryloyloxyethoxycarbonylamino]-2,2,4-trimethylhexane (UDMA), which have a high viscosity and result in polymerizates with very good mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Above all, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), 1,10-decanediol dimethacrylate (D<sub>3</sub>MA) or bis(3-methacryloyloxymethyl)tricyclo-[5.2.1.02.6]decane (DCP) are used as reactive diluents.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Methacrylate-based dental materials are cured by radical polymerization, wherein radical photoinitiators (light curing, direct filling composites and adhesives), thermal initiators (indirect composites or prosthesis materials) or redox initiator systems (composite cements) are used depending on the area of use. Moreover, the combination of photoinitiators with redox initiators, e.g., in the case of fillings of deep cavities, is known.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Redox systems are used above all when there is the risk of incomplete curing, e.g., because of a low monomer reactivity in the case of prosthesis materials or because of insufficient irradiation in the case of luting cements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">In order to guarantee a sufficient storage stability of the materials, materials based on redox initiators are usually used as so-called two-component systems (2C systems), wherein the oxidant (peroxide or hydroperoxide) and the reducing agent (amines, sulfinic acids, barbiturates, thiourea etc.) are incorporated into two separate components of the material. These components are mixed with each other shortly before use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">For a long time, redox initiator systems which are based on a mixture of dibenzoyl peroxide (DBPO) with tertiary aromatic amines, such as e.g., N,N-diethanol-p-toluidine (DEPT), N,N-dimethyl-sym.-xylidine (DMSX) or N,N-diethyl-3,5-di-tert.-butylaniline (DABA), have primarily been used for dental composite cements. Due to the limited thermal stability of DBPO, materials based on it must be stored in a refrigerator. A further disadvantage of such DBPO/amine systems is the discolorations which are caused by a slow oxidation of the amines. Moreover, the radical formation in the case of DBPO/amine-based redox initiator systems is impaired by acids and thus also by acidic monomers, which are normally used for the preparation of enamel-dentine adhesives. The amine component is protonated by an acid-base reaction and thereby deactivated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">The above disadvantages can be partially overcome with hydroperoxide redox initiator systems, because no tertiary amines are needed as reducing agent.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Moreover, hydroperoxides are more thermally stable than peroxides. Cumene hydroperoxide has, for example, a 10-hour half-life temperature T<sub>1/2 </sub>of 158&#xb0; C.; the 10-hour half-life temperature T<sub>1/2 </sub>of DBPO is only 73&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">DE 26 35 595 C2 and corresponding U.S. Pat.

curing composite cements consisting in each case of a cat. paste (A to C) and the base paste A were prepared. The flexural strength and the flexural modulus of elasticity were determined according to the EN ISO-4049 standard (2019, Dentistry&#x2014;Polymer-based filling, restorative and luting materials). The mechanical properties were measured after 24 h storage of the test pieces in water (WS) at 37&#xb0; C. (Table 3). The processing time (PT) of the resin pastes was determined by means of a Motion Compact Rheometer (MCR 302 Anton Paar). In the process, the base and cat. pastes were blended in each case by hand on a mixing block in a 1:1 ratio. The material was then applied to a die consisting of Delrin with a roughened surface on the MCR rheometer. A measuring bob shaft secured on a spindle with a likewise roughened surface compresses the sample and with slight rotation determines the storage modulus. At the beginning of the stable phase and after achieving a particular gradient, an inflection point was defined in each case. The inflection points were then connected by a straight line. From this straight line, the measurement point furthest away was defined as PT. The whole measurement was carried out at 28.7&#xb0; C. in a temperature-controlled chamber.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Flexural strength (FS, MPa), flexural modulus of elasticity (FM,</entry></row><row><entry>MPa) and processing time (PT, s) of the cements made from cat.</entry></row><row><entry>pastes A-C and base paste A</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>FS 24 h 37&#xb0; C.
