description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate to a device that evaluates a damage quantity of equipment due to the operation of, for example, a power generator, and a method thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that in turbines, casings, control valves, and so on which are the main components of thermal power plants, damages or deteriorations occur and accumulate in places thereof in accordance with the operation and thus increase the failure risk of the components over time. Therefore, to soundly and economically operate these thermal power plants, it is necessary to quantitatively grasp the damages that occur and accumulate in the places of the components in accordance with the operation and execute maintenance such as repairing and part changes at appropriate times.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of the damage include crack initiation and its growth in a member used under a high-temperature environment. It is known that creep and metal fatigue are causes of the crack initiation and growth. Creep is a phenomenon in which a metal material used under an environment whose temperature is about half its melting point undergoes gradual permanent deformation with time even under low stress equal to or less than the yield stress of the metal material and finally cracks, resulting in the rupture of the metal. Fatigue is a phenomenon in which crack is initiated and grown by repeated stress even if the stress is not large enough to cause rupture under a static load, leading to failure. This repeated stress is generated not only by external force but also by thermal stress. For example, in thermal power plant equipment, stress generation is unavoidable during use under a high-temperature environment, during operation, and at the activation and stop times, and damages due to these stresses accumulate in places of the equipment in accordance with the operation. To avoid such damages of the equipment due to creep or fatigue, the thermal power plant equipment requires appropriate maintenance and management.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in a steam turbine, components for which the maintenance and management against damages due to crack initiation and growth is especially important are a turbine shaft (hereinafter referred to simply as a rotor) and a turbine casing. The rotor is a rotary shaft that transmits, to a power generator, rotational force that rotor blades receive from a steam flow, and the turbine casing is a cover surrounding the rotor. The steam flow passes between the turbine casing and the rotor, and the rotor blades provided on the outer periphery of the rotor generate the rotational force from the steam flow. A plurality of stages of the rotor blades are arranged on the outer periphery of the rotor, and when the rotor blades receive the steam flow, the rotational force is generated in the rotor. Meanwhile, the steam having a high temperature when flowing in consumes energy as it passes through the stages of the rotor blades, and thus the temperature of the steam decreases as it goes more downstream. Consequently, not only the rotor and the turbine casing which come in contact with this steam are used in a high-temperature environment but also temperature distribution is generated in the same member.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rotor and the turbine casing receive thermal stress when changed in temperature by heating and cooling at, for example, the activation and stop times and at the time of load variation. In addition, during operation, centrifugal force due to the high-speed rotation of the rotor constantly generates stress. Such thermal stress causes the accumulation of fatigue damages, and the centrifugal force under the high-temperature environment causes the accumulation of creep damages.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Not only the temperature change and the stress but also the material properties of an evaluation-target member influence the progress of the damage. It is known that the material properties are also deteriorated by a high-temperature environment and load stress. Therefore, as the material deteriorates, it is also necessary to appropriately correct the material properties used for the evaluation of creep damage and fatigue damage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hardness decrease and embrittlement are examples of the material deterioration. It is known that material strength and hardness are correlated in most cases, and as hardness decreases, strength properties such as creep and fatigue properties also decrease. In turbine equipment, since it is difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of strength property evaluation samples having a sufficiently large size from the equipment in operation, changes in such strength properties are often estimated from the measurement results of hardness which is relatively easily measured. Further, the embrittlement of a material influences a crack propagation rate, and thus unless the embrittlement is appropriately evaluated, it is difficult to evaluate crack growth that occurs during operation. That is, the appropriate damage management of the turbine equipment requires the evaluation of the temperature, generated stress, and a material deterioration quantity of each member during the operation of the plant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the execution of conventional material deterioration evaluation, the steam turbine is opened when the plant is in non-operation. Material deterioration is evaluated based on hardness measurement or embrittlement evaluation of an evaluation-target site, and the temperature and stress of each part during operation and at the activation and stop times are evaluated based on finite element analysis and design conditions, and from operation data, how many times and how long the evaluation-target site has been exposed to these temperature and stress are evaluated, whereby fatigue damage and creep damage of each site are evaluated. Since this material deterioration progresses as the plant operates, periodic measurement is required for the appropriate evaluation of a material deterioration quantity. However, stopping the power plant and opening the steam turbine take a lot of trouble and time to increase power generation costs. This makes it difficult to execute the evaluation a sufficient number of times because of cost restriction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in conventional thermal power generation, base-load operation is the mainstream and the operation is often at about rated power at which plant efficiency is the highest. In such an operation case, temperature and stress generated in parts of a rotor and a turbine casing (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;an operating state quantity&#x201d;) are very clear because they are precisely evaluated and optimized when the turbine is designed, and the operating states do not readily vary because turbine power varies only a little during operation. This makes it relatively easy to calculate the temperature and load stress of an evaluation-target site based on design data and operation history to evaluate creep damage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the recent widespread use of renewable energy has led to increasing opportunities when a thermal power station operates at part load and also to an increasing number of times it is activated and stopped. The increase in the part-load operation leads to an increase in off-design point operation, and as a result, the turbine equipment is exposed for long hours to temperature and load stress that are not expected when it is designed. Because of this, the evaluation of creep damage based on design data and operation history on the premise that the operation is often at about rated power is considered very low in accuracy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the evaluation of thermal stress caused by a temperature change at the time of load variation or at the activation and stop times also requires accuracy. The magnitude of thermal stress correlates with a variation of the temperature of turbine equipment and temperature distribution in the turbine equipment including peripheral components. As for the temperature change when the turbine stops, the temperature of each place decreases from a steady state owing to natural cooling. Since the cooling rate differs depending on each place, the temperature does not uniformly decrease, but a temperature difference among the peripheral turbine components and a temperature difference in the same member constantly change, leading to the generation of thermal stress. Further, it takes several days for the turbine equipment including a rotor and a casing to be cooled to room temperature. If the plant is activated again before they are cooled to room temperature, temperature distribution at the activation time and a temperature variation up to the time when the temperature returns to the steady state are not uniform, either. That is, the thermal stress repeatedly generated when the plant is activated and stopped differs depending on the activation and stop conditions. Similarly, in part-load operation as well, thermal stress differs depending on a load variation condition. As compared with the conventional operation as a base-load power supply, in the recent operation in which the plant is often activated and stopped and is often operated at part load, these conditions are diversified and are difficult to expect. That is, fatigue damage evaluation simply based on the number of activation and stop times is considered low in accuracy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For the evaluation of damage due to crack initiation or crack growth in turbine equipment, it is necessary to appropriately evaluate time-dependent material deterioration, creep damage, and fatigue damage. The progress of the material deterioration such as hardness decrease and embrittlement is caused by temperature and load stress. That is, the material deterioration progresses as the plant operates, and thus for appropriate damage evaluation, the periodic evaluation of material properties is necessary. However, for the direct measurement of an evaluation-target site, the turbine has to be opened, which involves time and cost problems. Further, in recent years, it is expected that part-load operation and the number of activation and stop times of a thermal power plant will increase. Consequently, the turbine equipment is exposed for long hours to temperature and pressure not expected when it is designed, and it is worried that creep damage evaluation on the premise that the plant operates at about rated power is low in accuracy. Further, as for fatigue damage due to thermal stress, thermal stress generated in recent diversified operation patterns is difficult to predict, and fatigue damage evaluation simply based on the number of activation and stop times and the number of times load varies is poor in reliability.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a damage evaluation device according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating an example of the installation positions of sensors according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of an operation data obtaining unit according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a material deterioration evaluation unit according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a risk evaluation unit according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an explanatory chart of creep damage evaluation according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an explanatory chart of fatigue damage evaluation according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an explanatory chart of crack growth evaluation according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an explanatory chart of crack growth evaluation according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an explanatory chart of failure risk evaluation according to the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described above, conventional damage evaluation devices and damage evaluation methods have problems of the increase in trouble and cost due to the opening of a turbine, and difficulty in achieving highly accurate and reliable evaluation.

The installation positions of the sensors differ depending on design conditions and are not limited to the wake flow of the rotor blades of the first stage and may be other positions.

To calculate these values, steam pressures are also necessary as parameters. In this case, pressure sensors are provided as the sensors <b>10</b>, values of these parameters are calculated based on measurement values of the pressure sensors, and the calculated values are combined with the measurement values of the temperature sensors.

In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the characteristic lines representing the crack propagation rate are corrected from M<b>1</b> to M<b>2</b> and from M<b>3</b> to M<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0066">A crack growth quantity per unit time is calculated from this crack propagation rate and accumulated, whereby a crack length is calculated. A damage quantity is calculated from a ratio of this crack length to the limit crack length determined by the material deterioration quantity such as an embrittlement quantity, the material data, and the operating state quantity or to the limit crack length decided in advance in design data.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0067">The obtained damage quantity is not only output but also can be saved in the operation data storage unit <b>40</b>. As the damage quantity, a creep damage quantity and a fatigue damage quantity may be separately evaluated or the combination of these may be evaluated.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0068">The risk evaluation unit <b>70</b> evaluates failure risk using the calculated damage quantity at the current time and other state quantities (S<b>76</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example of the evaluation of the failure risk in this embodiment. In this embodiment, the level of the failure risk is set in advance based on the damage quantity and the total operating time. The thresholds (A, B, a, b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> are constants decided in advance according to a design condition, a material used, and so on of each evaluation-target member. In this example, a rotor or a casing is taken as an example, and its damage quantity is calculated from an expected damage form, but a prediction error occurs in the damage quantity because of variation in material deterioration and material strength. Since this error increases in proportion to an increase in the operating time, the use of two parameters of the damage quantity and the total operating time for the evaluation of the failure risk enables appropriate risk evaluation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0069">For example, if the total operating time is &#x201c;a&#x201d; hours or more and the damage quantity is A% or more, the failure risk is determined as high. On the other hand, if the total operating time is &#x201c;b&#x201d; hours or less and the damage quantity is B% or less, the failure risk is determined as low.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0070">In this evaluation, the method to evaluate the risk from a matrix of the two parameters is described, but the method is not limited to this. For example, operating rate, average operating temperature, the number of activation and stop times, and so on may be used as parameters, and as the damage quantity, a creep damage quantity and a fatigue damage quantity may be used separately for the evaluation. It is also possible to calculate a failure probability using a probability theory method instead of uniquely deciding the risk using the matrix of the parameters. In this example, the failure risk is calculated using the damage quantity that is estimated in real time based on the operation data, but if a parameter that makes the calculated damage quantity indefinite is used together for the evaluation of the failure risk, the risk can be appropriately evaluated.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0071">(Recommended Maintenance Time Presentation Unit <b>80</b>)</p><p id="p-0091" num="0072">Using data such as the cumulative damage and the result of the damage quantity and failure risk evaluation generated by the risk evaluation unit <b>70</b>, the recommended maintenance time presentation unit <b>80</b> predicts a future damage quantity based on operation plan data that a user separately inputs through the input unit <b>35</b>, and proposes a recommended maintenance time. The recommended maintenance time presentation unit <b>80</b> has a device for displaying such as a display device and is capable of presenting the contents of the proposal to the user. Here, the operation plan is information indicating, for example, an operating rate, average power, and the frequency of activations and stops of the facility, and is stored in advance in the operation data storage unit <b>40</b>. Based on a data set of the operation data and historical data which are linked to the obtained damage quantity and material deterioration data, the recommended maintenance time presentation unit <b>80</b> calculates a material deterioration quantity and a cumulative damage quantity that are expected in the given operation plan.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0073">An example using the cumulative operating time will be described as a calculation example. Any time unit is set in advance from the relation between the historical data and the material deterioration quantity, and the relation of the material deterioration quantity and the operating time in this time unit is obtained, whereby it is possible to predict the trend of the material deterioration quantity from the operating time that the user separately inputs. Similarly, from the historical data, a change in the state quantity such as temperature and load stress in the unit time is predicted. From these material deterioration quantity and state quantity, a creep damage quantity is predicted. Similarly, as for fatigue damage, the magnitude of generated load stress and the number of times it is generated per unit operating time are estimated and this estimation is combined with the material deterioration prediction, whereby it is possible to predict the fatigue damage quantity. In this example, the cumulative operating time is used as a parameter, but plant power, an operating rate, or an evaluation formula is also usable, for instance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0074">A future failure risk is evaluated again using the damage quantity thus predicted, and from the result, the recommended maintenance time is presented. The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is used for the failure risk evaluation, and the recommended maintenance time is proposed based on the evaluation result.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0075">As described above, the damage evaluation device of the embodiment successively calculates the operating state quantity at a given evaluation-target site of the rotor, the casing, or the like from the data obtained during the operation of the turbine equipment, estimates the material deterioration quantity at the current time from the operating state quantity and the historical data, and based on these, evaluates the cumulative damage due to the crack initiation or growth, evaluates the failure risk, and goes so far as to recommend the maintenance time based on the future operation plan. That is, successively calculating the material deterioration quantity based on the obtained data can reduce the opportunities when the deterioration quantity is measured while the turbine is opened. Further, the creep damage quantity and the fatigue damage quantity are calculated in the unit time in which the successively calculated state quantity such as temperature and stress can be regarded as constant, and are accumulated, which makes it possible to appropriately evaluate the damage quantity even in a part-load operation involving the change in the state quantity.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0076">Owing to these characteristics, even in the case where, for example, a load-varying operation and the number of activation and stop times increase, it can be expected that highly reliable maintenance and management are achieved because damage is successively predicted based on the latest operating state. Further, it is possible to predict the material deterioration quantity and the damage quantity without executing a large-scale inspection by opening the turbine, and cost reduction can be expected. It should be noted that, though the application example to the thermal power plant including the steam turbine and the boiler is described in this example, this configuration is not restrictive.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0077">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
