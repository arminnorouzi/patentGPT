More specifically, the invention relates to lithium ion batteries with thin anodes.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lithium batteries can charge and discharge many times, are generally stable, and have high energy densities per weight and volume.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some embodiments, anodes in lithium ion batteries are made from silicon, specifically a silicon powder that has small crystalline silicon particles in random orientations packed together with graphite powder. There are voids/spaces among these particles. Lithium is stored within the silicon and graphite particles (which have a high absorption for the lithium) and in the voids/spaces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the prior art uses thick silicon substrates that are porous. The silicon substrates have long deep pores with large average pore diameters to increase the surface area (e.g., the surface area of the pore walls) of the silicon exposed to lithium within the silicon substrate. In some embodiments, the pores in the silicon substrates have large spaces between them so that there is space for the lithiated silicon substrate to expand and contract during charge and discharge cycling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These types of porous silicon substrate can form long nanowire-type lithiated silicon structures within the silicon substrate. Accordingly, while increasing lithium storage per silicon substrate volumes (due to the increased porous surface area exposed to lithium), these silicon substrates increase the amount of lithium intercalation and structural failures of these substrates.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To store large amounts of lithium and improve the energy density of these batteries (e.g., both in microbatteries and larger batteries, like power cells), the cathode region has to be thick, i.e., greater than 100 microns in thickness. The large thickness of these cathodes provides a larger amount of lithium for storage in the battery anode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During a discharge cycle, when the battery is connected to an external circuit load, electrons flow from the anode through the circuit load and back to the cathode. Generally, the lithium metal atoms diffused in and/or in contact with the anode, lose an electron and become lithium ions in, on, or near the anode and silicon substrate. These lithium ions then move through the battery, e.g., through the battery electrolyte, creating an (lithium ion) ionic current. Reaching the cathode, lithium ions intercalate into the cathode lattice and are reduced by electrons provided from the load circuit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">During a charging cycle, the ionic current reverses in the battery. A charging power source removes electrons from the lithium compounds at the cathode to create lithium ions at/in the cathode region. In the charging cycle, these lithium ions migrate through the electrolyte as lithium ionic current back to the anode and accumulate at anode surface or intercalate in the anode lattice where they become reduced by the electrons provided by the charging power source. The accumulation of lithium metal at the anode and electrochemical processes within the battery cause a potential difference across the battery between the anode and cathode that enables the battery to produce a current through an external load during the next discharge cycle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Lithium is absorbed or intercalated at a high concentration in these prior art anode substrates, e.g., silicon substrates. This intercalation (reversible inclusion or insertion of a molecule or ion into a material layer) creates large volume changes in the substrate during the charge and discharge cycles. These volume changes cause battery failure due to silicon substrate cracking, battery leakage of internal components, contaminants entering the battery, internal shorting of battery components, etc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other failure modes include lithium dendrite growth into and from the substrate which also causes component shorting, substrate weakening, cracking, contamination, battery leakage, etc.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As stated, thick silicon (Si) substrates used in lithium ion batteries have many failure modes due to lithium intercalation, substrate volume cycling, and dendrite growth. In addition, these thicker substrates are inflexible or have reduced flexibility because of their thickness which prevents forming the lithium batteries into shapes useful for many physical structures.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thicker substrates used in the prior art anodes also are costly in terms of battery energy density as measured by energy per battery volume and/or energy per battery weight.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is a need to: reduce the failure rate of lithium batteries and lithium battery anodes, increase energy density per battery weight and volume, increase battery charge rate, and enable flexible lithium batteries that can easily form into multiple physical configurations. There is also a need for methods of making these batteries easily and cheaply. These improvements are needed for energy storage in general and specifically for uses in microelectronics, cell phones, the internet of things (IoT), home and large building energy storage/capacity, vehicles (including electric cars, boats, trucks, trains, and other forms of transport), and energy storage/capacity in high power applications in industry. Electric utility applications need these improved batteries for storing large amounts of energy generated by alternative energy sources like wind, tides, solar, etc. to help make these alternative energy sources be viable and reliable, and to provide a continuous energy supply when the charging from an intermittent energy source.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of this invention include different configurations of lithium batteries that have a cathode made of a lithium containing material, an anode, and an electrolyte/separator between the cathode and anode.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the anode includes:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">1. a conductive anode current collector made of a material non-reactive with lithium, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">2. a nucleation layer on the anode current collector surface that can create a lithium metal layer that is continuous on the conductive substrate surface.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In some embodiments, the nucleation layer is a (thin/first) semiconductor layer made of a porous, single crystalline material, with a first porosity.

For example, while the meaning of these descriptions might change if the device was rotated upside down, the descriptions remain valid because they describe relative relationships between features of the invention.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">Embodiments of this invention include various cathode structures in various lithium battery embodiments also having various anode structures where the anode structure is thin, e.g., the total thickness of all three layers is less than 100 micrometers/microns (nm) or less than 25 microns thick.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Embodiments enable plating and stripping of a lithium metal layer on an anode surface, e.g., a smooth anode surface and/or an anode nucleation surface (nucleation surface). The nucleation surface can be the surface of a conductive current collector modified to enable a lithium seed layer and formation of a lithium metal layer. In alternative embodiments, the nucleation can be one or more thin semiconductor, e.g., silicon, layers, including but not limited to a single crystal porous Si surface, disposed on a conductive current collector. The anode nucleation layer enables a lithium metal layer to easily vary (grow and shrink) in thickness during battery charge and discharge cycles with no or a minimum of lithium intercalation.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">In some embodiments, the anode nucleation layer facilitates a lithium seed layer formation that in turn facilitates formation of a lithium metal layer or lithium layer. The effective formation of the lithium metal layer prevents or greatly inhibits the lithium ions from penetrating through the lithium metal layer and therefore eliminates or greatly reduces lithium intercalation into other layer(s) below. As a result, battery component deterioration/failure resulting from volume cycling and other intercalation effects are eliminated or reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">In some embodiments, the smoothness of the nucleation layer surface inhibits or prevents dendrite growth on/in the anode and therefore prevents battery deterioration and/or the electrical shorting of internal battery components, e.g., shorting to the cathode and electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">Because the thickness/volume of the anode, and therefore the battery thickness, is reduced, more energy producing components can now be put into the volume not needed by the present invention but needed in thicker prior art anodes and lithium storage structures. As a result, more energy producing components can occupy the freed-up volume, formerly needed by prior art anodes, to increase the energy density of the battery. Alternatively, the same energy storage now can be produced by a battery with a smaller volume/weight profile.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Embodiments of the invention enable flexible batteries that can be formed into different shapes, e.g., stacked, bent, rolled, applied to curved surfaces, etc. to create high density and fast charging energy storage devices and storage devices that can be physically configured into different form factors for different applications.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">Many alternative, economical, and scalable structures and methods are disclosed that, given this disclosure, enable easy and inexpensive manufacture of these energy storage devices.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">Methods of cheaply making these energy storage devices are presented below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">As used herein, &#x201c;plating&#x201d; means deposition of lithium metal and/or lithium atoms/ions to form a lithium metal layer of variable thickness upon a surface. &#x201c;Stripping&#x201d; means the removal of lithium atoms/ions and electrons from the lithium metal layer causing the lithium metal layer to shrink. Plating causes the lithium metal layer to grow (become thicker) by converting lithium ions (by adding an electron) to lithium atoms added as lithium metal to the lithium metal layer. Stripping decreases the thickness of the lithium metal layer as lithium atoms (lithium ions and associated electron) leave the lithium metal layer.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">Unfortunately, up until now, using a silicon (nano size or bulk-size or other semiconductor) substrate as an anode substrate has caused the failure modes as discussed above due to the volume cycling of the silicon substrate, lithium dendrite growth, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">This disclosure describes various embodiments that provide anode surfaces and thicknesses that repeatedly permit lithium metal layers to form (grow during charging and shrink during discharging cycles) with minimal or no mechanical failure effects on battery components or significant dendrite growth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">&#x201c;Uniform&#x201d; plating means that a lithium metal layer plated on a surface is a predominantly continuous lithium layer across the entire area of a surface. This lithium layer can be wavy and non-uniform in thickness or the thickness can be constant over the entire surface. However, in some embodiments, the lithium metal layer forms on substantially all or all the surface, e.g., an anode surface, with all parts of the anode surface covered with the lithium metal layer.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">It is thought that this uniform plating of the lithium metal layer, e.g., on the nucleation layer, prevents or largely inhibits dendrite formation, particularly when the surface of the lithium metal layer is smooth. The semiconductor layer(s) used as nucleation layers are smooth.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">It has been observed that when plating lithium on unmodified copper or other metallic/conductive surfaces, the lithium does not plate with a uniform thickness and/or does not plate in a continuous/uniform layer. The lithium tends to aggregate in &#x201c;globs&#x201d; in some regions while leaving other (e.g., larger) areas/regions of the metallic surface exposed with little or no lithium on the metallic surface. This non-uniform plating performs poorly when used in an anode and probably contributes to low specific capacity and dendrite formation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">In some embodiments of the present invention, an anode is made by disposing a thin, crystal semiconductive layer on a conductive current collector layer. The semiconductive layer has a surface on which lithium nucleates, e.g., the lithium nucleates to first form a lithium seed layer on/in the semiconductor surface. A lithium metal layer then forms uniformly/continuously across the entire surface of the semiconductor layer, e.g., on the seed layer on/in the semiconductive layer. The lithium metal layer will grow and shrink during the charge and discharge cycling of the battery.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">In some embodiments, the semiconductor layer is made from single crystal silicon. Accordingly, the semiconductor layer used as a nucleation layer will be referred to as a nucleation layer, silicon layer, crystal silicon layer, or single crystal silicon layer, etc. without loss of generality, even though other semiconductor materials and structures are envisioned for making the (thin, first, &#x201c;I layer&#x201d;) semiconductor layer.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">In some embodiments, the thin, crystal silicon layer has a porosity. The porosity (first porosity) has an average pore size large enough to form a lithium seed layer on the silicon nucleation layer surface but not large enough to promote lithium intercalation or a large amount of lithium storage within the silicon nucleation layer. As stated, no further lithium will intercalate within the silicon layer after the lithium metal layer is formed. In addition, because of the smoothness of the silicon layer, the lithium metal layer will have a smooth surface and be uniformly/continuously spread over the semiconductor surface. As a result, dendrite formation will be greatly reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">Since operation of the battery(ies) of the present invention, including battery charge and discharge cycling, does not rely on a thick silicon substrate to store lithium (because the majority of the lithium is stored in the lithium metal layer and not in the thin semiconductor layer), there is minimal intercalation in the semiconductor layer after the lithium metal layer is formed. Also, there is little or no volume cycling of the semiconductor layer. No thick substrate is needed to store lithium. Using thinner anodes, much thinner batteries can be made with high energy densities.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">These invention embodiments have removed the need for thick semiconductor (e.g., silicon) substrates in the battery anode. Contrarily, any semiconductor layer used (if any) does not store large amounts of lithium but primarily acts to enable the lithium metal layer to form and grow (plating) and shrink (de-plating) during cycling.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">In some embodiments, the semiconductor nucleation layer is porous with pores of such a size to enable a lithium seed layer formation that helps the more efficient formation of the lithium metal layer.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">Accordingly, the battery anode is thin single crystal porous silicon layer, flexible, with little or no intercalation of lithium into the silicon. Thus, the failure modes common in the prior art are reduced or eliminated. Further, the battery volume and weight that was formerly needed for thicker silicon substrates can now be used for additional thin anode/battery structures and more energy storage.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">Using the embodiments of the present invention increases the energy density of batteries (energy storage devices) by a factor of 2 to 10 or more.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Other embodiments, described below, use two or more single crystal semiconductor layers, sometimes each with different porosities, deposited on the anode current collector electrode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">Still other embodiments, described below, use no semiconductor layers, and modify the conductive current collector surface to create a uniform lithium metal layer disposed on the current collector. Some of these embodiments, use conductive current collector substrates made of materials that do not react with lithium.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">Larger, e.g., thicker, cathodes can provide more lithium for the higher current densities enabled in these anodes with greater energy densities. However, thicker cathodes, while providing more lithium, can decrease the charging and discharging rates of the battery because of the increased time the lithium takes to migrate through the thicker cathode during charge/discharge cycles.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">Embodiments are disclosed that use cathode thicknesses thin enough to enable fast battery charging while maintaining high current densities in the anode region.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">Refer to the Figures.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross section view of one embodiment of a battery anode region <b>100</b>.
