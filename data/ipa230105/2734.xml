Since MSCs can be isolated by a relatively simple procedure, they are widely used as biomaterials, mainly for local transplantation following induction of differentiation into cartilage, bone, or the like in vitro.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For advanced clinical applications, the ability to produce a necessary amount of cells that maintain a certain function is a prerequisite for commercialization.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, if there are variations in the properties of the starting material (e.g., human bone marrow aspirate), i.e., if there is a difference in the donor-dependent properties, the properties of the cell preparation as a product will be greatly affected.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is important to obtain high-purity mesenchymal stem cells with minimal variation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have isolated LNGFR/Thy-1-double-positive cells from a cerebrospinal fluid by flow cytometry to obtain rapidly expanding clones (RECs), thereby establishing a purification and isolation method that can eliminate the difference in the donor-dependent proliferation potential of the MSCs (Japanese Patent No. 6463029, WO2016/017795, Mabuchi Y. et al, Stem Cell Reports 1(2): 152-165, 2013). According to this method, RECs are isolated and sorted, for example, using Ror2 expression as an indicator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, a purified mesenchymal stem cell composition and a method for purifying a mesenchymal stem cell composition are also known (Japanese Patent No. 6025329). According to this method, mesenchymal stem cells with a diameter of 150 &#x3bc;m or less are purified.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, variation is still observed in the differentiation potential and the proliferation potential of the REC clones. Moreover, even RECs with excellent proliferation potential will inevitably deteriorate due to repeated passages, and therefore an effective quality control method has been sought. Furthermore, even for the use of Ror2 expression as an indicator, there is room for improvement regarding correlation with the proliferation potential.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART LITERATURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 6463029</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent literature 2: International Patent Application Publication WO2016/017795</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent literature 3: Japanese Patent No. 6025329</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Non-patent literature 1: Y Mabuchi, S Morikawa, S Harada, K Niibe, S Suzuki, F Renault-Mihara, D D Houlihan, C Akazawa, H Okano, Y Matsuzaki, <i>LNGFR+Thy</i>-1+ <i>Vcam</i>-1<i>hi+ cells reveal functionally distinct subpopulations in mesenchymal stem cells, </i>Stem Cell Reports, 1(2): 152-165, 2013.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problem to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, the present invention aims at establishing a method for sorting out high-purity and highly homogeneous RECs and an indicator that guarantees the cell performance.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present inventors have investigated to solve the above problem, where cells positive for both LNGFR and Thy-1 were obtained from a human bone marrow aspirate and a number of REC clones were produced from each single cell to measure the differentiation and proliferation potentials of the cells.

Since the RECs particularly retain migration ability, they can be administered intravenously and thus are expected for their application to serious systemic diseases such as skeletal dysplasia.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Even among such REC clones, however, variation in the differentiation and proliferation potentials is sometimes observed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention provides cell clones with less variation and a method for sorting out such cell clones.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A cell population including cell clones of the present invention is a cell population of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal stem cell clones that are double-positive for LNGFR (CD271) and Thy-1 (CD90), wherein the cell population satisfies at least one of the following characteristics (a) and (b):</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">(a) the coefficient of variation of the forward scatter in flow cytometry is 35% or less; and</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">(b) the average cell size is 20 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">2. Method for Enriching Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the present invention, mesenchymal stem cells that are positive for LNGFR (CD271) or that are double-positive for LNGFR (CD271) and Thy-1 (CD90) can be obtained, for example, by following the method described in WO2009/31678.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An overview of this method is as follows.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, mesenchymal stem cells are highly enriched by sorting out cell fractions that are positive for LNGFR (CD271) (CD271+) or that are double-positive for CD271 and CD90 (CD271+CD90+) from a cell population containing human mesenchymal stem cells. If the cell population containing human mesenchymal stem cells contains hematopoietic cells, a step of sorting out cells that are double-negative for CD45 and CD235a (CD45-CD235a-) can be added to sort out non-hematopoietic cells.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The cell population containing mesenchymal stem cells can be prepared by flow cytometry or affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">While a material used for obtaining this cell population is not limited, examples thereof include bone marrow and peripheral blood (including peripheral blood collected after G-CSF administration).

Moreover, if the material is contaminated with red blood cells, the red blood cells are preferably hemolyzed in advance.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cell population prepared as described above is used for sorting out CD271+ cells or CD271+CD90+ cells.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one exemplary method for sorting out CD271+ cells or CD271+CD90+ cells, antibodies are used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The antibodies are anti-CD271 and/or anti-CD90 antibodies that are capable of sorting out CD271+ cells or CD271+CD90+ cells. When flow cytometry is employed for sorting, an anti-CD271 antibody or anti-CD271 and anti-CD90 antibodies labeled with different fluorescent dyes such as FITC, PE, or APC can be used in an appropriate combination to sort live cells in a short time. Other than flow cytometry, CD271+CD90+ cells can also be sorted by a method using magnetic beads or affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Prior to these methods, dead cells may be removed by allowing the cell population to react with a fluorescent dye (e.g., PI) that stains dead cells and subsequently removing the fluorescently stained cells.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">3. Enriching REC cells</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, single-cell culturing (cloning) of the sorted LNGFR-positive cells or LNGFR- and Thy1-double-positive cells is performed to select a lot of rapidly proliferating cells, thereby obtaining high-purity human mesenchymal stem cells (REC: Rapidly Expanding Clones) excellent in proliferation potential, differentiation potential, and migration ability.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a process of isolating the RECs by single-cell cloning.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Mononuclear cells are prepared from human bone marrow or fat/placental chorion, and the bone marrow mononuclear cells are stained using anti-LNGFR antibody alone or anti-LNGFR and anti-Thy1 antibodies. Then, using flow cytometry (cell sorter), LNGFR-positive cells or LNGFR- and Thy1-positive cells are cloned and sorted into a 96-well culture plate. Specifically, one cell per well is seeded. After 2 weeks of single-cell culturing, an image of the culture plate is photographed under a microscope to sort out wells that are confluent or semi-confluent and designate cells contained in these wells as RECs.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Herein, &#x201c;rapidly proliferating&#x201d; and &#x201c;rapidly expanding&#x201d; mean that, when one cell per well is seeded and cultured in a 96-well culture plate, the growth rate is such that the culture plate becomes confluent or semi-confluent within two weeks of culture (doubling time of 26&#xb1;1 hour).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Confluent refers to a state where 90% or more of the surface of a culture container (surface of the culture) is covered by cultured cells. In addition, semi-confluent refers to a state where 70-90% of the surface of a culture container (surface of the culture) is covered by cultured cells. The size and type of the culture equipment used can be changed as appropriate depending on the growth rate of the cells. Cells that proliferate later on (moderately or slowly expanding cells), i.e., cells that are not semi-confluent or confluent after 2 weeks of single-cell culturing, are discarded. The RECs collected from each of the sorted wells are transferred to a culture flask for each well and further cultured to confluency (expansion culture). The cells from the expanded culture are then collected separately. RECs from one well are considered one lot and will be used for the sorting described below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Since the cells of the present invention are obtained by cloning and sorting where one cell is seeded per well, the genetic traits among all of the expanded cells are identical. Therefore, according to the present invention, the entire cell population may be referred to as a &#x201c;clone&#x201d; or each of the cells constituting the cell population may be referred to as a &#x201c;clone&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the present invention, RECs used for sorting can also be evaluated in advance using an REC marker (anti-Ror2). For example, after the aforementioned expanding culture, proliferating adherent cells are collected from all lots, and a portion (about 1 to 3&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells) of each lot is stained with an anti-Ror2 monoclonal antibody for single staining. A technique of single staining using an anti-Ror2 monoclonal antibody is known (WO2016/17795). Briefly, the percentage of REC marker-positive cells in the collected cells is determined by flow cytometry analysis using an REC marker. The percentage can be determined by quantitating Ror2 mRNA expression using quantitative PCR, or can be determined manually by microscopy. Lots (cell populations) having a certain percentage of positive cells (e.g., 65%) are considered acceptable and will be used for the sorting described below.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">4.
