it is meant a tyre having a high curvature ratio (typically greater than the one of motor-vehicles) in particular greater than 0.200, more preferably greater than or equal to 0.250, so that high camber angles can be reached during the cornering of the motor-cycle. In case the tyre is destined to be mounted on wheels for sport uses, the curvature ratio can be higher than 0.300. Such curvature ratio is typically less than or equal to 0.800, preferably less than or equal to 0.500, even more preferably less than or equal to 0.400.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By &#x201c;curvature ratio&#x201d; it is meant, with reference to the herein attached <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the value of the transversal curvature of the tyre, the transversal curvature being defined by the value of the ratio (f/C) between the distance f, measured on the equatorial plane <b>20</b> of the ridge of the tread band from the line b passing through the end points <b>0</b> of the tread band <b>17</b> and the distance C between said end points <b>0</b> of the tread band <b>17</b>.

The footprint typically has a substantially null curvature, or in any case it substantially assumes the conformation of the rolling surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By &#x201c;electric power supplier&#x201d; it is meant a component for supplying electric power to the electronic unit of the monitoring device. The supplier can consist for example of one or more electric energy accumulators, wherein the energy to be supplied is pre-accumulated (e.g. batteries or capacitors), or it can contain, in combination or not with one or more accumulators, an in situ electric power generator and/or in situ electric power receiver suitable for directly supplying the electronic unit and/or for recharging the accumulators (for example a transducer of mechanical energy in electric energy, or &#x201c;energy scavenger&#x201d; or &#x201c;harvester&#x201d;, or an electromagnetic induction receiver).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">There have been proposed tyres for vehicles, in particular for motor-vehicles, comprising monitoring devices of one or more physical quantities arranged in the inner cavity of the tyre, for example as described in US2014/0118134A1; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,862,486; 5,749,984; 5,960,844; 5,977,870; US2008/0303634A1; US2009/0134710A1; US2010/0007477A1, DE102012007071A1, WO2007/121768A1, WO2007/048621A1, WO2013/098711A1, WO2013/098712A1, WO2018/065846A1, US2007/0013503A1, US2010/0271191A1, US2015/0097662A1.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For the driver of a motor-cycle, especially during sporty driving or in any case in demanding driving conditions due to speed and/or road features (e.g. curving road), it is extremely important to know, in addition to the inflation pressure, the actual temperature of the front and rear tyres. In fact, the tyre performances (in particular the grip) strongly depend on the temperature, in particular on the temperature of the tread. Therefore, the driver can adjust his driving as a function of such temperature information, for example based on whether or not it is reached a threshold temperature above which the tyres provide adequate performances, for example, for a sporty driving or a fully safe driving in case of unfavourable environmental driving conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Applicant has realized that in this context it is preferable detecting the temperature as close as possible to the inner surface of the crown portion, since in this way it is acquired a datum close to the actual temperature of the tyre tread material, which is a critical element for the tyre own performances. On the contrary, the temperature for example close to the rim or the temperature of the fluid present in the inner cavity can be very different from the temperature of the inner surface of the crown portion (and therefore of the tread). Furthermore, when the temperature is acquired for example close to the rim or the inflation valve, the detected data is influenced by the temperature of the environment outside the wheel due to the heat conduction and/or the presence of external heat sources such as air flows coming from the radiators or from the brake discs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The Applicant has therefore faced the problem of making a monitoring device suitable for being fixed onto the inner surface of the crown portion of a tyre for motor-cycles.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For the making of monitoring device for pressure and temperature, a PCB (&#x2018;Printed Circuit Board&#x2019;) technology is typically used, based on a rigid support, on which the circuit tracks (electrically conductive metallic tracks) are printed and the electronic components are fixed through the respective electric connections (e.g. &#x201c;pin&#x201d;) by welding and, possibly, adhesives. In this way the electric and mechanical connections between the various electric and electronic components and the rigid support are made. Typically, the rigid support (PCB) comprises one or more layers of a base material, such as glass fibre, impregnated with a (e.g. epoxy) resin.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, for the operation of the monitoring device it is usual providing an electric energy accumulator/generator. For example, a (e.g. coin cell) battery comprising a metal capsule can be typically used. This electric energy accumulator/generator typically has a significant weight. For example, a non-rechargeable coin cell battery of the CR2032 type, with electric charge of about 200-250 mAh, has mass of about 3 g.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The main tendency for the preparation of monitoring device suitable to be installed onto the inner surface of tyres for motor-vehicles is to make the overall monitoring device as compact as possible. For example, a known solution envisages to superimpose on each other the accumulator and the PCB, suitably connected, with all the electronic components fixed on them, and to encapsulate the whole with an encapsulating material (e.g. polymeric resin), possibly inside a rigid containment body. In these situations, the support or the rigid board PCB is interposed between the electronic components and the accumulator, with the latter in more proximal position to the inner surface with respect to the electronic components. Furthermore, a housing can be provided (for example made of elastomeric material) for coupling the device to the surface of the tyre. The coupling can be made by a piece for attachment to the surface of the tyre and/or one or more adhesives. The set of these structures (rigid support, containment body, encapsulant, housing, adhesive/s) entails a weight increase, for a total overall mass of the whole monitoring device which can reach 8-15 g, almost all located in a small area, equal to the plan area of the container (for example inscribed in a circle with diameter of 18-30 mm).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The Applicant, in carrying out tests with a monitoring device thus made and fixed onto the inner surface of the crown portion of tyres for motor-cycles, has found the following problems.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">First of all, in the aforesaid monitoring device the actual temperature sensor is at a certain distance from the inner surface of the tyre (typically made by the liner). Furthermore, between the temperature sensor and the inner surface various elements are interposed, including the rigid board, the accumulator, the encapsulating material and possibly part of the housing, which, during the rolling of the tyre, heat the environment inside the device. Therefore, the temperature detected by the sensor undergoes a &#x201c;flywheel&#x201d; effect such that it can be significantly different from the actual temperature of the inner surface, and therefore of the tread.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, the (flat) face of the monitoring device for the attachment onto the inner surface of the tyre is relatively wide and therefore it does not well adapt to the very curved inner surface (both in axial and tangential direction) of a tyre for motor-cycles. The Applicant has verified the onset of adhesion problems, with the monitoring device which tends to detach. To overcome this problem, the attachment surface of the monitoring device could be made curve, but in this way the curvature should be tailor-made on the transversal and tangential curvature of the target tyre, with consequent industrial complexity in terms of production and application to the tyre. Furthermore, the encapsulating material and/or the housing should be highly deformable, at least at the attachment face, to conform themselves to the geometry changes caused by the passage of the device at the footprint area, with a further increase of the aforesaid problems about to the heat generated inside the device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the overall mass of the monitoring device, placed at the inner surface of the tyre and therefore with an arm relatively long with respect to the rotation axis, produces a balance alteration during rotation of the wheel (consisting of tyre and rim), which is significant as a consequence of the reduced weight of the tyres for motor-cycle. This masses unbalance during rotation can cause an unpleasant driving experience for the driver, up to compromise the driving safety of the motor-cycle. This problem is exacerbated by the overall mass localization of the device in a portion of limited area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The Applicant has therefore faced the problem of providing a tyre for motor-cycles with a monitoring device of at least one physical quantity, preferably of the temperature, applied onto the inner surface of the crown portion of the tyre, which is able to maintain a strong and durable adhesion of the device onto the inner surface, while limiting the masses unbalance during rotating of the tyre in use.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To overcome one or more of these drawbacks, the Applicant has conceived a monitoring device according to the present invention, in which the electronic unit and the electric power supplier are both fixed onto a flexible support.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the Applicant, this solution causes the overall mass of the monitoring device to be reduced, due to the elimination of a component with significant mass such as the rigid board (PCB), as well as of the encapsulating material and of the housing, with advantages in terms of reduction of the above described masses unbalance during rotation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, in the monitoring device the power supplier and the electronic unit can be separately fixed onto the flexible support. More specifically, at least part of the (preferably the whole) electronic unit and the power supplier can be arranged so that not being radially superimposed. In this way the overall mass of the monitoring device is divided into at least two parts with non-negligible mass with respect to the overall mass of the device. The mass which insists on a respective single localized crown portion of the tyre is thus reduced, with a consequent further reduction of the aforesaid rotational unbalance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, since the electronic unit (comprising the sensor) can be fixed onto the flexible support without the interposition of the electric power supplier (e.g. the accumulator), the sensor is close to the inner surface and it detects a temperature very close to the actual one of the inner surface, and therefore of the tread, thanks also to the fact that the flexible support is typically thin and rapidly reaches the thermal equilibrium with the inner surface of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The flexible support also adapts to the curvature of the inner surface of the crown portion, with advantageous effects in terms of adhesion strength and/or duration.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an aspect the invention relates to a tyre for motor-cycles comprising a monitoring device fixed onto an inner surface of said tyre at a crown portion of said tyre.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The monitoring device comprises an electronic unit and an electric power supplier for supplying said electronic unit.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The electronic unit comprises: at least one sensor for detecting at least one of the following physical quantities: temperature, pressure, acceleration, deformation; a processing unit; a transceiver.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The monitoring device further comprises a flexible support in single body, wherein said electronic unit and said electric power supplier are fixed on said flexible support.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For the purposes of the present description and of the following claims, by &#x201c;flexible support&#x201d; it is generally meant a support made of a material (including a composite/layered material) which, if used for the making of a square-shaped plate with side significantly greater than the circumferential extension of the entry or exit area from the footprint area of a tyre (for example a plate with surface of 120 mm&#xd7;120 mm) and with thickness equal to the support, allows this plate to conform&#x2014;at ambient temperature&#x2014;to a cylindrical surface with lower radius than the normal curvature radius of a tyre inflated to its nominal pressure (e.g. a cylindrical surface with radius of 200 mm, preferably 100 mm, more preferably 50 mm) without breaking or undergoing permanent deformation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present invention can have one or more of the following preferred features.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably an equatorial plane of said tyre crosses, or passes close to, said electronic unit, more preferably it crosses, or passes close to, said sensor. In this way the temperature is detected in the middle of the tread band.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably an equatorial plane of said tyre crosses, or passes close to, said electric power supplier.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In fact, the Applicant has observed that, in certain conditions relatively to the geometric shape of the device and/or of the tyre, to the materials, to the operating conditions, etc., when a massive component is arranged substantially far from the equatorial plane, the monitoring device of the present invention, in particular the flexible support, can deform collapsing towards the equatorial plane. For example, in one embodiment of a monitoring device according to the present invention comprising two accumulators arranged on opposite end of a flexible support with elongated shape and arranged perpendicularly to the equatorial plane (so that the two accumulators are far from the equatorial plane), the ends of the flexible support can move towards the equatorial plane, forming a fold, or curl, in the flexible support. Such fold can mainly form in a central portion of the flexible support.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the Applicant, without restricting to any theory, this phenomenon originates from the centrifugal force to which the massive parts of the monitoring device are subjected (typically the electric power supplier or parts thereof), arranged relatively far from the equatorial plane, in particular when during the rotation they are out of the footprint and possibly also entering and exiting the footprint. This centrifugal force (with radial direction), due to the high transversal curvature of the tyre for motor-cycles, has a component directed tangentially to the inner surface and facing towards the equatorial plane and therefore it tends to push the massive parts along the inner surface towards the equatorial plane.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">This can first of all generate stresses on the contact/adhesion surfaces between the massive parts and the support and between the support and the inner surface, with the possibility of detachment and/or loss of structural and/or electric integrity of the monitoring device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the flexible support is subjected to deformation forces that can produce the aforesaid fold or curl in the flexible support, and this happens the more the support is non-deformable under compression.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The formation of such fold, especially in the center of the flexible support, i.e. wherein electronic components and/or electric connection circuits can typically be found, can lead, especially with prolonged use, to an interruption of the electric connections and/or a malfunction of the devices.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The aforesaid positioning of the electronic unit and/or of the electric power supplier onto, or close to, the equatorial plane allows arranging one or more of the most massive components of the device (e.g. the electric power supplier, the accumulator/s, the electronic unit, etc) in the bottom region of the transversal curvature of the inner surface of the tyre in a section passing through the rotation axis of the tyre. In this way, no forces, or minimal forces, are generated that push these massive components along this curvature towards the equatorial plane. This therefore allows strongly reducing or completely cancelling the onset of the aforesaid stresses on the contact/adhesion surfaces between the massive components and the support and between the support and the inner surface, and/or the formation of the aforesaid fold.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Consistently with the above, by the expression &#x201c;equatorial plane passing close to an element&#x201d; it is meant that said element is positioned so that the component of the centrifugal acceleration acting on the element and directed tangentially to the inner surface towards the equatorial plane, is substantially null or negligible.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the distance of said element from said equatorial plane is less than or equal to 25 mm, more preferably less than or equal to 15 mm.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably the flexible support has a plan view with elongated shape along a main development direction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">By &#x201c;main development direction&#x201d; it is meant the direction along which the flexible support has the greater dimension when undeformed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably the monitoring device is fixed onto the inner surface of the tyre for motor-cycles so that the main development direction of the flexible support, and/or a direction passing through the center of mass of the accumulators, forms an angle with a direction parallel to the equatorial plane less than or equal to 45&#xb0;, more preferably less than or equal to 30&#xb0;, even more preferably less than or equal to 20&#xb0;. Preferably the main development direction of the flexible support is parallel to the equatorial plane of the tyre. In this way the massive components are easily kept close to the equatorial plane.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably a length of the flexible support along said main development direction is greater than or equal to 50 mm, more preferably greater than or equal to 70 mm, and/or less than or equal to 140 mm, more preferably less than or equal to 130 mm. The Applicant has verified that such lengths suffice to allow efficiently distributing the masses of the electric and electronic components without making the overall device excessively long and/or bulky.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably an aspect ratio R between a length of the flexible support along said main development direction and a width along a direction orthogonal to the main development direction is greater than or equal to 1.5, more preferably greater than or equal to 2, even more preferably greater than or equal to 2.5, and/or less than or equal to 6, more preferably less than or equal to 5.

The arrows <b>100</b> schematically show the, radially directed, centrifugal force which is generated during the rotation of the tyre in the out-of-footprint portion and which acts on the masses of each accumulator <b>14</b>.
