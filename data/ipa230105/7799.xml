For example, a &#x201c;bucket&#x201d; type approach can be used in which a first housing component serves as a bucket into which electronic device components are placed, and a second housing component serves as a cover for the bucket. This arrangement secures the electronic device components between the first and second housing components. As a variation of this, some or all of the electronic device components can be assembled into the cover for the bucket, and the cover can subsequently be rotated into the bucket to close the device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other known portable electronic devices can be constructed by inserting components into a hollow housing element. For example, an electronic device can be constructed using a tubular structure (e.g., a flattened tube or a hollow rectangular tube) into which electronic device components can be inserted. The electronic device components can be inserted into the tubular structure from one or both ends, and connected within the structure. For example, one or more circuits inserted from opposite ends of the tubular structure can be connected through an opening for a window in the structure. The structure can be capped at one or both ends to ensure that the components remain fixed within the tubular structure, and to provide interface components (e.g., connectors, buttons, or ports) for the device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, however, as portable electronic device continue to be made smaller, thinner and/or more powerful, there remains a continuing need to provide improved techniques and structures for providing housings for portable electronic devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments are described herein in the context of housings for electronic devices. According to one aspect, adjoining surfaces of electronic device housings can be mounted or arranged such that adjoining surfaces are flush to a high degree of precision. The electronic devices can be portable and in some cases handheld.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention pertains to apparatus, systems and methods for assembling electronic devices, namely, portable or handheld electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention may be implemented in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, as a method, system, device, or apparatus. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a method for assembling a device housing of an electronic device, one embodiment can, for example, provide an outer glass member for the device housing, and provide a protective side structural member having a receptive plane that is to receive the outer glass member. A liquid adhesive can be applied to a portion of the outer glass member and/or a portion of the protective side structural member. The outer glass member can be positioned adjacent to the receptive plane of the protective side structural member. A first a first force can be applied to push the outer glass member against a planar reference surface, and a second force can be applied to push the protective side structural member against the planar reference surface. The second force is independently applied from the first force. Still further, the liquid adhesive can be cured into a solid bonding material that bonds together the outer glass member and the protective side structural member, thereby assembling the outer glass member with the protective side structural member. Subsequently, the first force and the second force can be removed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a method for assembling a device housing of an electronic device, one embodiment can, for example, provide an outer housing member for the device housing, and provide a protective side structural member. A first force can then be applied to push the outer housing member against a planar reference surface, and a second force can be applied to push the protective side structural member against the planar reference surface. The second force is independently applied from the first force. The outer housing member and the protective side structural member can then be secured together, thereby assembling a portion of the device housing including at least the outer housing member with the protective side structural member. The assembled portion of the device housing can then be removed from the planar reference surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As an electronic device enclosure, one embodiment can, for example, include at least an outer periphery member defining a side surface for the electronic device enclosure, and an internal structure secured to an inner surface of the outer periphery member. The internal structure can be offset from front and back planar boundaries of the outer periphery member. The electronic device enclosure can further include a front cover assembly placed and secured adjacent the front planar boundary of the outer peripheral boundary, thereby providing a front surface for the electronic device enclosure. The front cover assembly can include a front cover member and a protective side member, the protective side member being provided against and around the sides of the front cover member.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus includes a cover part that includes at least one attachment protruding therefrom. The apparatus also includes a housing part and at least one electronic component. The housing part includes at least one receptacle configured to receive the attachment. The receptacle is defined at least partially on a first side and is configured to capture the attachment. The cover part is interfaced with a second side of the housing part when the attachment is captured in the receptacle. Finally, the electronic component is arranged within an inner volume defined by at least the housing part. In one embodiment, the cover part is in substantially direct contact with the second side of the housing part when the attachment is captured in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other

Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments are described herein in the context of a housing for an electronic device. The housing can make use of an outer member. The outer member can be aligned, protected and/or secured with respect to other portions of the housing for the electronic device. The electronic device can be portable and in some cases handheld.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to one aspect, adjoining surfaces of electronic device housings can be mounted or arranged such that adjoining surfaces are flush to a high degree of precision. Edges of portable electronic devices are susceptible to impact force, such as when dropped. According to another aspect, protective sides can be provided on edges of electronic device housings so to dissipate impact forces and thus reduce damage to electronic device housings. According to still another embodiment, an electronic device housing can have one or more of its exposed major surfaces (e.g., front or back surfaces) formed of glass. The glass surfaces can be protected by the protective sides and/or can be aligned so that the top surfaces of the glass surfaces and the protective sides can be substantially flush.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another aspect, apparatus, systems and methods for robustly attaching a cover portion of an electronic device to a bottom portion, e.g., a housing portion, of the electronic device are described. The cover portion may generally include a frame (e.g., interface member) into which n outer member (e.g., glass member) has been inserted. Attachment members (e.g., arms, tabs) can be coupled to, e.g., insert molded into, a cover portion, and can be arranged to substantially engage with a housing portion such that the cover portion is effectively held against the housing portion. The attachment members can be used to fasten the cover portion to the housing. In general, receptacles of the housing portion are arranged to substantially capture, mate or otherwise engage attachment members of the cover portion.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to another aspect, a cover assembly can be configured to support and protect an outer glass member. The cover assembly can form part of a housing for an electronic device. The cover assembly can also include a distinct glass lens, attachment members, structural support.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to still another aspect, an optical lens can be formed from a formed optical adhesive. The optical lens can, for example, be used as a lens for a camera flash of a portable electronic device. The optical lens can be provided between the camera flash and the cover member A mold can be used to form a lens from the optical adhesive.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The following detailed description is illustrative only, and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will generally be used throughout the drawings and the following detailed description to refer to the same or like parts. It should be appreciated that the drawings are generally not drawn to scale, and at least some features of the drawings have been exaggerated for ease of illustration.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application and business related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to one aspect, a housing for an electronic device can include an outer periphery member that forms the sides of the electronic device. The outer periphery member can define a volume into which electronic device components can be placed. To obtain the components within the device, front and back covers can be placed over the front and back surfaces of the outer periphery member.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">An outer periphery member can provide a variety of attributes to the electronic device including for example, structural, functional, cosmetic, or combinations of these. The outer periphery member may for example form at least a portion of the right, left, top and bottom sides of the device. As such, the outer periphery member may surround components that are placed in the device back to front, front to back or center to back and front (e.g., components inserted within the volume defined by the outer periphery member). The outer periphery member may be formed from one or more elements. The elements may be similar or different depending on the dimensions or shape of the device, as well as functional or structural considerations (e.g., outer periphery member elements serving as an antenna for tuning electromagnetic waves). If several elements are combined to form the outer periphery members, the elements can be connected in any suitable manner to form a single unit having adequate structural, functional, or cosmetic properties. In some cases, the outer periphery member can be formed from several elements that act as a single integral unit (e.g., a unitary part). For example, the elements can be integrally formed together.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the outer periphery member can define a band that forms an enclosed volume having a front and back open area. The band may define a ring-like structure that wraps around some or all of the components of the electronic device. The electronic device can include a variety of components such as housing elements, electronics, structural members, or combinations of these. In some cases, one or more structural members (e.g., a mid-plate) can be connected to the outer periphery member within the volume enclosed by the outer periphery member to receive and support components, or enhance the structural properties of the outer periphery member.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the electronic device can include front and/or back cover assemblies operative to cap the volume defined by the outer periphery member. The cover assemblies can be positioned relative to the open areas of the outer periphery member such that the front and back cover assemblies are placed adjacent to the front and back surfaces of the outer periphery member, respectively. The cover assemblies can include any suitable feature, including for example housing portions, access points, electronics, structural members, aesthetic members, or combinations of these. In some cases, the cover assemblies can include one or more features for securing or retaining electronic device components within the volume enclosed by the outer periphery member.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The outer periphery member and the front and back cover assemblies can provide some or all of the exterior surfaces of the device, and thus define the outer periphery form or look and feel of the electronic device. In particular, the front cover can substantially form the front surface of the device, the back cover can substantially form the back surface of the device, and the outer periphery member can substantially form the top, bottom, left and right surfaces of the device. It will be understood, however, that some or all of the cover assemblies can instead or in addition provide part of the top, bottom, left or right surfaces of the device, and that some or all of the outer periphery member can provide part of the front or back surfaces of the device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Because the cover assemblies can define exposed surfaces of the electronic device, one or both of the cover assemblies can include components, coatings or finishes that enhance the functional, cosmetic and/or aesthetic characteristics of the assemblies. For example, one or both of the cover assemblies can include a transparent or translucent window through which input/output components are able to be used by the user. For example, one output component that can be used is a display device that can present information to the user via the cover assembly. As another example, one input component that can be used is a touch sensor (e.g., touch sensor) that can receive user input from the user via the cover assembly. As another example, one or both of the cover assemblies can include a cosmetic component for enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the device. In some embodiments, the cosmetic component can cause the cover assembly to be substantially opaque in some areas (e.g., on a back cover assembly), yet transparent or translucent in other areas (e.g., on a front cover assembly through which content generated by the display device is provided). In other words, the cover assembly can include a transparent or translucent window that is provided on a portion of the cover assembly. The cover assemblies can also support other function features, such as a camera opening, a lens, a light, a sensor, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Internal components of the electronic device can be assembled using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the internal components can define one or more layers that are placed within the outer periphery member. For example, layers can initially be placed near the center of the volume defined by the outer periphery member, and subsequently be added towards one or both of the front and back surfaces of the device. Each layer added to the device can be coupled or fit to a layer previously inserted and attached to the device.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To further retain component layers, the electronic device can include an internal platform providing a structural element for the outer periphery member and to which component layers can be coupled. In some embodiments, the internal platform can provide attachment points for the various layers placed within the electronic device. The internal platform may be placed within the height of the outer periphery member such that it is substantially near the middle of the outer periphery member (e.g., at half the height of the outer periphery member), thus defining a mid-plate. In particular, the mid-plate can form a substantially H-shape cross-section with the outer periphery member, thus providing enhanced structural properties. Electronic device components or layers can be assembled to both the front and back surfaces of the mid-plate (e.g., the mid-plate separates the internal volume of the outer periphery member into two distinct regions or pockets). The mid-plate can be secured to the outer periphery member (e.g., using welding, or formed with or made integral with the outer periphery member. Although called a plate or platform it will be understood that the internal platform can take a variety of non-planar forms, including various formations that include steps, offsets, curved surfaces, or combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an illustrative electronic device structure taken along the device width in accordance with one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an exploded cross-sectional view of an illustrative electronic device taken along the device length in accordance with one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a top view of an illustrative electronic device in accordance with one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a bottom view of an illustrative electronic device in accordance with one embodiment. Electronic device <b>100</b> can include any suitable type of electronic device having a display, including for example a media player, a mobile telephone, a personal e-mail or messaging device, pocket-sized personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a music recorder, a video recorder, a camera, radios, medical equipment, and devices combining some or all of this functionality.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Electronic device <b>100</b> can have any suitable shape, including for example a shape delimited by front surface <b>110</b>, back surface <b>112</b>, left surface <b>114</b>, right surface <b>116</b>, top surface <b>118</b> and bottom surface <b>119</b> (not shown in the cross-section). Each surface can be substantially planar, curved, or combinations of these. The surfaces can include one or more chamfers, detents, openings, dips, extensions, or other features modifying the smoothness of the surfaces.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Electronic device <b>100</b> can be constructed using any suitable structure, including for example using outer periphery member <b>120</b>. Outer periphery member <b>120</b> can surround or wrap some or all of the electronic device such that the outer periphery member defines an internal volume <b>122</b> into which electronic device components can be placed. For example, outer periphery member <b>120</b> can wrap around the device such that the external surfaces of outer periphery member <b>120</b> define left surface <b>114</b>, right surface <b>116</b>, as well as top surface <b>118</b> and bottom surface <b>119</b> of the device. To provide a desired functionality to a user, the electronic device can include several components placed within the device, for example within volume <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The outer periphery member can have a particular height (e.g., the device height h) such that the outer periphery member encloses volume <b>122</b> into which electronic device components can be assembled. The thickness (e.g., outer periphery member thickness t), length (e.g., device length <b>1</b>), height (e.g., device height h), and cross-section of the outer periphery member can be selected based on any suitable criteria including for example based on structural requirements (e.g., stiffness, or resistance to bending, compression, tension or torsion in particular orientations). In some embodiments, the outer periphery member can serve as a structural member to which other electronic device components can be mounted. The outer periphery member can include one or more depressions, recesses, channels, protrusions, or openings for supporting components or for providing structural support for the device. In some embodiments, an opening can be used to provide access to one or more internal components contained within the outer peripheral member.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Outer periphery member <b>120</b> (or device <b>100</b>) can have any suitable cross-section. For example, outer periphery member <b>120</b> can have a substantially rectangular cross-section. In some embodiments, outer periphery member <b>120</b> can instead or in addition have a cross-section in a different shape, including for example a circular, oval, polygonal, or curved cross-section. In some embodiments, the shape or size of the cross-section can vary along the length or width of the device (e.g., an hourglass shaped cross-section).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Electronic device components can be placed within volume <b>122</b> using any suitable approach. For example, electronic device <b>100</b> can include components <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> can be inserted into volume <b>122</b>. Each of components <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> can include individual components, or several components assembled together as a component layer or stack, or include several distinct layers of components to insert within volume <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, components <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> can each represent several components stacked along the height of the device. The component layers can be electrically coupled to each other to enable data and power transfers, as required for the proper operation of electronic device <b>100</b>. For example, the component layers can be electrically coupled using one or more of a PCB, flex, solder, SMT, wires, connectors, or combinations of these. The component layers can be inserted into outer periphery member <b>120</b> using any suitable approach. For example, components <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> can all be inserted from front surface <b>110</b> or from back surface <b>112</b> (e.g., back to front, front to back, or middle to front and back). Alternatively, the components can be inserted from both front surface <b>110</b> and back surface <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, one or more of the components can serve as a structural element. Alternatively, electronic device <b>100</b> can include a distinct structural element placed within volume <b>122</b> and coupled to outer periphery member <b>120</b>. For example, electronic device <b>100</b> can include one or more internal member or platform <b>140</b>, which can serve as a mounting points or regions for helping secure, hold or pack one or more component layers (e.g., attaching component <b>130</b> to the back surface of internal platform <b>140</b>, and component <b>132</b> to the front surface of internal platform <b>140</b>). Internal platform <b>140</b> can be coupled to outer periphery member <b>120</b> using any suitable approach, including for example using snaps, fasteners, flexures, welds, glue, or combinations of these. Alternatively, internal platform <b>140</b> may even be part of the outer periphery member (e.g., machined, extruded, or cast, or integrally formed as a single unit).

In some cases, the internal platform, outer periphery member or both can include one or more openings for coupling components located in the front and back regions. The size of each region can be selected based on any suitable criteria, including for example operational needs of system, numbers and types of electrical components in the device, manufacturing constraints of the internal platform, or combinations of these. The internal platform can be constructed as a distinct component constructed from any suitable material (e.g., plastic, metal or both), or instead defined from an existing electronic device component placed within the volume defined by the outer periphery member. For example, the internal platform can be formed by a printed circuit board or chip used by the device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments internal platform <b>140</b> and/or opening <b>122</b> can include one or more electrically conductive elements for providing electrical connections between the components.

Front and back cover assemblies <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> can be flush, recessed or protruding relative to the front and back surfaces of outer periphery member <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, one or both of front and back cover assemblies <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> can include delicate or fragile components. To protect the components from damage during use or when dropped, one or both of the cover assemblies can be flush or sub-flush relative to the outer periphery member to prevent edges from engaging other surfaces. Alternatively, the one or more of the cover assemblies can be &#x201c;proud&#x201d; (i.e., protrude above the edge of the outer peripheral member). In some embodiments, one or both of front cover assembly <b>150</b> and back cover assembly <b>160</b> can include one or more display regions through which one or more display devices can be viewed.

For example, portions of the electronic device housing can have at least 75% of its exterior as glass. In one implementation, one or both of the cover assemblies can be glass while side surface are some material other than glass (e.g., metal, plastic).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the housing a portable electronic device can be banged or rub against various surfaces. When plastic or metal housing surfaces are used, the surfaces can tend to become scratched. On the other hand, glass housing surfaces (e.g., glass cover assemblies) can be more scratch resistant. Moreover, glass housing surfaces can offer radio transparency, while metal housing surfaces can disturb or hinder radio communications. In one embodiment, an electronic device housing can use glass housing members (e.g., glass cover assemblies) for a front surface and a back surface of the electronic device housing. For example, a front surface formed from a glass housing member can be transparent to provide visual access to a display device positioned behind the glass housing member at the front surface, while a back surface formed from a glass housing member can be transparent or non-transparent. Non-transparency, if desired, can conceal any interior components within the electronic device housing. In one embodiment, a surface coating or film can be applied to the glass housing member to provide non-transparency or at least partial translucency. Such a surface coating or film can be provided on an inner surface or an outer surface of the glass housing member.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, one or both of front and back cover assemblies <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> can provide side protection for the front and back members.

The ring-shape of outer periphery member <b>220</b> can enclose volume <b>222</b> in which electronic device components can be assembled and retained. The shape of outer periphery member <b>220</b> can define the boundaries of volume <b>222</b>, and therefore can be determined based on the size and type of components placed within volume <b>222</b>. The boundaries of volume <b>222</b> (e.g., determined by the shape of outer periphery member <b>220</b>) can have any suitable shape, including for example a substantially rectangular shape (e.g., having straight or rounded edges or corners), a circular shape, an oval shape, a polygonal shape, or any other closed shape that can define a volume.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Outer periphery member <b>220</b> can have any suitable size, which can be determined based on any suitable criteria (e.g., aesthetics or industrial design, structural considerations, components requires for a desired functionality, or product design). The outer periphery member can have any suitable cross-section, including for example a variable cross-section or a constant cross-section. In some embodiments, the cross-section of the ring can be selected based on desired structural properties for the outer periphery member.

For example, the width of the outer periphery member can be 3 mm and the width of the internal member can be 50 mm. In some embodiments, the height of the internal platform can be related to the width of the outer periphery member. For example, the width of the outer periphery member can be 1 to 8 times the height of the internal platform, such as 2 to 6 times or approximately 4 times the height of the internal platform. In one implementation, the height of the internal platform can be approximately 0.7 mm and the width of the outer periphery member can be approximately 2.5 mm.

The force F<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, can be applied at various points on an opposing surface of the outer housing member <b>504</b>. For example, in this arrangement, a top surface of the outer housing member <b>504</b> can be pressed against a surface of the planar reference surface <b>502</b>, and the force F<b>1</b> can be induced on a bottom surface of the outer housing member <b>504</b>. The force F<b>1</b> can be applied as a single structure (e.g., spring) or be a plurality of structures (e.g., series of springs). The use of a plurality of springs can provide more uniform application of force across the surface of the outer housing member <b>504</b>.

These members of the electronic device housing can be secured together in a variety of different ways. For example, these members can be held together by an adhesive, such as glue or epoxy, which can remained biased against the planar reference surface <b>502</b> while the adhesive cures.

In one embodiment, the protective side members are to be strong; hence, a structurally strengthened polymer, such as polyarylamide, can be utilized. The polyarylamide can be strengthened by containing glass fibers. One source of strengthened polyarylamide is Ixef polyarylamide (PARA) from Solvay Advanced Polymers, L.L.C which can contain glass fiber reinforcement. Additionally, since the protective side members are tightly adjacent sides of the outer housing member, the respective materials used for the protective side members and the outer housing member. Specifically, the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the respective materials, if not controlled, can produce undesired stress on the sides of the outer housing member. For example, with an outer housing member of glass, its CTE is about 10 millimeters/meter/.degree. C. Hence, ideally, for this example the CTE of the material for the protective side members would be about 10 millimeters/meter/.degree. C. Although plastics tend to have CTE's (e.g., roughly 100 millimeters/meter/.degree. C.) that are dramatically higher than that of glass, some manufactured polymers, such as polyarylamide, can have CTE's (e.g., roughly 30 millimeters/meter/.degree. C.) that are substantially closer to that of glass and thereby would, if used, induce less stress on the sides of the outer housing member. For example, in one embodiment, a manufactured polymer for such use could have a CTE less than or equal to about 50 millimeters/meter/.degree. C., and in another embodiment, a manufactured polymer for such use could have a CTE less than or equal to about 35 millimeters/meter/.degree. C. Also, as noted above, the thickness of the protective side member can be thin, for example, the thickness can be not more than about 1 mm in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In still other embodiments, the protective side materials can be formed from multiple materials that can be alternated, intertwined or layered. The later of material against the edges of the outer housing member of glass can have a CTE relatively close to that of glass while an outer layer can have a higher CTE can permit a greater range of material, such as polymers (e.g., plastics).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The protective side members are able to be thin yet be cosmetically unintrusive.

However, these thicknesses are exemplary and vary with the size of the electronic device housing and with desired strength. Using a strengthened material for the protective side members as noted above can also be advantageous. Nevertheless, the provisioning of thin protective side members for outer housing members, such as glass covers, facilitates providing portable electronic device housings that are compact and thin yet resistant to side impact damage to the outer housing members.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b></figref> are structurally similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B and <b>10</b></figref>, respectively.

In these embodiments, the protective side members are rounded at corners of the electronic device housing. For example, in some embodiments, the thickness (t<b>3</b>) for the protective side member can be less than 5 mm (e.g., 1 mm). Also, in some embodiments, the thickness (t<b>4</b>) of the outer housing member can be less than 5 mm (e.g., 1 mm). However, these thicknesses are exemplary and vary with the size of the electronic device housing and with desired strength.

The glass assembly, namely, the outer glass member, can thus operate as an outer surface for the electronic device housing. Following the block <b>1306</b>, the outer member assembly process <b>1300</b> can end.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one embodiment, the outer glass member can represent a front (or top) surface of the electronic device housing.

In still another embodiment, the electronic device housing may utilize an outer glass member for a front surface of the electronic device housing and may utilize an outer glass member for a back surface of the electronic device housing.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">As discussed above, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, an electronic device housing can be substantially made of glass. For example, an electronic device housing might have at least 75% of its exterior as glass. In one implementation, front and bottom surfaces of an electronic device housing can be glass while side surface are some material other than glass (e.g., metal, plastic).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the case of portable electronic devices, housings are banged against or rub against various surfaces. When plastic or metal housing surfaces are used, the surfaces tend to become scratched. On the other hand, with glass housing surfaces (e.g., glass covers), the surfaces are much more scratch resistant. Moreover, glass housing surfaces offer radio transparency, while metal housing surfaces disturb or hinder radio communications. In one embodiment, an electronic device housing can use glass housing members (e.g., glass covers) for a front surface and a back surface of the electronic device housing. For example, a front surface formed from a glass housing member can be transparent to provide visual access to a display device positioned behind the glass housing member at the front surface, while a back surface formed from a glass housing member can be transparent or non-transparent. Non-transparency, if desired, can conceal any interior components within the electronic device housing. In one embodiment, a surface coating or film can be applied to the glass housing member to provide non-transparency or at least partial translucency. Such a surface coating or file can be provided on an inner surface or an outer surface of the glass housing member. The protective side members and the interface members discussed herein can be optionally used to protect and/or assembly the glass housing members.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a side view of a partial side portion of an electronic device housing <b>1400</b>.

The cover portion may generally include a frame (e.g., interface member) into which a glass member has been inserted. Attachment members (e.g., arms, tabs) can be coupled to, e.g., insert molded into, a cover portion, and can be arranged to substantially engage with a housing portion such that the cover portion is effectively held against the housing portion.

Bracket <b>2164</b>, which may be formed from a metal, may be welded to a surface, e.g., an interior surface, of housing <b>2112</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">A compliant snap <b>2168</b> is formed in bracket <b>2164</b>, and is configured to engage with tab <b>2160</b> when tab <b>2160</b> is inserted through an opening <b>2172</b>, e.g., a &#x201c;doghouse&#x201d; snap opening,&#x201d; defined by bracket <b>2164</b> and an interior surface of housing <b>2112</b>. A compressive force is generally applied by compliant snap <b>2168</b> against tab <b>2160</b> to secure tab <b>2160</b> within opening <b>2172</b> and, thus, to hold cover <b>2108</b> substantially against housing <b>2112</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a process flow diagram which illustrates a method of creating a device that includes a cover piece having an insert molded tab and a housing having a bracket configured to accommodate the tab, as for example described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, in accordance with one embodiment. A method <b>2201</b> of creating a device that includes a cover piece which is mounted to a housing a coupling that includes a tab and a bracket begins at step <b>2205</b> in which brackets, i.e., brackets which include a snap component, can be welded around the perimeter of the sides of a housing. Brackets may, for example, be same or similar to bracket <b>2164</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. Any number of brackets may generally be welded around the perimeter of the sides of a housing. By way of example, ten brackets may be welded around the perimeter of the housing. It should be appreciated that brackets may also be attached to the housing methods other than welding.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Once brackets are welded or, more generally, attached to the perimeter of the sides of the housing, tabs or hooks can be insert molded to cover support in step <b>2209</b>. Then, in step <b>2213</b>, a glass piece is coupled to the cover support to form an overall cover part. In one embodiment, the cover support may be a frame within which the glass piece may be secured. Any suitable method may typically be used to couple the glass piece to the cover piece.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">After the overall cover part is formed, process flow moves to step <b>2217</b> in which internal components are placed within an interior volume defined within the housing. The internal components generally include, but are not limited to including, electronic components. The overall cover part is assembled against the housing in step <b>2221</b> such that the tabs in the cover piece are substantially inserted through doghouse openings in the brackets welded to the housing. When tabs are inserted through doghouse openings, complaint snaps of the brackets may engage the tabs to hold the overall cover part against the housing. Upon assembling the overall cover part against the housing such that tabs go through doghouse openings in brackets, the method of creating a device is completed.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Although only a few embodiments of the invention have been described, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present invention. By way of example, a cover has generally been described as being removably coupled to a housing. Screws may be unscrewed to remove a cover from a housing, snaps may be disengaged from a midplate, and tabs may be disengaged from a snap. The ability to substantially disengage or decouple a cover from a housing may enable maintenance and repairs to be performed on components held by the housing. In some embodiments, however, cover may be substantially irremovably coupled to a housing.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">While a cover has generally been described as including a cover support (e.g., frame) to which a glass member is attached, it should be appreciated that the cover itself may be a glass member. In an embodiment in which the cover itself is a glass member, attachment features such as tabs and snaps may be glued directly to the glass member or indirectly to the glass member. When attachment features are glued indirectly to the glass member, the attachment features may be insert molded into pieces of plastic, and the pieces of plastic may be glued or otherwise attached to the glass member.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, the side of a housing which is associated with the engagement of a tab of a cover part is not the same as the side of the housing which interfaces with, e.g., comes substantially into contact with, the cover part. That is, the side of a housing that is used to engage a cover is different from the side or surface of the housing that is substantially sealed against the cover. It should be appreciated that in lieu of the housing substantially being sealed against the cover when the housing engages the cover, there may instead be a gap between the housing and the cover. In one embodiment, a material such as a compliant material may be placed in the gap between the housing and the cover.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Any number of coupling arrangements that allow a cover to be mounted to a housing may generally be included in an electronic device. Coupling arrangements are generally arranged along an interior periphery of an electronic device, and the number of coupling arrangements in an electronic device may be dependent upon factors including, but not limited to including, the size of the electronic device and the space available in the interior of the electronic device. In one embodiment, between approximately ten and approximately twenty coupling arrangements may be included in an electronic device. It should be appreciated, however, that fewer than ten and more than twenty coupling arrangements may generally be included in an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Optical Lens Formation</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to still another aspect, an optical lens can be formed from a formed optical adhesive. The optical lens can, for example, be used as a lens for a camera flash of a portable electronic device. A mold can be used to form a lens from an optical adhesive that can be cured while being molded. For example, the optical adhesive can be a liquid adhesive that can be cured by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In one embodiment, a mold (e.g., steel mold) having a lens configuration can be applied to the uncured optical adhesive, and then UV radiation applied to cure the optical adhesive. Once cured, the mold can be removed and the optical lens has been formed. In one particular embodiment, the optical lens can be formed on an inner surface of a glass housing member for a portable electronic device, and the curing of the optical adhesive to form the optical lens can be performed by UV radiation that is directed to the optical adhesive through the glass housing member. In another particular embodiment, the optical lens can be formed on an optical substrate (e.g., clear plastic carrier), and then the optical substrate can later be mounted in a portable electronic device, such as on an inner surface of a glass housing member for the portable electronic device.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In one embodiment, the portable electronic device having the optical lens formed from the optical adhesive can be configured to include a housing surface that has at least an opening or transparent portion. The portable electronic device can also include a camera and a camera flash light element for producing light. The optical lens receives at least a portion of light produced by the camera flash light element, and directs the received light through the opening or transparent portion of the housing surface. The optical lens can be formed from an optical adhesive that is molded and cured into a predetermined lens configuration.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Cover Assembly Structure and Assembly</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0168">According to still another aspect, a cover assembly, such as a back cover assembly, can be configured to support and protect an outer glass member. The cover assembly can form part of a housing for an electronic device. The cover assembly can also include a distinct glass lens, attachment members, and structural support.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>C</figref> illustrate perspective diagrams of a back cover assembly <b>2300</b> according to one embodiment.

The interface member <b>2302</b> provides a support structure that can be secured to a base housing. In one embodiment, the interface member <b>2302</b> can be removably secured to the base housing.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The back cover assembly <b>2300</b> can be secured to the base housing in any of a variety of ways. In the embodiment of the interface member <b>2302</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, the interface member <b>2302</b> includes one or more tabs <b>2306</b> and one or more hooks <b>2308</b>. The one or more tabs <b>2306</b> and the one or more hooks <b>2308</b> are used to secure the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> to the base housing, such as the outer periphery member <b>220</b> discussed above. The one or more hooks <b>2308</b> can include threaded openings (e.g., holes) that can receive attachment screws, which serve to firmly secure the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> to the base housing (e.g., the outer periphery member <b>220</b>). The attachment screws can prevent removal of the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> from the base housing. However, by removal of the attachment screws, the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> can then be removed.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The glass member <b>2304</b> is a thin glass sheet that is configured to fit within a recess provided by the interface member <b>2302</b>. In one embodiment, while within the recess, the sides (e.g., edges) of the glass member <b>2304</b> can be protected by protective side structural members. A glass piece <b>2310</b> and an optical barrier <b>2312</b> can be coupled to the glass member <b>2304</b>. The glass piece <b>2310</b> can be provided for an image acquisition device (e.g., camera) that is provided within the base housing for the electronic device. The glass piece <b>2310</b> is separate from the glass member <b>2304</b>. The glass piece <b>2310</b> can also provide different optical properties than those of the glass member <b>2304</b>. For example, the glass piece <b>2310</b> may (itself or via a coating) provide optical filtering (e.g., infrared filtering) or magnification. In other words, the glass piece <b>2310</b> can act as a lens, a filter or both.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The size, dimensions and materials for the components of the housing for the electronic device can vary with different embodiments. In the case of portable electronic devices, the thickness of the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> (excluding the one or more tabs <b>2306</b> and the one or more hooks <b>2308</b>) can be about 5 millimeters or less. For thin, portable electronic devices (such as handheld electronic devices), the thickness of the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> (excluding the one or more tabs <b>2306</b> and the one or more hooks <b>2308</b>) can be about 2 millimeters or less millimeters. Moreover, the thickness of the glass member <b>2304</b> can be about 1 millimeter or less. For example, the thickness of the glass of the glass member <b>2304</b> can be about 0.3 to 0.6 micrometers. The glass member <b>2304</b> is glass (e.g., alumina silicate or soda lime glass). However, in alternative embodiments, the glass member <b>2304</b> could be replaced by a member that is made (in whole or in part) of metal, ceramic and/or plastic material.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear perspective diagram for the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> according to one embodiment. The interface member <b>2302</b> primarily extends around a periphery of the back cover assembly <b>2300</b>. The interface member <b>2302</b> can be made from a polymer. The interface member <b>2302</b> illustrates a lens holder <b>2314</b> to secure the glass piece <b>2310</b> to the interface member <b>2302</b>. The interface member <b>2302</b> can also include a reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> that serves to strengthen the interface member <b>2302</b>. The reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> can be formed of metal, such as stainless steel. The reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> is a separate piece from an outer periphery support portion <b>2318</b>. The reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> can be secured to the outer periphery support portion <b>2318</b>. For example, the reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> can be inserted into the outer periphery support portion <b>2318</b> had held in place with slots and/or tabs. As another example, the outer periphery portion <b>2318</b> can be insert molded around portions of the reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> to secure the reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> to the outer periphery boundary <b>2318</b>. Additionally, in one embodiment, the one or more tabs <b>2306</b> and/or the one or more hooks <b>2308</b> can be strengthened by features of the reinforcement plate <b>2316</b>.

The assembly of the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> can provide the interface member <b>2302</b> having the outer periphery support portion <b>2318</b> secured or integral thereto. A layer of adhesive <b>2320</b> can be provided between the reinforcement plate <b>2316</b> and the interface member <b>2302</b>. The layer of adhesive <b>2320</b> can be applied as a film, spray, tape or coating. Besides the layer of adhesive <b>2320</b>, liquid adhesive can also be deposited in certain areas where the layer of adhesive <b>2320</b> is not present. The glass member <b>2304</b> can be pressed against the layer of adhesive <b>2320</b> (and liquid adhesive) so that the glass member <b>2304</b> can be attached to the interface member <b>2302</b>. Specifically, the glass member <b>2304</b> once aligned and attached to the interface member <b>2302</b> is not only secured thereto but also has its sides (edges) protected by the outer periphery support portion <b>2318</b>. By adhering the glass member <b>2304</b> to a substantial amount of its surface area, the glass member <b>2404</b> is reliably secured, such that in the event of breakage of the glass member <b>2304</b>, pieces of the glass member <b>2304</b> will remain secured to the adhesive and this the back cover assembly <b>2300</b>.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Additionally, a back cover assembly can also include one or more features to facilitate image acquisition. In one embodiment, the back cover assembly <b>2300</b> can also include an opening <b>2322</b> in the interface member <b>2302</b> for image acquisition components. Within the base housing there can be provided an image acquisition device (generally, denoted as a camera), and the opening <b>2322</b> in the interface member <b>2302</b> can be aligned with the position of the image acquisition device. Additionally, the glass member <b>2304</b> can include an opening <b>2324</b> for receiving the glass piece <b>2310</b> as well as the lens holder <b>2314</b> that contains glass piece <b>2310</b>. An adhesive ring <b>2326</b> can be imposed between the lens holder <b>2314</b> and the rear side of the glass member <b>2304</b> such that the adhesive ring <b>2326</b> is disposed around the opening <b>2324</b> so as to secure the lens holder <b>2314</b> against the rear side of the glass member <b>2304</b>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates an assembly diagram for the glass member <b>2304</b> according to one embodiment. Although the glass member <b>2304</b> is primarily a glass component form from a piece of glass <b>2400</b>, other components or materials can be adhered to the piece of glass <b>2400</b> to make it better suited for its intended use as a back cover portion of housing for an electronic device. Specifically, physical vapor deposition (PVD) of metal (e.g., aluminum) can provide marking on the piece of glass <b>2400</b>. The marking can include graphic (e.g., logos) <b>2404</b> or text <b>2406</b>. In this embodiment, the marking can be provided on an inside surface of the piece of glass <b>2400</b>. The glass member <b>2304</b> can also include a masking layer <b>2408</b>. The masking layer <b>2408</b> can also be provided on the inside surface of the piece of glass <b>2400</b>. The masking layer <b>2408</b> can color the otherwise translucent glass of the piece of glass <b>2400</b>. The masking layer <b>2408</b> can render the glass member opaque so as to obscure or hide the appearance of components behind the piece of glass <b>2400</b>. Because the marking and the masking layer <b>2408</b> are on the inside surface of the piece of glass <b>2400</b>, they are protected by the piece of glass <b>2400</b> and this unlikely to be damaged during use.
