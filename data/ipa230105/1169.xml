level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Checkpoint inhibitors are a form of cancer therapy that directly affect the functioning of the immune system of the patient. Immune system checkpoints can be either stimulatory or inhibitory, and some cancers are known to affect these checkpoints to prevent the immune system from attacking them. As such, checkpoint inhibitors can block these inhibitory checkpoints thereby restoring proper immune system function. Examples of checkpoints include, but are not limited to, CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1. Some checkpoint inhibitors that are currently approved by the FDA include, but are not limited to, ipilimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Yervoy&#xae;, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Delaware), nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Opdivo&#xae;, Bristol-Myers Squibb), pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Keytruda&#xae;, Merck Sharp &#x26; Dohme, New Jersey), and atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Tecentriq&#xae;, Genentech, Inc., Delaware). As used herein, the term checkpoint inhibitor encompasses therapeutic agents that are used to modulate the activity of an immune system checkpoint.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Side effects of targeting molecules of the immune system include immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs). Accordingly, there is need to develop dosing regimens or methods that maintain a therapeutically effective dose of the therapeutic agent in a patient while reducing the overall patient exposure to the therapeutic agent, thereby reducing or minimizing irAEs in such patient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a method of treating cancer in a patient.

The present disclosure also relates to devices and systems described herein configured for lymphatic delivery of an effective amount of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent. As described herein, advantages of the methods disclosed herein using the lymphatic administration of these immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors include, inter alia, reducing systemic exposure to the therapeutic agent, and maximizing delivery of the therapeutic agent to tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) where tumor antigens (Ags) are present, as well as maximizing delivery of the therapeutic agent to tumors.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a form of cancer immunotherapy. The therapy targets immune checkpoints, key regulators of the immune system that when stimulated can dampen the immune response to an immunologic stimulus. Some cancers can protect themselves from attack by stimulating immune checkpoint targets. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy can block inhibitory checkpoints, restoring immune system function.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The terms &#x201c;anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent&#x201d; and &#x201c;anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent&#x201d; as used herein refer to any molecule that is capable of inhibiting an immune checkpoint function of PD-1 and/or PD-L1, respectively. The anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agents of the present disclosure include, without limitation, molecules capable of binding to and inhibiting an immune checkpoint function of PD-1 and/or PD-L1, respectively, such as antibodies, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, fully human antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, IgG1 antibodies, IgG2 antibodies, IgG3 antibodies, IgG4 antibodies, antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), and bi-specific antibodies. The anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agents of the present disclosure also include, without limitation, other types of molecules capable of binding to and inhibiting an immune checkpoint function of PD-1 and/or PD-L1, respectively, such as polypeptides or proteins, including without limitation, human polypeptides or proteins, humanized polypeptides or proteins, or humanized polypeptides or proteins, and fusion proteins or fusion polypeptides, or small molecule inhibitors.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Immunotherapies are typically administered intravenously (i.v.). For example, both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies are typically administered i.v. and have been shown to induce anti-tumor responses in patients with cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinomas. Because anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy is associated with lower response rates and higher rates of severe Grade 3-4 toxicities than anti-PD-1 monotherapy, anti-PD-1 monotherapy has become the preferred immunotherapy therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Yet even for immunogenic melanoma, only 50% of patients are responsive to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. For these patients, combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies have been shown to have complementary activity of up to 50-60% response rates in advanced Stage III or IV melanoma, but disappointingly, they act synergistically to amplify immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and severe toxicity in up to 60% of all patients. Using analysis of outcome data from the CheckMate-067 trial, Oh, et al. argue that the elevated costs associated with irAEs due to anti-CTLA-4 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody render it cost-ineffective despite the benefits of improved disease-free survival in responsive cancers. Maximizing exposure of anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agents in TDLNs where cytotoxic T cells are activated against tumor Ags may improve anti-tumor responses, as well as minimize dose dependent irAEs.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In embodiments described herein, lymphatic delivery of checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agents may improve anti-tumor responses and alleviate irAEs in patients with cancers over that currently treated by conventional i.v. infusion.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">PD-1 is expressed by T-cells in TDLNs and additionally PD-L1 is expressed by tumors to tolerize and limit T cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, in some embodiments, lymphatic delivery of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may selectively remove mechanisms for inducing tolerance to tumor Ags within the TDLN or inhibition of T-cells by the tumors. In some embodiments, since lymph ultimately empties in the blood circulation, lymphatic delivery may also remove tolerance acquisition at peripheral LNs and other tumor sites, such as secondary tumor sites.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, due to enhanced exposure to drug targets, lymphatic delivery may allow a reduction of dose and may reduce dose-dependent irAEs that limit clinical use of anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agents.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Lymph nodes (LNs) are part of the open, unidirectional lymphatic vasculature. Lymph nodes contain both T and B lymphocytes in addition to other cells associated with the immune system. The entry point for capillary filtrate, macromolecules, and immune cells is at the &#x201c;initial&#x201d; lymphatics that (i) lie immediately below the epidermis, (ii) surround the periphery of all organs, and (iii) can be formed at the tumor periphery through the process of tumor lymphangiogenesis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). These &#x201c;initial lymphatics&#x201d; are immature capillaries without a basement membrane and with loose endothelial cell tight junctions that open and close to uniquely allow entry of waste materials and immune cells. From the initial lymphatics, lymph drains through mature, conducting lymphatic vessels that consist of a series of vessel segments bounded by valves and lined with smooth muscle cells that contract to actively propel lymph (often against gravity) to regional LN basins. Following transport through chains of downstream LNs via afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels, lymph is deposited into the blood vasculature via the subclavian vein. Monoclonal antibody access to the regional lymphatics following i.v. administration can occur through the high endothelial venules (HEVs) of LNs that are exclusive entryways for na&#xef;ve T and B cell entry. In addition, antibodies that have extravasated from the blood vasculature may also be taken up by initial lymphatics for delivery to regional LNs. However, because lymph drains into the blood vasculature, comparatively large i.v. doses may be needed to reach drug targets associated with tumor Ags presentation within tumor draining LNs (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> inset A). Systemic i.v. administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent can also result in activated na&#xef;ve-T cells in non-tumor draining LNs where non-tumor, self Ags rather than tumor Ags are presented (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, inset B), and may lead to irAEs.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Administration of biologics directly into the lymphatics is challenging, with intradermal (i.d.) or Mantoux administration offering the most accessible entry point into the initial lymphatics below the epidermis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Unfortunately, the small sub-epidermal volume can accommodate &#x2dc;100 &#x3bc;L and &#x2dc;50 &#x3bc;L of injected fluid in humans and in rodent models, respectively, which limits the therapeutic dose of lymphatically delivered biologics in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Deeper, subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) administration below the sub-epidermal space is inefficiently taken up by initial lymphatics and has reduced bioavailability due to off-target drug uptake and cellular processing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Many medical conditions benefit from having a steady state concentration of the active therapeutic agents for an extended period of time. Lymphatic delivery apparatuses are capable of administering therapeutic agents at a substantially constant rate over an extended period of time. Some devices are capable of delivering a therapeutic agent directly into the lymphatic system of a patient. One such device is the SOFUSA&#xae; (Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. Corporation, Delaware) drug delivery platform. SOFUSA&#xae; is a nanotopography-based lymphatic delivery system. In one embodiment, the SOFUSA&#xae; lymphatic infusion device includes a single-use, 66 mm<sup>2 </sup>array of 100 microneedles of 110 &#x3bc;m diameter, 350 &#x3bc;m long, and with a 30 &#x3bc;m hole located off-center (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). A 6-micron polyether ketone nanotopographical film heat-formed over each microneedle provides the nanotopographical features. These features have been shown to reversibly remodel tight junction proteins initiated via integrin binding to the nanotopography structures potentially augmenting uptake into the initial lymphatics. In both animals and humans, the device is first affixed via adhesive onto the tissue site of infusion, and then a calibrated applicator pushes the microneedle array into the sub-epidermal space where the initial lymphatics are located. A calibrated syringe pump then delivers drug into the microfluidic chamber, through the microneedle array, and into the sub-epidermal space in volumes not otherwise achievable through i.d injections (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">SOFUSA&#xae; infuses drug within the sub-epidermis space and therefore accesses capillaries of both the hemovascular and lymphovascular systems. Many factors including size, composition, dose, surface charge, and molecular weight affect uptake into lymphatic and/or blood capillaries. For example, large particles, immune cells, and macromolecules are primarily taken up by lymphatic capillaries, while small particles and molecules less than 20 kDa can be absorbed by blood capillary networks. Glycocalyx on the luminal sides of blood vessels and capillaries is responsible for a force opposing capillary pressure and inhibits re-absorption of fluid into the venous vasculature. Thus, while the blood capillaries are intact and comparatively impermeable in the sub-epidermal space, the &#x201c;initial lymphatics&#x201d; represent immature capillaries without a basement membrane. They have &#x201c;loose&#x201d; lymphatic endothelial cell tight junctions that open and close via fibrils to uniquely allow entry of macromolecules, waste products, and immune cells. It has been estimated that as much as 12 liters of capillary filtrate (carrying small solutes and macromolecules) is collected from peripheral tissues by the initial lymphatics and returned to the blood vasculature. Because lymph drains to the blood vasculature, pharmacokinetic profiling in serum provides a measure of effectiveness of delivery through the lymphatics to the blood vasculature.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Metastasis is thought to be directly or indirectly responsible for more than 90% of all cancer deaths, and the lymphatic system is thought to play a significant role in cancer metastasis. Malignant cells may enter the lymphatic system and are captured by lymph nodes where secondary tumors can be produced. The lymphatic system is also often involved in the spread of tumors to other parts of the body (i.e., metastasis). Consequently, there is need for a method of preventing or reducing the spread of malignant cells via the lymphatic system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the methods disclosed herein, two different exemplary modes for delivering an anti-PD-1 or an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to a patient are envisioned. In one mode, the target for the therapeutic agent is clearly identified, and the device comprising a plurality of microneedles is placed such that the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is administered to the lymphatic system of the patient so that the therapeutic agent is carried by the lymph vessels directly to that target. The target may be, for example, a solid tumor. In this case, while some systemic exposure will occur, the administration is much more regionalized.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the second mode, the therapeutic target or exact location of the target may be unknown or less clearly defined. In such case, delivery of the therapeutic agent is into the lymphatic system of the patient, and the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is intended to traverse the lymphatic system to either the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The therapeutic agent then enters the circulatory system of the patient leading to systemic exposure to the agent. For example, if a solid tumor has metastasized, the location of secondary sites for these cancer cells may not be known. Although the therapeutic agent may traverse certain lymph nodes before reaching either of the draining ducts, the administration is considered to result in systemic exposure. As such, one skilled in the art can apply methods disclosed herein to provide targeted, regional administration of a therapeutic agent or more widespread systemic administration. A medical professional can determine which mode of administration is appropriate for an individual patient being treated with an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent and place the device or devices accordingly.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some aspects, the therapeutic target is a lymph node, a lymph vessel, an organ that is part of the lymphatic system or a combination thereof. In some aspects, the therapeutic target is a lymph node. In some aspects, the therapeutic target is a specific lymph node as described elsewhere herein. In certain embodiments, the target is a tumor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, delivery of the therapeutic agent to the lymphatic system is delivery into the vessels of the lymphatic vasculature, the lymph nodes as described elsewhere herein, or both. In some aspects, delivery is to the superficial lymph vessels. In yet another aspect, delivery is to one or more lymph nodes. The specific target for delivery will be based on the medical needs of the patient.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, one or more devices described herein may be used to administer the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to a patient. In patients where more than one device is used to deliver the therapeutic agent to a plurality of locations on the body of a patient, the overall dose of the therapeutic agent at each location must be carefully adjusted such that the patient receives a therapeutically effective combined dose of the therapeutic agent. Being able to more selectively target specific locations in or on the body of a patient more precisely may mean that a lower dose is required at each specific location. In some embodiments, the dose administered to target one or more locations on the body of a patient is lower than a dose administered by other routes, including intravenous and subcutaneous administration.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may be administered to one or more lymph nodes. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may be administered to one or more lymph vessels. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may be administered to lymph vessels that are proximal to a tumor. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may be administered to lymph vessels that are distal to a tumor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Because the lymph fluid circulates throughout the body of a patient in a similar manner to blood in the circulatory system, any single position in the lymphatic vasculature can be upstream or downstream relative to another position. As used herein in reference to the lymphatic vasculature, the term &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refers to a position in the lymphatic system closer (as the fluid travels through the vessels in a patient) to either the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct relative to the reference position (e.g., a tumor or internal organ or a joint). As used herein, the term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; refers to a position in the lymphatic system that is farther from the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct relative to the reference position. Because the direction of fluid flow in the lymphatic system can be impaired or reversed due to the medical condition of the patient, the terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; do not specifically refer to the direction of fluid flow in the patient undergoing medical treatment. They are positional terms based on their physical position relative to the draining ducts as described.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent, such as an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is delivered to the interstitium of the patient, e.g., to a space between the skin and one or more internal structures, such as an organ, muscle, or vessel (artery, vein, or lymph vessel), or any other spaces within or between tissues or parts of an organ. In still yet another embodiment, the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is delivered to both the interstitium and the lymphatic system. In embodiments where the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is delivered to the interstitium of the patient, it may not be necessary to locate the lymph nodes or lymphatic vasculature of the patient before administering the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, a method of treating cancer in a patient is described. The method includes placing a device comprising a plurality of microneedles on the skin of the patient proximate to a first position under the skin of the patient, wherein the first position is proximate to lymph vessels and/or lymph capillaries in the patient's lymphatic system, and wherein the microneedles have a surface comprising nanotopography. The method also includes inserting the plurality of microneedles into the patient to a depth whereby at least the epidermis is penetrated and an end of at least one of the microneedles is proximate to the first position, and administering via the plurality of microneedles to the first position an effective amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or an effective amount of an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, thereby treating the cancer. In some embodiments, the present disclosure also relates to devices and/or systems described herein configured for lymphatic delivery of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, wherein the device and/or system comprises an amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent effective for treating cancer in a patient.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, a method of preventing or reducing cancer metastasis in a patient is described. The method includes locating at least one lymph node in the patient that intervenes in the lymphatic system between a solid cancer tumor and a draining duct, placing a device comprising a plurality of microneedles on the skin of the patient proximate to a first position under the skin of the patient located between the intervening lymph node and the solid cancer tumor, wherein the first position is proximate to lymph vessels and/or lymph capillaries in the patient's lymphatic system, and wherein the microneedles have a surface comprising nanotopography, inserting the plurality of microneedles into the patient to a depth whereby at least the epidermis is penetrated and an end of at least one of the microneedles is proximate to the first position; and administering via the plurality of microneedles to the first position a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent that is effective for preventing or reducing metastasis of the solid cancer tumor. In some embodiments, the present disclosure also relates to devices and/or systems described herein configured for lymphatic delivery of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, wherein the device and/or system comprises an amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent effective for preventing or reducing cancer metastasis in a patient.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, in some embodiments, a method of preventing or reducing cancer metastasis in a patient is described. The method includes locating a solid cancer tumor in the patient, locating at least one lymph node in the patient that intervenes in the lymphatic system between the solid cancer tumor and a draining duct, placing a device that comprises a plurality of microneedles on the skin of the patient at a first location on the skin of the patient that is proximate to lymph capillaries and/or lymph vessels that flow into the intervening lymph node, wherein the microneedles have a surface comprising nanotopography, inserting the plurality of microneedles into the patient to a depth whereby at least the epidermis is penetrated, and administering via the plurality of microneedles to the lymph capillaries and/or lymph vessels that flow into the intervening lymph node a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent that is effective in preventing or reducing cancer metastasis. In some embodiments, the present disclosure also relates to devices and/or systems described herein configured for lymphatic delivery of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, wherein the device and/or system comprises an amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, effective for preventing or reducing cancer metastasis in a patient.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the cancer comprises a tumor. In some embodiments, the lymph node is a tumor draining lymph node. Tumor draining lymph node refers to a lymph node that is downstream from a solid cancer tumor and is the first lymph node impacted by metastasis of the tumor. The first lymph node affected by metastasis is often referred to as the sentinel lymph node.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Because metastasis can be a systemic issue for a patient rather than just a localized one, in some embodiments the device is placed on the patient to effect systemic delivery of the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, rather than just targeted delivery to an identified lymph node. In some embodiments, the device is placed such that the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is not targeting a specific lymph node, although it may traverse one or more lymph nodes after administration; the device is placed with the expectation that the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent will enter the circulatory system of the patient after traversing the lymphatic vasculature leading to systemic exposure to the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent. This type of administration is intended to treat metastasized cancer cells that have moved past the local environment of the primary solid cancer tumor. Such metastasized cancer cells may not yet be exhibiting symptoms in that new location, but may do so if left untreated.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the device is placed, relative to the tumor, distal to the draining duct. In some embodiments, at least one lymph node in the patient intervenes in the lymphatic system between the tumor and a draining duct, and the first position is located between the intervening lymph node and the tumor. In some embodiments, the device is placed at a location on the skin of the patient having lymphatic capillaries and/or vessels that flow directly into the intervening lymph node without first passing through any prior lymph node.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, disclosed herein is a method for treating a solid cancer tumor in a patient. The method generally comprises locating the solid cancer tumor in the patient; locating a position in the lymphatic system of the patient that is upstream of the solid cancer tumor; placing a device comprising a plurality of microneedles on the skin of the patient proximate to a first position under the skin of the patient located proximate to the position in the lymphatic system of the patient that is upstream of the solid cancer tumor, wherein the first position is proximate to lymph vessels and/or lymph capillaries that are upstream of the solid cancer tumor, and wherein the microneedles have a surface comprising nanotopography; inserting the plurality of microneedles into the patient to a depth whereby at least the epidermis is penetrated; and administering via the plurality of microneedles to the first position a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or an anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, for example that is effective for preventing or reducing metastasis of the solid cancer tumor. In some aspects, the position in the lymphatic system of the patient to which the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is delivered is downstream of the solid cancer tumor. In some embodiments, the present disclosure also relates to devices and/or systems described herein configured for lymphatic delivery of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, wherein the device and/or system comprises an amount of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent effective for treating a solid cancer tumor in a patient.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, administering is done to the lymph vessels upstream to the solid cancer tumor. In other embodiments, administering is done to both the lymph nodes and lymph vessels upstream of the solid cancer tumor. In some aspects, it may not be necessary to locate a lymph node upstream of the tumor before administering the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to the patient. In some embodiments, the device is placed distal to the draining duct relative to the solid cancer tumor. In yet another aspect, the device is proximal to the draining duct relative to the solid cancer tumor.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Because cancer and other medical conditions can damage the lymphatic system of a patient, the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system can be impaired or even reversed (called backflow). This can lead to swelling in the surrounding tissues and organs of the patient. In some aspects, the device is placed such that backflow in the lymphatic system transports the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to the targeted location. For example, in a properly functioning lymphatic system, the downstream position relative to a solid cancer tumor would not transport the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent directly into the tumor. However, in an impaired lymphatic system, backflow from a downstream position relative to the solid cancer tumor would transport the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent directly to the tumor. A medical professional skilled in the art understands the manner by which the lymphatic system functions and will make treatment decisions for the patient based on that knowledge.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some aspects, the device is placed at a location on the skin of the patient such that the lymph vessels and/or capillaries flow directly into a specifically targeted lymph node without first passing through the solid cancer tumor or any other lymph nodes. In this instance, the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, after administration, would enter the lymph vessels of the patient and flow directly into the targeted lymph node. In yet another aspect, there may be lymph nodes between the site of administration and the targeted lymph nodes. One nonlimiting example when this occurs is if the targeted lymph node is deep within the body of the patient and there are no lymph vessels near the skin of the patient that flow directly into the targeted lymph node.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is known that certain types of cancer often metastasize to specific lymph nodes, and the placement of the device may be made on this basis. For example, oral and pharynx cancers, in addition to those of the head and neck, metastasize to the jugular lymph node chain, the cervical lymph nodes and the supraclavicular lymph nodes; many skin cancers (e.g., melanomas) metastasize to the draining axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basins depending on the location of the cancer; breast cancer metastasizes to the axillary, internal mammary and supraclavicular lymph nodes; prostate cancer metastasizes to the lumbar, inguinal and peritoneal lymph nodes; brain and central nervous system cancers metastasize into the jugular, cervical and lumbar lymph nodes; ovarian cancers metastasize to the retroperitoneal (pelvic and/or para-aortic) lymph nodes; cancer in the genitals of a patient metastasize to the lumbar lymph nodes, the inguinal lymph nodes, and the peritoneal lymph nodes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The specific lymph node targeted for delivery of the therapeutic agent is based on any reasonable criteria based on the medical needs and condition of the patient. For example, a lymph node biopsy may be performed to determine if metastatic cancer cells are present in a specific lymph node. Alternatively, a lymph node may be selected based on its location relative to a previously located tumor in the body of a patient. In some embodiments, the lymph node is selected because it is downstream from the solid cancer tumor. Placing the device in a position to target the downstream lymph nodes would affect metastatic cancer cells that are in those lymph nodes and reduce the likelihood of their spreading to other parts of the body. Alternatively, the device may be placed upstream of the tumor in order to take advantage of tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis that often occurs with solid cancer tumors. In this arrangement, the therapeutic agent would flow directly into the tumor thereby more effectively targeting the tumor.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the cancer is a cancer of the head and neck, and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the jugular lymph nodes, the cervical lymph nodes, the supraclavicular lymph nodes, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is an oral cavity cancer, and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the jugular lymph node chain, the cervical lymph nodes, the supraclavicular lymph nodes, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is a cancer of the pharynx, and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the jugular lymph node chain, the cervical lymph nodes, the supraclavicular lymph nodes, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is a melanoma, and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of axillary lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, jugular lymph nodes, cervical lymph nodes, supraclavicular lymph nodes, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is breast cancer, and lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the axillary lymph nodes, the internal mammary lymph nodes, the supraclavicular lymph nodes and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is prostate cancer, and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the lumbar lymph nodes, the inguinal lymph nodes, the peritoneal lymph nodes and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is in the genital system of the patient and the lymph nodes are selected from the group consisting of the lumbar lymph nodes, the inguinal lymph nodes, the peritoneal lymph nodes and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the amount of the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent required to target the metastatic cancer cells or the tumor is lower than the amount given by other routes of administration. A lower dose that is still therapeutically effective may reduce or eliminate side effects leading to a more positive patient outcome.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent may be nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Opdivo&#xae;, Bristol-Myers Squibb), pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Keytruda&#xae;, Merck Sharp &#x26; Dohme, New Jersey), cemiplimab (sold under the tradename of Libtayo&#xae;, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, New York), Spartalizumab (PDR001; Novartis), Camrelizumab (SHR1210; Jiangsu HengRui Medicine Co., Ltd.), Sintilimab (IBI308; Innovent and Eli Lilly), Tislelizumab (BGB-A317; BeiGene and Celgene Corp.), Toripalimab (JS 001; Beijing Cancer Hospital), AMP-224 (GlaxoSmithKline), AMP-514 (GlaxoSmithKline), anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody STI-A1110 (Sorrento Pharmaceuticals), AUNP12 (a 29-mer peptide PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor developed by Aurigene and Laboratoires Pierre Fabre), or a biosimilar thereof, or a bioequivalent thereof.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent may be atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor; sold under the tradename of Tecentriq&#xae;, Genentech, Inc., Delaware), avelumab (sold under the tradename of Bavencio&#xae;, Merck, Germany), durvalumab (sold under the tradename of Imfinzi&#xae;, AstraZeneca, Sweden), KN035 (Alphamab and 3D Medicines), AUNP12 (a 29-mer peptide PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor developed by Aurigene and Laboratoires Pierre Fabre), CA-170 (Aurigene/Curis; a small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor), BMS-986189 (Bristol-Myers Squibb; a macrocyclic peptide), or a biosimilar thereof, or a bioequivalent thereof.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If two or more devices are used, the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent administered to the patient using the two or more devices may be the same or different.

In yet another aspect, two or more devices comprising a plurality of microneedles are used to administer a single anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent. In this case each individual dose administered by each device may be smaller than a therapeutically effective dose, but the combined dose administered by the two or more devices is therapeutically effective.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the methods, devices and/or systems disclosed herein are used to treat solid cancer tumors or treat, reduce or eliminate cancer metastasis, the cancer may be any type susceptible to treatment with an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent.

In some aspects, administering is to a lymph node. In some aspects, administering is to a specific lymph node as described elsewhere herein. In yet another aspect, administering is to lymph vessels that are upstream of and known to flow into specific lymph nodes. In yet another aspect, administering is to lymph vessels that are upstream of and known to flow into a solid cancer tumor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is understood that when multiple doses of an anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent are administered to a patient, each individual dose may not be therapeutically effective, but the combined doses are therapeutically effective. The combined doses that are therapeutically effective may be smaller than a therapeutically effective dose if the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is administered by a different route (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, etc.).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, delivery of the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to the lymphatic system is delivery into the lymphatic vasculature, the lymph nodes as described elsewhere herein, or both. In some aspects, delivery is to the superficial lymph vessels. In yet another aspect, delivery is to one or more lymph nodes. The specific target for delivery will be based on the medical needs of the patient. In one nonlimiting example, if a lymph node biopsy or other medical assessment (e.g., lymph node swelling) is found to be positive for possible metastatic cancer cells, then the device comprising a plurality of microneedles can be placed on the patient such that it delivers the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent directly to the lymph node. In another nonlimiting example, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed where the sentinel lymph nodes are selected based on the type of cancer and the assessment of a medical professional. Alternatively, the device can be placed upstream of the lymph node such that the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent is delivered to the lymph vessels that feed into the targeted lymph node. In some embodiments, two or more devices are used to target two or more different locations in the lymphatic system of the patient. In another nonlimiting example, the device is placed upstream of a solid cancer tumor such that the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent feeds directly into the tumor. In another example, the device is placed directly downstream from a solid cancer tumor such that the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent would traverse the same lymphatic vessels as metastatic cells. In yet another aspect, one device is placed upstream of the solid cancer tumor and a second device is placed downstream of the solid cancer tumor. This would effectively treat both the solid cancer tumor and any possible metastatic cells that have begun to spread in the patient.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal.

In some aspects, the needles are microneedles. In some aspects, the array of needles may comprise between 2 and 50,000 needles with structural means for controlling skin penetration and fluid delivery to the skin (e.g., penetrating and delivering to the skin), see e.g., International Patent Application PCT/US2017/064668 (published as WO 2018/111621 A1), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In some other aspects, the array of needles may further comprise a manufactured random or structured nanotopography on each needle. The needle or needle array may be comprised in a system, such as a system wherein the device is attached to additional components of a therapeutic agent delivery apparatus comprising components such as fluidic delivery rate controls, adhesives for attaching to the skin, fluidic pumps, and the like. If desired, the rate of delivery of the agent may be variably controlled by the pressure-generating means. Desired delivery rates as described herein to the epidermis may be initiated by driving the one or more agents described herein with the application of pressure or other driving means, including pumps, syringes, pens, elastomer membranes, gas pressure, piezoelectric, electromotive, electromagnetic or osmotic pumping, or use of rate control membranes or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments described herein, devices comprising a plurality of microneedles as described herein functions as a permeability enhancer and may increase the delivery of one or more agents through the epidermis. This delivery may occur through modulating transcellular transport mechanisms (e.g., active or passive mechanisms) or through paracellular permeation. Without being bound by any theory, the nanostructured or nanotopography surface may increase the permeability of one or more layers of the viable epidermis, including the epidermal basement membrane by modifying cell/cell tight junctions allowing for paracellular or modifying cellular active transport pathways (e.g., transcellular transport) allowing for diffusion or movement and/or active transport of an administered agent through the viable epidermis and into the underlying viable dermis. This effect may be due to modulation of gene expression of the cell/cell tight junction proteins. As previously mentioned, tight junctions are found within the viable skin and in particular the viable epidermis. The opening of the tight junctions may provide a paracellular route for improved delivery of any agent, such as those that have previously been blocked from delivery through the skin.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Interaction between individual cells and structures of the nanotopography may increase the permeability of an epithelial tissue (e.g., the epidermis) and induce the passage of an agent through a barrier cell and encourage transcellular transport. For instance, interaction with keratinocytes of the viable epidermis may encourage the partitioning of an agent into the keratinocytes (e.g., transcellular transport), followed by diffusion through the cells and across the lipid bilayer again. In addition, interaction of the nanotopography structure and the corneocytes of the stratum corneum may induce changes within the barrier lipids or corneodesmosomes resulting in diffusion of the agent through the stratum corneum into the underlying viable epidermal layers. While an agent may cross a barrier according to paracellular and transcellular routes, the predominant transport path may vary depending upon the nature of the agent.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments described herein, the device may interact with one or more components of the epithelial tissue to increase porosity of the tissue making it susceptible to paracellular and/or transcellular transport mechanisms. Epithelial tissue is one of the primary tissue types of the body. Epithelial tissues that may be rendered more porous may include both simple and stratified epithelium, including both keratinized epithelium and transitional epithelium. In addition, epithelial tissue encompassed herein may include any cell types of an epithelial layer including, without limitation, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, squamous cells, columnar cells, cuboidal cells and pseudostratified cells. Any method for measuring porosity may be used including, but not limited to, any epithelial permeability assay. For example, a whole mount permeability assay may be used to measure epithelial (e.g., skin) porosity or barrier function in vivo see, for example, Indra and Leid., Methods Mol Biol. (763) 73-81, which is incorporated by reference herein for its teachings thereof.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments described herein, the structural changes induced by the presence of a nanotopography surface on a barrier cell are temporary and reversible. It was surprisingly found that using nanostructured nanotopography surfaces results in a temporary and completely reversible increase in the porosity of epithelial tissues by changing junctional stability and dynamics, which, without being bound by any theory, may result in a temporary increase in the paracellular and transcellular transport of an administered agent through the epidermis and into the viable dermis. Thus, in some aspects, the increase in permeability of the epidermis or an epithelial tissue elicited by the nanotopography, such as promotion of paracellular or transcellular diffusion or movement of one or more agents, returns to a normal physiological state that was present before contacting the epithelial tissue with a nanotopography following the removal of the nanotopography. In this way, the normal barrier function of the barrier cell(s) (e.g., epidermal cell(s)) is restored and no further diffusion or movement of molecules occurs beyond the normal physiological diffusion or movement of molecules within the tissue of a subject.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">These reversible structural changes induced by the nanotopography may function to limit secondary skin infections, absorption of harmful toxins, and limit irritation of the dermis. Also, the progressive reversal of epidermal permeability from the top layer of the epidermis to the basal layer may promote the downward movement of one or more agents through the epidermis and into the dermis and prevent back flow or back diffusion of the one or more agents back into the epidermis.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments described herein, are methods for applying a device having a plurality of microneedles to the surface of the skin a subject for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein. In some aspects, the device is applied to an area of the subject's skin, wherein the location of the skin on the body is dense in lymphatic capillaries and/or blood capillaries. Multiple devices may be applied to one or more locations of the skin having a dense network of lymphatic capillaries. In some aspects, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more devices may be applied. These devices may be applied spatially separate or in close proximity or juxtaposed with one another. Exemplary and non-limiting locations dense with lymphatics comprise the palmar surfaces of the hands, the scrotum, the plantar surfaces of the feet and the lower abdomen. The location of the device will be selected based on the medical condition of the patient and the assessment of a medical professional.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments described herein, at least a portion of or all of the therapeutic agent may be directly delivered or administered to an initial depth in the skin comprising the nonviable epidermis and/or the viable epidermis. In some aspects, a portion of therapeutic agent may also be directly delivered to the viable dermis in addition to the epidermis. The range of delivery depth will depend on the medical condition being treated and the skin physiology of a given patient. This initial depth of delivery may be defined as a location within the skin, wherein a therapeutic agent first comes into contact as described herein. Without being bound by any theory, it is thought that the administered agent may move (e.g., diffuse) from the initial site of delivery (e.g., the non-viable epidermis, the viable epidermis, the viable dermis, or the interstitium) to a deeper position within the viable skin. For example, a portion of or all of an administered agent may be delivered to the non-viable epidermis and then continue to move (e.g., diffuse) into the viable epidermis and past the basal layer of the viable epidermis and enter into the viable dermis. Alternatively, a portion of or all of an administered agent may be delivered to the viable epidermis (i.e., immediately below the stratum corneum) and then continue to move (e.g., diffuse) past the basal layer of the viable epidermis and enter into the viable dermis. Lastly, a portion of or all of an administered agent may be delivered to the viable dermis. The movement of the one or more active agents throughout the skin is multifactorial and, for example, depends on the liquid carrier composition (e.g., viscosity thereof), rate of administration, delivery structures, etc. This movement through the epidermis and into the dermis may be further defined as a transport phenomenon and quantified by mass transfer rate(s) and/or fluid mechanics (e.g., mass flow rate(s)).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Thus, in some embodiments described herein, the therapeutic agent may be delivered to a depth in the epidermis wherein the therapeutic agent moves past the basal layer of the viable epidermis and into the viable dermis. In some aspects described herein, the therapeutic agent is then absorbed by one or more susceptible lymphatic capillary plexus then delivered to one or more lymph nodes and/or lymph vessels.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, the device comprises a fluid delivery apparatus, wherein the fluid delivery apparatus comprises: a fluid distribution assembly wherein a cap assembly is coupled to a cartridge assembly, and the cartridge assembly is slidably coupled to a plenum assembly, and a mechanical controller assembly is slidably coupled to the cartridge assembly; a collet assembly constituting the housing of the fluid delivery apparatus and being slidably coupled to the fluid distribution assembly; and a plurality of microneedles fluidically connected with the fluid distribution assembly having a surface comprising nanotopography, the plurality of microneedles being capable of penetrating the stratum corneum of the skin of a patient and controllably delivering the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or the anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to a depth below the surface of the skin.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, the device delivers the anti-PD-1 therapeutic agent or the anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent to a depth below the surface of the skin of from about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 4000 &#x3bc;m, from about 250 &#x3bc;m to about 2000 &#x3bc;m, or from about 350 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m.

Because the thickness of the skin can vary from patient to patient based on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, medical condition, diet, gender, age, body mass index, and body part, the required depth to deliver the therapeutic agent will vary.

The nanotopographical film-microneedle combination has been found to increase permeability through the skin epidermis layer by remodeling tight junction proteins initiated via integrin binding to the nanotopography.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Twenty-four hours prior to SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; administration, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and the dorsal region was shaved and covered with depilatory cream (Nair Sensitive) for 8 minutes. The cream was then wiped off with warm, wet paper towels, followed by alcohol wipes. SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; was then applied to the dorsal region using a plastic shell with a skin adhesive. A hand-held applicator was then placed over the plastic shell to insert the microneedles into the skin. The operation of the device was as follows. The applicator strikes the microneedles with a post traveling at a velocity of 6 m/s. There is a total of 100 microneedles over the area of 66 mm<sup>2</sup>.

The uptake of ICG was monitored using a custom built near-infrared fluorescence imaging system employing a Gen III GaAs intensifier coupled to a sCMOS (Zhu B, Rasmussen J C, Litorja M, Sevick-Muraca E M. Determining the Performance of Fluorescence Molecular Imaging Devices Using Traceable Working Standards With SI Units of Radiance. IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2016; 35:802-11) to visualize delivery to inguinal and axillary LNs, and to quantify lymphatic propulsion and transport of ICG-laden lymph at contralateral sites after intradermal injection. Optimization of device placement and microneedle tissue penetration was performed on the first 8 subjects. In the last four subjects, infusion rates were varied between 0.2-1 mL/h and afterwards, lymphatic propulsion was analyzed from acquired images by counting the number of ICG-laden lymphatic &#x201c;packets&#x201d; that crossed a chosen anatomical landmark. Lymphatic pumping rates resulting from infusion were compared to those from the contralateral locations where ICG was administered intradermally. Contralateral intradermal (i.d.) injections were made using a conventional insulin syringe and 31 gauge needle to deliver 0.1 mL of 0.25 mg/mL ICG solution and were often made following desensitization with cold spray for those volunteers who were sensitive to needle prick. Cold spray was not used for application of the SOFUSA&#xae; infusion device and pain was assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire for each infusion device applied. Up to five different devices were placed on each volunteer for simultaneous infusion.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the first 8 subjects, device placement and microneedle penetration were optimized for infusions on the dorsal aspect of the wrist, lateral aspect of ankles, and medial aspect of calf and could be achieved with less success on the dorsal foot. In subjects of low BMI, the placement on the foot and wrist were often complicated with incomplete penetration of microneedles into the dermis as visualized by ICG leakage and impaired uptake. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows the lymphatic vessels imaged following SOFUSA&#xae; infusions and contralateral i.d. injections in the medial aspect of the calf and the expected symmetry of functional lymphatic vessels that pump ICG-laden lymph to the regional axillary and inguinal LNs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). With subjects sitting upright, it was found that lymphatic pumping rates expectedly ranged between 0.4-3.3 pulses/min, consistent with past work (Tan I C, Maus E A, Rasmussen J C, Marshall M V, Adams K E, Fife C E, et al.

In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the ratio of lymphatic pumping rates resulting from SOFUSA&#xae; infusion to that resulting from i.d. administration also tended to increase with SOFUSA&#xae; infusion rates, but, due to the small sample size, no further analysis or statistical significance could be determined. Further investigation of whether the nanotopographic features on the microneedle array are responsible for the enhanced filling and increased active transport remain will be performed. Interestingly, previous data in animals showed the nanostructured microneedle array devices cumulatively delivered significantly more etanercept than microneedle array devices without nanostructured coating by measuring the appearance of drug in the serum of rats and rabbits (Walsh L, Ryu J, Bock S, Koval M, Mauro T, Ross R, et al. Nanotopography facilitates in vivo lymphatic delivery of high molecular weight therapeutics through an integrin-dependent mechanism. Nano lett. 2015; 15:2434-41). At SOFUSA&#xae; infusion rates of 1 mL/hr, ICG &#x201c;pooling&#x201d; at the infusion site was visualized after removal of the device, indicating that the lymphatic uptake in the initial lymphatics in the sub-epidermal space was slower than the infusion rate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows the transient demarcations of ICG left by the microneedle array immediately after removal.

The average&#xb1;SD VAS pain score for application, infusion, and removal of the SOFUSA&#xae; was 8&#xb1;9, 5&#xb1;8, and 1&#xb1;4, respectively, indicating that the device caused between no pain to mild pain (Jensen M P, Chen C, Brugger A M. Interpretation of visual analog scale ratings and change scores: a reanalysis of two clinical trials of postoperative pain. J Pain. 2003; 4:407-14).

Twenty-four hours prior to SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; administration, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and the dorsal region was shaved and covered with depilatory cream (Nair Sensitive) for 8 minutes. The cream was then wiped off with warm, wet paper towels, followed by alcohol wipes. SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; was then applied to the dorsal region using a plastic shell with a skin adhesive. A hand-held applicator was then placed over the plastic shell to insert the microneedles into the skin. The operation of the device was as follows. The applicator strikes the microneedles with a post traveling at a velocity of 6 m/s. There is a total of 100 microneedles over the area of 66 mm<sup>2</sup>. With the microneedles inserted in the skin, the syringe pump is started to deliver the drug. In these studies, the syringe pump was set at a constant rate of 150 &#x3bc;L/h and was run for on average 11 minutes to deliver the 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 mAb. The anti-PD-L1 mAb concentration was 10 mg/mL. There were 11 groups with 3 animals each for the blood collections.

The anti-PD-L1 mAb was obtained from Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and conjugated with p-SCN-deferoxamine using method previously reported (Kam, K., Walsh, L. A., Bock, S. M., Fischer, K. E., Koval, M., Ross, R. F., and Desai, T. A., &#x201c;Nanostructure-Mediated Transport of Biologics across Epithelial Tissue: Enhancing Permeability via Nanotopography&#x201d;, Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 164-171; Vosjan M J, Perk L R, Visser G W, et al., &#x201c;Conjugation and radiolabeling of monoclonal antibodies with zirconium-89 for PET imaging using the bifunctional chelate p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine&#x201d;, Nat Protoc. 2010; 5:739-743). Radiolabeling of Df-anti-PD-L1 mAb with <sup>89</sup>Zr was accomplished using traditional methods previously described and purified with PD-10 columns as described in Kam, K., Walsh, L. A., Bock, S. M., Fischer, K. E., Koval, M., Ross, R. F., and Desai, T. A., &#x201c;Nanostructure-Mediated Transport of Biologics across Epithelial Tissue: Enhancing Permeability via Nanotopography&#x201d;, Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 164-171.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0178">Detailed <sup>89</sup>Zr Labeling Procedure. Coupling of the bifunctional chelate was performed as follows: (1) Pipette the required amount of mAb solution (maximum 1 ml; by preference between 2 and 10 mg/ml mAb) into an Eppendorf tube. Adjust the reaction mixture to a total volume of 1 ml by adding a sufficient amount of normal saline into the tube. Concentrations lower than 2 mg/ml will decrease the efficiency of the conjugation reaction, resulting in lower Df-mAb molar ratio. (2) Adjust pH of the mAb solution to pH 8.9-9.1 with 0.1 M Na2CO3 (maximum 0.1 ml). Alternatively, the desired pH for the reaction can be obtained by carrying out a buffer exchange of the mAb stock solution against 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0). (3) Dissolve Df-Bz-NCS in DMSO at a concentration between 2 and 5 mM (1.5-3.8 mg/ml) depending on the amount of mAb used. Add this to the protein solution to give a three-fold molar excess of the chelator over the molar amount of mAb and mix immediately. Keep the DMSO concentration below 2% in the reaction mixture. Typically, 20 &#x3bc;L (in steps of 5 &#x3bc;L) 2-10 mM Df-Bz-NCS (40-200 nmol) in DMSO is added to 2-10 mg intact antibody (13.2-66 nmol). In those cases, between 0.3-0.9 Df moieties will be coupled per antibody molecule. (4) Incubate the reaction for 30 min at 37&#xb0; C. using a Thermomixer at 550 r.&#x3bc;m. (5) In the meantime rinse a PD-10 column with 20 ml 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6). (6) Pipette the conjugation reaction mixture onto the PD-10 column and discard the flow-through. (7) Pipette 1.5 ml of 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6) onto the PD-10 column and discard the flow-through. (8) Pipette 2 ml of 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6) onto the PD-10 column and collect the Df-protein. the Df-Bz-NCS-mAb can be stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. until the day of radiolabeling for at least 2 weeks. Radiolabeling was performed as follows: (9) Pipette the required volume (=a) of [89Zr]Zr-oxalic acid solution (maximum 200 typically 37-185 MBq) into a glass &#x2018;reaction vial&#x2019;. (10) While gently shaking, add 200 &#x3bc;L-a &#x3bc;L (see Step 9) 1 M oxalic acid into the reaction vial. Subsequently, pipette 90 &#x3bc;L 2 M Na2CO3 into the reaction vial and incubate for 3 min at room temperature. (11) While gently shaking, pipette successively 0.30 ml of 0.5 M HEPES (pH 7.1-7.3), 0.71 ml of pre-modified mAb (typically 0.7-3.0 mg), and 0.70 ml 0.5 M HEPES (pH 7.1-7.3) into the reaction vial. The pH of the labeling reaction should be in the range of 6.8-7.2 for optimal labeling efficiency. (12) Incubate for 1 h at room temperature while gently shaking the reaction vial. Radiolabeling efficiency (typically &#x3e;85%) can be determined by ITLC using chromatography strips and 20 mM citric acid (pH 4.9-5.1) (ITLC eluent) as solvent. A 0.5-2.0 &#x3bc;L aliquot of the reaction solution can be directly applied to the ITLC strip. Radiolabeled mAb (Rf=0.0-0.1). Any radioactivity Rf &#x3e;0.1 represents radioactivity not bound to the mAb. Radiolabeling efficiency=CPM Rf 0.0-0.1 (CPM radiolabeled mAb)/CPM Rf 0.0-1.0 (CPM total)&#xd7;100%. (13) Meanwhile, rinse a PD-10 column with 20 ml of 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6). (14) After 1 h of incubation, pipette the reaction mixture onto the PD-10 column and discard the flow-through. (15) Pipette 1.5 ml of 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6) onto the PD-10 column and discard the flow-through. (16) Pipette 2 ml of 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4-5.6) onto the PD-10 column and collect the purified radiolabeled mAb. (17) Calculate the overall labeling yield: MBq 89Zr product vial (see Step 16)/MBq 89Zr starting activity (see Step 9)&#xd7;100% and analyze the purified radiolabeled mAb by ITLC, HPLC and SDS-PAGE. When the radiochemical purity is greater than 95% it is ready for storage at 4&#xb0; C. or dilution in 5 mg/ml gentisic acid in 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH5.4-5.6) for in vitro or in vivo studies. When the purity is &#x3c;95% the PD-10 column purification should be repeated. The radiolabeled mAb is stable upon storage for 48 h (0.9%&#xb1;0.4% dissociation of the initial bound 89Zr in a 37 MBq ml&#x2212;1 89Zr-mAb solution at t=48 h, but presence of Cl&#x2014; ions should be avoided). Gentisic acid is introduced during labeling and storage to minimize deterioration of the mAb integrity by radiation. The use of Cl&#x2014; ions should be avoided, as radiation and subsequent radiolysis of water molecules form OCl&#x2014; ions, which very specifically react with the SH-group of the enolized thiourea unit. Thus, the formed intermediary sulphenyl chloride bonds, and the sulphonyl chloride bonds arising upon further oxidation, are known to undertake a series of reactions, among which are coupling reactions and cleavage of methionyl peptide bonds. Therefore, the use of a 0.25 M sodium acetate buffer is strongly recommended.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0179">Group 1: SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; Administration 89Zr-Labelled anti-PD-L1 mAb.

Of the animals dosed with SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infusion, it is expected that a proportion of animals, such as at least, or at least about, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99%. will show a complete response, such as determined by undetectable primary tumor volume by caliper measurement, or by any other method identifiable in the art. No animals receiving i.p. administration of anti-PD-1 or i.p. administration of anti-PD-L1 or isotype control are expected to show a complete response, consistent with lymphatic delivery of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 to TDLNs potentiating early and robust anti-tumor activity. In addition, statistically significantly fewer animals, such as up to 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or 75% fewer animals are expected to show distant metastases, such as lung, bone, or LN metastases, in SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infused animals compared to systemically dosed and isotype control groups. These expected results suggest that despite the regional delivery of drug, there is an effective abscopal anti-tumor response from regional SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; dosing in comparison to systemic dosing. This expected result is consistent with (i) the greater drug exposure to na&#xef;ve T cells in TDLNs with lymphatic delivery and (ii) a more effective activation of T-cells against tumor Ags which once educated, leave TDLNs to mount a robust systemic anti-tumor response.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0216">Tumor bearing animals receiving SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infusion of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 are expected to exhibit significantly reduced tumor growth that occurs from an earlier time point when compared to that observed in animals receiving i.p. injection of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. For example, SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infusion of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 is expected to exhibit significantly reduced tumor growth over a period of time, such as at day 15 p.i. and onwards, when compared to animals dosed with isotype control antibody. In comparison, tumor bearing animals receiving i.p. injection of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 are expected to exhibit statistically significant reduced tumor growth from a later time point, such as on day 19 p.i. and onwards when compared to animals administered with isotype control antibody. Beginning from a time point, such as at day 15 p.i., the tumor volumes of animals having received a first round of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 via SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infusion are expected to be significantly smaller than tumor volumes in animals that received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 systemically. This expected result is consistent with an earlier anti-tumor response in animals dosed regionally with SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; infusion into the lymphatics as compared to those receiving drug systemically.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0217">IHC staining of the subset of SOFUSA&#xae; DoseConnect&#x2122; anti-PD-1-dosed or anti-PD-L1-dosed animals that have a residual primary tumor at study endpoint, are expected to show statistically greater number, e.g. an increase of up to 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 2.5-fold, or more, of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the primary tumors compared to controls or to animals dosed systemically. For example, it may be expected that an increase of 50% TILs in the primary tumors is observed following intravenous administration of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic agent, compared to an increase of 100% TILs in the primary tumors following lymphatic administration.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218">The impact of lymphatic delivery on tumor responses expected in this preclinical study may be attenuated in the small, quadrupedal preclinical tumor models as compared to bipedal non-human primates or patients. Systemic administration of monoclonal antibodies in rodent studies are commonly performed with i.p. injection for effective uptake by the plentiful lymphatics in the peritoneal cavity that promptly empties into the venous system. As a result, i.p. administration largely approximates the same pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles seen with i.v. injection. While i.p. administration may escape the exposure to tumor draining LNs seen in this lymphatic delivery study, the i.p. route of administration nonetheless uses the truncal lymphatics to deliver drug to the blood circulation. As a result of the exposure in the lymphatic compartment, the anti-tumor responses from i.p. administration in rodents may be expected to overpredict those from i.v. administration in humans. In addition to the attenuated response in rodent models, adverse immune responses to immunotherapies are generally non-existent in rodents, further requiring other pre-clinical and clinical investigation, described in the present disclosure, to understand whether lymphatic delivery can ameliorate irAEs.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 5.

As a whole, CTCL is quite rare, constituting &#x2dc;4% of NHL diagnoses in the United States (Korgavkar, K., M. Xiong and M. Weinstock (2013). &#x201c;Changing incidence trends of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.&#x201d; JAMA Dermatol 149(11): 1295-1299.).</p><p id="p-0257" num="0254">Study rationale. Initial treatment in patients with patch/plaque CTCL disease consists of skin-directed therapies (localized or generalized including PUVA) with the addition of milder systemic therapies for refractory, persistent or progressive disease. Patients who do not respond to biologic therapy or those with very aggressive or extracutaneous disease may be treated with combination chemotherapy. With the potential exception of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, there are no curative therapies for CTCL. Long-term curative treatment options have long been a challenge in CTCL. For relapsed or refractory disease, participation in clinical trials is recommended (National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas (Version 2.2019). https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/primary_cutaneous.pdf.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0255">In a study of biopsies taken from CTCL patients, CD4+ CTCL populations contained more T cells expressing PD-1, CTLA-4, and LAG-3 compared to normal skin. CTCL populations also contained more T cells expressing the inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), a marker of T-cell activation. Advanced T3/T4-stage samples expressed higher levels of mRNA from checkpoint inhibition genes compared with T1/T2 stage patients or healthy controls. Exhaustion of activated T cells is therefore a hallmark of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from the lesioned skin of patients with CTCL (Querfeld C, Zain J M, Wakefield D L, et al. Phase 1/2 Trial of Durvalumab and Lenalidomide in Patients with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL): Preliminary Results of Phase I Results and Correlative Studies, Blood 2018a 132:2931; Querfeld C (2018b, December). Phase 1/2 Trial of Durvalumab and Lenalidomide in Patients with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL): Preliminary Results of Phase I Results and Correlative Studies. Oral presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. San Diego, Calif.). A phase 2, single-arm study led by the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) evaluating pembrolizumab, an antibody to PD-1, showed promising results in people with higher stages of relapsed or refractory MF and SS (Khodadoust M, Rook A H, Porcu P, et al. Pembrolizumab for treatment of relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome: clinical efficacy in a CITN multicenter phase 2 study. Blood. 2016; 128(22):181). In this study 24 patients with MF/SS stages IB-IV treated with at least 1 prior systemic therapy were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The ORR was 38% (n=24) with a median time to treatment response of 11 weeks. One patient had a complete response, 8 patients had a partial response, 9 had stable disease, and 6 patients had PD. At 32 weeks, 8 of the 9 responses were ongoing. Based upon these results, although not approved, pembrolizumab is now listed in national guidelines as a treatment option for CTCL treatment. In a separate small clinical trial of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) plus lenalidomide in patients with CTCL, it has been reported that this combination is also active in improving skin disease and producing partial responses. Strong PD-L1 and ICOS expression is observed from non-responders. Detectable levels of PD-L1, but low levels of ICOS is observed in responding patients. Quantitative super-resolution microscopy detected nanoscale clusters of PD-1 in T cells from responders and no PD-1 clustering was observed in T cells from non-responders (Querfeld C, Zain J M, Wakefield D L, et al. Phase 1/2 Trial of Durvalumab and Lenalidomide in Patients with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL): Preliminary Results of Phase I Results and Correlative Studies, Blood 2018a 132:2931). The combination appeared to suppress the expression of PD-L1 and ICOS, possibly through down regulation of STAT1 and STAT3 (Querfeld C (2018b, December). Phase 1/2 Trial of Durvalumab and Lenalidomide in Patients with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL): Preliminary Results of Phase I Results and Correlative Studies.

In this pilot study, pembrolizumab will be administered via DoseConnect in patient with CTCL to assess through pharmacodynamic assessment in the tumor tissue if lymphatic delivery of pembrolizumab using SOFUSA&#xae; is feasible. The choice of CTCL is based on accessibility of tumor cells for pharmacodynamic measurements.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0257">In clinical studies of single agent pembrolizumab, the most common AEs (reported in &#x2265;20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, pain, and abdominal pain (KEYTRUDA&#xae; (pembrolizumab) [package insert]. Merck &#x26; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J.; 2019). These common AEs were generally Grade 1 to 2.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">Pembrolizumab can cause immune-related AEs. A wide range of immune related AEs, often in the form of autoimmune disease, is expected to occur at a low incidence (Id.). In the CITN experience of pembrolizumab in CTCL, AEs were consistent with those seen in prior studies of pembrolizumab with the exception of an immune-related skin flare reaction seen in 6 patients (2 patients with grade 2 and 4 patients with grade 3) which occurred exclusively in patients with SS (6/15; 40%) (Khodadoust M, Rook A H, Porcu P, et al. Pembrolizumab for treatment of relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome: clinical efficacy in a CITN multicenter phase 2 study. Blood. 2016; 128(22):181). Participants enrolled in this study may be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related AEs and treated with steroid and other supportive measures as required in accordance with published guidelines (Brahmer J R, Lacchetti C, Schneider B J et al. Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events in Patients Treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline. Journal of Clinical Oncology 2018 36:17, 1714-1768.). Pembrolizumab can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA&#xae; (pembrolizumab) [package insert]. Merck &#x26; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J.; 2019).

The biomarkers chosen, T-cell exhaustion markers PD-1, Lag-3, Tim-3, and ICOS in malignant CD4+ and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cells in tumor tissue, have been previously studied in many malignancies including CTCL (Querfeld C, Zain J M, Wakefield D L, et al.

In addition, detection of pembrolizumab in tumor tissue is based on previous observations in preclinical models that SOFUSA&#xae; administration can lead to higher levels of drug in the lymph nodes and tumor tissue compared to intravenous or other systemic administration methods. Ki67 in the tumor bed and peripheral blood can be detected after anti-PD-1 therapy (Kamphorst A O, Pillai R N, Yang S, Nasti T H, Akondy R S, Wieland A, Sica G L, Yu K, Koenig L, Patel N T, Behera M, Wu H, McCausland M, Chen Z, Zhang C, Khuri F R, Owonikoko T K, Ahmed R, Ramalingam S S.

Although the delivery of pembrolizumab will be via the lymphatics using the DoseConnect, since the lymphatic system is connected to the venous system, it is expected the intra-lymphatically administered drug will eventually appear in the blood and therefore allow for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements in the blood.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0275">Aspects of these various examples may all be combined with one another, even if not expressly combined in the present disclosure, unless they are clearly mutually exclusive.
