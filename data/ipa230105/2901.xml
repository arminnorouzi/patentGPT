A gas inlet device usually has three to five gas inlet regions that are arranged on top of one another. A hydride of a Group III compound such as arsine, phosphine or ammonia can be fed into the process chamber together with a carrier gas, e.g. hydrogen, through an uppermost and a lowermost gas inlet region. An organometallic compound, particularly a Group III MO-compound, likewise can be fed into the process chamber together with a carrier gas through an intermediate central gas inlet region. The Group III compound and the Group V compound can decompose on the heated surface of a susceptor. The decomposition products can be deposited on a substrate arranged in the process chamber so as to form a Group III-V layer. According to the invention, multiple gas distribution volumes, particularly multiple directly adjacent gas distribution volumes, can be interconnected into a gas inlet region, through which the same process gas can flow into the process chamber, in different processes. This makes it possible to vary the height of the gas inlet regions, through which the same process gas flows into the process chamber. An inert gas also can be discharged through an uppermost gas outlet zone and/or through a lowermost gas outlet zone, i.e. through a gas outlet zone lying directly adjacent to a process chamber ceiling or a susceptor, during a deposition process in order to protect the surface of the susceptor and/or the surface of the process chamber ceiling against parasitic deposition. It is particularly proposed that each gas inlet region, through which the same process gas flows, is formed by at least one gas outlet zone, preferably by two gas outlet zones. An inventive gas inlet device preferably can have at least five, seven, nine, ten or twelve gas distribution volumes that are respectively separated from one another by a base, wherein each gas distribution volume forms a gas outlet zone and multiple gas outlet zones are interconnected into a gas inlet region for introducing the same process gas. In this context, it is particularly proposed that multiple gas distribution volumes are interconnected in different combinations. According to one variation of the invention, it is proposed that an individually assigned supply conduit leads into each gas distribution volume. In this case, the supply conduit may have a single mouth that opens into the gas distribution volume. A gas conduit may lead into each of the supply conduits. The gas conduits can be selectively connected to one of a plurality of feed conduits by means of multiple valves that can be opened and closed. A different gas such as an inert gas or one of the process gases can be fed into each feed conduit. Consequently, the process gas can be fed into a different combination of gas distribution volumes and therefore exit from different combinations of gas outlet zones by switching the respective valves accordingly. The respective plurality of gas outlet zones or gas distribution volumes can be divided into multiple groups. For example, one group may comprise a plurality of gas outlet zones bordering on the process chamber bottom and/or a plurality of gas outlet zones bordering on the process chamber ceiling. A second group may comprise, for example, a plurality of gas outlet zones arranged in the center of the process chamber. A group of gas outlet zones may respectively form a gas inlet region, wherein the gas outlet zones belonging to a group directly border on one another and the same process gas or inert gas respectively exits into the process chamber through the gas outlet zones of the same group. Two adjacent groups, through the gas outlet zones of which a different gas respectively exits into the process chamber, border on one another in such a way that the gas outlet zones arranged at the border can be selectively assigned to either of the two groups, which border on one another at the border, by switching over the valves accordingly. In this case, gas outlet zones can be assigned to a border region and the gas conduits, which are assigned to the gas outlet zones assigned to a respective border region, can be selectively connected to different feed conduits. However, gas conduits of gas outlet zones that are arranged outside a border region, i.e. not assigned to any border region, may only be connected to one feed conduit. This makes it possible to selectively assign gas outlet zones arranged in a border region to either of the two groups bordering on one another in the border region. Consequently, these gas outlet zones can be used for increasing or reducing the size of a gas inlet region for respectively introducing the same process gas. The height of the gas inlet region therefore can be increased or reduced by switching over respective valves, by means of which feed conduits are connected to gas conduits. The switchover elements in the form of valves may be arranged outside the gas inlet device and, in particular, outside the reactor. The switchover elements form part of a gas mixing system in this case. However, the switchover elements may alternatively also be arranged in the reactor and, in particular, in the gas inlet device. According to one variation of the invention, it is proposed that the supply conduits are formed by pipes. The pipes have openings that lead into a gas distribution volume. In this variation, the pipes can be displaced in such a way that their openings selectively lead into different gas distribution volumes. This can be realized by means of an axial displacement of a pipe or by means of a rotation of a pipe. It would be possible to provide stops, on which the pipe respectively abuts when the entire opening leads into a gas distribution volume. It would furthermore be possible to provide openings, which can be selectively opened or closed by means of a closing element, between two gas distribution volumes such that a process gas fed into one of the two gas distribution volumes can flow into another gas distribution volume through the opening. A supply conduit in the form of a pipe may also have multiple openings, which can be closed by displacing the pipe, e.g. by rotating or linearly moving the pipe, in an outer pipe. In an arrangement of this type, in which the switchover elements are arranged in the gas inlet device, a supply conduit can selectively lead into different gas distribution volumes. A supply conduit also can simultaneously lead into multiple gas distribution volumes. However, it would also be possible that no supply conduit that is connected to a gas conduit leads into a gas distribution volume at all, but that the gas distribution volume rather can be selectively connected to an adjacent gas distribution volume in a fluidic manner by closing or opening a passage opening. To this end, it is preferred to provide mechanical actuating elements that can be actuated from outside the reactor or the gas inlet device and make it possible to spatially displace supply conduit pipes or closing elements.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the attached drawings.
