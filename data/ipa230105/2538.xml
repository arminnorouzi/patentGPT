In addition to maintaining the excellent properties of a TPU matrix material, foamed TPU materials have a series of advantages such as low density, heat and sound insulation, high specific strength, high elasticity, and buffering, and thus show promising application prospects in packaging, manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, military, aerospace, commodities, and other fields.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU) beads and a preparation method thereof have been disclosed in many patent documents, such as patent documents WO2007/082838, WO2010/136398A, CN102276785A, and the like. In addition, the patent document WO2007/082838 also discloses a processing method of ETPU beads, where the ETPU beads are filled in a mold and then hot-molded with steam to obtain a molded foamed product. At present, ETPU molded products are widely used in fields such as shoe materials, sports goods, and children's toys.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the current ETPU molded products on the market are prepared by melting and bonding ETPU beads through a hot-molding process with steam, and thus these ETPU molded products have a rough and uneven surface. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct diversified appearance designs on the surface of these ETPU molded products, and the appearance of these products is relatively single, which limits the application prospects of these products.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the technical problem that the existing foamed TPU products have a rough and uneven surface in the above background art, the present disclosure provides a TPU foam product with high flatness, and a preparation method and a use thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure adopts the following technical solutions to solve the above-mentioned technical problem: A TPU foam product with high flatness is provided, including an aliphatic thermoplastic polyurethane (ATPU) that has a melting range of 20&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. and a melting point of 90&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C., preferably 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C., and more preferably 120&#xb0; C. to 145&#xb0; C. The TPU foam product with high flatness has a density of 0.08 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and more preferably 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; and the TPU foam product with high flatness has a flatness value of less than 2 mm, preferably less than 1 mm, and more preferably less than 0.5 mm, and the flatness value is determined by a fixed-length ruler.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The melting range and melting point of the ATPU are determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Specifically, the melting range and melting point are obtained by the measurement of an instrument with a model of DSC <b>1</b> from METTLER and the data analysis of STARe software. More specifically, 5 mg to 10 mg of ATPU beads are heated from &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. at a heating rate of 20&#xb0; C./min, kept at the temperature for 2 min, cooled from 250&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. at a cooling rate of 10&#xb0; C./min, and finally heated from &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. at a heating rate of 20&#xb0; C./min; and a difference between a starting point and an end point of a melting peak temperature of the obtained DSC during the second temperature rise process is taken as the melting range of the ATPU beads, and a melting peak temperature of the obtained DSC curve during the second temperature rise process is taken as the melting point of the ATPU beads.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the melting point of the ATPU is lower than 90&#xb0; C., the thermal stability of the prepared foam product will be heavily reduced; and if the melting point of the ATPU is higher than 160&#xb0; C., a processing pressure required during a molding process of the product is high, which increases a steam cost, reduces a fusion rate among foamed ATPU beads, and reduces a strength of the product.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Beneficial effects of the present disclosure: The TPU foam product with high flatness disclosed in the present disclosure is prepared from ATPU with low melting point, such that ETPU beads obtained after foaming require a low molding pressure during steam molding, which reduces the steam consumption and the production cost. In addition, the TPU foam product with high flatness of the present disclosure not only has excellent resilience, but also has high flatness, and thus ETPU molded products with high flatness can have many appearance designs through mold pattern designs.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following improvements can be further made by the present disclosure based on the above technical solution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the ATPU may be at least one selected from the group consisting of a hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) type, an isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) type, a xylylene diisocyanate (XDI) type, a hydrogenated diphenylmethane diisocyanate (HMDI) type, and a hydrogenated XDI type; may preferably be an HDI type, an XDI type, or a hydrogenated XDI type; and may more preferably be an HDI type.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the ATPU may have a shore hardness of 60 A to 60 D, preferably 70 A to 55 D, more preferably 75 A to 95 A, and most preferably 85 A to 95 A; and the shore hardness may be determined according to ASTM D2240-05.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the ATPU may have a melt index of 10 to 250 g/10 min, preferably 15 to 100 g/10 min, and more preferably 20 to 50 g/10 min; and the melt index may be determined by applying a weight of 5 kg at 190&#xb0; C. according to ASTM D1238.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure also provides a preparation method of the TPU foam product with high flatness described above, including the following steps:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a. processing ATPU beads with a melting range of 20&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. and a melting point of 90&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C. by a physical gas foaming process to obtain foamed ATPU beads; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">b. filling the foamed ATPU beads obtained in step a into a mold, and heating with a heat source such that the foamed ATPU beads are fused to each other to obtain the TPU foam product with high flatness.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Beneficial effects of the present disclosure: Foamed ATPU beads are prepared from ATPU with a narrow melting range and a low melting point, such that the ETPU beads are easily fused during molding, with inapparent joint seams, which makes the foam product made from the foamed TPU beads have high flatness and thus enables diversified designs for the surface of the product.

Specifically, the melting range and melting point are obtained by the measurement of an instrument with a model of DSC 1 from METTLER and the data analysis of STARe software. More specifically, 5 mg to 10 mg of ATPU beads are heated from &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. at a heating rate of 20&#xb0; C./min, kept at the temperature for 2 min, cooled from 250&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. at a cooling rate of 10&#xb0; C./min, and finally heated from &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. at a heating rate of 20&#xb0; C./min; and a difference between a starting point and an end point of a melting peak temperature of the obtained DSC during the second temperature rise process is taken as the melting range of the ATPU beads, and a melting peak temperature of the obtained DSC curve during the second temperature rise process is taken as the melting point of the ATPU beads.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="left" id="FOO-00003">(2) Flatness evaluation of the foam products: A non-textured flat mold is used to mold the foamed beads into a product, and a flatness of a surface of the product is measured by a fixed-length ruler. The smoothness is represented by a maximum gap between a reference plane of the ruler and the surface of the product, expressed in mm. Each product is tested for 10 times, and then an average is taken. The flatness is tested for 10 products in each experiment, and then an average is taken.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">From the data in Table 1, compared with Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4, in Examples 1, 2, and 3 adopting the technical solution of the present disclosure, the obtained foamed TPU beads require a lower steam pressure for molding, which reduces the cost.
