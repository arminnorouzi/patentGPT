application No. PCT/KR2022/008076, filed on Jun. 8, 2022, which is based on and claims the benefit of a Korean patent application number 10-2021-0087256, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related

to an electronic device and a method using an ultra-wide band (UWB) signal. More particularly, the disclosure relates to an electronic device and a method for using a UWB signal as a radar signal while using the same signal to measure a distance to an external device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ultra-wide band (UWB) signals may be used in short-range wireless communication using radio waves, such as Bluetooth or wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi). When measurement is made using a UWB signal in communication, errors in the distance and azimuth between devices can be reduced to 10 cm and 5 degrees or smaller. Since use of UWB signals can increase the accuracy of distance and azimuth in comparison with other signals, various services use UWB signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">UWB signals may also be used as radar signals as well as for communication. When UWB signals are used as radar signals, the change in surrounding environment and the existence/absence of a living thing can be detected, the heart rate of the living thing can be identified, and the gesture thereof can also be recognized.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">UWB signals may be used to measure distance in communication or used as radar signals, and may be used for only one purpose at a time. In a case where an electronic device uses UWB signals for communication to measure a distance to an external electronic device, the electronic device may be allowed to use UWB signals as radar signals only when distance is not measured. Therefore, it may be difficult to sufficiently secure a time required to use UWB signals as radar signals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device and a method for using a UWB signal as a radar signal while using the same signal to measure a distance to an external device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.
