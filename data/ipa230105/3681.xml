Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of using an in situ modified graphite pencil electrode for the electrochemical measurement of analyte concentrations in aqueous samples.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The &#x201c;background&#x201d; description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present invention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diabetes is an infamous clinical ailment that is responsible for disability and death worldwide as a result of alteration of genes and expression of proteins relating to human metabolism. See W. Jin, M.-E. Patti, Genetic determinants and molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes, Clinical Science, 116 (2009) 99-111, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Deteriorating health conditions as a result of lifestyle changes brought about by technological advancement in developed nations and poor health systems in under-developed countries have both been linked to diabetes. Healthful management of diabetes necessitates regular monitoring of glucose levels in blood. See L. Guariguata, D. R. Whiting, I. Hambleton, J. Beagley, U. Linnenkamp, J. E. Shaw, Global estimates of diabetes prevalence for 2013 and projections for 2035, Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 103 (2014) 137-149, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The dominance of enzyme-based glucose biosensors in the global market is due to the superiority of glucose oxidase (GOD) in terms of its essential stability, immobilization property, biocompatibility, and low operating potential. However, its performance is still limited by surrounding humidity, lower temperatures, and pH between 2 and 8 due to its intrinsic protein nature and smaller dynamic range compared with the first two glucose sensing generations. See J. Wang, Electrochemical glucose biosensors, Chemical Reviews, 108 (2008) 814-825; J. Liu, C. Guo, C. M. Li, Y. Li, Q. Chi, X. Huang, L. Liao, T.

Patolsky, E. Katz, J. F. Hainfeld, I. Willner, Plugging into enzymes: Nanowiring of redox enzymes by a gold nanoparticle, Science, 299 (2003) 1877-1881, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Efforts such as entrapment of enzymes as a sol-gel, cross linkage of enzymes, wiring of GOD electrochemically, and incorporation of enzymes within a polymer via electro-polymerization have been reported to preserve the stability of enzymatic glucose sensors but could only be achieved with a single-use device due the inability to withstand modifications resulting from chemical and physical processes involved in fabrication.

This is because these other voltammetric methods tend to result in multiple, broad, and unresolved peaks, which quickly become more complicated with the complexity of the immobilized compounds on the transducer. These issues may be responsible for the adoption or adaptation of amperometric technique in the existing glucose sensor applications, as these do not distinguish among currents resulting from glucose, potential interferences, and immobilized compounds once a potential is applied.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Graphite Pencil Electrodes (GPE) have been reported as a fascinating electrochemical transducer for various environmental and clinical applications based on cost effectiveness, availability, flexibility, and renewability.

However, the methods described herein may show a high amount of analyte recovery, preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 97%, even more preferably at least 98%. Here, the analyte recovery is the percentage of the measured analyte concentration of the analyte with respect to the actual analyte concentration.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The reference electrode may be a standard hydrogen electrode, a normal hydrogen electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode, a saturated calomel electrode, a silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode, or a dynamic hydrogen electrode. Preferably, the reference electrode is a silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode. In one embodiment, the reference electrode is an Ag/AgCl electrode, and the counter electrode comprises platinum, gold, or some other metal. Preferably the counter electrode is a platinum wire. The counter electrode may also be called an auxiliary electrode.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The graphite electrode is in electrical communication with the reference electrode. After the immersing, a potential is applied between the reference electrode and the modified graphite electrode to produce a current within the aqueous sample. The biasing potential may have the waveform of a linear scan voltammetry, a square wave voltammetry, or a cyclic voltammetry. In one embodiment, cyclic voltammetry may be applied, using a linear scan of voltage in both directions (low to high potential and high to low potential). In another embodiment, linear scan voltammetry may be used with a scan in only one direction. For instance, linear scan voltammetry may be used to scan from a high potential to a low potential, which is also called cathodic sweep linear scan voltammetry (CSLSV) is used. The potential applied in this region may cause surface oxidation reactions on the surface of the graphite electrode, which may be noticeable as current peaks. CSLSV may be used to scan from 1.5 V to &#x2212;0.5 V, preferably 1.0 to &#x2212;0.2 V. A voltage scan rate may be 10-400 mV/s, preferably 50-200 mV/s, more preferably 80-120 mV/s, or about 100 mV/s. However, in some embodiments, the voltage scan rate may be slower than 10 mV/s or faster than 400 mV/s. In an alternative embodiment, voltammetry may be used that does not scan linearly through a range of potentials, for instance, different potentials may be applied at discrete steps.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Changes in the current as a result of reduction or oxidation of analytes may be compared to a correlation chart or a calibration curve to determine the concentration of analyte. Here, the correlation chart or calibration curve relates an analyte concentration for a particular value of current measured. The correlation chart or calibration curve may be further influenced by other parameters such as voltage, temperature, pH, electrolyte concentration, and other solution conditions. Because of the influence of several solution conditions on the measurement of the analyte, the method may comprise a step of measuring standard solutions to construct a correlation chart or calibration curve. This provides a way to better ensure that certain solution conditions do not differ significantly between samples and standard solutions.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one embodiment, cyclic voltammetry may be used with an aqueous sample to first identify the location of current peaks as a result of redox reactions. One or more current peaks may be observed in the cathodic sweep (high to low potential) and/or the anodic sweep (low to high potential). The value of the current peaks may be used from those cyclic voltammograms, or a linear scan voltammetry may next be applied using only a cathodic sweep or only an anodic sweep.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">By changing the applied potential in any form of voltammetry, the current may vary based on electrochemical reaction of analyte. As mentioned previously, the current may peak during the voltage scan. For a particular analyte, this peak may occur at a particular voltage or within a smaller range of voltages, and the value of the current at the peak may be linearly dependent on the concentration of analyte. In one embodiment, the analyte is glucose, and the voltage of its current peak is 0.60-0.65 V, preferably 0.61-0.64 V, or about 0.63 V. In one embodiment, the analyte is methionine, and the voltage of its current peak is 0.63-0.67 V, preferably 0.64-0.66 V, or about 0.65 V. Preferably, these current peaks of glucose and methionine are observed in the cathodic region of the voltammogram (high potential to low potential), and these current peaks may be considered secondary oxidation peaks.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Alternatively, a linear response in current may be obtained by applying a potential at or near the voltage relating to the current peak of the particular analyte. In this sense, the measurement technique may be more similar to amperometry. The voltage may be constant or relatively stable, and the current or an average value of current is measured.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment, the measuring further involves constructing a calibration curve from a current response of two or more standard solutions. This may be considered equivalent to constructing a calibration curve from a correlation chart. Preferably, the standard solutions comprise an identical analyte to the one being measured, though in other embodiments, the standard solutions may comprise a different species that has a similar electrochemical response. Preferably the standard solutions produce currents within the linear response range of the graphite electrode, so that a linear calibration curve may be determined to relate current to analyte concentration. Preferably, more than two standard solutions of different concentrations are used, for instance, 3-10 standard solutions, or 4-6 standard solutions. In one embodiment, separate standard solutions may each be prepared and measured one at a time. However, in another embodiment, standard solutions may be measured by a standard addition method, where one volume is measured, and then is mixed with standard solution (usually of a volume 10-1,000 times smaller), while the electrodes are kept in place.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Preferably, where standard solutions are used to construct a linear calibration curve, preferably the standard solutions are within a linear response range of the graphite electrode, so that the linear calibration curve has a correlation coefficient, R<sup>2</sup>, of at least 0.90, preferably at least 0.95, more preferably at least 0.97, even more preferably at least 0.99.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one embodiment, where the analyte is glucose, the measurement method may have a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03-5.0 &#x3bc;M, preferably 0.1-4.0 &#x3bc;M, more preferably 1.0-1.4 &#x3bc;M, or about 1.36 &#x3bc;M.

Additionally, this method of detection may rely on reporting the presence or absence of a peak in a voltammogram, rather than a particular value of current.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In one embodiment, the analyte concentration may be determined using amperometry and standard additions. Here, the potential may be held constant, and the level of current may be measured by sequentially adding and mixing standard additions, in order to increase the concentration by approximately the same amount each time. Each addition may be spaced by a time interval such as 20-100 s, or 30-60 s.

Moreover, the readout device may be a component of the sensing device or may be separated from the sensing device. Furthermore, the readout device may also be linked to an adapter that may interface with a controller device. Preferably, a readout circuit used to enable determination of the presence and/or amount of analyte may form part of the readout device.

The readout circuit may also be configured to indicate the current and/or potential value(s) to a user of the sensing device such that he/she may detect the presence of the analyte and quantify it based on this measurement. To achieve this, the readout circuit may comprise an electronic display and/or a loudspeaker for presenting the current and/or potential value(s) to the user, and may further comprise a transmitter (or transceiver) for transmitting the data to another device. The latter feature enables the user to monitor the environment from a remote location.

Concentrations of AA and some other interferences are always below 0.10 mM compared to the physiological level of glucose which has been estimated to be between 3.00 to 8.00 mM. See Z. Zhuang, X. Su, H. Yuan, Q. Sun, D. Xiao, M. M. F. Choi, An improved sensitivity non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on a CuO nanowire modified Cu electrode, Analyst, 133 (2008) 126-132, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Base the physiological ratio of glucose to its potential interferences, 0.10 mM of AA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>), fructose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) and alanine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>) were used as an interference concentration against 1 mM glucose.

Addition of 1 mM glucose into the solution containing 0.10 mM AA, fructose, and alanine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> (c), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> (c), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> (c), respectively) show no significant change in the current-peak when compared with the current peak of glucose in the absence of interferences. Apart from a slight change in background noise of the current-peak which does not significantly affect the current-peak of 1 mM glucose, percentage increase in 1 mM glucose current peaks as a result of all the study interference are not more than 5%. The interference study confirms the capability of GPE as a potential transducer for glucose sensor in the presence of potential interferences.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Voltammetric Determination of Glucose in Serum Sample</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0160">Developed technique was tested on the serum sample obtained from a healthy patient in King Fand University Teaching Hospital. Protein-free serum sample diluted 200 times in 0.10 M NaOH was used for analysis of glucose by spiking of a series of glucose standard solutions. Results of the serum sample analysis are enumerated in Table 2. About 0.04 mM glucose concentration equivalent to about 8.00 mM glucose concentration in the undiluted serum was found with a good recovery range between 97-110%. This performance is an indication of the capability of the developed technique with bare GPE in the presence of Cu for a real life application.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0161">A unique and cost effective voltammetric technique for the development of a non-enzymatic glucose sensor by in-situ reduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup> and electrochemical oxidation of glucose on the surface of graphite pencil electrode (GPE) was proposed. Adsorbed Cu<sup>+</sup> on GPE was characterized with flame emission scanning electron microscope-electron dispersed X-ray (FESEM-Edx) and X-ray spectroscopy (XPS). Electro-catalytic property of copper (Cu) was explored to enhance the secondary oxidation current-peak of glucose at about 0.63 V to more than 10 fold (&#x3e;1,000%) in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Linearity dependence of the electrode was determined as i(&#x3bc;A)=3.5985C<sub>glu</sub>+0.0143 for 0.06-4.0 mM concentration of glucose with a correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.9927, sensitivity of 315 &#x3bc;A&#xb7;mM<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and limit of detection (S/N=3) of 1.36 &#x3bc;M.

So, oxidation of methionine on the surface of GPE can only be initiated by the presence AgNO<sub>3 </sub>in NaOH electrolyte but not in PBS solution.

This behavior was further observed in O 1s spectra (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>) with the appearance of a hump on the O 1s spectrum ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>) of the PBS medium compared with O 1s spectrum of the NaOH sample ((b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>). Analysis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref> presented as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref> for the PBS medium reveal an extra peak with 530.22 eV BE, showing the presence of O in Ag<sub>2</sub>O in the PBS medium and O of AgO in the NaOH medium (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>F</figref>). Both Ag 3d and the O 1s spectra complement each other as proof for the deposition of AgO on GPE in NaOH and Ag<sub>2</sub>O on GPE in PBS medium with a common O&#x2550;C peak at about 532 eV for graphite attachment with the O of the oxides in both spectra.

An amount of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution necessary for effective oxidation of methionine needs to be determined. Effect of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution on the oxidation of 0.20 mM methionine is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B</figref>. Oxidation of methionine could not be noticed in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> due to the absence of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution. However, introduction of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution into the medium containing 0.10 M NaOH and 0.20 mM methionine leads to emergence of oxidation peaks of methionine around 0.65 V along with 2 reduction peaks of Ag at about 0.50 V and 0.05 V. It was observed that the peak current increases as the concentration of the AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution increases from 0.50 ppm (b) to 3.00 ppm (g). Peak current response of methionine to subsequent addition of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution was shown in a corresponding bar chart of the voltammogram presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. Concentrations of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution above 3 ppm do not show significant difference in peak current with 0.20 mM methionine (curves (h) to (j) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>). This could be as a result of the agglomeration of the Ag particles formed on the GPE surface, which may likely reduce or slow down the oxidation process. The concentration of AgNO<sub>3 </sub>solution that can effectively initiate oxidation of methionine was considered to be 3 ppm.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Electro-Analytical Performance</heading><p id="p-0181" num="0171">Performance of the developed sensor was ascertained by constructing a calibration curve (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>) from mean values of 3 voltammograms replicated with successive additions of methionine while retaining 0.10 M NaOH and 3 ppm AgNO<sub>3 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>). A characteristic reduction peak of Ag<sup>2+</sup> to Ag<sup>+</sup> responsible for the initiation of methionine oxidation, similar to what was observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> between 0.70 V and 0.60 V, can be observed in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> in the absence of methionine. Possible conversion of Ag<sup>+</sup> to Ag<sup>2+</sup> in the supporting electrolyte by the initial applied 0.20 V accumulation potential for 30 s can be attributed to CSLSV response to the reduction peak by GPE. This peak can still be observed despite addition of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 mM of methionine producing an oxidation peak with a deflection around 0.65 V potential in (b), (c), and (d), respectively, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>. Moreover, as the concentration of methionine increases from 0.06 to 0.50 mM as shown in (e) to (k) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the Ag reduction peak is no longer observed due to relatively higher current generated by oxidation of methionine on the GPE surface.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0172">A calibration curve for the corresponding voltammograms of methionine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>.

Addition of 100 &#x3bc;M methionine (DLM) shows a very sharp response in the amperogram at about 120 s but no response can be observed for the consecutive spiking of 20 &#x3bc;M AA, An, and Cyt.

Interference compounds added for the second periods between 400s and 700 s again show no amperometric response by interference and further confirm the selectivity of the sensor to methionine detection. Ability of the sensor to be sensitive to methionine after a series of interference compounds being added twice was proved by its third response to a third methionine addition after 700 s.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="2">Application of the Developed Technique on Serum Sample</heading><p id="p-0186" num="0175">Methionine concentration was analyzed by a standard addition method using a serum sample obtained from a healthy patient at the King Fand University Teaching Hospital.
