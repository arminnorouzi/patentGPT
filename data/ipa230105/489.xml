Of this medical suture thread, an outer surface is coated with various resin materials for the purpose of improving operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance (the easiness of moving a knot upon thread tying) on a sutured portion. For example, Patent Literature <b>1</b> below discloses that a suture thread is coated with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;MPC&#x201d;). This can enhance easiness and retainability when a surgeon ties the suture thread.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">PATENT LITERATURE 1: JP-A-2010-513678</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the suture thread described in Patent Literature 1 above, the suture thread is coated. That is, a resin layer made of MPC is formed on an outer surface of the suture thread. Thus, in the case of a multifilament suture thread including a single thread having an assembly of a plurality of fibrous ultrafine threads, the entirety of the suture thread is less bendable due to friction among the ultrafine threads arranged inside the suture thread. As a result, there is a problem that the operability of the suture thread in medical action is degraded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been made to cope with the above-described problem. An object of the present invention is to provide a medical suture thread as a multifilament, which is formed easily bendable and ensuring favorable operability.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above object, as a feature of the present invention, there is provided a medical suture thread as a multifilament including a single thread having an assembly of a plurality of fibrous ultrafine threads. The ultrafine threads are arranged inside the multifilament, and an inner-filament cover layer made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed on an outer surface of each ultrafine thread not exposed at an outer surface of the multifilament.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the feature of the present invention configured as described above, the medical suture thread is configured such that the inner-filament cover layer made of MPC is formed on the outer surface of each ultrafine thread arranged inside without exposed at the outer surface of the multifilament. Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads can be reduced. Consequently, the entirety of the suture thread is easily bendable. As a result, favorable operability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the multifilament includes: a core thread having an assembly of a plurality of the ultrafine threads and arranged at a center portion of the multifilament; and an outer thread arranged outside the core thread and covering the core thread without the core thread being exposed. The inner-filament cover layer is formed on each ultrafine thread forming the core thread.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, the medical suture thread includes the core thread having the assembly of multiple ultrafine threads and arranged at the center portion of the multifilament and the outer thread arranged outside the core thread and covering the core thread without the core thread being exposed. In addition, the inner-filament cover layer is formed on each ultrafine thread forming the core thread. Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads in the core thread is reduced. Consequently, the bendability of the entirety of the suture thread is improved. As a result, favorable operability can be ensured. In this case, the core thread may be formed of linearly-arranged bundles of multiple ultrafine threads linearly arranged in parallel. Alternatively, the core thread may include a braided thread braided with the multiple ultrafine threads. Alternatively, the core thread may include a twisted thread formed of the multiple twisted ultrafine threads.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the core thread includes: a braided thread braided with the plurality of ultrafine threads; or a twisted thread in which the plurality of ultrafine threads is twisted.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, friction among the ultrafine threads of the core thread is reduced in the medical suture thread even if the core thread includes the braided thread braided with the multiple ultrafine threads or the twisted thread formed of the multiple twisted ultrafine threads. Thus, the bendability of the entirety of the suture thread is improved. As a result, favorable operability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, an outer-layer cover layer made of the 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed on an outer surface of each ultrafine thread exposed at the outer surface of the multifilament, and the inner-filament cover layer is formed to have a smaller thickness than that of the outer-layer cover layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the inner-filament cover layer is formed to have a smaller thickness than that of the outer-layer cover layer formed on the outer surface of each ultrafine thread exposed at the outer surface of the multifilament, the outer-layer cover layer being made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC). Thus, an increase in the outer diameter of the suture thread can be suppressed while the bendability of the entirety of the suture thread is improved. As a result, favorable operability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the inner-filament cover layer is formed to have a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to a total weight of a filament forming each ultrafine thread, the inner-filament cover layer being formed on the filament.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, the medical suture thread is formed such that the weight of the inner-filament cover layer is a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament formed with the inner-filament cover layer thereon. Thus, bonding among the ultrafine threads can be prevented while the probability of the medical suture thread remaining curled is reduced. Meanwhile, an increase in the outer diameter of the medical suture thread can be suppressed while the bendability of the entirety of the medical suture thread is improved. As a result, favorable operability can be ensured.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of a medical suture thread according to one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of an ultrafine thread forming each of a core thread and an outer thread in the medical suture thread shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partially-enlarged side view showing the state of a cover layer partially formed on an outer surface of an ultrafine thread forming a medical suture thread according to a variation of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, one embodiment of a medical suture thread according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of a medical suture thread <b>100</b> according to the present invention.

In this case, the thickness of the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> is set according to use application of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> or a user's preference. In the present embodiment, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> is, as in the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b>, formed on the outer surface of the filament <b>121</b><i>a </i>with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>121</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">That is, the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> has the exact same configuration as that of the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> in the present embodiment.

Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> shows, by one common view, the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> and the ultrafine thread <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(Manufacturing of Medical Suture Thread <b>100</b>)</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, the process of manufacturing the medical suture thread <b>100</b> will be described. A worker manufacturing the medical suture thread <b>100</b> first prepares the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> formed with no inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> formed with no outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>. Specifically, the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are prepared as bases of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this case, the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are manufactured by the typical technique of manufacturing a suture thread. Thus, the worker may manufacture the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>as the bases of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> by the worker oneself. Alternatively, a commercially-available filament may be purchased and obtained. In the present embodiment, the worker prepares the polyester filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>with a size of No. 11-0 (about 20 &#x3bc;m) (the standard for a suture thread according to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, the worker dips the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>in a solution (e.g., an ethanol solution) containing MPC. In this manner, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> can be formed on the surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this case, the worker can dip the filament in the solution containing MPC in a state in which the multiple filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are gathered and bundled, a roll state in which each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>is wound in an annular shape, or a state in which each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>wound in a roll shape is drawn in a linear shape. The concentration of the solution containing MPC and the time of dipping the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are respectively determined as necessary according to the thicknesses of the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> to be formed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the worker performs drying treatment and sterilization treatment for the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>taken out of the solution containing MPC. In this manner, the worker can obtain the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> formed with the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the outer surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Note that the worker provides vibration to the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>or sets a drying temperature to a high temperature upon drying of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, and in this manner, can form the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>in a patchy manner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, the worker forms the core thread <b>110</b>. Specifically, the worker twists two bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads <b>111</b> by means of a not-shown twisting machine. In this manner, the single core thread <b>110</b> is formed. In the present embodiment, the worker can form the core thread <b>110</b> with a thickness of about 0.27 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, the worker forms the outer thread <b>120</b>. Specifically, the worker braids the outer thread <b>120</b>, which is formed of five bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads <b>121</b>, on the outside of the core thread <b>110</b> by means of a not-shown braiding machine. In this manner, a single thread is formed. That is, by the step of forming the outer thread <b>120</b>, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> including the core thread <b>110</b> completely covered with the outer thread <b>120</b> is formed. The medical suture thread <b>100</b> is formed with an outer diameter of about 0.6 mm in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the worker can complete the medical suture thread <b>100</b> through the steps of sterilizing, checking, and packing the medical suture thread <b>100</b>. In this case, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is housed in a packaging container (not shown) in a state in which the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is wound in a circular ring shape. Alternatively, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> may be packed with a medical tool such as a suture needle being coupled to a tip end portion of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>. Note that the worker can form the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on a medical suture thread <b>100</b> formed with no inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and no outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, the worker processes the filaments <b>111</b><i>a </i>by means of the not-shown twisting machine. After formation of the core thread <b>110</b>, the ultrafine threads <b>121</b> are braided using the not-shown braiding machine and the filaments <b>121</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> (i.e., a half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>) is formed at an outer peripheral portion of the core thread <b>110</b>. Next, the worker dips the half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> in the solution containing MPC.In this case, the worker causes a sufficient solution to penetrate the medical suture thread <b>100</b> to each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> (each filament <b>111</b><i>a</i>) forming the core thread <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this case, the worker can intermittently change tension to be applied to the half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> in the solution containing MPC. In this manner, a sufficient solution can penetrate the medical suture thread <b>100</b> to each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> (each filament <b>111</b><i>a</i>) forming the core thread <b>110</b>. In this manner, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the outer surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Accordingly, the worker can obtain the medical suture thread <b>100</b> formed of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> including these filaments and cover layers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">(Operation of Medical Suture Thread <b>100</b>)</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, operation of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> configured as described above will be described. A user such as a doctor couples a medical tool (not shown) such as a suture needle to the medical suture thread <b>100</b> unpacked from the package. Then, the user takes medical action such as a surgery or injury treatment. Moreover, the user takes medical action such as removal of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> sutured to an affected area of a patient. In this case, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, not only the outer thread <b>120</b> but also the core thread <b>110</b> inside the outer thread <b>120</b> are arranged, and the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> made of MPC is formed as an outer layer of each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>. Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads <b>111</b> is reduced. Consequently, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is easily bendable. As a result, the user can easily operate the medical suture thread <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As can be understood from description of operation above, according to the above-described embodiment, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is configured such that the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> made of MPC is formed on the outer surface of the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> arranged inside the multifilament without the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> being exposed at the outer surface of the multifilament. Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads <b>111</b> can be reduced, and therefore, the entirety of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is easily bendable. Accordingly, favorable operability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. Various changes can be made to the above-described embodiment without departing from the object of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> is formed on the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>. Moreover, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> is formed on the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> forming the outer thread <b>120</b>. However, it may only be required that in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> is formed on the outer surface of the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> not exposed at the outer surface of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> may be formed only on the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>. That is, in the configuration of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> of the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> forming the outer thread <b>120</b> can be omitted. Alternatively, in the configuration of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> may be formed on the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>, and on the other hand, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> may be formed only on a portion of the outer thread <b>120</b> exposed at the outer surface other than a portion not exposed at the outer surface due to overlapping of the ultrafine threads <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> of the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> of the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> forming the outer thread <b>120</b> are formed with the same thickness (a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>). However, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> may be formed with different thicknesses.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> may be formed thinner than the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>, for example. With this configuration, an increase in the outer diameter of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> can be suppressed while the bendability of the entirety of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is improved. Thus, favorable operability can be ensured. The inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> may be formed thicker than the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>. With this configuration, a loss of the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> due to abrasion can be reduced.
