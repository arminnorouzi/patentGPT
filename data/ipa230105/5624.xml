The resulting abnormal heartbeat, or arrhythmia, can occur in the atria of the heart (e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF)) and/or the ventricles of the heart (e.g., ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF)). Treatments for cardiac arrhythmias attempt to address the mechanisms driving sustained and/or clinically significant episodes including, for example, stable electrical rotors, recurring electrical focal sources, reentrant electrical circuits, and/or the like. Left untreated, cardiac arrhythmias may cause serious health complications such as morbidity (e.g., syncope, stroke, and/or the like) and mortality (e.g. sudden cardiac death (SCD)).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems, methods, and articles of manufacture, including computer program products, are provided for computational cardiac depolarization and repolarization simulation library mapping for non-invasive arrhythmia risk stratification.

Currently, left ventricular ejection fraction, a technique measuring the volumetric fraction of blood ejected from the left ventricle, is used to assess a patient's risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In many instances, left ventricular ejection fraction may also be used to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation or for invasive electrophysiology study and catheter ablation. However, left ventricular ejection fraction has suboptimal sensitivity and specificity for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Moreover, left ventricular ejection fraction is also be unable to predict mortality from worsening heart failure.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) may be treated by targeting the mechanisms driving sustained and/or clinically significant episodes including, for example, stable electrical rotors, recurring electrical focal sources, reentrant electrical circuits, and/or the like. Ablation is one example treatment for cardiac arrhythmias in which radiofrequency, cryogenic temperatures, ultrasound, laser energy, pulsed field ablation, and/or radiation (e.g. stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR)) may be applied to the source of the cardiac arrhythmia. The resulting lesions may alleviate cardiac arrhythmia by disrupting and/or eliminating the erratic electric signals causing the abnormal heart activation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A major challenge in arrhythmia management is the difficulty in predicting individual risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Presently, the majority of ventricular arrhythmia events occur in &#x201c;low risk&#x201d; populations. Thus, a large majority of patients (e.g., 55% of men and 65% of women) have sudden cardiac death (SCD) as their first presentation of increased arrhythmia risk. Furthermore, risk stratification in patients with inherited cardiomyopathies remains challenging. The risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with inherited familial cardiomyopathies is contingent on many factors including the electrophysiological alterations (e.g., conduction slowing, action potential morphology and restitution, intracellular calcium handling, and mechanoelectrical feedback) specific to the cardiomyopathy that can serve as a trigger to the arrhythmia and provide the myocardial structural remodeling (e.g., hypertrophy, fibrosis, fibrofatty deposits) that perpetuates the arrhythmia. The variable penetrance and/or unknown significance of many cardiomyopathy variants further complicates the assessment of arrhythmia risk. Traditionally, risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with genetic cardiomyopathies is assessed via left ventricular ejection fraction or scoring criteria. In practice, however, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of these conventional methods leave patients uncertain about their arrhythmia risk and suitable treatments (e.g., implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy or catheter ablation).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, monitoring the initiation and maintenance of QT-prolonging drug therapies, including antiarrhythmic medications such as dofetilide and sotalol, remains challenging given a patient's individualized responses to sodium or potassium channel blocking agents. Such drug therapies, which delay ventricular recovery (or repolarization), may protract the patient's QT interval. Thus, prior attempts have focused on prolongation of the QT interval or corrected QT (QTc) interval on the patient's surface electrocardiogram. Nevertheless, although these metrics assess important physiologic changes, sensitivity and specificity to accurately monitor QT-prolonging drug therapies remain suboptimal.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In light of the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of conventional methodologies for assessing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and methods to identify arrhythmia locations which either initiate or sustained cardiac arrhythmias, various implementations of the present disclosure include a rapid and noninvasive tool that provides a more accurate assessment of ventricular arrhythmia risks across diverse groups of patients and localize regions which may be pro-arrhythmic. In some example embodiments, an assessment engine may be configured to provide a patient-specific assessment of pro-arrhythmic factors. In particular, the assessment engine may stratify the risk of cardiac arrhythmias based on a spatial repolarization gradient, which corresponds to the magnitude by which the refractory period of neighboring regions in the myocardium changes as a function of distance through cardiac tissue. For example, the assessment engine may identify, based at least on adjacent myocardium areas exhibiting above-threshold differences in rates of cardiac repolarization (e.g., a first area of long repolarization that is immediately adjacent to a second area of short repolarization), a potentially pro-arrhythmic condition that is likely to result in an electrical wavebreak, reentry, and life-threatening arrhythmia.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a system diagram illustrating an example of a risk stratification system <b>100</b>, in accordance with some example embodiments.

For example, the computational library <b>125</b> may include cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) for various cardiac geometries, cardiac orientations, scar configurations, degrees of cardiac fibrosis and scar, depolarization patterns, activation types (e.g. left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, left posterior fascicular block, premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation), and combinations thereof. Alternatively and/or additionally, the computational library <b>125</b> may include cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) for various cardiac geometries, cardiac orientations, scar configurations, degrees of cardiac fibrosis and scar, depolarization patterns, activation types (e.g. left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, left posterior fascicular block, premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation), and combinations thereof.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows data tracings for the same lead (e.g., Lead III) but at different sampling rates (e.g., 500 hertz and 1000 hertz). In some example embodiments, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may process data from each lead individually. In doing so, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may generate corresponding graphs and identify one or more peaks, peak onsets, and peak offsets present in the data. Moreover, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may extract one or more peak, peak onset, and/or peak offset points to determine measurements such as QT intervals, QT dispersion, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some example embodiments, prior to matching the patient's electrocardiogram to one or more simulations in the computational library <b>125</b>, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may first identify a subset of the simulations corresponding to the patient's anatomy such that the subsequent matching is performed within the subset of simulations instead of the entire computational library <b>125</b>. For example, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may identify the subset of simulations corresponding to the patient's anatomy based on patient specific clinical data such as patient demographics and cardiac imaging. Examples of relevant imaging modalities include cardiac computed tomography cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sestamibi imaging (nuclear scintigraphy), cardiac positron emission tomography and computed tomography scanning (cardiac PET/CT), 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional echocardiography, 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping incorporating voltage mapping, electrogram mapping, activation mapping, entrainment mapping, isochronal late activation mapping, and impedance mapping.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Cardiac imaging data may be used to determine the locations of scar tissue, borderzone tissue, and normal tissue in the patient. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a 3-dimensional volume rendering from <b>4</b>-dimensional computed tomography (CT) with areas corresponding to borderzone tissue (e.g., between scar tissue and normal tissue) denoted by the dotted line. The area within the circle exhibits a relative lack of motion, which corresponds to dense scar tissue. Thus, in combination with patient demographics, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may use cardiac imaging data to eliminate simulations that are associated anatomies not sufficiently similar to the patient's anatomy and thus cannot be a match for the patient's electrical recordings. Doing so may increase the computational speed and efficiency of the subsequent matching to identify simulations that match the patient's electrical recordings.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some instances where the patient's anatomy is not well represented in the computational library <b>125</b>, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may generate a custom computational library for the patient that includes one or more patient specific cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) and cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations). For example, a custom computational library may be generated when the clinical data (e.g., demographics, cardiac imaging, and/or the like) associated with the simulations included in the computational library <b>125</b> are not sufficiently similar to the clinical data associated with the patient. As such, a custom computational library for the patient may be generated based on patient specific clinical data such as patient demographics and cardiac imaging.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some example embodiments, a variety of technique may be applied in order to match one or more cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) and cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) to the patient's electrical recordings. For example, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may apply one or more machine learning models trained to identify one or more cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) and cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) matching the patient's electrical recordings. Examples of suitable machine learning models include a neural network, a regression model, an instance-based model, a regularization model, a decision tree, a random forest, a Bayesian model, a clustering model, an associative model, a dimensionality reduction model, an ensemble model, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In doing so, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may compare spatial data and/or temporal data. For instance, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording may include time series data in which the voltages measured by the electrodes are recorded at regular time intervals (e.g., every millisecond; 1000 Hz). To identify simulations matching the patient's 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may apply a recurrent neural network (e.g., a long short term memory (LSTM) network and/or the like) capable of recognizing patterns present across two or more sequences of measurements. The recurrent neural network (RNN) may be trained, for example, to detect QRS complexes in one or more cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) that match those present in the patient's 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Alternatively and/or additionally, the recurrent neural network may be trained to detect T waves in one or more cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) that match those present in the patient's 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Upon identifying (or generating) the cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) and cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) matching the patient's electrical recordings, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may apply the simulations to generate a 3-dimensional assessment for the patient. For example, the assessment engine <b>110</b> may determine, based at least on the cardiac depolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular activation simulations) and cardiac repolarization simulations (e.g., ventricular recovery simulations) matching the patient's electrical recordings, the magnitude and/or location(s) of the regions of increased spatial repolarization gradient, slow conduction, conduction block, or early activation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the cardiac repolarization phase of a patient with ventricular arrhythmias may exhibit one or more abnormalities that are not present in the cardiac repolarization of a control patient. For instance, the presence of neighboring myocardium areas with above-threshold different rates of cardiac repolarization (e.g., a first area of long repolarization that is immediately adjacent to a second area of short repolarization) may be a potentially pro-arrhythmic condition. Sites of slow conduction are also known to perpetuate certain types of arrhythmias. And sites of early activation may be locations of pro-arrhythmic tissue.
