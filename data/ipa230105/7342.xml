Expected physiologically observable states relating to the media content are generated based on the creative intent input. An audiovisual content signal with the media content and media metadata comprising the physiologically observable states is provided to a playback apparatus. The audiovisual content signal causes the playback device to use physiological monitoring signals to determine, with respect to a viewer, assessed physiologically observable states relating to the

It should be noted that this overview is not an extensive or exhaustive summary of aspects of the example embodiment. Moreover, it should be noted that this overview is not intended to be understood as identifying any particularly significant aspects or elements of the example embodiment, nor as delineating any scope of the example embodiment in particular, nor the invention in general. This overview merely presents some concepts that relate to the example embodiment in a condensed and simplified format, and should be understood as merely a conceptual prelude to a more detailed description of example embodiments that follows below. Note that, although separate embodiments are discussed herein, any combination of embodiments and/or partial embodiments discussed herein may be combined to form further embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0029">Techniques as described herein can be used to modify or adapt audiovisual content being rendered by playback devices to audiences or viewers for the purpose of preserving the creative intent based on which the audiovisual content is/was created.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0030">More specifically, the rendering of the audiovisual content is affected by, or adapted to, an assessment of the viewer's internal physiological state (e.g., emotion, cognition, attention locus, etc.) which is obtained or deduced by various types of monitoring of the viewer's physiological aspects. This assessment of the viewer's internal physiological state is combined with narrative and emotional expectation that is expected and/or intended by creatives of the audiovisual content and that is inserted into media metadata for the audiovisual content during the audiovisual content and metadata production stages (or post-production stages).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0031">The creative intent of the audiovisual content, as inserted into or represented by the media metadata, includes emotion and narrative goals of creators of the audiovisual content. Additionally, optionally or alternatively, the media metadata includes instructions for modifying received an audiovisual signal from which the media content and metadata is received by the playback devices.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0032">Under techniques as described herein, affective computing such as artificial emotional intelligence (or emotion AI) may be used to recognize, interpret, simulate, estimate or predict human emotion, understanding, behavior, etc. Computational models (e.g., algorithms, methods, procedures, operations, etc.) can be used to consolidate multiple sources of physiological monitoring signals as well as interactions with the media metadata and the playback device used for final rendering, reproduction and/or transduction of the source signal that contains media content depicting the audiovisual content to the viewer.

Thus, two emotional states can be possibly expected by the creatives for a given viewer, depending on which sides the viewer is on. A first emotional state to be expected by the creatives for the viewer may be &#x201c;sympathy&#x201d; if the viewer's chosen side is losing.

The playback devices use both the E&#x26;N metadata and the physiological monitoring and assessment to derive and make media content adjustments or modifications to the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) as needed to preserve or avoid distortions to the creator's intent while rendering the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) to an audience.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0056">The E&#x26;N metadata may comprise one or more metadata portions, respectively, for one or more data portions in the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) to be rendered at one or more time points, one or more time intervals, in one or more scenes, etc. Each metadata portion in the E&#x26;N metadata of the media metadata (<b>117</b>-<b>1</b>) may specify a physiologically observable state such as an expected emotion state and/or an expected cognition state (or simply E&#x26;N state) for a respective data portion in the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) to be rendered at a time point, a time interval, a scene, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0057">The expected (or target) E&#x26;N state may be specified in one or more monitoring-device specific ways.

The creator (or artists) may choose a certain color on purpose, whether by whim, feeling, personal color harmony understanding, symbolism, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0080">A system as described herein seeks to match the intended aesthetics in various rendering environments. In operational scenarios in which certain rendering options as intended by the creator are not available or technically feasible in an actual rendering environment, the system can determine whether there are other acceptable rendering options available in the actual rendering environment that still meet the creative intent of the artists. For example, changing a musical key to accommodate a singer's range is often acceptable as an alternative for preserving or respecting the creative intent. Analogous or alternative visual elements may also be used as alternatives for preserving or respecting the creative intent.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0081">In some operational scenarios, asymmetry of aesthetics may become a meaningful issue. For example, it may be an acceptable rendering option to reduce the color saturation on image content playback if the playback device is limited in display capabilities; however, it may not always be an acceptable rendering option to boost the color saturation even if the playback device has a larger range than that used to set or express the creative intent.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0082">Message. The combination of the storyline, evoked emotions, aesthetics, etc., may be for the overall purpose of conveying a message. However, there may exist cases in which the creative intent only expects to focus on the three categories or aspects as identified above and is free of an overall message.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0083">Resume. Audiovisual content can contain creative aspects, features and details that indicate or show off technical or creative quality that may only be appreciated by experts or connoisseurs, who may represent a margin or a tiny fraction of an overall content consumer population intended by the content creator.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0064" num="0084">Techniques as described herein may or may not address all five categories or aspects of creative intent as discussed above. In some operational scenarios, a system as described herein may address only a subset of the five categories or aspects of creative intent, such as the first two: the narrative information aspect and the emotional expectations or effects aspect. Additionally, optionally or alternatively, the system may address the third aspect, aesthetics, either by way of the narrative information aspect when the aesthetics are deemed important to narrating the story (e.g., symbolic colors, etc.) or by way of the emotional expectations or effect aspect when the aesthetics are deemed important to influencing or inducing the emotion expectation or effect.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">4. Emotions and Representations</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0085">There are several taxonomies on emotion, ranging from a relatively small number such as the six from Elkman theory, to others containing more nuances and including almost thirty different emotions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0086">Some emotions have corresponding facial expressions, while others involve deeper internal feelings without visible signs to naked eyes or other vision techniques. The emotions that have&#x2014;or are accompanied with corresponding&#x2014;facial expressions may be considered as a distinct set, since those can be the most easily assessed in some operational scenarios. For example, a camera pointed at audience or a solo viewer and facial expression analysis software may be used to obtain estimates of those emotions accompanied by corresponding facial expressions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0087">TABLE 1 below shows four human emotion taxonomies (with their respective numerosity in parentheses) as well as an example subset that may be analyzed or determined from facial expressions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Elkman</entry><entry>Plutchik</entry><entry>Core</entry><entry>Cowan</entry><entry>Facial</entry></row><row><entry>Theory (6)</entry><entry>Theory (8)</entry><entry>anonymous (7)</entry><entry>Theory (27)</entry><entry>Expressions (9)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Joy</entry><entry>Joy</entry><entry>Happiness (joy)</entry><entry>Joy</entry><entry>Happiness (joy)</entry></row><row><entry>Surprise</entry><entry>Surprise</entry><entry>Surprise</entry><entry>Surprise</entry><entry>Surprise</entry></row><row><entry>Sadness</entry><entry>Sadness</entry><entry>Sadness</entry><entry>Sadness</entry><entry>Sadness</entry></row><row><entry>Anger</entry><entry>Anger</entry><entry>Anger</entry><entry>Anger</entry><entry>Anger</entry></row><row><entry>Disgust</entry><entry>Disgust</entry><entry>Disgust</entry><entry>Disgust</entry><entry>Disgust</entry></row><row><entry>Fear</entry><entry>Fear</entry><entry>Fear</entry><entry>Fear</entry><entry>Fear</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Anticipation</entry><entry/><entry>Excitement (possibly</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Anticipation)</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Trust</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Contempt</entry><entry>Contempt</entry><entry>Contempt</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Calmness</entry><entry>Neutral</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Boredom</entry><entry>Boredom</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Awkwardness</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Anxiety</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Horror</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Romance</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Sexual desire</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Nostalgia</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Confusion</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Entrancement (possibly</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>amazement)</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Amusement</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Adoration</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Admiration</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Awe</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Aesthetic appreciation</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Craving</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Interest (possibly</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>anticipation)</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Satisfaction</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Relief</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0069" num="0088">Other familiar emotions not cited by the specific theories as listed in TABLE 1 above may include, without limitation, vigilance, grief, rage, loathing, ecstasy, etc. In some operational scenarios, the non-cited emotions may be approximately mapped to other corresponding synonyms in the lists of TABLE 1 above. For example, several emotions may be mapped as follow: vigilance &#x2dc; interest, grief&#x2dc; sadness, rage &#x2dc; anger, loathing &#x2dc; contempt, ecstasy &#x2dc; romance or sexual desire or amazement, etc., where &#x201c;&#x2dc;&#x201d; in between two emotions denotes a mapping from the preceding emotion to the subsequent emotion. Sometimes a change in the word for an emotion is just a magnitude change of the same emotion. For example, grief is a stronger amplitude version of sadness.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0089">As used herein, the term &#x201c;immersiveness&#x201d; may mean that, while viewing&#x2014;which, as used herein, may include visually seeing and/or audibly hearing as well as possibly perceiving motion&#x2014;media content (e.g., audio content, visual content, etc.) as rendered by a playback device, the viewer feels as if actually placed in the world of the story depicted in the media content.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0090">Immersiveness may be achieved through realistic image and audio rendering capabilities in a rendering environment, such as wider field of views (FOV), wider color gamut, increased (luminance) dynamic range, higher bit-precision, higher fidelity positionalized sound, and so forth. By way of comparison, a viewer in a rendering environment with relatively low image and audio rendering capabilities may constantly see an image border from a narrow FOV presentation on a small screen display, thereby being prevented from having a feeling of immersiveness.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0091">Hence, image and audio rendering capabilities may be further improved to avoid or reduce visual or audible distractions that are relatively easily caused by lower image and audio rendering capabilities. However, it should be noted that, while technologically achieved immersiveness and viewer engagement can often go hand-in-hand, the correlation between rendering capabilities and immersiveness is not absolute and does not work for all cases. For example, relatively &#x201c;low&#x201d; technological capabilities such as a book could still cause a reader to feel thoroughly immersed in the story depicted in the book if the story were told in the book in a compelling and engaging way. Conversely, relatively high technological capabilities such as a VR game in a high-end professional rendering environment could still fail to engage or cause a game user to feel immersed if the VR game were uninspiringly derivative or boring.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0092">While not explicitly accounted for in the emotions of TABLE 1 above, immersiveness can be of importance to media ecosystems (or rendering environments) and playback devices in many operational scenarios as a magnifier of some or all emotions as identified in TABLE 1. Hence immersiveness need not be directly or separately assessed/measured/quantified but rather exerts its impact in these operational scenarios by way of detectable, assessible, measurable and/or quantifiable emotions that have been magnified or augmented by immersiveness.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0093">An emotion as described herein may be represented in a variety of ways. In some operational scenarios, an emotion may be represented discretely. For example, an emotion may be characterized or assessed into a specific emotion type (e.g., through face tracking and facial expression analysis, etc.) such as one identified in TABLE 1 above and have various levels of intensity such as five (5) levels, fewer than five (5) levels, or more than (5) levels. The various levels of intensity for the emotion may collapse to neutral at the lowest in physiological state assessment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0094">In some operational scenarios, an emotion may be characterized or assessed with continuous values. For example, an emotion may be represented or modeled with two Cartesian axes respectively representing arousal and valence. Arousal is essentially a magnitude or level of intensity as discussed above, whereas valence determines whether human feeling in connection with the emotion is positive or negative. For example, a positive value measurement of valence as obtained with one or more physiological monitoring probes or sensors may indicate a positive feeling, whereas a negative value measurement of valence as obtained with the physiological monitoring probes or sensors may indicate a negative feeling.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0095">This coordinate-based emotion modeling can be useful as some physiological measurements and/or assessment obtained through physiological monitoring probes or sensors and corresponding computer-implemented analyses can only identify, quantify, measure and/or assess arousal and valence levels of underlying emotion(s), depending on available physiological monitoring and assessment technologies. GSR is an example in which only arousal and valence of an emotion may be assessed at this point.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0096">Additionally, optionally or alternatively, a system as described herein can operate in conjunction with other types of emotion modeling or representations&#x2014;such as a standardized model associated with IAPS (interactive affective picture system) for facial emotions. Such emotion modeling or representation nay be used to identify, quantify, measure and/or assess arousal and valence as well as possibly other aspects (e.g., dominance, etc.) for underlying emotion(s).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">5. Physiological Monitoring and Assessment</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0097">Techniques as described herein can operate with any combination of a wide variety of physiological monitoring and/or assessment technologies to monitor and/or assess the viewer's emotion state, cognition state, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0098">Physiological monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes may include, but are not necessarily limited to only, one or more of: head mounted displays (HMDs) with monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes. monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes around eyes, earbuds with (or in-ear) monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes, EOG devices, EEG devices, eye gaze trackers, gas content monitors, pupillometry monitors, monitoring devices deployed with specific playback devices, monitoring devices deployed with specific rendering environments, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0099">Some monitoring/assessment technologies can be incorporated directly on an image display that is a part of a playback device or system, while some other monitoring/assessment technologies can be incorporated through separate, auxiliary, peripheral, smart earbuds and/or smartwatch devices operating in conjunction with a playback device. In a media consumption application with a relatively large audience such as in a cinema or theater, physiological monitoring/assessment technologies ranging from one or more cameras facing the audience, to sensors placed in the seats, to measurements of the overall cinema or theater such as gas content or temperature, etc., may be implemented or used to monitor and/or assess multiple viewers' collective and/or individual emotion states, cognition states, etc.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0100">A system as described herein can generate individual physiological state assessment as well as group physiological state assessment. Example physiological monitoring/assessment techniques include, but are not necessarily limited to only, one or more of: eye gaze tracking via EOG, cognition state via EEG, auditory attention via EEG, emotional and/or narrative state via pupilometry, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0101">Physiological state assessment may be broken into two categories or aspects, cognition and emotion, which may be mapped to the narrative information aspect and the emotion expects or effect aspect of the creative intent, respectively, as previously identified. Physiological state assessment of cognition relates to cognitive load, which indicates whether and how much the viewer is struggling to comprehend elements important to the storyline.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0102">Engagement is an internal state of attention important to emotion and cognition. The internal state of attention may, but is not limited to, be measured through eye trackers such as mapping the viewer's gaze position onto specific audio or visual elements in rendered media content. Such eye trackers may be built into an image display (e.g., TV, mobile display, computer monitor, etc.) in a video display application, virtual reality (VR) application, an augmented reality (AR) application, etc.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0103">The viewer's engagement (or internal state of attention) with the depicted story can be (qualitatively and/or quantitatively) assessed with EEG by way of P300 evoked potential responses. A reduction of electric field potential as determined through the P300 evoked potential responses indicates engagement or attention on the part of the viewer than otherwise.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0104">In some operational scenarios, engagement may be considered as a subset of emotion. In these operational scenarios, expected engagement levels (or attention levels) to various visual and/or audio elements rendered by playback devices may be specified in media metadata as emotion expectations metadata.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0105">In some other operational scenarios, rather than being considered as a subset of emotion, engagement (or attention) may be considered as subset of cognition. Expected engagement levels (or attention levels) to various visual and/or audio elements rendered by playback devices may be specified in media metadata as narrative information (or cognition) metadata.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0106">Techniques as described herein can be implemented to support different approaches of classifying, representing and/or measuring emotions and dimensions/levels/intensities thereof. In some operational scenarios, emotions may be monitored, measured and/or assessed (e.g., by way of physiological monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes, etc.) in terms of (e.g., continuous values of, ranges of continuous values of, etc.) valence and arousal. In some operational scenarios, emotions may be monitored, measured and/or assessed (e.g., by way of physiological monitoring devices/sensors/electrodes, etc.) in terms of (e.g., discrete type values of, discrete integer representations of, classifications of, etc.) a set of distinct (albeit related) emotions.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0107">Certain emotions may be read from acquired imagery&#x2014;such as through visible light, thermal imaging cameras, etc.&#x2014;of the viewer's face. One or more facial expression methods, algorithms and/or procedures may be used to assess or read the viewer's internal state or emotion through facial expressions captured in the acquired imagery. Reading the viewer's internal state or emotion from thermal images rather than visible light images may provide or afford a relatively deep understanding of the viewer's internal state or emotion than possible with reading visible light images, as visible light images may be masked by a &#x201c;poker face&#x201d; of the viewer, whereas the thermal images may not be so easily masked by such &#x201c;poker face.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0089" num="0108">To assess non-visible emotions, an electroencephalography (EEG) sensory data collection method may be implemented with a skullcap disposed of electrodes (e.g., dozens of electrodes, just a handful of electrodes, etc.) touching the viewer's head at multiple places. An EEG sensory data collection method may also be implemented through electrodes deployed, embedded and/or disposed with a headband, over-the-ear headphones (or cans), a part of a hat, etc. In some applications such as VR applications and the like, a multi-sensor EEG system or assembly can be built into a head-mounted display (HMD). Also, relatively innocuous ways to collect EEG sensory data can be developed or implemented by way of electrodes placed in smart earbuds.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0109">As previously noted, some of the physiological monitoring/assessment technologies allow for, or support, readings of (e.g., only, with other dimensions such as dominance, etc.) arousal and valence, such as GSR, which also may be referred to as ectodermal activity (EDA), skin conductance, electrodermal response (EDR), psychogalvanic reflex (PGR), skin conductance response (SCR), sympathetic skin response (SSR), skin conductance level (SCL), or the like. Heart-rate and respiration monitoring are physiological monitoring/assessment examples that can (e.g., only, etc.) monitor or assess arousal levels of underlying emotions.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">6. Metadata Control and Physiological Monitoring</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0110">Media rendering operations as described herein may be under metadata control. As previously noted, media metadata may be inserted and/or embedded with corresponding media content in a coded bitstream, a media file, etc., that is transmitted and/or delivered to downstream recipient devices such as playback devices. The media metadata may include metadata portions such as those generated for Dolby Vision, Samsung's HDR10+, Technicolor Advanced HDR, Dolby ATMOS, etc. Some or all the media metadata can be inserted and embedded with the media content in the coded bitstream, media file, etc. A recipient playback device may use the media metadata to adapt or alter (luminance) dynamic range, color saturation, hue, spatial filtering, etc., in relation to an actual image display in a target environment and use the audio metadata to alter audio rendering/reproduction with an actual audio speaker/channel configuration deployed in the target environment.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0111">The media metadata further comprise E&#x26;N metadata such as expected emotion states, expected cognitive states (e.g., cognitive loads, etc.), content modification metadata, and the like. Emotional expectations metadata in the E&#x26;N metadata may be used to describe a set of emotions as listed in TABLE 1 above or a set of emotional dimensions such as arousal and valence. In some operational scenarios, Some or all emotions in the set of emotions described in the emotional expectations metadata can be monitored, measured, estimated, determined and/or assessed using facial expression extraction technologies. Some or all emotions in the set of emotions described in the emotional expectations metadata can be monitored, measured, estimated, determined and/or assessed using EEG, pupilometry, other physiological state assessment techniques such as thermal and GSR, combinations of different physiological state assessment techniques, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0112">In a media content and metadata production stage, not all emotions as listed in TABLE 1 above need to be used, included and/or described in the emotional expectations metadata. In a media consumption stage (e.g., implemented with playback devices), not all emotions need to be monitored, measured, estimated, determined and/or assessed by a media playback device. Some emotions may be more applicable in a specific rendering environment with a specific playback device than others. Some emotions may be more applicable to a specific viewer than others.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0113">It should be noted that different technology fields or disciplines may use different terms of art that are synonymous or have substantial overlap in meaning. Some terms of art tend to be used by creatives (or creators of media content), whereas some other terms of art tend to be used neuroscience professionals or experts. As compared with colloquial terms or usages, terms of art can have advantages of specificity in a discipline or field. Terms most appropriate to those interacting with each particular portion of a system implementing techniques as described herein are used in this document. Thus, for steps involving the insertion of metadata, as would be done by creatives in the media production stage, terms more familiar to the creatives are used. By comparison, for steps involving processing of physiological signals, terms more appropriate to neuroscience are used.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0114">An example term with overlapping meanings is a term &#x201c;confusion&#x201d;, which is related to cognition state and confusion estimate. The term &#x201c;confusion&#x201d; is a more appropriate term to use with creatives, while the term &#x201c;cognitive load&#x201d; with overlapping meaning is a more appropriate term to use with neuroscientists who may use the latter term to describe or indicate a level of confusion. As a term of art, cognitive load has additional specificity in neuroscience as the term includes gradations from very stressed confusion to mental states simply requiring attention.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">7.

In this example, the viewer is watching in a home theater with a full immersive sound system (e.g., ATMOS sound system, etc.) and a large high-end image display (e.g., 105 inch image display, etc.) that uses standing glass vibration to reproduce or emanate sounds from received audio data in the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) directly from the screen of the image display with a 3&#xd7;3 positional grid resolution (e.g., Crystal Sound technology, etc.).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0214">In many operational scenarios, a low tolerance snap option is adopted in immersive audio processing.

One portion of the complex crystalline silver texture is changing shape from crystalline to biomorphic dendritic shapes, while corresponding sounds&#x2014;represented by or depicted as emitting from an audio object of interest&#x2014;from that activity is changing to more of fluidic pitch-bending having subtle human voice undertones (implying the &#x201c;vital spirit&#x201d; Newton was seeking). More specifically, these sounds are localized to the image region depicting the anomalous region of the dendritic growth in the above-mentioned portion of the complex crystalline silver texture.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0216">In the large-display rendering environment, before the camera slowly zooms into the anomalous region to eventually show a convex reflection of Newton's entranced face, the anomalous region depicted in the image region only occupies a small part of images rendered on the large image display (or screen) and thus can easily be overlooked. As the image display is relatively large, even though the viewer is looking in the general neighborhood of the dendritic growth region, the viewer's gaze position is still slightly off so the anomalous region (or the expected attention locus) falls just outside the viewer's perifovea.

The high tolerance snap option avoids or prevents discretization into a single speaker element at a single position that would likely cause the audio object position (or the position of the AOI) in the audio rendering to be mismatched from the relatively small image region depicting the anomalous region on the screen that is supposed to emit the same sounds.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0223">In the present example, the snap option to accurately place the audio object position and tolerate timber quality deterioration has been set or selected by the creatives as the signal modification option in the rankings of various possible signal modification options.

Operational parameters used to increase the volume, reduce the reverb, a positional tolerance used in selecting the speaker, etc., may be set dependent on a magnitude of the difference between the viewer's expected attention locus and the viewer's assessed attention locus.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0228">This large-display rendering environment may be contrasted with a small-display rendering environment in which a viewer views the same scene on a small image display (or screen).

More specifically, as previously noted, the viewer's assessed state(s) corresponding to the viewer's expected states can be obtained by receiving and processing the (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) physiological monitoring signals generated by available physiological devices/sensors operating in the rendering environment with the playback device. Thus, the viewer's assessed state(s) such as assessed arousal can be generated by way of the available physiological devices/sensors such as EEG electrodes, GSR sensors, etc., and compared with the viewer's expected state(s). Differences between the viewer's assessed and expected state(s) such as assessed and expected arousals can be used as negative feedback by the closed-loop system implemented by the playback device in the content playback to attempt to achieve a zero divergence between the viewer's assessed and expected state(s), subject to a state difference threshold in some operational scenarios.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0253">It should be noted that the viewer's assessed or expected state(s) are not limited to only the assessed or expected physiological responses of the viewer such as arousal as measured by a specific type of physiological monitoring device/sensor/tool.

It should be noted that, in various embodiments, (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) media content adjustments/modifications may be carried out with respect to other luminance related characteristics such as max, min and average luminance values, luminance values of specific image regions, specific objects, specific characters, background, etc., based on received media content and metadata produced in a production stage and (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) physiological monitoring. Additionally, optionally or alternatively, (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) media content adjustments/modifications may be carried out with respect to other visual characteristics such as color precisions, saturations, hues, spatial resolutions, image refresh rates, zoom-in and/or -out operations, etc., based on received media content and metadata produced in a production stage and (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) physiological monitoring. Additionally, optionally or alternatively, (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) media content adjustments/modifications and related rendering operations may be carried out with respect to audio characteristics, motion-related characteristics, tactile characteristics, etc., based on received media content and metadata produced in a production stage and (e.g., real time, near real time, etc.) physiological monitoring. Additionally, optionally or alternatively, different release versions that support different combinations of types of media content adjustments or modifications and/or that support different combinations of types of physiological monitoring can be produced and consumed by different types of playback devices in different rendering environments.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0255">A media production system implementing techniques as described herein can interact with creatives at different levels to generate media content (e.g., <b>117</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, etc.) and media metadata (e.g., <b>117</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, etc.). For example, semantic expressions (indicating expected states at various time points or scenes of a content timeline) in user input as provided by the creatives can be received, extracted, transformed, embedded, and/or implemented in the media content (<b>117</b>-<b>2</b>) and the media metadata (<b>117</b>-<b>1</b>). A viewer's emotional or narrative responses corresponding to (or associated with) the expected states extracted and/or translated from the semantic expressions can be assessed through physiological monitoring while the media content is being dynamically adapted and rendered to the viewer. For example, the viewer's cognitive load at various time points or scenes corresponding to expected narrative states extracted and/or translated from the semantic expressions (e.g., in storyboard information, in creatives' edits, etc.) can be assessed through physiological monitoring to result in media content adjustments/modifications (e.g., increase dialog volume, increase dialog's signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) that is particularly suited to converge the viewer's assessed narrative states to the expected narrative states.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0256">Techniques as described herein can be used to prevent blindly making media content modifications that are not necessary for converging to the expected states and to make individually different media content modifications depending on the viewer, the viewer's playback device, a rendering environment in which the viewer's playback device is operating, and so forth. Thus, for a first viewer with hearing problems affecting the first viewer's narrative states or cognitive loads, dialog volume may be increased. For a second viewer in a noisy rendering environment, dialog signal-to-noise ratio may be increased, instead of raising dialog volume to cause the second viewer to feel that the dialog volume is too loud. For a third viewer with a playback device with headphones that effectively shields ambient noises, dialog volume may be lowered. Other factors such as ambient light, reverb, echo, etc., may also be taken into account in determining a specific type and a specific adjustment magnitude of media content adjustment/modification. In some operational scenarios, the specific type and/or the specific adjustment magnitude of media content adjustment/modification may be determined or generated fully automatically without user input from the creatives other than the semantic expressions provided by the creatives. In various embodiments, none, some or all selection factors, opt-in options, opt-out options, scales, thresholds, lower and upper limits, etc., used to determine or generate the specific type and/or the specific adjustment magnitude of media content adjustment/modification may be exposed through user interfaces to, and wholly or partly controlled by, the creatives or associated artistic and/or engineering professionals (or users). Additionally, optionally or alternatively, more or fewer controls may be given to the creatives working in different fields. In some operational scenarios, as compared with audio professionals, video professionals who are more familiar with how contrast, saturation, etc., impact expected emotional and/or narrative states of a audience/viewer may be given more controls, for example through user interfaces, storyboards, etc., to manipulate visual characteristics and visual characteristics and responses to visual characteristics represented in the media content and metadata.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0257">In a production stage (e.g., <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, etc.), media content (e.g., <b>117</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, etc.) and media metadata (e.g., <b>117</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, etc.) may be created in relation to a reference rendering environment (e.g., a cinema, a home theater, a tablet computer, a mobile handset, etc.).

Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>506</b> causes processor <b>504</b> to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0276">The term &#x201c;storage media&#x201d; as used herein refers to any non-transitory media that store data and/or instructions that cause a machine to operation in a specific fashion. Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and/or volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <b>510</b>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>506</b>. Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0277">Storage media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media. Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media. For example, transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>502</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0278">Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <b>504</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <b>500</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus <b>502</b>. Bus <b>502</b> carries the data to main memory <b>506</b>, from which processor <b>504</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>506</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>510</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0279">Computer system <b>500</b> also includes a communication interface <b>518</b> coupled to bus <b>502</b>. Communication interface <b>518</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>520</b> that is connected to a local network <b>522</b>. For example, communication interface <b>518</b> may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface <b>518</b> may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <b>518</b> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0280">Network link <b>520</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>520</b> may provide a connection through local network <b>522</b> to a host computer <b>524</b> or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>526</b>. ISP <b>526</b> in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; <b>528</b>. Local network <b>522</b> and Internet <b>528</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>520</b> and through communication interface <b>518</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>500</b>, are example forms of transmission media.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0281">Computer system <b>500</b> can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <b>520</b> and communication interface <b>518</b>. In the Internet example, a server <b>530</b> might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet <b>528</b>, ISP <b>526</b>, local network <b>522</b> and communication interface <b>518</b>.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0282">The received code may be executed by processor <b>504</b> as it is received, and/or stored in storage device <b>510</b>, or other non-volatile storage for later execution.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">14.
