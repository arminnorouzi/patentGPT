Some of these water filtration systems typically use water filters (e.g., a replaceable water filter cartridge) for filtering any water dispensed therefrom. Traditional water filter cartridges are provided with a filtering media, for example, a block of activated carbon or other granular filtration media, within a casing of the water filter cartridge to enhance water filtration capability. These traditional water filter cartridges also include water ports for feeding and dispensing water at least partially disposed in the casing with the filtering media. The water filter's filtering media can adsorb or remove contaminants such as sand, rust, and cysts within the flow of water prior to delivering water and/or ice to a user (e.g., via the refrigerator's water dispenser or ice maker).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the filtration process, and specifically, the flow path and flow rate of existing systems, the water filtering process is generally slow, which in some instances, may compromise the water filters performance, for example, due to an over saturation of the water filter with the filtered contaminates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is an unmet need for an improved water filter to further enhance water filtration by improving the filtering process flow rate and speed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an exemplary embodiment, a water filter for use with an appliance is provided.

The housing cap includes an upper portion, a lower portion, and a channel formed through the upper portion and the lower portion. The water filter also includes an interface adapter accommodated in the channel. The interface adapter includes a side wall vertically extending from an upper surface of the interface adapter and partially around a perimeter of the upper surface. The adapter also includes a projection vertically extending from the upper surface. The projection is integrally formed with the upper surface and a portion of the side wall.

In some embodiment, when the interface adapter <b>200</b> and the filtering member are coupled together, the filtering media interface <b>206</b> may surround the upper surface and a circumference of the filtering member.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inserting portion <b>110</b> may be inserted into the hollow portion of the filtering member such that it is in contact with an inner surface of the filtering member so that the interface adapter <b>200</b> is capable of being fixedly mounted on the upper surface of the filtering member. The inside portion of the inserting portion <b>110</b> may be hollow such that it is capable of communicating with a filter outlet flow path formed on the intermediate portion <b>210</b>. Accordingly, the purified water flowing into the hollow portion of the filtering member of the filtering member may pass through the inserting portion <b>110</b>, the filter outlet flow path and filter outlet port and discharged through an opening of the inserting portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The interface step portion <b>224</b> may protrude from the upper surface of the filtering media interface <b>206</b>. The interface step portion <b>224</b> may have a smaller diameter than the filtering media interface <b>206</b>. The intermediate portion <b>210</b> may extend from the center of the interface step portion <b>224</b> in the upper direction. The intermediate portion <b>210</b> may be located in the inserting portion <b>110</b> when the housing cap <b>106</b> and the interface adapter <b>200</b> are coupled together. The inlet flow path and filter outlet flow path may be formed in the inside of the intermediate portion <b>210</b>. Therefore, water supplied into the inside portion of the water filter <b>100</b> and discharged from the purified water from the water filter <b>100</b> is capable of being performed through the intermediate portion <b>210</b>. For example, a first filter inlet flow path extending in a lower direction may be formed on the opened upper surface of the intermediate portion <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the interface step portion <b>224</b> may include a second filter inlet flow path passing across the interface step portion <b>224</b>. The second filter inlet flow path may have an opening formed in a circumferential surface of the interface step portion <b>224</b> and extending toward the center of the interface step portion <b>224</b>. The first filter inlet flow path and the second filter inlet flow path may be connected to each other at a lower end of the intermediate portion <b>210</b>, that is, at the inside of the interface step portion <b>224</b>. Accordingly, the water which flows through the inserting portion <b>110</b> flows through the first filter inlet flow path of the intermediate portion <b>210</b> and then flows along the second filter inlet flow path which is branched into both sides at the lower end of the first filter inlet flow path to the outside and is thus capable of being discharged through an opening of the circumference of the interface step portion <b>224</b>. The water which is discharged through the filter inlet flow path flows along the space between the housing <b>102</b> and the filtering member. The water which flows into the outside of the filtering member may be purified in the process of coming in the hollow portion of the filtering member through the filtering member.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, or alternatively, the intermediate portion <b>210</b> may include a first extending portion which extends from the upper surface of the interface step portion <b>224</b> and a second extending portion which extends from the first extending portion in the upper direction. The first extending portion may have an outer diameter which is larger than the outer diameter of the second extending portion and the filter outlet port may be formed on the upper side portion of the first extending portion.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a guide surface which is recessed in the inside direction may be formed on the outer surface of the second extending portion of the upper side of the filter outlet port. The guide surface may be spaced apart from the filter outlet port in the upper direction. Therefore, when the purified water which is discharged to the filter outlet port flows in the upper direction, the water is guided to the outside of the second extending portion by the guide surface so that the water can flow more effectively.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is to be understood that the detailed description is intended to be illustrative, and not limiting to the embodiments described.
