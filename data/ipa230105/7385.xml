Similarly, a problem mentioned in this section or associated with the subject matter provided as background should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in this section merely represents different approaches, which in and of themselves may also correspond to implementations of the claimed technology.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Headphones are used for a number of different purposes. One purpose is to provide hearing protection. The most basic hearing protection (HP) headphones are over the ear headphones having ear cups which surround the user's ears to provide passive HP, also called soundproofing. Passive HP headphones filter out ambient noise and also provide an amount of impulse noise protection. Passive HP headphones typically have no electronics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another purpose is to deliver sound directly to the user's ear, such as when listening to sounds, both live and prerecorded, including, for example, music, prerecorded books, and telephone conversations. These sound delivery headphones will usually be referred to as music headphones for simplicity. Some music headphones include electronics to provide the user with high-quality music. Over the ear music headphones, because they surround the ear, also filter out ambient noise and provide a limited amount of noise protection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Both HP devices and music headphones can include electronics to provide conventional noise cancellation, which is particularly effective at generating sound waveforms which are the exact opposite of lower frequency ambient sound waveforms, thus canceling them. However, there is yet no integrated headphone solution that provides the wearer configurable choices of hearing protection and quality sound delivery for music and programming</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting implementations that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting implementations in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various implementations that follow.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A modular headphone system that can afford the wearer configurable choices of hearing protection and quality sound delivery for music and programming is provided. In an embodiment, a modular headphone includes a headband and an earpiece mounted to the headband. The earpiece comprises a can comprising a speaker, the can secured to the headband. A removable and replaceable music ear cup is removably mountable to the can to overlie the speaker. A removable and replaceable hearing protection/sound amplification (HP/amp) ear cup is removably mountable to the can to overlie the speaker.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The can comprises a can body. In embodiments, the can body comprises a circumferentially-extending side wall surrounding the speaker and a circumferentially-extending open region defined between the speaker and the side wall. In one exemplary embodiment, the HP/amp ear cup comprises a sound absorbing element within the circumferentially extending open region and a sound absorbing layer overlying the sound absorbing element and the speaker. In an exemplary embodiment, each of the music ear cup and the HP/amp ear cup comprise an understructure having a circumferentially-extending outer portion defining an open region aligned with the speaker, and a cushion structure mounted to the understructure, so that the cushion structure defining an ear-receiving open region aligned with the open region of the understructure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An exemplary cushion structure can comprise a resilient, circumferentially extending, cushion structure body having an inner, circumferentially extending surface, an outer, circumferentially extending surface, and a face surface joining the inner and outer circumferentially extending surfaces. A body cover that covers the inner and outer circumferentially extending surfaces and the face surface can also be part of the cushion structure. In one exemplary implementation, the cushion structure body is made of polyurethane memory foam and the body cover is made of polyurethane synthetic leather. The cushion structure further comprises a sound-permeable cover overlying the open region of the understructure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An exemplary HP/amp ear cup comprises a sound absorbing element within the circumferentially extending open region and a sound absorbing layer overlying the sound absorbing element and the speaker. The sound absorbing element is made of one or more of polyurethane foam, cotton, melamine, or composite materials. Combinations of these materials, other materials and combinations thereof are contemplated by the disclosed technology. One exemplary headphone employs sound absorbing element is 5 mm to 15 mm thick. In another exemplary headphone, the sound layer is made of one or more of polyurethane foam, cotton, melamine, or composite materials and sound absorbing layer is 2 mm to 4 mm thick.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, amplification circuitry in the HP/amp ear cup ceases sound amplification in response to an impulse sound. The amplification circuitry in the HP/amp ear cup can cease sound amplification in response to an impulse sound exceeding an adjustable threshold. For example, the amplification circuitry in the HP/amp ear cup ceases sound amplification in response to an impulse sound exceeding a level of 82 dB. The amplification circuitry in the HP/amp ear cup can resume sound amplification within 2 milliseconds. Some implementations further including a toggle enabling a user to selectively activate capability of the amplification circuitry in the HP/am ear cup to cease amplification upon detection of an impulse sound.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a headphone system comprises a headband and an earpiece mounted to the headband. The earpiece comprises a can that includes a speaker. The can is secured to the headband. A hearing protection/sound amplification (HP/amp) ear cup is mounted to the can to overlie the speaker. The can also comprises a can body. The can body comprises a circumferentially-extending side wall surrounding the speaker. A circumferentially-extending region is defined within an inner region defined between the speaker and the side wall. The ear cup comprises a sound-absorbing element within the circumferentially-extending region, a sound-absorbing layer overlying the sound absorbing element and the speaker, and an outer ear cup structure that is configured to engage a user's ear and mounted to the can and overlying the sound-absorbing layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One example of the headphone system, the outer ear cup structure comprises an understructure having a circumferentially-extending outer portion defining an open region aligned with the speaker and a cushion structure mounted to the understructure, such that the cushion structure defines an ear-receiving open region aligned with the open region of the understructure. The cushion structure further includes a resilient, circumferentially extending, cushion structure body having an inner, circumferentially extending surface, an outer, circumferentially extending surface, and a face surface joining the inner and outer circumferentially extending surfaces. A body cover that covers the inner and outer circumferentially extending surfaces and the face surface is also part of the cushion structure. Further, a sound-permeable cover overlies the open region of the understructure. Other features, aspects and advantages of technology disclosed can be seen on review the drawings, the detailed description, and the claims, which follow.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The included drawings are for illustrative purposes and serve only to provide examples of possible structures and process operations for one or more implementations of this disclosure.

It is to be understood that there is no intention to be limited to the specifically disclosed embodiments and methods but that other features, elements, methods and embodiments may be used for implementations of this disclosure. Preferred embodiments are described to illustrate the technology disclosed, not to limit its scope, which is defined by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a variety of equivalent variations on the description that follows. Unless otherwise stated, in this application specified relationships, such as parallel to, aligned with, or in the same plane as, mean that the specified relationships are within limitations of manufacturing processes and within manufacturing variations. When components are described as being coupled, connected, being in contact or contacting one another, they need not be physically directly touching one another unless specifically described as such. Like elements in various embodiments are commonly referred to with like reference numerals.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A more sophisticated version of hearing protection is provided by HP and amplification headphones, which will usually be referred to as HP/amp headphones. HP/amp headphones provide passive hearing protection from loud noises much like passive HP headphones. Some implementations of HP/amp devices also include electronics to amplify relatively low level ambient sound. The passive hearing protection allows the wearer to be protected against sudden impulse sound, such as loud noises in excess of 82 dB, in an industrial or manufacturing setting or loud noises produced by gunfire when hunting. In both cases the HP/amp devices allows the wearer to hear coworkers or hunting companions while being protected against loud, impulse sounds. The electronics are designed so that they do not amplify impulse sounds or other loud sounds. However they can provide enhanced hearing for the low level ambient sounds, such as to permit a hunter to hear sounds of animals as well as speech.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one example of a modular headphone system <b>10</b> including a headband <b>12</b>, a left earpiece <b>14</b> and a right earpiece <b>16</b> secured to headband <b>12</b>, in this example by a pivot/swivel joint <b>18</b>. Each ear piece of modular headphone system <b>10</b> can be used in a hearing protection/sound amplification (HP/amp) mode or in a music headphone mode. Each earpiece includes what is referred to herein as a can and an ear cup mounted to the can.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, with the present technology a headphone system includes two different interchangeable ear cups mountable to the cans of the earpieces. An HP/amp ear cup to be used when the system is to be used in an HP/amp device mode and a music ear cup when the system is to be used in a music headphone mode. With the present technology electronics for use in two alternative modes, an HP/amp device mode or in a music headphone mode, can be included in the cans. Also, the provision of extra sound deadening material between the can and the users ear, in the examples below provided by a sound absorbing layer in front of the speaker and a sound absorbing element around the speaker, can improve the passive HP against the effects of impulse sounds or other loud sounds in the HP/amp device mode.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the example discussed below, each can include the electronics for the speaker/driver. The electronics appropriate for use in the HP/amp device mode and in the music headphone mode can be distributed between the cans or each can include all the necessary electronics. An example of electronics suitable for use in implementing the HP/amp mode is found at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>: HP/amp audio driver <b>805</b>. An example of electronics suitable for use in the music mode is found at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>: music audio driver <b>804</b>. When the electronics are distributed between the cans, the electronics would be coupled to one another by wires, wireless communications, or both.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each can <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> preferably can be used with one of two removable and replaceable ear cups, HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> and music ear cup <b>26</b>. The user chooses which ear cup to mount to the cans <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> based on the mode the system is to be used in. For example, if the system is to be used in a noisy industrial environment or at a shooting range, the HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> would likely be chosen and mounted to each can <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. If the system is to be used, for example, while listening to music or watching a video on an airplane, the music ear cup <b>26</b> would typically be used. Modular headphone system <b>10</b> shown in the attached figures shows an HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> mounted to the can <b>20</b> of the left earpiece <b>14</b> and the music ear cup <b>26</b> mounted to the can <b>22</b> of right earpiece <b>16</b> to avoid unnecessary duplication of drawing figures; during use the same type of ear cup, that is HP amp ear cup <b>24</b> or music ear cup <b>26</b>, would typically be used at the same time for both left and right ear pieces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Therefore, modular headphone system <b>10</b> can be used with two different interchangeable ear cups, the HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> to be used when the system is to be used in an HP/amp device mode and the music ear cup <b>26</b> when the system is to be used in a music headphone mode.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate can <b>22</b> and music ear cup <b>26</b> of the right earpiece <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with components of music ear cup <b>26</b> shown in an exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. With renewed reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, can <b>22</b> includes a can body <b>30</b> having a circumferentially extending side wall <b>32</b> which surrounds a speaker <b>34</b> to define a circumferentially extending region <b>36</b> therebetween. Ear cup <b>26</b> is mountable to and removable from can <b>22</b> and includes an understructure <b>38</b> and a cushion structure <b>40</b>. Understructure <b>38</b> includes a rim <b>42</b> having a first edge <b>44</b> towards can <b>20</b> and a second edge <b>46</b>. Understructure <b>38</b> also has an inwardly extending flange (or outer portion) <b>48</b> extending inwardly from second edge <b>46</b>. Flange <b>48</b> defines an open region <b>50</b> aligned with speaker <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Cushion structure <b>40</b> includes a sound-permeable cover <b>52</b> aligned with open region <b>50</b>. Cover <b>52</b> can be made of a fabric material, such as for example and without limitation, non-woven fabrics and materials, staple short fiber and continuous long fibers, that can be bonded together by chemical, mechanical heat or solvent treatments. The amount of sound attenuation provided by cover <b>52</b> is preferably no more than 1 dB. Cushion structure <b>40</b> also includes a cushion structure body <b>54</b> typically made of a foam material such as memory foam comprising mainly of Polyurethane treated chemically to increase its viscosity and/or density, such as for example Reicofil&#x2122; available from Reifenhauser Company located in Troisdorf Germany (http://www.reicofil.com/) or equivalent, for a comfortable fit during use. Body <b>54</b> has an outer, circumferentially extending surface <b>56</b>, an inner, circumferentially extending surface <b>58</b> and a face surface <b>60</b> joining the inner and outer surfaces <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Cushion structure <b>40</b> further includes a body cover <b>62</b> including an inner ring member <b>64</b> sized to fit within and adjacent to surface <b>58</b> of body <b>54</b>, a circumferential member <b>66</b> sized to surround and lie adjacent to outer surface <b>56</b> of body <b>54</b> and rim <b>42</b> of understructure <b>38</b>, and an end member <b>68</b> joined to inner ring member <b>64</b> and circumferential member <b>66</b>; this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The components of body cover <b>62</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as separate components but are, in this example, a single component. End member <b>68</b> has an opening <b>70</b> corresponding to the open interior <b>72</b> of inner ring member <b>64</b>, both of which are aligned with open region <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cushion structure <b>40</b> defines an ear-receiving open region <b>74</b> aligned with open region <b>50</b> of understructure <b>38</b>. Body cover <b>62</b> can be made of materials which are nonporous, to facilitate cleaning of cushion structure <b>40</b>; one suitable example is polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride, which can be formed to simulate leather. In general, body <b>54</b> and body cover <b>62</b> are made of materials which are suitable for the expected use environments and are comfortable to wear. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, circumferential member <b>66</b> has a re-curved portion <b>82</b> which engages first edge <b>44</b> of rim <b>42</b> to secure cushion structure <b>40</b> to understructure <b>38</b>. The flexibility of circumferential member <b>66</b> also permits cushion structure <b>40</b> to be removed and permits cushion structure body <b>54</b> and sound permeable cover <b>52</b> to be cleaned, repaired or replaced as needed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Left earpiece <b>14</b>, including can <b>20</b> is depicted with HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b>, in the example that will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>. The portions of can <b>20</b> and can <b>22</b> engaging ear cups <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are essentially the same. The primary difference between the HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and the music ear cup <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is the circuitry used to implement the audio drivers <b>804</b>, <b>805</b>. In addition, a sound absorbing element <b>76</b> and a sound absorbing layer <b>78</b> can be incorporated into HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b>. HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> includes outer ear cap structure <b>79</b> which, in this example, is identical to music ear cup <b>26</b> so those components will not be described again. In this example sound absorbing layer <b>78</b> is positioned between sound absorbing element <b>76</b> and flange <b>48</b> of understructure <b>38</b>. Body <b>30</b> has an inwardly directed wall <b>80</b> extending between the speaker <b>35</b> and side wall <b>32</b>. Sound absorbing element <b>76</b> is housed within the circumferentially extending region <b>36</b> of can <b>22</b> and lies against wall <b>80</b>. Sound absorbing element <b>76</b> and sound absorbing layer <b>78</b> are made of materials which enhance the passive hearing protection provided by modular headphone system <b>10</b>, especially in relation to loud noises, typically in excess of 82 dB, both impulse and non-impulse sounds. In one example sound absorbing element <b>76</b> is made of one or more of polyurethane foam, cotton, melamine, or composites thereof about 5 mm-15 mm thick and sound absorbing layer <b>78</b> is made of analogous material about 2 mm-4 mm thick. One example material for implementing sound absorbing element <b>76</b> and sound absorbing layer <b>78</b>, Sonex&#x2122; was tested to yield a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) equal to 0.65 sound attenuation. In comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, it is seen that circumferentially extending region <b>36</b> is an open region in the music ear cup <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> while it is substantially filled with sound absorbing element <b>76</b> in the HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the disclosed example the electronics necessary for the music mode and the HP/amp mode are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, which provide schematic diagrams of electrical circuitry implementing a modular headphone system. The circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> includes HP/amp audio driver <b>805</b> to drive speaker <b>35</b> of can <b>20</b> and music audio driver <b>804</b> to drive speaker <b>34</b> of can <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the electronics necessary for both the music mode and the HP/amp mode can be found in either of can <b>20</b> or can <b>22</b> with wires making connections to the speaker on the can on the opposite side. In either case it is preferred that various switches, buttons, indicators be located on both can <b>20</b> and can <b>22</b> to keep functions separate and not have the switches, buttons and indicators too close to one another.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is preferred that headphone <b>10</b> includes a microphone to detect environmental noise. Microphones can be situated in either one of or both earpieces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a volume control switch <b>84</b> that, in this example, controls the volume for both earpieces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in the music mode and also controls the amplification of low level noise in the HP/amp mode, such as when an industrial setting or while hunting or at a shooting range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a mode switch <b>86</b> that activates a hunting mode in which the user can adjust volume needed to be heard. In one embodiment, pressing the up arrow button of mode switch <b>86</b> causes the headphone <b>10</b> to enter a hunting mode and to raise the threshold for amplifying sounds greater than the threshold. Pressing the down arrow button of mode switch <b>86</b> causes the headphone to lower the threshold for sound amplification. With renewed reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, various controls and optional visual indicators provide the user with the capability to control the features of the headphone <b>10</b>. A Bluetooth button <b>55</b> enables the user to pair the headphone with a Bluetooth signal source. An appropriately positioned blue tooth indicator LED blinks white during pairing; shows steady white when paired and is otherwise off when not working. An HP button <b>57</b> provides the user control over toggling between HP/amp mode and music mode. A conveniently located HP indicator shows white when working, red when battery state is low and is off when the headphone <b>10</b> is not working. When the HP button <b>57</b> is pressed, the HP indicator shows red for 3 seconds and then turns off to save power. An NC button <b>59</b> enables the user to toggle Noise Canceling (NC) on and off. A proximately located NC indicator shows white for 3 seconds when noise canceling is activated and is off when noise canceling is off. Control buttons <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, and <b>59</b> are turned on with a long press and off with a short press. Alternatively a simple toggling of the function can be implemented. Optionally, a 3.5 mm input <b>61</b> provides the user the capability to enjoy music when the headphone has no connectivity to Bluetooth. When active, headphone <b>10</b> will automatically shut off HP protection, Bluetooth, and noise canceling. Noise level amplification can be provided by different techniques, with sound compression currently preferred. The electronics preferably is designed to stop amplification when the level of external sound,&#x2014;an impulse sound or ambient sounds as described above, for example,&#x2014;exceeds a threshold of about 82 dB or as adjusted in hunter mode; this is true for both modes. Therefore, in the HP/amp mode, sound amplification is quickly shut down in response to an impulse sound such as a gunshot and quickly returns to sound amplification, preferably within 2 ms. It is preferred that both left and right earpieces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> using both HP/amp ear cup <b>24</b> and music ear cup <b>26</b> achieve a noise reduction rating (NRR) of at least 22 and preferably 28-30. When in the music mode, it is preferred that the music, or other sound being delivered to the user, be paused upon receipt of a telephone call and automatically turned back on upon completion of the telephone call. Conventional noise cancellation, preferably of at least 20 dB, can be provided for either or both the music mode and the HP/amp mode.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above descriptions may have used terms such as above, below, top, bottom, over, under, et cetera.
