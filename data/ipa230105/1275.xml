Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to covers for the heads of golf clubs and, more particularly, to supports each for storing a golf club head cover temporarily while the golf club is being used.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Golf is a cross-country game played by striking a small ball with various clubs from a series of teeing grounds into an arrangement of holes on a course. How a player hits and directs the ball is the essence of the game. The player who holes the ball in the fewest strokes is the winner. Golf requires an investment in course fees, golf clubs, golf balls, related equipment, and a reasonable skill acquired with patience and dedication.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A golf club is an implement used to hit a golf ball. An ordinary golfer carries with them a set of golf clubs, typically a set of woods, a set of irons, at least one putter, and, often, one or more hybrids, and selects an appropriate club to use for each shot. Each club includes a shaft configured with a grip and a club head. Woods are used for long-distance fairway or tee shots and have a large head and a long shaft for maximum club speed. While most woods are of different metals, the term &#x201c;woods&#x201d; identifies their shape and intended use and differentiates them from the other club types. Irons, the most versatile class of clubs, are used for a variety of shots, hybrids combine design elements of woods and irons, and putters are used mainly on the greens to roll the ball into the hole. The rules of golf limit the number of a set of clubs to no more than fourteen. A player may choose any combination of legal clubs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An ordinary golfer transports golf clubs in a golf bag. Carry bags are configured for being carried by the player, have single or dual shoulder straps, and are lightweight. Stand bags are like carry bags but include rigid internal reinforcement and deployable legs, which convert the bag to a tripod enabling it to be securely placed upright on the turf. Cart bags are constructed for being harnessed to a two-wheeled pull cart or a motorized golf cart. They often have rudimentary carry straps or handles for loading and transporting, no stand legs, and feature supplemental storage and substantial construction. Staff bags are the largest class of golf bags. Caddies or other assistants to professional or high-level players use these bags, which are the same size or larger than cart bags, and normally incorporate a single shoulder strap, a large amount of storage for equipment and spare attire, and prominent branding.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Golf clubs are expensive. Accordingly, most golfers use club head covers configured to protect the club heads from striking each other and from weather and incidental damage when stored in the bag, make clubs more identifiable at a glance, and provide a personal touch to the clubs. While covers for woods are the most common, there are covers for all types of clubs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When golfer selects a club for making a shot, he removes the cover from the club's head and either drops it to the ground or places it over his golf bag or other chosen location, which often leads to the cover becoming misplaced or lost. Additionally, a cover dropped to the ground requires the player to bend down to pick up, which is frustrating and often uncomfortable. While skilled artisans have developed a variety of systems configured to temporarily store a golf club head cover while a golfer uses the club, existing systems are not entirely satisfactory, expensive, difficult to use, and unnecessary complex, thereby necessitating continued improvement in the art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a golf bag including a body configured to receive golf clubs through an opening defined by a rim of a wall of the body, improvements therein according to the invention including a clip clipped onto the rim, and an elongate member including a lower end and an upper end, the elongate member extending upright to the upper end from the lower end affixed to the clip and configured for reception into a golf club head cover applied thereover from the upper end to support the golf club head cover depending downwardly from the upper end for temporarily storing the golf club head cover when removed from a head of a golf club.

A user installs clip <b>70</b> by orienting support <b>50</b> free ends <b>72</b>A and <b>74</b>A down aligned over either side of rim <b>98</b>. He then lowers clip <b>70</b> onto rim <b>98</b> in the direction of arrow A, forcing rim <b>98</b> between free ends <b>72</b>A and <b>74</b>A of legs <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>, which slide over either side of rim <b>98</b>. The inherent resilience of legs <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> enable them to concurrently grip either side of rim <b>98</b> positioned therebetween, which secures clip <b>70</b> to rim <b>98</b>.

This is done without the user having to bend over when golf bag <b>90</b> is customarily supported upright during play.
