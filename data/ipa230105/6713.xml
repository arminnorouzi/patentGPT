To meet the high growth in mobile data traffic and support new applications and deployments, improvements in radio interface efficiency and coverage are of paramount importance. Moreover, this demand for wireless data traffic has increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, and to enable various vertical applications, 5G (e.g., fifth generation) communication systems have been developed and are currently being deployed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A basic philosophy of 5G or New Radio (NR) in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is to support beam-specific operations for wireless communication between a gNodeB (gNB) and a user equipment (UE). There are several components in the 5G NR specification that can efficiently be operated in a beam-specific manner. Note that the 5G communication system involves implementation to include higher frequency (mmWave) bands, such as 28 GHz or 60 GHz bands or, in general, above 6 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates, or in lower frequency bands, such as below 6 GHz, to enable robust coverage and mobility support.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The mmWave beam codebook design is very important and challenging for the 5G mmWave base stations since, being different from low frequency bands, narrow beams are needed to support the high data transmission at the mmWave band due to the large mmWave band path-loss. A significant number of narrow beams may be needed to cover a wide angular region, for example, horizontally from &#x2212;60 degree to +60 degree. On the other hand, due to the larger overhead of synchronization signal block (SSB) signaling (which refers to synchronization/physical broadcast channel (PBCH) block because the synchronization signal and PBCH channel are packed as a single block), especially in the 5G standalone system, the number of SSB beams, where each beam corresponding to an SSB index, cannot be large.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to paring or grouping beams into composite beams.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a method is provided.

The apparatus comprises memory and a processor operably coupled to the memory. The processor is configured to identify, based on one or more UE reports, information on a plurality of narrow beams; determine beam correlation information for the plurality of narrow beams based on the one or more UE reports; and determine pairs of narrow beams from among the plurality of narrow beams based on the correlation information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, a non-transitory, computer-readable medium is provided. The computer-readable medium includes program code that, when executed by a processor of an apparatus, causes the apparatus to identify, based on one or more UE reports, information on a plurality of narrow beams; determine beam correlation information for the plurality of narrow beams based on the one or more UE reports; and determine pairs of narrow beams from among the plurality of narrow beams based on the correlation information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other technical features may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Before undertaking the DETAILED DESCRIPTION below, it may be advantageous to set forth definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout this patent document.

Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged system or device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5G or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x201c;beyond 4G network&#x201d; or a &#x201c;post LTE system.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission coverage, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques and the like are discussed in 5G communication systems.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul communication, moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP) transmission and reception, interference mitigation and cancelation and the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The discussion of 5G systems and frequency bands associated therewith is for reference as certain embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented in 5G systems. However, the present disclosure is not limited to 5G systems, or the frequency bands associated therewith, and non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure may be utilized in connection with any frequency band. For example, aspects of the present disclosure may also be applied to deployment of 5G communication systems, 6G or even later releases which may use terahertz (THz) bands.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In 5G or the other wireless systems, mm Wave is a major band on which high throughputs can be achieved. The propagation on the mm Wave bands suffers more significant path loss than that in the sub-6 GHz bands. To compensate the increased path loss, multiple antenna elements can be simultaneously activated to form a narrow beam with high gain. The narrow beamwidth, however, incurs an overhead for aligning the beam direction to the best signal transmission/reception directions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various embodiments of the present disclosure recognize that, for composite beam operation, the pairing of the narrow beams has to be carefully designed. If the paired beams' angles are close to each other, there can be strong interference to each other, for example the side lobe of one beam could be strong at the main lobe of the other beam.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is noted that a composite beam system can also be implemented with three (or more) narrow beams for a single SSB index. The term &#x201c;narrow beam&#x201d; is used here since a large antenna array which is a typical setup for 5G mmWave network deployment is capable of forming narrow beams; however, the various embodiments in this disclosure can be applied to other composite beam systems with any beam width. Many beams, e.g., &#x3e;100 may be needed to cover a wide angular region. The number of SSB beams, where each beam corresponds to an SSB index, cannot be large, especially in the 5G standalone (SA) system. 5G NR supports at most 64 SSBs for mmWave.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Various embodiments of the present disclosure present methods to generate the beam paring for the BS. The methods use input information including the individual beam pattern, the pointing angle of the individual beams. Although mmWave bands are used as example in this disclosure, the non-limiting embodiments in this disclosure can also be applied to other frequency bands as well.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various embodiments of the present disclosure also recognize that formulating a composite beam (CB) pairing enhancement can be used to design an automatic pairing method that finds the optimal pairing that maximizes the intra-pair distance. Large intra-pair distance leads to less interference within the pair. These design specifications can be requirements of the system, for the base station to maintain contact with the UE, or any other feature that would be advantageous to the design of the CBs or a codebook. Moreover, various embodiments of the present disclosure permit the codebook to offer different types, shapes, and powers of CBs to accomplish the objectives of using CBs to cover narrow beam areas or volumes more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, various embodiments of the present disclosure also provide for a method of using method to maximize both the intra-pair and inter-pair distance that can overcome error propagation. Large inter-pair distance can reduce the chance of error propagation and adopting a CB codebook with less errors and interference to support mobile UE.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, various embodiments of the present disclosure also provide examples of a composite beam system, where the BS uses two arrays to transmit the two narrow beams at the same time (one array for one narrow beam). One approach to reduce the number of SSB beams is to implement a composite beam system, where the BS transmits two narrow beams simultaneously for one SSB (same SSB index), and thereby halving the number of SSBs for the network. Thus, for a composite beam system, a BS transmits two narrow beams simultaneously for one SSB halving the number of SSBs, where the beam search could be for instance 28 CBs+2 (or 1) NB search. To pair the beams, search accuracy such that, for example, the percentage that the 28+2 (or 1) beam search arrives at the same result as the 56-beam search. The intra-pair distance should be large such that there is less beam pattern distortion when they are transmitted simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Before further addressing the methods and devices used to effectuate the solutions discussed herein, various physical embodiments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref> below, which describe such various embodiments implemented in wireless communications systems and with the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) communication techniques.

Once the set of narrow beams changes, the BS can re-pair the narrow beams, following the methods provided in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0105">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the scan range of the narrow beam codebook expands to cover a larger cell or more UEs with different heights. The number of the narrow beams changes if a higher scan range is needed, for example, where the number of narrow beams increases from 32 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A to <b>48</b></figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, and a new pairing of narrow beams is then needed. Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a size-32 NB codebook with only two rows is displayed while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> a size-48 NB codebook with three rows is displayed.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustration of another example where the number of NBs does not change, but the pointing angles could change to better serve the UEs. For a size-32 NB codebook, the NB s could be distributed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, where the horizontal coverage region is [&#x2212;30&#xb0;,30&#xb0;]. This could happen when the UEs are concentrated in a small angular region, for example, a plaza area. Note that the pointing angles are different from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. Therefore, a different pairing may be needed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0107">In another embodiment, the BS could take into account the beam load when generating the composite beams. In other words, pairing based on the beam load. The beam load might be defined as the number of UE served by the beam, or the number of throughputs delivered by the beam to the served UEs. In one option, the beams with less load are paired, while the beam with high load are not paired. As a result, the load on the composite beams is more balanced. In another option, the beams with less load are grouped into big composite beams that include more than two narrow beams, while the beams with more load are grouped into small composite beams that include two or one narrow beams.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0108">In various embodiments, the beam paring is performed using an ILP algorithm. For example, the composite beam design involves a pairing solution that increases (or maximizes) the intra-pair distance to reduce the intra-pair interference when forming composite-beam which can be formulated as an ILP problem, which assumes: the distance between beam i and beam j is d<sub>ij</sub>; z<sub>ij</sub>=1 if beam i and beam j are paired, otherwise z<sub>ij</sub>=0; the objective is to increase (or maximize) the sum of the distance, where d<sub>min </sub>is a constraint on the minimum intra-pair distance. Given these assumptions, the ILP problem can be formulated based on the following:</p><p id="p-0122" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00008" num="00008"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <munder>   <mi>max</mi>   <msub>    <mi>z</mi>    <mi>ij</mi>   </msub>  </munder>  <mtext>  </mtext>  <mrow>   <munder>    <mo>&#x2211;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>i</mi>     <mo>,</mo>     <mi>j</mi>    </mrow>   </munder>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>d</mi>     <mi>ij</mi>    </msub>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msub>     <mi>z</mi>     <mi>ij</mi>    </msub>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>sum</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>of</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>the</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>distance</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00008-2" num="00008.2"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>s</mi>    <mo>.</mo>    <mi>t</mi>    <mtext> </mtext>    <mo>.</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <msub>     <mi>z</mi>     <mi>ij</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>   <mo>=</mo>   <msub>    <mi>z</mi>    <mi>ji</mi>   </msub>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mo>&#x2200;</mo>   <mi>i</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>j</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mi>symmetry</mi>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00008-3" num="00008.3"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <munder>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mi>j</mi>    </munder>    <msub>     <mi>z</mi>     <mi>ij</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>   <mo>=</mo>   <mn>1</mn>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mtext>  </mtext>  <mrow>   <mo>&#x2200;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>i</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>pair</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>once</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00008-4" num="00008.4"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>z</mi>     <mi>ij</mi>    </msub>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msub>     <mi>d</mi>     <mi>min</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>   <mo>&#x2264;</mo>   <msub>    <mi>d</mi>    <mrow>     <mi>i</mi>     <mo>,</mo>     <mi>j</mi>    </mrow>   </msub>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mo>&#x2200;</mo>   <mi>i</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>j</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>minimum</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>distance</mi>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00008-5" num="00008.5"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>z</mi>    <mi>ij</mi>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>0</mn>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>or</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mtext> </mtext>     <mtext>  </mtext>    </mrow>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mn>1</mn>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mtext> </mtext>  <mrow>   <mo>&#x2200;</mo>   <mi>i</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>j</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mi>binary</mi>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0123" num="0000">For example, a MATLAB Mixed-Integer Linear Programming can be adopted to solve this problem, where finding the maximum d<sub>min </sub>is done by trial and error.

The method <b>1400</b> is for illustration only and other embodiments can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0115">The method begins with the system identifying, based on one or more UE reports, information on a plurality of narrow beams (step <b>1401</b>). For example, in step <b>1401</b>, the system (e.g., computing device <b>400</b>) may identify this information from offline reports to generate the parings in an offline methodology to provide predefined beam codebooks to a BS (e.g., BS <b>102</b>). In another embodiment, the beam paring may be performed online by BS <b>102</b>. In this example, the BS <b>102</b> may also transmit reference signals on the plurality of narrow beams and receive these UE report(s) from which to determine beam parings.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0116">The system then determines beam correlation information for the plurality of narrow beams based on the one or more UE reports (step <b>1402</b>). For example, in step <b>1402</b>, the system may determine information about distances between respective beams in the set of beams as well as other information, such as, signal strengths, beam interference, UE indications of preferred beams, etc.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0117">The system then determines pairs of narrow beams from among the plurality of narrow beams based on the correlation information (step <b>1403</b>). Thereafter, for offline paring, the system may generate codebook(s) including the beam parings for use in a wireless communication system. For online paring, the BS may then use one or more of the determined pairs to transmit SSB(s) to UE(s) in the wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0118">In step <b>1403</b>, the system may determine pairs of narrow beams a function of a distance between beams in each respective pair of the pairs of narrow beams or intra-pair distance. For example, the system may determine the pairs of narrow beams to have a largest possible distance between the beams in each respective pair of the pairs of narrow beams among the plurality of narrow beams. This may allow for reduced interference between the beams in the respective pairs of narrow beams when transmitted. Additionally or alternatively, in step <b>1403</b>, the system may determine the pairs of narrow beams as a function of a distance between beams in different pairs of the pairs of narrow beams or inter-pair distance. For example, the system may determine the pairs of narrow beams to have a largest possible distance between the different pairs of beams in the pairs of narrow beams. This may allow for reduced correlation between the different pairs of beams. For example, the pairs of the beams may be transmitted in different timeslots, thus not leading to inter-pair interference. However, reducing the correlation or similarity between the pairs may reduce the chance of error propagation between beam pairs. In various embodiments, the system may determine as a function of a distance between beams in each respective pair of the pairs of narrow beams and distance between beams in different pairs of the pairs of narrow beams or both intra and inter pair distance. For example, the system may use an ILP algorithm, such as one discussed above.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0119">In various embodiments, the system may also determine the beam correlation information based on identifying a beam load for beams in the plurality of beams as discussed above.
