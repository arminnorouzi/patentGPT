Solder ribbons are used to electrically conductively connect the front side of a solar cell, which simultaneously represents the negative pole of this solar cell, to the rear side (positive pole) of the following solar cell.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, all solar cells within a solar module are interconnected in series. Commercially available solar modules use 60 or 72 solar cells. The layout then consists of 6&#xd7;10 or 6&#xd7;12 solar cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, three solar cell strings (<b>102</b>) are used in solar modules, each with 2&#xd7;10 or 2&#xd7;12 cells as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each solar cell (<b>101</b>) has an open circuit voltage of 650-700 mV. This results in an open circuit voltage of 39-42 V per solar module when using 60 cells per module and an open circuit voltage of 46.8-50.4 V when using 72 cells per module. In the following, an open-circuit voltage of 40 V and the use of 60 cells per module is assumed for the sake of simplicity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a photovoltaic system, solar modules are interconnected. The solar modules and cables are approved for a maximum system voltage of typically 1000 V or 1500 V. Depending on the maximum system voltage, the maximum number of solar modules that can be interconnected in series in a module string is determined. At 1000 V system voltage and 40 V module voltage, a maximum of 25 modules may be interconnected in series in one module string.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Given that the open-circuit voltage of the solar cells is temperature-dependent and increases by approx. 0.3% per degree Kelvin as the temperature drops, the maximum number of modules still depends on the minimum temperature for which the system is specified. When specified for &#x2212;25&#xb0; C., the module open-circuit voltage increases by 0.3%/K*50K*40 V=6 V compared to the standard temperature of +25&#xb0; C. This means that with a maximum string voltage of 1000 V, only 21 modules may be interconnected in series.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This means that in this module string a total of N=60&#xd7;21=1260 solar cells are interconnected in series.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the serial interconnection, the same current flows through all of these 1260 solar cells. Now the current of a solar cell depends on its quality, its area and its illumination. In a photovoltaic system, sorted solar cells of the same quality and area are used. However, the illumination of the solar cells can vary, e.g. due to shading of a (partial) solar cell. Shading can be caused by clouds, interfering objects or contamination.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In case of shading of a solar cell&#x2014;for the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that one cell is completely shaded, while all others are not shaded at all&#x2014;the shaded solar cell (<b>201</b>) behaves like a diode in the dark and blocks, i.e. no current flows. Thus, no current flows in the entire string. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the string voltage V<sub>s </sub>at the load is then zero and all other (illuminated) solar cells (<b>101</b>) in the string supply their open-circuit voltage V<sub>oc</sub>=0.67 V. In the closed mesh of the entire string, the voltage V<sub>c </sub>of the shaded solar cell is then:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>c</sub><i>=V</i><sub>s</sub>&#x2212;(<i>N&#x2212;</i>1)<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>=&#x2212;(<i>N&#x2212;</i>1)<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>=&#x2212;1295<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>=&#x2212;839<i>V </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Such a high voltage in reverse direction would destroy the solar cell, avalanche breakdown of the junction would occur, especially, at so-called hotspots&#x2014;local short circuits in the junction. To avoid this and at the same time prevent shading of individual solar cells from affecting the current and thus the performance of entire strings, solar modules are typically equipped with so-called bypass diodes (<b>103</b>), which are interconnected anti-parallel to a certain number of solar cells: The maximum reverse voltage that a solar cell can tolerate on a sustained basis is in the &#x2212;13 V range. This means that each bypass diode may be interconnected in parallel to a maximum of 20 solar cells.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the equivalent circuit diagram of a solar module with 3 solar cell strings and 3 bypass diodes. In the normal case, when all cells experience the same irradiation, the voltage of the N<sub>s</sub>=20 solar cells of the cell string is applied to each bypass diode in the reverse direction. Thus, at the operating point of maximum power, the diode voltage is V<sub>D</sub>=&#x2212;N<sub>s</sub>*V<sub>oc</sub>=&#x2212;13.3 V. The diode blocks and does not affect the operation of the solar cells.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In the event that one cell is shaded, the current through the cell string is zero amps. The current of the other modules is then driven through the bypass diode. The diode becomes conductive and only approx. 0.5 V diode voltage drops. At the shaded solar cell, the voltage</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>c</sub><i>=&#x2212;V</i><sub>D</sub>&#x2212;(<i>N</i><sub>s</sub>&#x2212;1)<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub><i>=&#x2212;V</i><sub>D</sub>&#x2212;19<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>=&#x2212;13,2<i>V </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">is then present. This voltage is not dangerous for the solar cell and the solar module if it does not have extreme hotspots. Also the case of 72-cell modules is still uncritical for most cell types.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">More cells cannot be interconnected in parallel to a bypass diode without endangering the cells. This would not be desirable for 60-cell or 72-cell modules, since in a typical system the bypass diodes already switch to bypass when only 10% of a solar cell, i.e. less than 0.2% of the module area, is shaded. In the bypass case, one loses the complete power of a cell string of e.g. 1 10 W for a 3, 30 W module. Additional loss of 5 W is caused by the voltage drop of 0.5 V at the bypass diode.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">More difficult than 60-cell modules is the case of modules with half cells. With this technology, the solar cells are halved. Instead of a current of approx. 10 A, they only deliver approx. 5 A. As a result, the resistive losses in the cell connectors are quartered and the power per module increases by 6-7 W. If the halved cells were used in a standard module layout, this would mean connecting 40 solar cells instead of 20 solar cells per bypass diode. This would double the reverse voltage of the cells in the shading case. To get around this problem, half-cell modules are typically interconnected in a half-module format. Here, the module is divided into two halves as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In each half, 20 half cells (<b>401</b>) per cell string are interconnected in series and routed to a bypass diode. The bypass diodes are arranged in the center of the module so that the two halves of the module are interconnected in parallel. The disadvantage of this arrangement is the additional space required for the cross-connectors in the center of the module. This reduces the module efficiency by approx. 0.6% rel. In addition, the costs of module production increase due to the additional cross-connectors and the higher interconnection effort.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">Even more complex is the consideration of bypass diodes in so-called shingle modules as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In these modules, the solar cells are cut by laser into 5 or 6 strips (<b>501</b>) and these are then interconnected in series without solder ribbons. Typically, conductive adhesive is used for this purpose. For a module layout of 6&#xd7;10 solar cells and vertical string direction, this results in 6 strips&#xd7;10 cells=60 cell strips per string. This would be too many cells for a bypass diode. Therefore, in this case, 3 bypass diodes have to be integrated into each string. This is very costly in terms of manufacturing and requires a lot of material for the module-internal interconnection of the bypass diodes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0016">It is object of the invention to enable a module layout in which more than 20 solar cells can be interconnected in series in a solar cell string without the reverse voltage of the individual cells exceeding a certain value, for example 12 V, in the case of shading.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">The invention solves the object by means of an electronic circuit (<b>601</b>) which ensures that the string voltage always remains above a certain value V<sub>min</sub>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures.

In a string with 60 cells, V<sub>min</sub>=27.5 V. To ensure that no power is lost in the illuminated case, V<sub>min </sub>should not be greater than the voltage V<sub>MPP </sub>at the maximum power point. For V<sub>MPP</sub>, the following applies to typical solar modules: V<sub>MPP</sub>=N<sub>s</sub>0.84 V<sub>oc</sub>. This results in a maximum number of solar cells per string as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0022">Since V<sub>MPP </sub>depends logarithmically on irradiance, the dependence of the minimum irradiance required for V<sub>MPP </sub>to be greater than V<sub>min</sub>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, results. The unit suns results from the normalized unit <b>1</b> sun=100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is approximately reached in Germany in summer at noon. From the figure it can be seen that, for example, for a string length of 60 cells, the minimum irradiation must amount to approx. 0.02 suns. The open circuit voltage of the individual cells is relatively insignificant at this point. This means that the principle can be applied well, and only very slight performance losses have to be accepted. Standard 60-cell modules or shingle modules, for example, can thus be completely interconnected in this embodiment. If the number of cells per string is reduced to 40 cells in a further embodiment of the invention, the minimum irradiance is only 0.002 suns. This is the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for half-cell modules. It is not necessary to cut the strings in half. Each string then has 40 solar cells and is connected to a separate input of the electronic circuit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0023">If the irradiation is lower than the minimum irradiation, V<sub>MPP </sub>is below V<sub>min</sub>. The operating point thus shifts towards idle with decreasing irradiation. When the solar cells are no longer able to provide the voltage V<sub>min</sub>, the system shuts down. In one embodiment of the invention, the electronic circuit measures the irradiance, for example by measuring the current. This allows the input voltage to be reduced as irradiance decreases, so that when there is no irradiance V<sub>min </sub>can become greater than V<sub>MPP</sub>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0024">The open circuit voltage of solar cells is fairly linearly dependent on temperature.
