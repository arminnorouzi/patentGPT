In some circumstances, the bleeding is relatively minor, and normal blood clotting functions, in addition to the application of simple first aid, is all that is required. In other circumstances, substantial bleeding can occur. These situations usually require specialized equipment and materials as well as personnel trained to administer appropriate aid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bleeding during surgical procedures may manifest in many forms. It can be discrete or diffuse from a large surface area. It can be from large or small vessels, arterial (high pressure) or venous (low pressure) of high or low volume. It may be easily accessible or it may originate from difficult to access sites. The control of bleeding is essential and critical in surgical procedures to minimize blood loss, to reduce post-surgical complications, and to shorten the duration of the surgery in the operating room. The selection of appropriate methods or products for the control of bleeding is dependent upon many factors, which include, but are not limited to, bleeding severity, anatomical location of the source and the proximity of adjacent critical structures, whether the bleeding is from a discrete source or from a broader surface area, visibility and precise identification of the source and access to the source.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional methods to achieve hemostasis include use of surgical techniques, sutures, ligatures or clips, and energy-based coagulation or cauterization. When these conventional measures are ineffective or impractical, adjunctive hemostasis techniques and products are typically utilized.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address the above-described problems, materials have been developed for controlling excessive bleeding or as adjuncts to hemostasis. Topical Absorbable Hemostats (TAHs) are widely used in surgical applications. TAHs encompass products in various forms, such as based on woven or non-woven fabrics or sponges, and are typically made of at least partially resorbable materials, ranging from natural to synthetic polymers and combinations thereof, including lactide-glycolide based co-polymers such as polyglactin 910, oxidized cellulose, oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), gelatin, collagen, chitin, chitosan, starch etc. Gelatin is used in various forms with or without a topical thrombin solution. Also, widely used are biologically active topical hemostatic products (topical thrombin solutions, fibrin sealants, etc.) and a variety of synthetic topical sealants.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To improve the hemostatic performance, scaffolds based on the above mentioned TAH materials can be combined with biologically-derived clotting factors, such as thrombin and fibrinogen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fibrin sealants, also known as fibrin glues, have been in use in the clinic for decades. Oftentimes, fibrin sealant comprises two liquid components, a fibrinogen comprising component and a thrombin comprising component, which are stored frozen due to their inherent instability. Sometimes fibrin sealant products comprise two freeze dried components, which require reconstitution immediately prior to use and delivery by a conjoined syringe or other double-barreled delivery device. Freeze dried formulations are typically stable, but the fibrinogen component is difficult to reconstitute. Many hemostatic formulations currently available on the market or in development utilize lyophilized fibrinogen, frequently in combination with lyophilized thrombin, with hemostatic formulations applied in the form of dry powder, semi-liquid paste, liquid formulation, or optionally disposed on a supporting scaffold such as absorbable fabric scaffold.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hydrogels are materials that absorb solvents (such as water), undergo rapid swelling without discernible dissolution, and maintain three-dimensional networks capable of reversible deformation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To provide dressings with enhanced hemostatic and tissue sealing and adhering properties, therapeutic agents, including, but not limited to, thrombin, fibrin and fibrinogen have been combined with dressing carriers or substrates, including gelatin-based carriers, polysaccharide-based carriers, glycolic acid or lactic acid-based carriers and a collagen matrix.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">US patent application having a publication No. 2013/0261192 discloses a medical absorbable hemostatic and wound healing promoting material for bone wounds and a preparation method thereof. The absorbable hemostatic material for bone wounds is formed of 40-95% of a base material and 5-60% of an adjuvant, based on weight percent, wherein the base material is an oligosaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a mixture of the oligosaccharide and the polysaccharide, and the adjuvant includes (1) one or more polyhydric alcohols. (2) one or more vegetable oils, and (3) one or more emulsifying agents.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">US patent application having a publication No. 2012/0027817 relates to mechanically hemostatic body-absorbable compositions having a putty-like consistency comprising a finely powdered polysaccharide and a biocompatible liquid comprising one or more block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 8,105,622 relates to pharmaceutically acceptable hydrogel polymers of natural, recombinant or synthetic origin, or hybrids thereof, introduced in a dry, less hydrated, or substantially deswollen state and rehydrate in a physiological environment to undergo a volumetric expansion and to affect sealing, plugging, or augmentation of tissue, defects in tissue, or of organs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">High bleeding volume and transfusion rate are major challenges during the orthopedic procedures. Energy devices like monopolar are rather designed for soft tissues, while bone waxes are generally not absorbable by the body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is a need in improved hemostatic forms and materials which facilitate ease of application and rapid onset of hemostasis for wounds such as bone wounds.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention relates, inter alia, to non-flowable and deformable compositions, methods of making thereof, and using same for treating bleeding tissues.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Currently, hemostatic methods used, especially in orthopedic surgeries, are limited. The bone wax is the most common used material, but it is non-absorbable/degradable. This might lead to several problems, including impediment of bone regeneration and infections.

Once contact with moisture (blood), the dry particles absorb water very fast and swell, allowing to fill the micro-structure or cavities of e.g., a bone tissue, to achieve hemostasis.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one aspect, there is provided a non-flowable and deformable hemostatic composition comprising a xerogel comprising crosslinked powdered polysaccharide dispersed within a substantially anhydrous blend of one or more dispersants. The xerogel comprising crosslinked powdered polysaccharide is referred to as: &#x201c;xerogel crosslinked powdered polysaccharide&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the polysaccharide comprises a polymer selected from carboxymethyl starch (CMS), hyaluronate, and a mixture, copolymer or a derivative thereof.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Within the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d;, when used in connection with polysaccharide, refers to polysaccharide that is derived from the natural polysaccharide by chemical modification such as etherification or esterification.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hereinthroughout, for each one of &#x201c;PEG&#x201d;, &#x201c;CMS&#x201d;, &#x201c;HA&#x201d;, and &#x201c;glycerol&#x201d; it is also meant to encompass any derivative thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Starch is a polymeric carbohydrate comprising numerous glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as energy storage. CMS is one of the major varieties of modified starch, starch ethers genus, is a water-soluble anionic polymer compound. It is commonly used sodium salt, also known as CMS-Na, wherein a white or yellow powder, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and may absorb moisture.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hyaluronic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;HA&#x201d; means hyaluronate, or any salt thereof, e.g., sodium hyaluronate. Also, the term &#x201c;HA derivative&#x201d;, when used herein, is intended to encompass, inter alia, any salt thereof, in particular the sodium salt of the HA derivative.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term &#x201c;hyaluronic acid&#x201d; encompasses all variants and combinations of variants of hyaluronic acid, or hyaluronan, of various chain lengths and charge states, as well as various chemical modifications. That is, the term also encompasses the various hyaluronate salts of hyaluronic acid, such as sodium hyaluronate. Various modifications of the hyaluronic acid are therefore encompassed by the term, such as oxidation, e.g. oxidation of CH<sub>2</sub>OH groups to COOH; periodate oxidation of vicinal hydroxyl groups, optionally followed by reduction or imine formation; reduction, e.g., reduction of COOH to CH<sub>2</sub>OH; sulphation; deamidation, optionally followed by deamination or amide formation with new acids; esterification; substitutions with various compounds, e.g., using a cross-linking agent as described herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to one embodiment, a fast swelling, superabsorbable, biodegradable hemostatic composition comprises: carboxymethyl starch (CMS) crosslinked by citric acid (or similar polyfunctional carboxylic acid e.g., malic, tartaric, citric, malonic, succinic, glutaric, or adipic acid) above 50% by weight, which is suspended or dispersed as a fine powder, as demonstrated in the Examples section, in a mixture of a first non-toxic glycerol-containing and hygroscopic dispersant, and a second non-toxic, optionally alcohol-functionalized, dispersant, which in some embodiments comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG). The hemostatic composition of the invention is pasty and/or dough-like, non-flowable, and has sufficient viscosity and cohesion to maintain a continuous, singular form at room temperature when placed upon flat, unconstrained flat surfaces and within cavities or voids. The inventive composition is substantially free of water or anhydrous. In some embodiments, both dispersants are hydrophilic. Hereinthroughout, cross-linked hyaluronate may be used instead of, or in addition to, crosslinked CMS xerogel.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Typically, the dried polysaccharide xerogel has three-dimensional crosslinked polymeric network that are capable of absorbing large quantities of water, saline or physiological liquid forming hydrogels. The powerful osmotic action dehydrates and gels the blood component upon contact, and swelling to more than 20 times of the dry xerogel weight or volume may be achieved to fill up a wound and produce a &#x201c;back pressure&#x201d; in the confined wound space to simulate tamponade effect or enhance the natural clotting process in internal voids. These dispersants (e.g., PEG and glycerol) maintain the anhydrous environment and makes the composition hygroscopic.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, the instantly disclosed composition (e.g., in the form of hemostatic paste) can be employed for a timed or delayed release of active agents e.g. as a drug-delivery vehicle. The composition may incorporate growth factors, antibiotics, local anesthetics, and any agents useful to improve wound healing, prevent infection or relieve pain.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">By incorporating coagulation activators, platelet activators or blood vessel constrictors, fibrinolytic function inhibitors, etc., including e.g., thrombin, fibrinogen, the hemostatic effect of the paste may be further improved.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the main component of the paste/dough-like forming the xerogel is polysaccharide crosslinked by citric acid, having an increased mechanical stability. Several polysaccharides showed high absorption ability in the unmodified state, but these have the disadvantage that the swelling occurs only in warm water and that dissolution can take place.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Such unmodified/uncross-linked polysaccharides have low mechanical stability and can undergo degradation, and/or retrogradation, and/or and syneresis (contraction of a gel accompanied by the separating out of liquid).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the xerogel comprises (cross-linked) polysaccharide selected from CMS or HA hyaluronate</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, one of the dispersants comprises glycerol. In some embodiments, the dispersants comprise glycerol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), are present in a weight ratio ranging from 1:2.7 to 2.7:1, or 1.3:1 to 2.7:1, respectively. In some embodiments, the glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), are present in a weight ratio of above 1.3:1 to less than 2.7:1, respectively. In some embodiments, the glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), are present in a weight ratio of 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2:1, 2.1:1, 2.2:1, 2.3:1, 2.4:1, 2.5:1, 2.6:1 or approaching 2.7:1, respectively, including any value and range therebetween. In some embodiments, the glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), are present in a ratio between higher than 1.3:1 to below 2.7:1 by weight, respectively. Reference is made in this respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-D</figref>, showing that when the ratio was about 1:1.3, the sample was dry and easy to crack during kneading by hand. When the ratios are 1:1.7 and 1:2.2, the samples were easy to deform by kneading. It is suggested that these ratios are the appropriate PEG to glycerol range. When the ratio increased to about 1:2.7, the sample was too thin, somehow flowable, and was very sticky to nitrile gloves, that is being less effective for practical use by a surgeon for placing the paste over the bleeding site. These ratios, on the other hand, still satisfy a desired adhesiveness range of 2.5 to 4 N/m e.g., at least 3 N/m, as tested using a T-peel test (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and Tables 5 and 6).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the powder content in the composition is above 50%, by weight.

The term &#x201c;viscous solution&#x201d; refers to a solution that has an increased resistance to flow, yet is capable of deformed and reform, typically, but not exclusively, having a static high viscosity. In some embodiments, the paste has a high viscosity at rest and room temperature. In some embodiments, the paste provides a substantially homogeneous dispersion of the crosslinked polysaccharide.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the term &#x201c;high viscosity&#x201d; means that the paste cannot be easily squeezed out when being applied.

The adhesive force of the PG group is stronger than that of the PEG400 group (p&#x3c;0.05). Nevertheless, as described below, it was further found that when the formulation contains PEG400, it becomes less sticky to gloves.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0187">PEG400 dosage determination: to address bone bleeding, one of the needs is the ease of use of the product. Normally, practitioners use the hemostat by hand, like bone wax. Thus, one of the requirements of the present concept is the composition not being sticky to gloves. The decrease in adhesive force when PG is replaced by PEG400 provides direct evidence that the PEG400 contribute directly to the ease of use of this bone hemostat. Accordingly, it was visually observed that when the formulation contained both propylene glycol and PEG400 (1:1 by weight) the hemostat was sticky to gloves and when the prototype contained propylene glycol, it was stickier, and it adhered to gloves (nitrile gloves were used in exemplary procedures). In this respect, propylene glycol is less preferred. Reference is made in this respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> presenting a photographic image showing that PEG-to-propylene glycol 1:1, the paste sticks to the gloves.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0188">When the propylene glycol was fully replaced by PEG400, although the adhesiveness decreased a little bit, it did not adhere to gloves any more. Additionally, the PEG400-containing prototype is as effective as the propylene glycol one in hemostasis as shown below.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0189">As the result, PEG400 was used instead of propylene glycol for bone hemostat.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0190">In additional exemplary procedures, four different PEG400 to glycerol weight ratios, 1:1.3, 1:1.7, 1:2.2, and 1:2.7, respectively, were tested (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-D</figref>). When the ratio was about 1:1.3, the sample was dry and easy to crack during kneading by hand. When the ratios are 1:1.7 and 1:2.2, the samples were easy to deform by kneading. It is suggested that these ratios are the appropriate PEG to glycerol range. When the ratio increased to about 1:2.7, the sample was too thin, somehow flowable, and was very sticky to nitrile gloves (also known as acrylonitrile butadiene rubber; Medicom). It is to note, again, that paste with PEG-to-propylene glycol 1:1, by weight, also resulted in the paste being stick to the gloves.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0191">Referring to Table 6, when the ratio is 1:1.3, the sample was too thin, which means it could not stay at the bleeding surface. Also, the sample became less and less flowable when the PEG400 dosage was reduced.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Samples with different PEG/glycerol weight ratio </entry></row><row><entry>(the cross-linking ratio is 0.4x)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>CMS-CA</entry><entry>Glycerol</entry><entry>PEG400</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>PEG400/glycerol</entry><entry>(g)</entry><entry>(g)</entry><entry>(g)</entry><entry>Adhesiveness</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>1:1.3</entry><entry>6</entry><entry>2.26</entry><entry>1.74</entry><entry>NA (too thin)</entry></row><row><entry>1:2.2</entry><entry>6</entry><entry>2.75</entry><entry>1.25</entry><entry>3.96 N/m</entry></row><row><entry>1:2.7</entry><entry>6</entry><entry>2.92</entry><entry>1.08</entry><entry>3.99 N/m</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0207" num="0192">It is noteworthy that, as described below, both T-peel test and in-vivo test shown good results when the ratio was up to 1:2.7.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 4 Degradation Rate Vs. Crosslinking Agent Concentration</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0193">Normally, a starch-based material can be degraded by the body within a very short period of time because of the amylase in the plasma. For a hemostat, to maintain its function, the degradation profile should be slow at the very beginning and be fast once the hemostasis is achieved. To achieve this goal, adjusting the crosslinking rate was dictated by using different amounts of citric acid. It was found that the more citric acid was added, the more condense the xerogel particles were.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0194">In exemplary procedures, the degradation rate was determined using phenol-sulfuric acid method: carbohydrates (simple sugars, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and their derivatives) react in the presence of strong acid and heat to generate furan derivatives that condense with phenol to form stable yellow-gold compounds that can be measured spectrophotometrically.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0195">Thus, in exemplary procedures, glucose standard solution was first prepared, by adding 20.12 g of glucose to 500 mL of double distilled (dd) water. Next, each of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 mL of the glucose solution respectively, were then taken and diluted to 20 mL with dd water. Chromogenic solution was then prepared by adding to the phenol solution (80%), 1.5 mL, to 18.5 mL of dd water to make the phenol solution of 6%. Next, 199.85 and 200.01 mg of the CMS, and 200.01 and 200.46 mg of CMS-CA (0.5, 1, and 4&#xd7;) were weighted, and 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was poured to each sample.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0196">For obtaining the standard curve, 5 mL of the chromogenic solution was added to each of the glucose solutions as described above. Next, 5 mL of the chromogenic solution was added to the samples containing the PBS. The standard curve solutions and the sample solutions were heated in boiling water for 30 min, and thereafter were cooled in ice.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0197">The standard samples and the testing samples were added to 96-well plate (n=2), followed by measuring the absorbance value at 490 nm.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0198">The results are summarized in Table 7 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. At the beginning, the degradation rate was reversely proportional to the crosslinking rate. At longer time points the degradation rates were similar in all sample groups, indicating that the overall degradation profile of the CMS-CA is affected by the crosslinking rate.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0199">From the results it can be concluded that the condensed xerogel particles are more resistant to enzyme degradation at the beginning (just after the hemostat was applied). Once the enzyme in the plasma has adequate contact with the whole particle, the degradation is likely to accelerated according to the trend shown in Table 7 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. It is noteworthy that the bone hemostat needs a relatively rapid degradation rate, since it should not interrupt the bone tissue regeneration.

The defect was created, and no treatment was applied during 10 min to ensure the hemostasis was not due to auto coagulation. Next, one of the control samples (Bone wax and Ostene (purchased from Baxter)) and CMS-CA or HA-CA were applied to the same defect surface. Acute hemostasis, durable hemostasis and adhesiveness were evaluated.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0205">The detailed procedure is described below.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0206">In a first set of exemplary procedures, the samples were evaluated in an in vivo sheep model both before and after heparin administration. Evaluations in the non-heparinized sheep model were aimed to simulate use of bone hemostats during standard surgery (e.g., spinal surgery). Evaluations in the heparinized sheep model were aimed to mimic the use of bone hemostats in anticoagulated cardiovascular patients (e.g., sternotomy). The target was to apply each of the eight sample (six tests and two controls) a minimum of five times in a non-heparinized animal model and five times in a heparinized animal model. Both non-heparinized and heparinized testing were conducted in each animal. The actual number of applications per sample were determined by the number of accessible application sites available in the six animals included in the study.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0207">Each sheep had four to six defects created on each ilium (mean of five defects per ilium).

Any bleeding detected at the overlap point was noted in the comments section but was not attributed to either product.

Baseline and post-treatment activated clotting time (ACT) were monitored to adjust the dose of heparin used in the animal A minimum of 10 minutes after the initial administration of heparin, a blood sample was drawn, and ACT measured. The animal was appropriately heparinized when ACT was greater than 2 times the baseline reading.
