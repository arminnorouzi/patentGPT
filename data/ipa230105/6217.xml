More particularly, the present invention relates to pulsed electrochemical deposition of ordered intermetallic carbon composites for advanced electrocatalytic applications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Metastable materials offer the opportunity to explore new materials for electrocatalysis beyond conventional equilibrium phases. Metastable ordered intermetallic compounds (metastable alloys with long range atomic scale ordering) offer unparalleled control of material properties by providing the ability to precisely modulate the local atomic structure by accessing a specific phase, and allowing one to access various structural variations of materials with the same composition. However, synthetic methods for manipulating the nanoscale morphology of metastable ordered intermetallic compounds is difficult, since the principles which govern formation of these materials is poorly understood. Catalyst activity and selectivity are impacted by the atomic structure and morphology of the electrode. Hence, lack of morphological control of metastable ordered intermetallic materials is hampering its progress for advancing the field of electrocatalysis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nanostructured metastable ordered intermetallic compounds are difficult to rationally target synthetically because the nucleation and growth conditions required to access these phases are not unequivocally known. The formation of metastable ordered intermetallic nanoparticles can only occur under conditions in which interfacial stabilization by capping agents results in greater stability for the metastable phase relative to equilibrium phases, or under conditions in which nucleation rather solid-state diffusion is rate limiting. However, the former case is difficult to predict from first principles, while the latter often results in materials with poor atomic ordering. Hence, conventional synthetic methods, such as high temperature annealing and/or colloidal synthesis, largely excludes the formation of metastable ordered intermetallic compounds under typical reaction conditions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electrochemical deposition has recently emerged as a flexible technique for the direct preparation of metastable alloys and ordered intermetallic phases yielding catalyst with high intrinsic catalytic performance. However, these techniques are limited to the preparation of thin films on flat/nonporous substrates, precluding their application in an application-relevant contexts which require high surface area, and for designing materials which can harness diffusional transport gradients for enhancing catalytic activity and/or selectivity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a method utilizing pulsed electrochemical deposition to decouple nucleation from growth kinetics, allowing for the direct synthesis of sub-15 nm diameter metastable ordered intermetallic Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles which uniformly decorate commercial carbon black supports.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention which includes a method of forming a nanostructured metastable ordered intermetallic compound including depositing Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles using pulsed electrochemical deposition.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a method of the present invention, the Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles are deposited at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles are deposited in a single step. The open circuit potential is typically 0.54 V. A pulsed potentiostatic waveform with a large overpotential to initiate uniform nucleation is used. The pulsed potentiostatic waveform can take the form a pulse of t=0.03+5 s for 200 cycles. The pulsed potentiostatic waveform with the large overpotential to initiate uniform nucleation is used with a constant potential deposition to grow deposited nuclei. The constant potential deposition has a duration of t=180 s.

In particular, nanostructured metastable ordered intermetallic compounds are particularly challenging to synthesize. Here, the present invention is directed to a method for synthesizing sub-15 nm metastable ordered intermetallic Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles at room temperature, in a single step, by pulsed electrochemical deposition onto high surface area carbon supports. The resulting Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles displays a 7&#xd7; enhancement of the mass activity relative to Pt/C and a 4&#xd7; enhancement relative to Pd/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The high performance of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles is demonstrated to arise from reduced oxygen binding caused by alloying of Pd with Bi. The isolation of Pd-sites from each other facilitate methanol tolerant ORR behavior.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention is directed to a method utilizing pulsed electrochemical deposition to decouple nucleation from growth kinetics, allowing for the direct synthesis of sub-15 nm diameter metastable ordered intermetallic Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles which uniformly decorate commercial carbon black supports.

The resulting Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>nanoparticles achieve a surface area of &#x2dc;37 m<sup>2</sup>/g<sub>Pd</sub>, which is nearly 40&#xd7; higher than conventional electrodeposition processes which yield low-porosity thin film morphologies.

The ORR performance was assessed by measuring Linear Sweep Voltammograms (LSV) on Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C, Pd/C, Pt/C in 0.1M KOH electrolyte saturated with oxygen at 1600 rpm, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. The onset potential for ORR with Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C (0.97 V) is lower than Pt/C (1.03 V) and Pd/C (1.09 V). However, as the overpotential for ORR increases, the current density of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>increases faster than that of Pt/C and Pd/C, resulting in a higher current density after 0.94V. The half-wave potential of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C is 0.92V, whereas the half-wave potential of Pt/C and Pd/C is 0.87V and 0.91V, respectively. The intrinsic activity of all materials was determined by mass-transport correction of linear sweep voltammograms by the Koutecky-Levich equation to obtain the kinetic current density, which was then normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (specific activity) or mass of precious metal (mass activity). The mass and electrochemically active surface areas were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and CO stripping, respectively.

However, the specific activity retention of Pd/C is &#x2dc;30%, indicating that it exhibits significantly lower stability than Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C. The specific surface areas Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>and Pt/C decreases by &#x2dc;10%, and by &#x2dc;15% for Pd/C after 10K cycles, the loss of activity is probably caused by particle aggregation, and removal of highly active sites via surface reconstructions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>.

The enhanced stability of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>relative to Pd/C can be attributed to the strong bonds afforded by the negative enthalpy of mixing of Pd and Bi and/or by enhanced affinity of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>with the carbon support.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To understand why Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C is more active than elemental Pd/C cyclic voltammograms of both samples in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH were measure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>. Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C does not exhibit hydrogen underpotential deposition (H-UPD) in the potential range 0 to &#x2dc;0.4 V potential range, while it is clearly visible on Pd/C. The surface oxidation feature of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C which occurs above 0.7V in the anodic scan displays a sharper feature relative to Pd/C. In the reverse scan direction (anodic scan) of the cyclic voltammogram, the Pd oxide reduction peak of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C is significantly sharper than Pd/C. In addition to this the Pd oxide reduction peak of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C (0.750 V) shifts by 31 mV towards more positive potentials relative to Pd/C (0.719 V), indicating that the Pd&#x2014;O bond has substantially weakened. Pd adsorbs oxygen based intermediates too strongly, hence a reduction of the Pd&#x2014;O bond energy can enhance catalysis as indicated by the Sabatier principle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an image view of a representative high resolution TEM image of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>and its resulting electron diffraction pattern after 10K cycles of ADT demonstrating a retainment of intermetallic crystallinity.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Low-temperature fuel cells can utilize small molecules, such as methanol, for the anode reaction. Alkaline membranes are permeable to methanol, allowing significant crossover of methanol from the anode to the cathode during fuel cell operation. Pt and Pd are both excellent catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol, however this reaction occurs in the same potential range as ORR, eroding the efficiency of Pt and Pd for performing ORR. Recent studies have shown that multiple neighboring Pt or Pd metal sites (large site ensembles) are required for methanol oxidation to occur, however large site ensembles are not required for ORR. The atomic ordering of the atoms in ordered intermetallic Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>will maximize the number of bonds between Pd and Bi, and minimize the number of possible Pd&#x2014;Pd bonds, leading to small ensembles of Pd sites. Inspection of the crystal structure indicates that the number of Pd&#x2014;Pd bonds present on the surface varies from 2 to 4 depending on the facet, indicating that Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>should be a poor catalyst for methanol oxidation because of low number of Pd ensembles. To test this hypothesis, the oxidation of methanol on N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with 0.5 M of methanol, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> on Pd/C, Pt/C and Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C was measured. The oxidation of methanol can be clearly seen in Pt/C and Pd/C as two characteristic oxidation peaks are observed in the forward and return scans at 0.9-0.95 V and at 0.77 V, respectively. In contrast, the CV of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C in methanol appears similar to CVs collected in methanol free solution, to provide further insight CVs of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C with and without methanol in the electrolyte were overlayed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>C</figref>. Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C exhibits a small increase in the baseline current at voltages more positive than 0.5 V when methanol is present in the anodic scan direction, however the peak potential of the anodic wave (&#x2dc;0.9 V) overlaps with the wave collected in a methanol free solution, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In the return scan, the Pd-oxide reduction peak overlaps with that of methanol-free solutions, and showing a small anodic increase in the current between 0.6 to &#x2dc;0.7 V. Nevertheless, Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C reacts poorly with methanol, indicating that it should exhibit high methanol tolerance during ORR. To assess the ORR methanol tolerance, ORR electrocatalysis is performed in the presence of 0.5 M methanol, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. The voltammograms indicate that ORR is completely suppressed at voltages more positive than 0.6 V for Pt/C and Pd/C from methanol oxidation, as indicated by the large oxidative wave. The ORR can outcompete methanol oxidation at voltages more negative than 0.6 V, increasing the overpotential for ORR by &#x3e;200 mV on Pt/C and Pd/C. In contrast, a minor shift of 11 mV is observed for the half-wave potential of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12 </sub>for ORR, indicating that the presence of methanol hardly interferes with its ORR activity. The minimization of surface Pd&#x2014;Pd bonds afforded by atomic scale ordering allow Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C to possess superior methanol tolerant ORR behavior.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate graphical views of sample characteristics, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a graphical view of methanol oxidation on Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C, Pd/C, and Pt/C in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with 0.5 M Methanol. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates a graphical view of CV of Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with and without methanol. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates a graphical view of ORR on Pd<sub>31</sub>Bi<sub>12</sub>/C, Pd/C, and Pt/C in N2- saturated 0.1 M KOH with 0.5 M Methanol.
