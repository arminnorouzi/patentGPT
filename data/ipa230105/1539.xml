More specifically the present disclosure further is associated with at least the CPC classifications: B24C 1/00 Methods for use of abrasive blasting for producing particular effects; Use of auxiliary equipment in connections with such methods; B24C 3/00 Abrasive blasting machines or devices; B24C 7/00 Equipment for feeding abrasive material, Controlling the flowability, constitution, or other physical characteristics of abrasive blasts; B24C 11/00 Selection of abrasive materials (or additives) for abrasive blasts; B24C 5/00 Devices or accessories for generating abrasive blasts; B24C 9/00 Appurtenances of abrasive blasting machines or devices, e.g., working chambers, arrangements for handling used abrasive material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Blast finishing with abrasive materials is a well-known industry. In many situations, blast machines have integrated separators that are supposed to separate reusable abrasive media from non-reusable media. In some cases, the reusable media is routed back into the blast machine or collection container and the non-reusable media is routed to a discards barrel. Conventionally, blast machine separators are not kept in peak operating condition. This often causes problems because literally tons of good, useable abrasive media travels with the non-reusable discards into waste barrels. Those barrels are then sealed and sent to the landfill. For example, wasting useable abrasive media can cost users tens of thousands of dollars or more. This is money that is literally thrown away and sent to a landfill.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains a need for improved methods for separating reusable abrasive media from non-reusable media. This need and other needs are satisfied by the various aspects of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the purposes of the disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, the disclosure, in one aspect, relates to devices, systems, and methods for separating good, reusable blasting media from unwanted separator fines on blasting machines.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In further aspects, the present disclosure may generally relate to separating good blasting media from unwanted separator fines on blasting machines. Blast machines may have integrated separators that may be configured to separate reusable abrasive media from non-reusable media. The reusable media may be routed back into the blast machine or collection container and the non-reusable media may be routed to a discards barrel. Traditionally, blast machine separators may not be kept in peak operating condition causing literally tons of good abrasive to travel with the discards into waste barrels. Those barrels may then be sealed and subsequently may be sent to a landfill. The present disclosure may provide an apparatus which may be place in route to a discards barrel configured in a manner which may screen good abrasive from dust and fines particles. The apparatus may be portable and relatively inexpensive. Further, the apparatus may save users at least tens of thousands of dollars in wasted abrasive costs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In further aspects, the present disclosure also relates to an apparatus, method, or system which may separate good abrasive blasting media from the unwanted dust and fines particles from sources outside of one or more blast machines. Blast machines may leak abrasive including but not limited to good abrasive, fines and dust particles. Leaked abrasive may be swept up from the floors, vacuumed from one or more catch pits and placed into barrels. The present disclosure may provide an apparatus which may be configured to screen the leaked dust and fines particles from leaked reusable abrasive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still further aspects, the present disclosure may classify abrasive medias in peening applications. Peening machines may require specific media sizes to accomplish particular peening criteria, standards, or policies. By draining a controlled portion of an abrasive media hopper through the apparatus provided in the present disclosure, the abrasive media may be separated into various sizes and subsequently into specific classifications. The present disclosure may further be configured in such a manner that peeners may be assured the media they are using meets the requirements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional aspects of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the disclosure. The advantages of the disclosure will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure, as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several aspects of the disclosure and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows an exploded view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows another perspective view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a left-side view and right-side view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of the separator assembly of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a top view and a side view of the separator assembly of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows another perspective view of the separator assembly of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> shows a front view of the separator assembly of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a perspective cross sectional view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows another perspective cross sectional view of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows a top view and a top sectional views of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows a bottom view and a bottom sectional views of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a flow chart of a method of using an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a front view and a front right and front left sectional views of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows a rear view and a rear right and rear left sectional views of an apparatus consistent with the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the disclosure and the Examples included therein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Before the present articles, systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific manufacturing methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular materials unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary.

This section covers some of the most widely used types of manufactured abrasives. Manufactured abrasives, meaning primarily those materials that are created through a manufacturing process as opposed to being mined from the earth. Some naturally occurring materials are also produced artificially (such as aluminum oxide and naturally occurring diamond), so the distinction between these two categories is not absolute. Additionally, naturally occurring abrasives are often used in the same applications as manufactured abrasives. Thus, some naturally-occurring abrasives are herein incorporated as well.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Widely-used naturally occurring abrasives include garnet, cerium oxide, flint, emery, corundum (aluminum oxide), and diamond. These materials may have varying characteristics and chemical compositions depending on the specific geological source. Manufactured versions of these materials are usually more consistent in chemical composition and other characteristics.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Manufactured Abrasives: Abrasives can be distinguished in a variety of ways&#x2014;their hardness, color, chemical composition, crystal shape, and friability, to name but a few. Since the chemical composition&#x2014;that is, the type of material&#x2014;determines many of the other characteristics, we use that as the primary means of distinguishing one type of abrasive from another.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">1. Chemical Composition</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">1a. Alumina Based (Aluminum Oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) abrasive media having a hardness of 9.0 on Mohs hardness scale includes at least:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">A. White Fused Aluminum Oxide which has high chemical purity (&#x3e;99% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It is generally used for applications where high purity is important including but not limited to medical, dental or other industrial uses. Additionally, this abrasive media may be generally softer or more friable than other abrasives. This abrasive media may be used in grinding applications where a more friable product is desired. This abrasive media may have granules that are typically are blocky shaped, with an aspect ratio of approximately 1:1 to 3:1.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">B. White Calcined Aluminum Oxide&#x2014;High purity aluminum oxide (&#x3e;99.5% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manufactured by growing individual crystals from seed crystals at high temperature. Crystals are hexagonal platelet shaped with an aspect ratio of 5:1. Used in a variety of lapping, buffing and polishing applications, incorporated into bars and pads, and used in ceramics.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">C.

Brown Fused Aluminum Oxide&#x2014;Abrasive with a content of 2-4% TiO2 to further enhance toughness; the &#x201c;workhorse&#x201d; of the industry; used in a wide variety of uses including Bonded, Coated, Refractory and Industrial markets; probably the most widely used abrasive.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">E. Low Titania Brown Fused Aluminum Oxide&#x2014;Abrasive with a content of 1-2% TiO2 to enhance toughness of the grain; generally used in Bonded or Coated applications requiring an abrasive slightly tougher than White Aluminum Oxide.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">F. Zirconia-Alumina&#x2014;The toughest of the alumina-based products; used in Bonded, Coated and Sandblasting applications requiring an extra tough abrasive.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">G. Hydrated Alumina&#x2014;Aluminum oxide with water chemically bonded to the alumina. Crystals are small (typically 1 mm or less in size) and very soft; typically used for fine polishing applications and as a raw material for ceramics.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">H. Ceramic Aluminum Oxide&#x2014;A high-purity fine-grained alumina obtained from sintering dispersed colloidal alumina. This provides a tough product primarily used for precision grinding of steels and hard alloys.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">1b. Silicon Carbide (SiC) abrasive media having a hardness of 9.3 on Mohs hardness scale includes at least:</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">A. Silicon Carbide is a man-made abrasive material formed by a series of vapor-phase reactions of carbon and silicon dioxide at high temperature in an Acheson furnace. Alpha phase silicon carbide, in the form of hexagonally shaped platelets, is the most common form observed in the abrasives and refractories industries. The character of alpha silicon carbide is dependent on a number of factors such as purity of raw materials used in the Acheson furnace, and the reaction time and temperature.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">B. Green Silicon Carbide is a man-made abrasive material having the highest purity Silicon Carbide that can be manufactured is generally used in grinding wheels for particular grinding properties or in industrial applications requiring a high purity coatings.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">C. Black Silicon Carbide is a man-made abrasive material having lower purity (95-98%). Generally classified as a tougher Silicon Carbide generally used in Bonded, Coated, Refractory and Industrial markets for a wide variety of applications.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">1c. Other Manufactured Abrasives Including Boron Carbide (B4C), Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN), and Diamond; used for special applications requiring very hard materials for grinding and polishing. CBN and Diamond are also known as &#x201c;Superabrasives.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">2. Abrasive Shapes Particle shape affects the performance of the abrasive in a variety of ways, such as the rate of stock removal and level of subsurface damage. Some specialty applications require unusual shapes. For fused alumina and many other abrasives (such as silicon carbide), the aspect ratio (length to width) is a primary descriptor of shape. For others, the aspect ratio is irrelevant or misleading. Thus, fused aluminum oxide tends to have one long dimension and two smaller, roughly equal dimensions; i.e., the thickness is roughly equal to the width. Calcined alumina tends to have two long dimensions and one much smaller one; i.e., the length and width are roughly equal, but the thickness is about one-fifth the length. (For calcined alumina, this ratio, length to thickness, is often referred to as the aspect ratio). For more exotic shapes, aspect ratio may vary with the size of the particle and thus can only be given as a range.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">2a. Blocky Shape abrasive having a high bulk density wherein the abrasive grain is &#x201c;rounded&#x201d; by abrading equipment to remove very sharp, weak grain. Depending on application, the grain shape can vary from &#x201c;mulled&#x201d; to blocky with sharp edges. The blocky shape may enhance toughness and bulk density of the grain. Applications include tougher grinding or sanding applications, longer life for sandblasting and increased density for refractory or ceramic applications. The aspect ratio of this abrasive is approximately 1:1.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">2b. Blocky Shape abrasive having a medium bulk density wherein the abrasive grain is shaped to yield particles which are sharp but do not contain weak, platey or needlelike particles. Uses of this abrasive include but is not limited to general grinding, sanding, sandblasting and refractory applications. Aspect ratio is approximately up to 1.5:1.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">2c. Sharp Shape abrasive having a low bulk density wherein the abrasive grain may have been specially crushed to yield very sharp grain. This is generally required by the coated abrasives industry and some grinding wheel applications to produce an aggressive, fast cutting product. Aspect ratio ranges from 1.5:1&#x2192;3:1.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">2d. Platelet Shaped abrasive which may generally found in calcined alumina.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">2e. Extreme Shapes/Irregular Shapes abrasive having a variety of highly unusual shapes are possible through different manufacturing processes for specific applications. Includes extruded abrasives.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">All abrasives contain particles with a range of sizes. In general, the more uniform in size the abrasive, the more expensive and difficult it is to manufacture. Sizing or grading refers to making the particle sizes within an abrasive more uniform so that the majority of the particles fall within a given range of sizes.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">There are at least three ways this can be done: The abrasive particles themselves can be made smaller until they are all the same very small size; the abrasive particles can be joined together to make larger particles of a desired size; or the particles can be sorted into different sizes. Most abrasive manufacturing uses some combination of these methods to obtain particles of the desired size range.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Size Classification: After size reduction, the material is separated into discrete size ranges. This is accomplished by a variety of means, including most prominently screening, air classifying, and water classifying. In screening, the material to be separated is passed over a series of screens with decreasing opening sizes. At the first, coarsest, screen, most of the material passes through, with only the largest particles retained on the screen and eventually collected. At the second screen, the next coarsest fraction is removed, and so on. In air classifying, the material is blown across a series of openings. The coarsest particles fall first; the finer particles fall later. Thus, size separation is achieved. There are two main forms of water classification, fractional sedimentation and elutriation. In fractional sedimentation, the material is mixed with water and a dispersing agent to allow for discrete settling. The agitation ceases, and the material begins to settle. After a given period of time, all particles over a given diameter will have settled at least to a given depth. The material and liquid above that depth are then removed, and the material removed from the liquid, while the remaining material is then remixed for further gradual material removal.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In elutriation, the same principle applies, but the column of water in which the material is settling is itself moving at a fixed rate (as more water is added near the bottom of the column). Particles small enough to settle more slowly than the column of water is moving upward are floated off and collected.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Characterization of Abrasives: Abrasives are most commonly used to remove part of the surface of some material, called the substrate or workpiece. This removal is called abrading. The abrading occurs by rubbing the abrasive under some pressure against the surface to be abraded. To effectively abrade, the abrasive must be harder than the material being abraded. The rate at which the surface is removed, and the smoothness of the abraded surface, depend upon a variety of characteristics of the abrasive and the substrate. Of these, the most important is the size of the abrasive particles. When we speak of characterization of abrasives, we frequently mean describing the particle size distribution. If everything else is equal, larger particles abrade more rapidly, and leave a rougher surface, than smaller particles. Thus, it is important for the user to know approximately the size of the abrasive they are using. Abrasives with relatively large particles are called coarse; those with smaller particles are called fine. These are, of course, relative terms. It is more correct to call one abrasive coarser or finer than another.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">The range of particle sizes may be described within an abrasive by means of a particle size distribution. Thus, it may be said that all of the particles are larger than ten microns in diameter, half of the particles are larger (and half smaller) than 30 microns in diameter, and none of the particles are larger than 60 microns in diameter. But the user of the abrasive may want to know if, having used this abrasive, they later use an abrasive in which all of the particles are larger than 11 microns, half are larger than 29 microns, and none are larger than 58 microns, they can expect it to perform the same.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Within the various types of abrasives discussed above, various sizes or grades of abrasive are available. These sizes are standardized within the abrasives industry. For example, while the particle size distribution of individual batches of ANSI 100 grade will vary, they will all meet a set of particle size distribution criteria. There will be few if any particles over 212 microns in diameter, no more than 20% of the abrasive will be made up of particles over 150 microns in diameter, etc.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Many individual abrasive manufacturers have also developed their own sets of size ranges; in general, the designations used have some connection to the size of the abrasive particles. The individual manufacturers can generally relate these sizes to those covered by one of the national or international standards. In addition to size, other characteristics of the abrasive, such as the bulk density, capillarity, pH, friability, surface area, and free iron and other chemical content may be crucial to appropriate performance in various applications. Development and updating standardized ways to measure such characteristics is the main focus of the Standards Committee. These standards provide the basis for manufacturers to supply globally.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Sizing Abrasive Media Particles: Defining the size of a particle may be the mean diameter of the largest surface. Therefore, this particle would be the diameter of the larger circle shown. When size may be defined as the average diameter of all its sides, it would be considerably smaller. When size may be defined based on a particle's volume, it would be another value still. Sizing is based on the methods of measurement.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Methods of Measurement: Abrasive sizes are broadly broken into two groups, macrogrits (also called &#x201c;screen sizes&#x201d;) and microgrits (also called &#x201c;sedimentation sizes&#x201d;). This division is due to the different methods of size measurement traditionally used. (Some modern methods of particle size measurement may be used on either type of material, as discussed below.)</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">Screen Sizing Using Test Sieves: For example, in order to make sure that none of the particles in our ANSI 100 grade abrasive were over 212 microns in diameter. Looking at a large volume under a microscope, checking to make sure there were no oversized particles; or, screening it through a sieve with openings 212 microns in size, hoping it all passed through. This latter method, using sieves with known opening sizes to see how much abrasive can pass through under given conditions, has long been the industry standard. These measurements are performed with specially produced and controlled test sieves.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Test sieves are woven wire or electroformed screens or perforated metal pans that are used for testing and sifting. Of these, woven wire sieves are most commonly used for testing materials to ensure they meet a designated particle size distribution. Woven wire test sieves are constructed by placing wire cloth between two suppressed die formed frames. Stainless steel or brass is generally used in the construction of both the frame and woven wire mesh that performs the sieving. These devices are widely used in various types of laboratory particle size analysis.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Test sieves are manufactured to standardized requirements; the specific standard used depends on where it is manufactured, and the type of sieve. In the United States, ASTM E11 covers the requirements for design and construction of woven wire cloth test sieves. European sieves are manufactured to ISO Standard 3310-1. Electroformed sieves are manufactured in the United States to ASTM E161, while perforated plate sieves are manufactured to ASTM E323, or British Standard BS140-1. All of these standards specify a number of properties to which any rated test sieves must adhere. These ratings include acceptable opening sizes, opening dimensions, maximum number of allowable openings in each test sieve, and in the case of woven wire sieves, nominal wire diameter.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Sieves are available in a number of quality levels, with the precise nomenclature used varying by manufacturer. Commonly used terms include certified, inspection, matched, calibrated, matched and calibrated, and midpoint. Certified or inspection sieves are the most widely used. They are manufactured to a national or international standard and come with a certificate of conformity. It is also possible to obtain pairs of sieves that have been manufactured and tested to match each other, and sieves with a test certificate which gives the range of tolerances and measurements taken.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">MacroGrits (sizes 4 to 220 or 240, also called screen sizes or sieve sizes) are traditionally measured using test sieves. The particles in these sizes range from less than 45 microns to up to 8 mm (8000 microns). A range of particles is allowed to be present in a given size, with a maximum coarse limit and a minimum fine percentage. (For most sizes, no more than 3% of the abrasive by weight is allowed to be finer than the fine limit.) To determine the particle size distribution of a material, a stack of sieves with known openings is prepared, with the sieve with the biggest openings on top, the smallest on the bottom. A known weight of the material to be tested is placed on the top sieve, and the stack is shaken or tapped to sift the material through the sieves. (The devices most commonly used to tap or shake the sieves during testing are the Rotap&#x2122; and the CAMI&#x2122; sifter.) Particles too large to pass through a sieve are retained on top of it. After a given time, the stack is disassembled, and the material retained on each sieve is removed and weighed. If the top sieve on the stack has an opening of 200 microns, and all the material has passed through it, it may be determined that the material contains no particles larger than 200 microns. If the next sieve has an opening of 170 microns, and 10% of the material is retained on it, it may be determined that 10% of the material is from 170 to 200 microns in size. Thus, with the appropriate sieves, we can obtain a complete measurement of the distribution of particle sizes within it. Standard sizes have been developed both for the sieves and for the abrasives they measure. For the test sieves, these are given in the various standards mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Microgrits (also called sedimentation sizes) are defined as sizes corresponding to 240 or 280 (approximately 60 microns in size) and finer. For many years, the standard method of measuring these sizes was through sedimentation using Stokes' Law. In lay terms, Stokes Law says that the bigger the particle, the faster it settles in a liquid. If you know the apparent specific gravity of the material, and the density and viscosity of the liquid, and the distance it settles, and the time it takes to settle, you can calculate how big the particle is. This is applied in practice through the use of a long column filled with alcohol (called the settling medium) at a known temperature, sitting inside a larger tube filled with water to maintain the alcohol at the correct temperature. At the bottom of the tube is a smaller graduated collecting tube. This apparatus is called a sedimentometer, or sedimentation tube. The material to be tested is pre-wet, then placed in the settling medium at the top of the tube, and the time recorded. When the first material reaches the collecting tube, the time is recorded. As the material reaches the various graduations in the settling tube, these times are recorded, until all the material has settled. Based on the total height of material in the tube, say 25 mm, it may be determined that the time required for the material to reach 12 mm represents 48% of the cumulative volume percentage. If it reached this height in 8 minutes, that means 48% of the material is 28.2 microns and coarser in size. If the 2mm height was reached in 4 minutes, that means 8% of the material is 39.8 microns and coarser. (These figures are taken from material in ANSI Standard B74.10, for aluminum oxide. Times for materials with a different density, such as silicon carbide, are different.)</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Microgrits: Electrical Resistance Method&#x2014;Beginning in the 1970's, some abrasives companies began using electrical resistance to measure microgrits. The principle of electrical resistance measurement is that a particle will cause a change in the strength of a current proportional to the volume of the particle. The standard apparatus used for electrical resistance measurement is the Coulter Counter, which has gone through a variety of model numbers over the years.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">National and International Size Standards</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">Macrogrits: Despite these problems, standards have been issued for full ranges of macrogrit and microgrit sizes by ANSI, FEPA, and JIS. (ANSI is of course the American National Standards Institute; FEPA is the European Federation of Abrasives Producers; and JIS is the Japanese Standardization Organization.) For macrogrits, these standards are all but identical, and differ only in a few of the sizes covered and the range of applications covered. ANSI standard B74.12-2001 gives two separate specifications, one for abrasives to be used for grinding wheel and general industrial applications, one for abrasives to be used for blasting. For the sizes covered, the only difference is material used for blasting need not be as tightly sized. Comparing ANSI B74.12-2001 with FEPA 43GB-1984R1991 and JIS R6001-1987, the size requirements for sizes defined are identical. FEPA includes two sizes, F22 and F40, not covered by ANSI or JIS. JIS does not cover the four coarsest sizes, 4, 5, 6 and 7, covered by ANSI and FEPA.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">ANSI B74.18-1996, currently under revision, covers coated abrasives. These sizing requirements are quite different from those for bonded and loose abrasives. (For brevity, the differing standards will be referred to as &#x201c;bonded&#x201d; and &#x201c;coated.&#x201d;) In general, it is entirely possible that any particular abrasive that meets the requirements for a coated size will meet the requirements for the same bonded size (that is, an ANSI bonded 180 may also be acceptable as an ANSI coated 180), and vice-versa. It is also entirely possible that a FEPA F120 (bonded) will not meet the requirements of a FEPA P120 (coated), and vice-versa. This is because the standards specify different sieve sizes to be used for testing, allow or require different percentages of retained material on the various sieves, and in general state the requirements in a manner which frustrates direct comparison of the sizes.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Without entering into a detailed comparison of the standards, which the interested user is encouraged to do, one example will hopefully suffice. For FEPA P80 (coated), FEPA GB43-1991 requires all of the material to pass through a 355 micron sieve, and a maximum of 3% be retained on a 255 micron sieve. For FEPA F80 (bonded), FEPA 42GB-1984R1993 requires all the material to pass through a 300 micron sieve. There is no requirement with regard to a 255 micron sieve, and up to 25% of the material may be retained on a 212 micron sieve. Clearly, a single abrasive with no particles over 255 microns would meet both these standards. But an abrasive with no particles over 355 microns, 1% from 300 to 355 microns, and 2% from 255 to 300 microns would meet the coated standard and fail the bonded one. An abrasive with no particles over 300 microns but 4% from 255 to 300 microns would meet the bonded standard and fail the coated one.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">With regard to ANSI B74.18-1996, direct comparison is even more difficult, since the standard in general does not specify what percentages may or must be retained. Instead, the sieves themselves are first calibrated with a standard sand (see Appendix 3). The requirements for the material to be tested are then expressed in terms of the performance of the sieve with regards to the standard sand. Thus, for a coated ANSI 120, the maximum percentage allowed to be retained on a 133 micron sieve is 1.2 times the percentage of standard sand retained on that same sieve. The 133 micron sieve must have retained from 9.9 to 17.9 percent of the 120 standard sand. That same sieve is then used as a fines control sieve for coated 100 grade. The percentage of material which passes through that sieve must be within +10%/&#x2212;7% of the percentage of the 100 grade standard sand which passed through it.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In comparing coated with bonded macrogrits, the most that can be said is that the sizes are approximately the same, but the specified requirements differ sufficiently to require individual appraisal of batches of material.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">Thus, for ANSI grade 80 (FEPA F80, JIS 80), a total of 65% of the sample must be retained on sieves with openings of 150 and 180 microns. At least 75% of the size must pass through a sieve with an opening of 212 microns. The range shown for size 80 is thus 150 to 212 microns: at least 65% of the sample, including the median size, will fall within this range.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">MICROGRITS: Comparison of standards for microgrits is not as straightforward. ANSI standards for coated and bonded grains differ substantially, as do the FEPA standards for coated (called &#x201c;FEPA P&#x201d;) and bonded (called &#x201c;FEPA F&#x201d;) grains. The JIS standard is also quite different. For the most part, the standards specify a) a minimum value which 94% of the abrasive must be coarser than, b) a maximum value that 97% of the abrasive must be finer than, and c) the range in which the midpoint must fall.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Superabrasives</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">As noted above, some manufactured abrasives, commonly diamond and cubic boron nitride (CBN), are characterized as superabrasives due largely to their extreme hardness. These are used in a variety of demanding high-tech applications. Standard sizes of these materials and approved testing methods are defined in ANSI B74.20-2004, currently under pre-publication formatting as of this writing. In general, standard sizes for these materials are defined as a size range (e.g., 1-2 microns, 6-12 microns). The standard specifies that materials in these sizes must include at least 90% of the particle size distribution within the size ranges specified (maximum of 5% each above and below the range). For example, for a 1-2 micron size, at least 95% of the sample must be above 1 micron in size, and no more than 5% of the sample may be over 2 microns in size. The sample's average size must be near the center of the desired distribution (1.28-1.72 microns for a 1-2 micron material). Additionally, the coarsest particle detected must be below a maximum limit (e.g., 6 microns for size 1-2, 20 microns for size 6-12). ANSI B74.20 also describes a variety of methods that are commonly used to characterize the particle size, including a number discussed above (such as electrical resistance, direct microscopy, laser diffraction, and photosedimentation) and a few methods unique to characterizing extremely fine particles (such as photon correlation spectroscopy).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0000">Abrasive Media Classification with the Present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">For example, the present disclosure may provide an apparatus for separating reusable abrasive media from non-reusable media further comprising a housing which may be configured to be composed of plastic thermoformed housing cast out of metal or fabricated out of structural shapes, a plate, or even metal stamped with slight modifications to the one or more housing designs.
