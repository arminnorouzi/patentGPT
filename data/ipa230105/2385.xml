The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP serve as secondary messengers in various cellular pathways.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">cAMP functions as a second messenger regulating many intracellular processes within the body. One example is in the neurons of the central nervous system, where the activation of cAMP-dependent kinases and the subsequent phosphorylation of proteins are involved in acute regulation of synaptic transmission as well as neuronal differentiation and survival. The complexity of cyclic nucleotide signaling is indicated by the molecular diversity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of cAMP. There are at least ten families of adenylyl cyclases, and eleven families of phosphodiesterases. Furthermore, different types of neurons are known to express multiple isozymes of each of these classes, and there is good evidence for compartmentalization and specificity of function for different isozymes within a given neuron.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">A principal mechanism for regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling is via phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cyclic nucleotide catabolism. The eleven known families of PDEs are encoded by 21 different genes; each gene typically yields multiple splice variants that further contribute to the isozyme diversity. The PDE families are distinguished functionally based on cyclic nucleotide substrate specificity, mechanism(s) of regulation, and sensitivity to inhibitors. Furthermore, PDEs are differentially expressed throughout the organism, including in the central nervous system. As a result of these distinct enzymatic activities and localization, different PDEs' isozymes can serve distinct physiological functions. Furthermore, compounds that can selectively inhibit distinct PDE isozymes may offer particular therapeutic effects, fewer side effects, or both (Deninno, M., Future Directions in Phosphodiesterase Drug Discovery. <i>Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters </i>2012, 22, 6794-6800).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The present invention relates to compounds having a binding affinity for the fourth family of PDEs (i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), and, in particular, a binding affinity for the PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4C isoforms.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The PDE4 isozymes carry out selective, high-affinity hydrolytic degradation of the second messenger adenosine 3&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP mediated beneficial pharmacological effects resulting from that inhibition have been shown in a variety of disease models. A number of other PDE4 inhibitors have been discovered in recent years. For example, Roflumilast (Daliresp&#xae;), marketed by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is approved for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to decrease the number of flare-ups or prevent exacerbations of COPD symptoms. Apremilast (Otezla&#xae;) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">While beneficial pharmacological activity of PDE4 inhibitors has been shown, a common side effect of these treatments has been the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, which are hypothesized to be associated with inhibition of the PDE4D isoform. Attempts have been made to develop compounds with an affinity for the PDE4B isoform over the PDE4D isoform (See: Donnell, A. F. et al., Identification of pyridazino[4,5-b]indolizines as selective PDE4B inhibitors. <i>Bioorganic </i>&#x26; <i>Medicinal Chemistry Letters </i>2010, 20, 2163-7; and Naganuma, K. et al., Discovery of selective PDE4B inhibitors. <i>Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters </i>2009, 19, 3174-6). However, there remains a need to develop selective PDE4 inhibitors, especially those having an affinity for the PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C isoforms. In particular, compounds with enhanced binding affinity for the PDE4A, and PDE4B isoforms over the PDE4D isoform are anticipated to be useful in the treatment of various diseases and disorders of the central nervous system (CNS).

Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, isotopes of hydrogen, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H; carbon, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>14</sup>C; chlorine, such as <sup>36</sup>Cl; fluorine, such as <sup>18</sup>F; iodine, such as <sup>123</sup>I and <sup>125</sup>I; nitrogen, such as <sup>13</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N; oxygen, such as <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, and <sup>18</sup>O; phosphorus, such as <sup>32</sup>P; and sulfur, such as <sup>35</sup>S. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies (e.g., assays). The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>F, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>15</sup>O and <sup>13</sup>N, can be useful in positron emission tomography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g., D<sub>2</sub>O, acetone-d<sub>6</sub>, or DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>. Compounds of the invention which includes compounds exemplified in Examples 1-97 described below, include isotopically-labeled versions of these compounds, such as, but not limited to, the deuterated and tritiated isotopes and all other isotopes discussed above.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to novel, selective, radiolabelled PDE4 ligands which are useful for imaging and quantifying the PDE4B receptor in tissues (e.g., brain), using positron-emission tomography (PET).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to 4-(8-Cyclopropyl-9-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido[2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;:4,5]pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-10-yl)-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluorobenzonitrile, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and its use for imaging a tissue, cells or host, in vitro or in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Compounds</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0094">The compounds of Formula I, as described above, have a pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazinone core fused to a ring moiety represented by A.

Commercial solvents and reagents were generally used without further purification. Anhydrous solvents were employed where appropriate, generally AcroSeal&#xae; products from Acros Organics or DriSolv&#xae; products from EMD Chemicals. In other cases, commercial solvents were passed through columns packed with 4 &#x212b; molecular sieves, until the following QC standards for water were attained: a) &#x3c;100 ppm for dichloromethane, toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran; b)&#x3c;180 ppm for methanol, ethanol, 1,4-dioxane and diisopropylamine. For very sensitive reactions, solvents were further treated with metallic sodium, calcium hydride or molecular sieves, and distilled just prior to use. Products were generally dried under vacuum before being carried on to further reactions or submitted for biological testing. Mass spectrometry data is reported from either liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) instrumentation. Chemical shifts for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data are expressed in parts per million (ppm, 6) referenced to residual peaks from the deuterated solvents employed. In some examples, chiral separations were carried out to separate enantiomers or atropisomers (or atropenantiomers) of certain compounds of the invention (in some examples, the separated atropisomers are designated as ENT-1 and ENT-2, according to their order of elution). In some examples, the optical rotation of an enantiomer or atropisomer was measured using a polarimeter. According to its observed rotation data (or its specific rotation data), an enantiomer or atropisomer (or atropenantiomer) with a clockwise rotation was designated as the (+)-enantiomer or (+)-atropisomer [or the (+) atropenantiomer] and an enantiomer or atropisomer (or atropenantiomer) with a counter-clockwise rotation was designated as the (&#x2212;)-enantiomer or (&#x2212;)-atropisomer [or the (&#x2212;) atropenantiomer].</p><p id="p-0405" num="0387">Reactions proceeding through detectable intermediates were generally followed by LCMS, and allowed to proceed to full conversion prior to addition of subsequent reagents.
