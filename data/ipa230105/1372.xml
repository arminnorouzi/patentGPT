Process for preparing said microcapsules is also an object of the invention. Perfuming compositions and consumer products comprising said capsules, in particular perfumed consumer products in the form of home care or personal care products, are also part of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One of the problems faced by the perfumery industry lies in the relatively rapid loss of olfactive benefit provided by odoriferous compounds due to their volatility, particularly that of &#x201c;top-notes&#x201d;. In order to tailor the release rates of volatiles, delivery systems such as microcapsules containing a perfume, are needed to protect and later release the core payload when triggered. A key requirement from the industry regarding these systems is to survive suspension in challenging bases without physically dissociating or degrading. For instance, fragranced personal and household cleansers containing high levels of aggressive surfactant detergents are very challenging for the stability of microcapsules.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aminoplast microcapsules formed of a melamine-formaldehyde resin have been largely used to encapsulate hydrophobic actives, thus protecting said actives and providing their controlled release. However, capsules such as aminoplast ones suffer from stability problems when used in consumer products comprising surfactants, such as perfumery consumer products, especially after prolonged storage at elevated temperatures. In such products, even though the capsule wall remains intact, the encapsulated active tends to leak out of the capsule by diffusion through the wall due to the presence of surfactants that are able to solubilise the encapsulated active in the product base. The leakage phenomenon reduces the efficiency of the capsules to protect the active and provide its controlled release.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of strategies have been described to improve the stability of oil core-based microcapsules. Cross-linking of capsule walls, with chemical groups such as poly(amines) and poly(isocyanates), has been described as a way to improve stability of microcapsules. WO2011/154893 discloses for instance a process for the preparation of polyurea microcapsules using a combination of aromatic and aliphatic polyisocyanates in specific relative concentrations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stabilization of oil/water interfaces with inorganic particles has been described in so-called Pickering emulsions. In this context, functionalization of inorganic particles to allow their cross-linking is known. For instance, Pickering emulsions cross-linked from an outer water phase with polyelectrolytes providing electrostatic interactions have been the object of prior disclosures (Li Jian et al. in Langmuir (2010), 26(19), 15554-15560). However, such systems are very likely to dissociate in a surfactant base or in ethanol over time as electrostatic interactions are insufficient to promote stability. Covalent cross-linking has also been described in relation with Pickering emulsion in the preparation of colloidosomes. In particular, the use of diisocyanates as cross-linker has been disclosed in scientific publications. WO2009/063257 also describes the use of polyisocyanates as possible cross-linker for surface-modified inorganic particles in order to prepare microcapsules with increased level of protection from UV light for the contents. These products are typically intended for agrochemical applications. This type of system is not suitable for perfume encapsulation. In fact, in order to maintain a good morphology and permeability of the microcapsules, an excess of surface-modified inorganic particles is needed. Another problem is that these microcapsules show little margin for size adjustment. Furthermore, the amount of adsorbed particles at the oil-water interface is limited which affects the properties of the capsule membranes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is still a need to provide new microcapsules while not compromising on their performance, in particular in terms of stability in a consumer product, as well as in delivering a good performance in terms of hydrophobic material delivery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention is therefore a core-shell microcapsule comprising:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a) an oil-based core comprising a hydrophobic material, preferably a perfume oil; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">b) a polymeric shell comprising chitosan particles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">In a second aspect of the invention is a core-shell microcapsule slurry comprising at least a microcapsule made of:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">a) an oil-based core comprising a hydrophobic material, preferably a perfume oil; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">b) a polymeric shell comprising chitosan particles.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">A third aspect of the invention is a process for preparing core-shell microcapsules or core-shell microcapsule slurry as defined above, wherein the process comprises the steps of:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">1) suspending in water chitosan particles to form a water phase;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">2) preparing an oil phase comprising a hydrophobic material, preferably a perfume oil;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">3) adding the oil phase to the water phase and mixing them to form an oil-in-water Pickering emulsion, under conditions allowing the formation of core-shell microcapsule by interfacial polymerization and/or interfacial reaction,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">wherein a polyfunctional monomer is added in step 1) in the water phase and/or in step 2) in the oil phase.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">In a fourth aspect, the invention concerns a microcapsule obtainable by such a process as well as perfuming compositions and consumer products containing them.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">In a last aspect, the invention relates to the use of chitosan based particles, for the stabilization of a Pickering emulsion further subjected to an interfacial polymerisation reaction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: is a schematic representation of the formation of a Pickering emulsion when chitosan particles are used to stabilize the oil phase.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0019">Unless stated otherwise, percentages (%) are meant to designate percent by weight of a composition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">By &#x201c;active ingredient&#x201d;, it is meant a single compound or a combination of ingredients.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">By &#x201c;perfume or flavor oil&#x201d;, it is meant a single perfuming or flavoring compound or a mixture of several perfuming or flavoring compounds.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">By &#x201c;consumer product&#x201d; or &#x201c;end-product&#x201d; it is meant a manufactured product ready to be distributed, sold and used by a consumer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">A &#x201c;microcapsule&#x201d;, or the similar, in the present invention has a morphology that can vary from a core-shell to a matrix type. According to one embodiment, it is of the core-shell type. In this case, the microcapsules comprise a core based on a hydrophobic material, typically a perfume, and a shell comprising chitosan particles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">Microcapsules have a particle size distribution in the micron range (e.g. a mean diameter) comprised between about 1 and 3000 microns, preferably comprised between 1 and 1000 microns, more preferably between 1 and 500 microns, and even more preferably between 5 and 50 microns. The polymeric shell of the microcapsule according to the present invention is formed by interfacial polymerization and/or interfacial reaction in the presence of chitosan particles.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">By &#x201c;particle size&#x201d; it is meant an average diameter of particles based on size distribution measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using Zetasizer Nano ZS equipment from Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK when particles are dispersed into a water phase.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">By &#x201c;microcapsules size&#x201d; it is meant the volume mean diameter (D[4,3]) of the relevant capsules, capsules suspension as obtained by laser light scattering of a diluted sample in a Malvern Mastersizer 3000.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">By &#x201c;polyfunctional monomer&#x201d;, it is meant a molecule that, as unit, reacts or binds chemically to form a polymer or a supramolecular polymer. The polyfunctional monomer is oil soluble or water soluble. The polyfunctional monomer of the invention has at least two functional groups that are capable to react with or bind to functional groups of another component (for example chitosan particles) and/or are capable to polymerize to form a polymeric shell. The wording &#x201c;shell&#x201d; and &#x201c;wall&#x201d; are used indifferently in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">By &#x201c;polyurea-based&#x201d; wall or shell, it is meant that the polymeric shell comprises urea linkages produced by either an amino-functional crosslinker or hydrolysis of isocyanate groups to produce amino groups capable of further reacting with isocyanate groups during interfacial polymerization.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">It has now surprisingly been found that performing core-shell microcapsules encapsulating hydrophobic material could be obtained when chitosan particles are comprised within the shell. The microcapsules of the invention therefore provides a solution to the above-mentioned problems as it improves the storage stability in challenging bases even with a low concentration of polymeric material in the shell and it improves the performance in application owing to the cationic surface charges of microcapsules from the chitosan particles.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Core-Shell Microcapsule</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0030">A first object of the invention is a core-shell microcapsule comprising:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">a) an oil-based core comprising a hydrophobic material, preferably a perfume oil; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">b) a polymeric shell comprising chitosan particles.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Hydrophobic Material</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The hydrophobic material according to the invention can be &#x201c;inert&#x201d; material like solvents or active ingredients.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">When hydrophobic materials are active ingredients, they are preferably chosen from the group consisting of flavors, flavor ingredients, perfumes, perfume ingredients, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, pest control agents, biocide actives and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material comprises a mixture of a perfume with another ingredient selected from the group consisting of nutraceuticals, cosmetics, pest control agents and biocide actives.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material comprises a mixture of biocide actives with another ingredient selected from the group consisting of perfumes, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, pest control agents.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material comprises a mixture of pest control agents with another ingredient selected from the group consisting of perfumes, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, biocide actives.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material comprises a perfume.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material consists of a perfume.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material consists of biocide actives.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">According to a particular embodiment, the hydrophobic material consists of pest control agents.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">By &#x201c;perfume&#x201d; (or also &#x201c;perfume oil&#x201d;) what is meant here is an ingredient or a composition that is a liquid at about 20&#xb0; C.

As a &#x201c;perfuming ingredient&#x201d; it is meant here a compound, which is used for the primary purpose of conferring or modulating an odor. In other words such an ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as being able to at least impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition, and not just as having an odor. For the purpose of the present invention, perfume oil also includes a combination of perfuming ingredients with substances which together improve, enhance or modify the delivery of the perfuming ingredients, such as perfume precursors, emulsions or dispersions, as well as combinations which impart an additional benefit beyond that of modifying or imparting an odor, such as long-lastingness, blooming, malodor counteraction, antimicrobial effect, microbial stability, pest control.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">The nature and type of the perfuming ingredients present in the oil phase do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect.
