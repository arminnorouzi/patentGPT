id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An adaptive control method for controlling EP pulse parameters during electroporation (EP) of cells or tissue using an EP system includes providing a system for adaptive control to optimize EP pulse parameters including EP pulse parameters, applying voltage and current excitation signals to the cells, obtaining data from the current and voltage measurements, and processing the data to separate the desirable data from the undesirable data, extracting relevant features from the desirable data, applying at least a portion of the relevant features to a trained diagnostic model, estimating EP pulsing parameters based on an outcome of the applied relevant features, where the initialized EP pulsing parameters are based on the trained model and the relevant features, to optimize the EP pulsing parameters, and applying, by the generator, a first EP pulse based on the first pulsing parameters.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

This discovery made possible the insertion of large molecules into cell cytoplasm. It is known that therapeutic moieties such as pharmacological compounds can be incorporated into live cells through a process known as electroporation. The genes or other molecules are injected into the live cells in and short pulses of high electric fields are applied. The cell membranes are transiently made porous and the genes or molecules enter the cells, where they can modify the genome of the cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the treatment of certain types of cancer with chemotherapy, it is necessary to use a high enough dose of a drug to kill the cancer cells without killing an unacceptable high number of normal cells. If the chemotherapy drug could be inserted directly inside the cancer cells, this objective could be achieved. Some of the anti-cancer drugs, for example, bleomycin, normally cannot penetrate the membranes of certain cancer cells effectively. However, electroporation makes it possible to insert bleomycin into cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Treatment typically is carried out by injecting an anticancer drug directly into the tumor and applying an electric field to the tumor between a pair of electrodes. The field strength must be adjusted reasonably accurately so that electroporation of the cells of the tumor occurs without damage, or at least minimal damage, to any normal or healthy cells. This can normally be easily carried out with external tumors by applying the electrodes to opposite sides of the tumor so that the electric field is between the electrodes. When the field is uniform, the distance between the electrodes can then be measured and a suitable voltage according to the formula E=V/d can then be applied to the electrodes (E=electric field strength in V/cm; V=voltage in volts; and d=distance in cm). When large or internal tumors are to be treated, it is not easy to properly locate electrodes and measure the distance between them.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Treatment of a subject using cell poration therapy provides a means for avoiding the deleterious effects typically associated with administration of anticancer or cytotoxic agents. Such treatment would allow introduction of these agents to selectively damage or kill undesirable cells while avoiding surrounding healthy cells or tissue. One issue, however, with using electroporation techniques is that diseased tissue, particularly cancerous tissue, can be quite heterogeneous, requiring adjustment of electroporation conditions. Thus, the present invention provides the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis methods in combination with adaptive control methods for EP to maximize the electroporation of the desired tissues while minimizing tissue damage.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for implementing a control system using tissue-sensing based feedback to optimize the EP process with tumor-specific measurements acquired before and between each EP pulse.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with some embodiments, a system for providing adaptive control to optimize electroporation (EP) pulse parameters during EP of cells and tissue using an EP device comprises a measurement device, an initializing module, a generator, a controller, and a memory module.

High voltage isolation will allow the hardware to be used with the high voltage power supply while plugged into the PC. A low voltage power supply may be used to power all auxiliary circuitry, e.g. EMEs for capacitance and impedance measurements, analog-to-digital converter, digital-to-analog converters, relays, DSP, optical switches, etc.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref> depict three different configurations of EPEs and EMEs. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, a single set of electrodes are used, that are connected via a switching mechanism to the respective EPE and EME power sources. The switching mechanism switches on and off when a small excitation voltage is applied across its control terminals. These switches use coupling mechanisms which include electromagnetic, electromechanical, piezoelectric and photoelectric mechanisms.

In this embodiment, the tissue in the zone can be interrogated in different ways. For example, the tissue right against the EPEs can suffer damage (e.g. the tissue is in a &#x201c;kill zone&#x201d;). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, measuring impedance (including capacitance) between EME #1 and EME #2 can help determine the tissue damage at EPE #1, for example, or alternatively could be used in a sort of &#x201c;electronic tumor tomography&#x201d;, as is more fully described in relation to EM, below.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>C and <b>7</b>D</figref> depict different EPE configurations, although only a single pair of electrodes are depicted for simplicity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> depicts one set of non-penetrating solid EPEs, applied topically to the surface of the skin. Additional sets of EPEs are not shown, but are included. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> depicts one set of solid EPEs that are penetrating into the tissue; in this embodiment, the tip of the EPEs is generally pointed to facilitate insertion into the tissue, such as a solid needle tip.

This results in a three dimensional electric field along the length and radial dimensions between the electrodes. In general, these penetrating EPEs can be from about 1 to about 20 mm, depending on the geometry and physiology of the tissue to be treated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the penetrating solid EPEs are coated with an insulating (non-conductive) material, such that only a distal portion of the electrode is exposed.

OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The present invention is generally directed to devices, systems and methods useful in the controlling of electroporation (EP) pulsing parameters for improvement and ideally optimization of EP of cells and tissues of a patient. As further described herein, there are a variety of uses for the invetnion, including, but not limited to, for example, the ability to insert therapeutic moieties (including small molecule drugs, plasmids encoding therapeutic proteins, etc.) into cells. The invention finds particular use in oncology applications. The invention allows suitable EP conditions and/or an EP protocol to be determined in real time, using electrical measurements (EM), including but not limited to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The present invention aims to improve EP processes by integrating feedback control mechanisms. Thus, the systems and methods of the invention can be used with any EP devices/applicators and any methods such as those outlined in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 62/214,807, 62/214,872, 62/141,142, 62/141,182, 62/141,256, and 62/141,164, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety, specifically including the Figures, Legends and descriptions of the Figures and components therein.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">EP parameters currently used in clinical trials are empirically established in preclinical mouse studies using homogeneous syngeneic tumor models. Commonly, electrical parameters are selected that give the highest rise in mean expression of the electroporated nucleic acid over injection alone. Previous studies in the field have analyzed the effects of pDNA concentration, electric field (e-field) strength, pulse width, tissue type, electrical conditions, injection volume, molecule of interest, concentration, and applicator geometry on expression. It has been determined that each of the aforementioned parameters significantly impacted the resulting expression.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">To maximize the efficacy of EP, a quantifiable metric of membrane integrity that is measureable in real-time is desirable. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a method for the characterization of physiologic and chemical systems and can be performed with standard EP electrodes. This technique measures the electrical response of a system over a range of frequencies to reveal energy storage and dissipation properties. In biologic systems the extracellular and intracellular matrix resist current flow and therefore can be electrically represented as resistors. The lipids of intact cell membranes and organelles store energy and are represented as capacitors. Electrical impedance is the sum of these resistive and capacitive elements over a range of frequencies. To quantify each of these parameters, tissue impedance data can be fit to an equivalent circuit model. Real-time monitoring of electrical properties of tissues will enable feedback control over EP parameters and lead to optimum transfection in heterogeneous tumors. Using EIS feedback, will allow (1) delivery parameters to be adjusted in real-time, (2) delivery of only the pulses necessary to generate a therapeutic response, and (3) reduce the overall EP-mediated tissue damage as a result.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing closed-loop EP control systems using tissue-sensing based feedback to optimize the EP process with tumor-specific measurements acquired before and between each EP pulse. Tissue sensing is used to measure the membrane charge time for a specific tumor to tailor each EP pulse for optimal treatment.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">As will be appreciated by those in the art, successful EP occurs when the cellular membrane is disrupted, resulting in a change of capacitance. Thus, by monitoring and measuring electrical properties, e.g. impedance (including capacitance) before, during and/or after the EP pulses, relevant empirical data can be collected and used to create models during initial training phases.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to an adaptive control method and systems for improving or optimizing controlled EP pulse parameters during EP of cells and tissues using the aforementioned closed-loop EP control systems and devices.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">In some embodiments, the control systems may include a measurement device, an initializing module, a signal generator, a controller and a memory module. The control methods described herein are implemented in the control systems.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In one aspect, the measurement device measures tissue/cell conditions such as dielectric and conductive properties of cells and tissues. The measurement device may include one or more different measuring devices to facilitate measuring the tissue/cell conditions. For example, the measuring device may include a voltage sensor/device and/or a current sensor/device. The voltage sensor may be configured to measure voltages across cells or tissues when an excitation signal and/or EP pulses are applied to the cells or tissues. The current sensor measures current across the cells or tissues when an excitation signal and/or EP pulses are applied to the cells or tissues. The results of the measurements (e.g. measured data) may be sent to the controller for further processing.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The initializing module may be configured to initialize EP pulsing parameters for performing EP on the cells and tissues. The EP pulsing parameters may be predetermined EP pulsing parameters empirically established based on previous experiments/clinical trials. Alternatively, the predetermination of the EP pulsing parameters may be based at least in part on one or more trained models. A signal generator may generate the excitation signal and/or electroporation pulses that are applied to the cells and tissues. The measurement device measures the tissue/cell conditions such as dielectric and conductive properties of cells and tissues in response to the application of the excitation signal and/or electroporation pulses.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">As noted, the controller receives the measured data, which corresponds to results of the measurements of the tissue/cell conditions. The controller then processes the measured data to facilitate diagnosis/identification of characteristics of the tissues and cells and/or determine updated control parameters for the system. For example, the hetero- or homogeneity of the tissue can be evaluated. The controller may include (in any combination) a pre-processing module, a feature extraction module, a diagnostic module and a pulse parameter estimation module.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">The pre-processing module obtains measured data from the measurement device and pre-processes the measured data to separate desirable data from undesirable data. For example, the undesirable data may include noise, direct current bias. The pre-processing may include scaling the measured data based on standardized values such as standard deviation, performing digital filtering of the measured data and validating the measured data.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">The feature extraction module extracts information such as relevant features from the desirable data. The relevant features may be quantitative information. For example, the quantitative information may be extracted using computational routines described herein. The relevant features of the desirable data are sent to the diagnostic module for further processing. For example, the diagnostic module applies at least a portion of the relevant features of the desirable to one or more trained diagnostic models to determine whether the next step is to select next applied EP pulsing parameters or to stop the control process if a diagnostic issue is detected, e.g., electrodes not placed in tissue. The pulse parameter estimation module is configured to select or generate the next applied EP pulsing parameters based on an outcome of the diagnostic module and the feature extraction module.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a &#x201c;one-step ahead feedforward control&#x201d;. By &#x201c;one step ahead feedforward control&#x201d; it is meant that before a first EP pulse is applied, the parameter estimation routine initializes the initial control parameters for the first pulse based on the model trained in the initial training phase using the empirical data from the previously conducted experiments. These previously conducted experiments may be based for example on tissue samples with tumors having similar characteristics to those of the current tissue to be subjected to the control method of the present invention. For example, types, sizes or locations of melanoma tumors can be used to build a dataset to serve as the basis for the initial model. Initial excitation signals including voltage and current signals are applied through a signal generator (e.g. the proprietary signal generator described herein). The measurement device measures the response of the tissue to the excitation signals. The controller derives &#x201c;features&#x201d; based on the measurements and uses the trained model to compare the extracted features to old features derived from the empirical data obtained in the previously conducted experiments. The old and derived &#x201c;features&#x201d; are obtained from tissue sensing measurements, e.g. EIS. The models may be trained based on a tissue or tumor type identified by the diagnostic module in a diagnostic phase, and then used to select optimal parameters/conditions for the first EP pulse. These first pulse parameters are thus &#x201c;fed forward&#x201d; to be applied as the first pulse for the control routine as opposed to the conventional EP systems and methods in which parameters/conditions of the first pulse are based on fixed or static conditions. In this sense, the methods of the present invention utilize feedforward control to provide optimal EP parameters based on a sensed tissue type, in conjunction with feedback control to sense cell conditions, e.g., degree of permeabilization and adjust the pulse parameters accordingly.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Variations in tumor characteristics, e.g., tumor location, size, and degree of vascularization, fibrosis, and necrosis which normally affect treatment outcome result in poor predictability of effective EP conditions for gene delivery and, consequently, variable therapeutic outcomes. Conventional EP systems apply an open-loop control system using static parameters that rely on a priori knowledge determined by preclinical studies in homogeneous syngeneic tumor models. However, preliminary data has shown that even in homogeneous tumors, the time required to apply an electrostatic field across a cell membrane follows a log-normal distribution. Applying static parameters to different tumors, even in a homogenous model, results in a wide range of applied electrostatic fields across cell membranes and leads to treatment variability. The present invention overcomes the aforementioned deficiencies of the prior art by implementing control methods employing closed-loop control systems using tissue-sensing based feedback to optimize the EP process with tumor-specific measurements acquired before and between each EP pulse. Thus, by using EIS feedback control combined with the &#x201c;one-step ahead feedforward control,&#x201d; the present invention is able to more effectively predict effective parameters for EP taking into account the variations in tumor characteristics that normally affect the treatments.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II. ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY (EIS)</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0203">The systems and methods of the invention may include Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy EIS (or tissue sensing) measurements which may be conducted using an EP device. In some embodiments, the EP device may include electroporation electrodes (EPEs) for applying EP pulses and electrical measurement electrodes (EMEs) for applying low voltage interrogation signals to the cells. In some embodiments, the electrodes of the EP device function as both EMEs and EPEs and solid state relays may be used to switch between high voltage EP pulse circuitry and low voltage EIS interrogation circuitry, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is simple schematic depicting some of the components of an EP device used to apply electric pulses for EIS according to the present invention. Although an electrode array of 4 electrodes is shown, this is not limiting, with arrays of pairs of electrodes including 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 or more electrodes all finding use in the invention. Furthermore, although the electrodes are shown as having a straight shape, this is not limiting as the electrodes may have curved or spiral shapes, as shall be described below with respect to various EP devices that may be used in the systems and methods of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts the situation where the electrodes of the array function either as EP electrodes when connected to the EP circuitry or serve as electrical measurement (EM) electrodes when connected to the tissue sensing/EIS circuitry. As discussed herein, when the electrodes of the EP device function as both EMEs and EPEs, the electrodes switch between EPE and EME modes through relay switch. That is, solid state relays are used to switch between the high voltage EP pulse circuitry and the low voltage EIS interrogation circuitry, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. That is, the proprietary generator of the present invention is capable of supplying both high voltage pulses and low voltage interrogation signals to the EP device as necessary. In other embodiments where the EP device is provided with separate EPEs and EMEs, the EP device may be connected to two power sources via a switching mechanism that switches on and off when a small excitation voltage is applied across its control terminals. These switches use coupling mechanisms which include electromagnetic, electromechanical, piezoelectric and photoelectric mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Due to general knowledge about electroporation conditions, capacitance and resistance measurements acquired prior to applying EP pulses enables a priori knowledge of the conditions that will cause destabilization of capacitive elements such as cell membranes. Measuring capacitance between pulses allows the electrical conditions, including pulse width (which can be calculated from associated time constants) to be adjusted based on the time constants associated with membrane capacitance and resistance. In addition, this information allows the process to be stopped when an ideal drop in time constant is reached, e.g. when membrane integrity has been compromised, thus allowing the introduction of therapeutic moieties.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments, the EP device uses different sets of EPEs and EMEs, as is generally depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some cases, as is more fully outlined below, when different sets of sets of EPEs and EMEs are used, the EMEs and the EPEs can be offset, allowing for impedance measurements in different areas of the electric field zone, as generally discussed below and in the legend for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In these embodiments, an additional low voltage EME power supply is used, in addition to the higher voltage EPE power supply, along with the appropriate circuitry and connectors.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In other preferred embodiments, as described above, and as shall be used to illustrate the systems and method of the present invention, the EP device uses a single set of electrodes for both EP and EIS measurements. EIS measurements can be performed using EPEs without negatively impacting tissue characteristics. Using the same electrodes to perform low power EIS measurements and high power EP pulses is ideal, as this reduces the number of required electrodes and directly measures tissue responses. EIS is a low power technique capable of real-time monitoring of tissues. This technique is performed by applying a series of low voltage excitation signals across a pair of electrodes and measuring a response current over a range of frequencies. The magnitude and phase of each applied excitation is then computed and fit to an equivalent circuit model of the tissue as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, hereinafter termed &#x201c;CPE-based Tissue Model.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">Impedance measurements may be obtained using the equation below:</p><p id="p-0209" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>Z</mi>   <mo>&#x2061;</mo>   <mo>(</mo>   <mi>f</mi>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mn>1</mn>     <msup>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>Q</mi>        <mn>0</mn>       </msub>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mn>2</mn>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>&#x3c0;</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>f</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>     </msup>    </mfrac>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msup>     <mi>e</mi>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mi>j</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</mi>       <mo>/</mo>       <mn>2</mn>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </msup>   </mrow>   <mo>+</mo>   <msub>    <mi>R</mi>    <mi>s</mi>   </msub>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0210" num="0208">In the above equation, Z(f) is Z(f) is tissue impedance in Ohms; f is frequency in Hertz; j is a constant representing &#x221a;{square root over (&#x2212;1)}; Q<sub>0 </sub>is admittance (at f=1 Hz) in Siemens; R<sub>s </sub>is resistance in Ohms; and &#x3b1; is the constant phase element (CPE) in no units.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0209">As illustrated in the model, resistive elements (R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>E</sub>) are due to the intracellular and extracellular matrix, respectively, and lipid structures are represented by the constant phase element (CPE<sub>M</sub>) of the tissues and cells. CPE<sub>M </sub>is a function that represents the charge or capacitance of the lipid bilayers (denoted by Q<sub>M</sub>) and a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 representing the non-ideal nature of the capacitor (denoted by &#x3b1;). As shall be discussed further below, the time-constant for charging the lipid bilayer, may then be computed as &#x3c4;=(R<sub>l</sub>Q<sub>m</sub>)<sup>1/&#x3b1;</sup>. Computing of the time constant in this manner is integral to the methods of the present invention, as the time constant is then used to identify the optimal EP pulse durations before, during and/or after each treatment.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0210">By using the array of EPEs and/or additional electrical measurement electrodes, EMEs, the tissue in the zone surrounded by the electrode arrays can be interrogated. This information can be used to direct EP conditions, for example. That is, using different EIS interrogation input signals, such as chirp pulses (or many others as outlined below), the output signals allow the device to fit to the tissue models to determine the properties of the tissue and the EP signals to use. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, after insertion of the electrodes, different interrogations can be run. For example, comparing impedance between electrodes 1 and 2 to impedance between 1 and 8 can help determine that the tissue between electrodes 1 and 8 is &#x201c;normal&#x201d; tissue, as compared to &#x201c;abnormal&#x201d; or &#x201c;diseased&#x201d; tissue between 1 and 2. Similarly, interrogation between electrodes 7 and 8 or 6 and 7 can help determine that electrode 7 is near or in a blood vessel, and thus should not be used for electroporation. Thus, for example, these measurements can be used to address the four following questions, and any other relevant inquiries depending on data necessary based on the scope of experimentation.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0211">1) Is each electrode making good contact with the tissue? As will be appreciated by those in the art, using electrodes in difficult to access areas or on particularly compliant skin can result in uncertainty if both electrodes adequately inserted into the tissue to be treated. This results in nonhomogeneous electric fields and poor delivery. 2) Are electrodes inserted into viable tissue? Inserting electrodes into abnormal tissue, particular tumor tissue, can be heterogeneous in texture and/or cell integrity, etc., with many tumors having necrotic and/or apoptotic cellular areas. Thus an electrode can be inserted into a location that might not result in good and/or even electric fields, and thus that electrode might not be used in the procedures of the present invention. 3) Is the therapeutic moiety (TM) or drug in the right location? In this embodiment, this measurement can be made pre- and post-injection of the TM solution, and the differences can inform whether more TM solution should be injected. 4) Are there electrodes that should not be used due to their location and/or contact? Again, making reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, these EIS measurements can allow the determination that electrode 7 is placed irregularly (e.g. in or close to a blood vessel, etc.), or that the location into which the electrode is inserted results in poor electrical contact due to tissue heterogeneity and/or integrity. 5) Is the tissue (e.g. tumor) getting electroporated sufficiently? This is the same as tissue sensing, as this measures the integrity of the cell membrane. Thus, these measurements can be made before EP (to establish a baseline), during EP and after EP, to insure that EP did occur.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0212">In addition, these EIS measurements can be used to determine ideal EP conditions as will be described below in relation to the adaptive control methods of the present invention for providing improved or optimized EP pulsing parameters. In some embodiments, the method of the present invention may include contacting the tissue in the electric field zone <b>100</b> or in the electroporation location <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) with a pair of EPEs/EMEs <b>120</b>. A low voltage power supply electrically connected to the EPEs/EMEs is used to apply a low voltage interrogation signal to the EPEs/EMEs. Methods for sensing the impedance and/or capacitance may include but are not limited to waveforms such as phase locked loops, square wave pulses, high frequency pulses, and chirp pulses. A voltage sensor and a current sensor are used to sense a voltage drop and current flowing through the circuit, and these parameters may then be processed by a controller, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to determine an average impedance for all cells in the measured area.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0213">As described above, capacitance and resistance measurements are an indicator of how healthy the cells are, and may be used to determine how long an electric pulse to apply in order to disrupt the cell membrane and provide conditions sufficient for electroporation. Once the average impedance of the cells has been determined, it is possible to determine several characteristics of the measured cells including, but not limited to Initial condition of cells or tissue&#x2014;for example, whether the cells are diseased (demonstrated by lower than average capacitance), whether the cells are healthy, positioning of electrodes&#x2014;whether the electrodes are properly positioned surrounding area around tissue/cells of interest/and whether they are in right location for effective electroporation, and the time constant, as briefly discussed above (to be described further below) for the cells.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0214">In some embodiments, impedance measurements may be made across several EI sensing electrode pairs to determine whether the average across all cells in the electric field zone 100 is consistent and for more accurate reading in a specific location. If EI measurements across are not consistent across several electrode pairs, this may indicate inconsistency in homogeneity of cells, thus requiring different time constants to be applied to different sets of electrodes. The time constant gives an indication of pulse width to be applied to the cells for electroporation to occur. Charging a capacitor to its maximum (i.e., where the capacitor/cell cannot store energy due to electroporation, where good transfection occurs) takes about 5 time constants. As a result pulse width for charging a capacitor to a point just before electroporation occurs can be determined therefore pulse width necessary to charge capacitor to at least 5 time constants (&#x3c4;<sub>C</sub>). After the time constant is determined, the pulse width is set accordingly for each set of EPEs based on the time constant determined for the cells in the area which the EPEs are surrounding.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0215">The time constant may be based on the circuit model illustrated and described above and derived from the series of equations below. The time constant for the purposes of the present invention is described as the amount of time (T) required for the potential applied across the terminal (V<sub>a</sub>) to drive the CPE to one-half of the applied potential (V<sub>CPE</sub>=V<sub>a</sub>/2).</p><p id="p-0218" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>

Fitting electrical data to the modified Randles model circuit allows parameter monitoring for conditions of membranes. Tumor tissue can thus be fit in real time to a modified Randles equation.

As will be appreciated by those in the art, successful electroporation occurs when the cellular membrane is disrupted, resulting in a change of capacitance and resistance. When subjected to an electric field, cells generally act as capacitors. When the electric field is applied for a long enough period (depending on the cell properties, health, size, etc. . . . ) charge accumulates at the cell membrane until it reaches a certain threshold and causes a breakdown of membrane integrity. In the embodiments where the EPEs and EMEs are different electrodes, the EMEs may be powered by a low voltage interrogation circuit. The present invention also includes a voltage sensor, and a current sensor, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> to measure current and voltage across cell membranes and tissue and the controller to process the voltage and current to determine an average capacitance for cells in the electric field zone <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0219">Impedance may be measured based on charge redistribution in the cells in response to low frequency electric field excitations of the low voltage interrogation circuit. Impedance may be measured before, between and after electroporation electric fields are applied to determine cell conditions, including, but not limited to cell health, placement of electrodes relative to cells for optimum electroporation, and most importantly a time constant which can be used to determine pulse width of electric fields to be applied to the cells in the electric field zone. As described before, in general, charging a capacitor to its maximum, i.e. right before electroporation occurs, takes a period of five time constants, therefore the pulse width of the initial electroporation electric field pulse may be set to 5 times the time constant. This pulse width is insufficient to cause electroporation in the cells which are outside of the electroporation location <b>110</b>, as described above, but sufficient to cause electroporation in the cells of the tissue in the electroporation location <b>110</b> which is subjected to the additive effects of the electric fields from all sets of EPEs being applied as one continuous electric field. Impedance measurements may be applied again after the first EP electric fields have been applied, and a percentage drop in impedance or time constant may be calculated and compared to a predetermined value to determine whether cells in the electroporation location have been electroporated sufficiently. If not, the systems and methods of the present invention adjust the pulse width&#x2014;based on the calculated percentage drop in capacitance&#x2014;for the next set of electroporation pulsed electric fields until it is determined sufficient EP has occurred in the EP location. Therefore, impedance measurements between pulses allows for electrical conditions, namely pulse width to be adjusted based on time constants associated with cell membrane capacitance and resistance, and the electroporation process can be stopped when an ideal prop in capacitance, time constant, or membrane integrity is reached.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0220">Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to control systems and methods for electroporating cells in an EP location of a tissue using the various electroporation devices of the present invention, described herein.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">III.

In some embodiments, the signal generator <b>1530</b> is capable of supplying both a low voltage excitation (interrogatory) signal, as well as a high voltage signal for an EP pulse. An example of such a generator is the proprietary generator (A) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. The generator is capable of performing real-time feedback control based on EIS data before and between each EP pulse.

EIS data captured before and between pulses is obtained by the generator over a range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz with 10 data points acquired per decade. Acquisition of EIS data over this spectra is accomplished in 250 ms, which is rapid enough to: (1) execute routines to determine a time constant for the next pulse; (2) store EIS data for post analysis; and (3) not interrupt clinically used EP conditions. The generator may be capable of a minimum output load impedance of 20 ohms and a maximum load impedance of an open circuit.

EP Electrode Configurations</heading><p id="p-0236" num="0231">The EP devices of the present invention find use in two main therapeutic areas: delivery of therapeutic moieties and tissue electroporation/ablation. In general, and for many of the embodiments outlined herein, the patient is suffering from a disease such as cancer that is localized in particular tissues that will benefit from the intracellular delivery of therapeutic moieties (TMs). Alternatively, in some embodiments, it is desirable to kill small loci of cells within a tissue (sometimes referred to in the context of electroporation as &#x201c;irreversible electroporation&#x201d; or &#x201c;electroporation ablation&#x201d;). As is known in the art, one advantage of irreversible electroporation is that it results in apoptosis rather than necrosis as for other common ablation techniques. While most of the discussion herein is related to the former, the FPA systems and methods in the absence of TM delivery are contemplated throughout.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0232">The EP devices and methods of the invention are used to electroporate cells in a tissue of a patient or subject as well as deliver TM to the electroporation location for treatment thereof. In general, the EP devices of the invention are used to treat diseased or abnormal tissue, such as cancerous tissues. The term &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; includes a myriad of diseases generally characterized by inappropriate cellular proliferation, abnormal or excessive cellular proliferation. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancers (including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), lung cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, or sarcomas. Accordingly, cancerous tissues including skin tissue, connective tissues, adipose tissues, etc. can be treated using the systems of the invention. Such cancers may be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, degenerative growth and developmental disorders, mitogenic agents, ultraviolet radiation (UV), viral infections, inappropriate tissue expression of a gene, alterations in expression of a gene, or carcinogenic agents. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, inhibition or reduction of proliferation of cancer cells, destruction of cancer cells, prevention of proliferation of cancer cells or prevention of initiation of malignant cells or arrest or reversal of the progression of transformed premalignant cells to malignant disease or amelioration of the disease. The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient&#x201d; refers to any animal, preferably a mammal such as a human.

Through the application of the electric field over a period of time, the cell membrane accumulates charge and creates a trans-membrane voltage, according to the formula Vm=1.5&#xd7;Radius&#xd7;E<sub>ext</sub>, with Radius being the radius of the cell, and E<sub>ext </sub>being the external electric field of the cell. In general, the cell membrane breaks down (e.g. forms pores) at roughly one volt, although the size and shape of the cells, in addition to their placement in the electric field, can make a difference. For example, long muscle cells have a higher capacitance across the cell width than along their length. Similarly, larger cells are generally electroporated at lower voltages.

However, by using the alternating pulse devices of the present invention, the damage to the cells in the burn out zone can be minimized by reducing the heat and field by 50% (in the case of two sets of electrodes, more if more sets are used).

As will be appreciated by those in the art, successful electroporation occurs when the cellular membrane is disrupted, resulting in a change of capacitance. When subjected to an electric field, cells generally act as capacitors. When the electric field is applied for a long enough period (depending on the cell properties, health, size, etc. . . . ) charge accumulates at the cell membrane until it reaches a certain threshold and causes a breakdown of membrane integrity. The capacitance sensor system may be a low voltage interrogation or excitation circuit, may include a pair of capacitance sensing electrodes powered by a low voltage power source, a voltage sensor, a current sensor and an electronic signal processing device to process the voltage and current to determine an average capacitance for cells in the zone.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0303">In these embodiments, the sensor system is for performing impedance measurements of cell membranes of the tissue and includes a pair of capacitance sensing electrodes (e.g. electrode <b>1720</b>) powered by a low voltage power supply (e.g. generator A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). The sensor system may further include a voltage sensor (integrated into electrodes <b>1720</b>, <b>1752</b> and/or <b>1754</b>) configured to sense a voltage or voltage drop across the cell membranes. In addition, the sensor system may include a current sensor (integrated into electrodes <b>1720</b>) configured to sense a current across the cell membranes and an electronic signal processing device, e.g. a controller <b>1505</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The electronic signal processing device (e.g. controller <b>1505</b>) processes the voltage drop and the current across the cell membranes to determine the impedance of the cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0304">In some embodiments, methods for sensing impedance (EIS), described above, may include applying waveforms such as phase locked loops, square wave pulses, high frequency pulses, chirp pulses, etc. as is more fully described below. When exposed to an electric field, cell membranes act as capacitors. Capacitance may be measured based on charge redistribution in the cells in response to low frequency electric field excitations of the low voltage interrogation circuit, and from the capacitance, impedance measurements may be derived. Capacitance may be measured before, between and after electroporation electric fields are applied to determine cell conditions, including, but not limited to cell health, placement of electrodes relative to cells for optimum electroporation, and most importantly a time constant which can be used to determine pulse width of electric fields to be applied to the cells in the electric field zone. In general, charging a capacitor to its maximum, i.e. right before electroporation occurs, takes a period of five time constants, therefore the pulse width of the initial electroporation electric field pulse may be set to <b>5</b> times the time constant. This pulse width is insufficient to cause electroporation in the cells which are outside of the electroporation location, as described above, but sufficient to cause electroporation in the cells of the tissue in the electroporation location which is subjected to the additive effects of the electric fields from all sets of electroporation electrodes being applied as one continuous electric field. Capacitance measurements may be repeated after the first electroporation electric fields have been applied, and a percentage drop in capacitance may be calculated and compared to a predetermined value to determine whether cells in the electroporation location have been electroporated sufficiently. If not, pulse width may be adjusted&#x2014;based on the calculated percentage drop in capacitance for the next set of electroporation pulsed electric fields until it is determined sufficient electroporation has occurred in the electroporation location.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0305">The electronic signal processing device (e.g. controller <b>1505</b>) may fit the tissue impedance data to the equivalent circuit model, CPE-based Tissue Model described above in order to predict the next optimal pulsing parameters. As described above, electrical impedance is the sum of these resistive and capacitive elements over a range of frequencies, therefore to quantify each of these parameters, tissue impedance data can be fit to the CPE-based Tissue Model. Therefore, capacitance measurements taken between pulses by the electrodes <b>1720</b>, <b>1752</b> and <b>1754</b> with the integrated sensors allows for electrical conditions, e.g., pulse width to be adjusted based on time constants associated with cell membrane capacitance, and the electroporation process can be stopped when an ideal drop in capacitance or membrane integrity is reached. It is hypothesized that real-time monitoring of electrical properties of tissues will enable feedback control over EP parameters and lead to optimum transfection in heterogeneous tumors. Using EIS feedback, will allow (<b>1</b>) delivery parameters to be adjusted in real-time, (<b>2</b>) delivery of only the pulses necessary to generate a therapeutic response, and (<b>3</b>) reduce the overall EP-mediated tissue damage.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0000">b.

ADAPTIVE CONTROL METHODS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0366" num="0357">Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to an adaptive control method for controlling EP pulse parameters during EP of cells in a tissue, using an EP device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a control routine for an adaptive control method for controlling EP pulse parameters during using an EP system according to the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a one-step ahead feedforward control routine for optimizing EP pulse parameters employing the control routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> according to the present invention. In some embodiments, the adaptive control method may be implemented using any of the EP devices described herein. The method of the present invention is however, not limited to such, but may also be practiced on any of the EP systems and devices/applicators and any methods such as those outlined in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 62/214,807, 62/214,872, 62/141,142, 62/141,182, 62/141,256, and 62/141,164, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety, specifically including the Figures, Legends and descriptions of the Figures and components therein.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0358">The devices, systems and methods of the present invention will improve the process of EP-based gene therapy. Current EP systems apply an open-loop control system using static parameters that rely on a priori knowledge determined by preclinical studies in homogeneous syngeneic tumor models. However, preliminary data has shown that even in homogeneous tumors, the time required to apply an electrostatic field across a cell membrane follows a log-normal distribution. Applying static parameters to different tumors, even in a homogenous model, results in a wide range of applied electrostatic fields across cell membranes and leads to treatment variability. One potential remedy is to define static parameters that apply sufficiently long EP pulses that encompass 95% of known membrane charging times. However, due to variance in the charging times, the average tumor would be over treated by a factor of 4, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects such as necrosis and apoptosis. The present invention provides a solution to the aforementioned problem by implementing a closed-loop control system using tissue-sensing based feedback control to optimize the EP process with tumor-specific measurements acquired before and between each EP pulse. In some embodiments, tissue sensing will be used to measure the membrane charge time for a specific tumor to tailor each EP pulse for optimal treatment. Constraint boundaries are imposed on the EP pulse parameters to ensure feedback convergence. The necessary conditions required to implement a closed-loop control system for enhancing EP are (1) the ability to exert an electrical force on a tissue to drive it towards a desired state and (2) the ability to measure the state of the tissue. This can be achieved by measuring bioelectrical changes as a result of applied electrical excitation signals.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0359">The feedback adaptive control method of the present invention employs a closed-loop feedback control mechanism to regulate EP by monitoring the physiological properties of tumors before and between EP pulses. Physiological properties will be determined by fitting EIS tissue data to equivalent circuit models, described herein, in real-time with a non-linear least-squares curve fitting routine. Fitting data to tissue models allows the integrity of cell membranes, represented by CPEs, to be quantified for the tissue being treated. The duration of EP pulses is modulated based on CPE model fit parameters, allowing EP to be stopped when a relative change in CPE parameters reaches a level associated with therapeutically beneficial pDNA expression. The control devices, systems and methods of the present invention will allow a user to inject a therapeutic molecule, characterize the baseline state of the tissue, deliver optimized EP pulses for that tissue, and stop pulsing when a relative drop in membrane integrity is achieved. This removes any ambiguity associated with EP, and ensures successful delivery of immunotherapeutic genes regardless of variations in tumor properties. Thus, EIS represents a significant advancement in the hardware currently used for clinical intratumoral immunotherapy.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0360">Various aspects of the present invention address the need to advance the practice of EP by implementing the dynamic feedback control system, as described above. In vivo EP for gene therapy has been used clinically in vaccination and oncology indications for many different tissue types and tumor As described above, EIS is a low power technique capable of real-time monitoring of tissues. This technique is performed by applying a series of low voltage excitation signals across a pair of electrodes and measuring a response current over a range of frequencies. The magnitude and phase of each applied excitation is then computed and fit to an equivalent circuit model of the tissue. A common equivalent circuit used for tissue is illustrated above. In this model, resistive elements (R<sub>I </sub>and R<sub>E</sub>) are due to the intracellular and extracellular matrix, respectively, and lipid structures are represented by the constant phase element (CPE<sub>M</sub>). CPE<sub>M </sub>is a function that represents the charge or capacitance of the lipid bilayers (denoted by Q<sub>M</sub>) and a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 representing the non-ideal nature of the capacitor (denoted by a).

Various embodiments of the EP systems and devices of the present invention utilize the same electrodes to perform low power EIS measurements and to high power EP pulses. The aforementioned configuration is ideal, as this reduces the number of required electrodes and directly measures tissue responses. The adaptive control method further comprises initializing EP pulse parameters for performing EP in the tissue and the initialized EP pulse parameters are based at least in part on at least one trained model as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> is an illustration of the initial training stage for a model used to estimate pulsing parameters according to the present invention. As described previously, the model may be a physics-based model, empirical model, or data-driven model. In some embodiments, the trained model is trained using empirical data observed during initial operation of an EP device using fixed EP pulse parameters. The models may be trained using supervised learning routines using machine learning methods. In some embodiments, the particular implementation used for the model prediction stage may be a decision support tree which generates a logical rule-set for parameter estimation and diagnostics according to the adaptive control method of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0362">In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a &#x201c;one-step feedforward control&#x201d;. By &#x201c;one step ahead feedforward control&#x201d; it is meant that before a first EP pulse is applied, the parameter estimation routine initializes the initial control parameters for the first pulse based on the model trained in the initial training phase using the empirical data from previously conducted experiments. These previously conducted experiments may be based for example on tissue samples with tumors having similar characteristics to those of the current tissue to be subjected to the control method of the present invention. The initialization may be an initial training phase which is conducted offline. Parameter estimation routines (to be described more fully below) are first created during an initial model training phase, using, for example, empirical data collected from a number of experiments/trials. This may be done offline by operating the system without any feed-forward or feedback control (fixed pulse parameters). The empirical data may include a variety of fixed pulse settings, resulting features and corresponding biological outcomes resulting from these experiments/trials. Based on the previously trained models and measured features, derived from tissue sensing measurements in the initial training phase and from a tissue or tumor type identified in a diagnostic phase, the controller uses the parameter estimation routine to select optimal parameters/conditions for the first EP pulse. These first pulse parameters are thus &#x201c;fed forward&#x201d; to be applied as the first pulse for the control routine as opposed to the conventional EP systems and methods in which parameters/conditions of the first pulse are based on fixed conditions. In this sense, the methods of the present invention utilize feedforward control to provide optimal EP parameters based on a sensed tissue type, in conjunction with feedback control to sense cell conditions, e.g., degree of permeabilization and adjust the pulse parameters accordingly.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0363"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>B</figref> are a flow-chart illustrating the method for adaptive control of EP pulse parameters according to the present invention.

In some embodiments, the current and voltage measurements may be made by a voltage sensor and a current sensor, for example, as illustrated in the measurement device <b>1510</b> of control system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The current and voltage sensors (which may be integrated into the electrodes of the EP device or contained separately elsewhere in the control system of the present invention) act as transducers which sense current and voltage across the cell membranes and detect any changes in quantities and provide an output signal to the controller <b>1505</b>, for the controller to carry out a function corresponding to the signals received from the sensors, i.e., predict the first pulse parameters.

To this effect, sensor data is cleansed by removing outliers, out of range values, missing values, removing biases, scaling, cross-correlation, and applying de-noising routines.

Generally, in this embodiment, there are two nucleic acids that are electroporated into the tissue, one encoding a heavy chain and one encoding a light chain. In some cases, these can be in a single expression vector or two expression vectors can be used as is more fully described below.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0390">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is used generally. Antibodies that find use in the present invention can take on a number of formats as described herein, including traditional antibodies as well as antibody derivatives, fragments and mimetics, described below. Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; (typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (typically having a molecular weight of about 50-70 kDa). Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. The present invention is directed to the IgG class, which has several subclasses, including, but not limited to IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, with the former finding particular utility in a number of applications, particularly oncology. Thus, &#x201c;isotype&#x201d; as used herein is meant any of the subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. It should be understood that therapeutic antibodies can also comprise hybrids of isotypes and/or subclasses.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0391">The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition, generally referred to in the art and herein as the &#x201c;Fv domain&#x201d; or &#x201c;Fv region&#x201d;. In the variable region, three loops are gathered for each of the V domains of the heavy chain and light chain to form an antigen-binding site. Each of the loops is referred to as a complementarity-determining region (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;CDR&#x201d;), in which the variation in the amino acid sequence is most significant. &#x201c;Variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable region differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. Variability within the variable region is not evenly distributed. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called &#x201c;hypervariable regions&#x201d; that are each 9-15 amino acids long or longer.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0392">In some embodiments, the antibodies are full length. By &#x201c;full length antibody&#x201d; herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions, optionally including one or more amino acid modifications as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibodies can be a variety of structures, including, but not limited to, antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;antibody mimetics&#x201d;), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;antibody conjugates&#x201d;), and fragments of each, respectively. Specific antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH<b>1</b> domains, (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains, (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989, Nature 341:544-546, entirely incorporated by reference) which consists of a single variable, (v) isolated CDR regions, (vi) F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426, Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5879-5883, entirely incorporated by reference), (viii) bispecific single chain Fv (WO 03/11161, hereby incorporated by reference) and (ix) &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; or &#x201c;triabodies&#x201d;, multivalent or multi specific fragments constructed by gene fusion (Tomlinson et. al., 2000, Methods Enzymol. 326:461-479; WO94/13804; Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-6448, all entirely incorporated by reference). The antibody fragments may be modified. For example, the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al., 1996, Nature Biotech. 14:1239-1245, entirely incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p-0403" num="0393">As will be appreciated by those in the art, there are a wide variety of suitable therapeutic antibodies that can be used in the present invention, depending on the type and location of the cancer. Suitable therapeutic antibodies include, but are not limited to, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies of therapeutic use in humans, including currently approved antibodies identical or similar to muromonab, abciximab, rituximab, daclizumab, basiliximab, palivizumab, infiliximab, trastuzumab, gemtuzumab, alemtuzumab, ibritumomab, adalimumab, omalizumab, tositumomab, efalizumab, ceruximab, bevacizumab, natalizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and pidilizumab MPDL328OA (ROCHE), as well as antibodies under clinical development, particularly those in oncology applications.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0394">In addition, the present invention provides EP methods and devices that deliver therapeutic antibodies to immune checkpoint inhibitors. As used herein, &#x201c;immune checkpoint&#x201d; molecules refers to a group of immune cell surface receptor/ligands which induce T cell dysfunction or apoptosis. These immune inhibitory targets attenuate excessive immune reactions and ensure self-tolerance. Tumor cells harness the suppressive effects of these checkpoint molecules.

This system can output a minimum of 10V and maximum of 300 V with pulse durations ranging from 100 &#x3bc;s to 10 ms. EIS data captured before and between pulses is obtained over a range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz with 10 data points acquired per decade. Acquisition of EIS data over this spectra is accomplished in 250 ms, which is rapid enough to: (1) execute routines to determine a time constant for the next pulse; (2) store EIS data for post analysis; and (3) not interrupt clinically used EP conditions. Data gathered from the EIS system is fit to the tissue impedance model, described above, in real-time using an embedded Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) microprocessor (STM32F407, ST Microelectronics). When operating in feedback mode, features of this data can be used to control parameters associated with the EP process. The custom generator interfaces with a variety of standard EP applicators, and will support up to 6 electrodes. Solid state relays are used to switch between high voltage EP pulse circuitry and low voltage EIS interrogation circuitry. To allow hands-free operation of the generator a foot pedal was added to trigger, pause, or abort the EP process. An image of this generator and its accessories is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0406">Unpublished studies performed in vivo investigated the effect of varying pulse widths based on time constant data acquired from EIS spectra. These studies were performed with MC38 tumors implanted in the flank skin of 8-week-old albino B6 mice. At the time of treatment tumor volumes averaged 75 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumors were injected with 50 &#x3bc;g of pDNA encoding the luciferase protein under control of a CMV promoter. A prototype applicator C including an EP device, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, was used to perform both injections and EP. This applicator contains two EP electrodes around a central injection lumen; during EP the injection lumen is retracted. Electroporation was performed at an e-field strength of 350 V/cm and pulse widths were modulated in real-time from 0.1 to 20.0 multiples of the time constant computed from EIS data gathered before pulsing each MC38 tumor. A total of 8 pulses was applied to each tumor, as this previously has correlated with a high degree of transfection. Luminescence data was acquired at 48 hours by injecting 200 &#x3bc;l of a 15 mg/ml D-luciferin solution prepared in DPBS and performing in vivo optical imaging.

It was originally hypothesized that as the applied pulse width increases with respect to the measured time constant, the percentage of the e-field applied across the lipid bilayer would increase according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref>. This is particularly important as the computed time constants from the EIS data before each EP treatment follows a log-normal distribution, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref>. The results of the experiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>C</figref> shows as the applied pulse widths increases, with respect to the measured time-constants, the resulting luminescence also increases. This phenomenon supported the hypothesis as capacitors approach charge saturation at 5 time constants, the measured expression reaches an upper limit. Data sets acquired above two time constants had significantly (p&#x3c;0.05) higher luminescence when compared to injection alone. As pulse widths become longer and more energy is dissipated through the tissue, expression will begin to diminish as irreversible tissue damage occurs.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0409">Additionally, this experiment demonstrated a potential criteria to cease the EP process prior to reaching a previously determined terminal number of pulses. As cell membranes begin to permeabilize their ability to hold a charge decreases, which in turn causes a decrease in the time constant associated with charging CPEs. Supporting this theory, a high degree of correlation was observed between changes in the time constant and measured luminescence. Tumors with time constant drops of greater than 20% correlated with significantly (p&#x3c;0.05) higher expression of pDNA. This measurement can be used to stop the pulsing process when conditions for successful gene therapy are present. Interestingly, groups with short pulse durations caused an increase in time constant, due to compression of lipid bilayers that causes an increase in capacitance. For this study, we propose to utilize the prototype generator to explore the variables for controlling EP and validate this technique in homogeneous and heterogeneous tumors. We hypothesize EP-based gene delivery can be optimized for each tumor by measuring tissue properties and adjusting each applied pulse width. Interrogation of real-time changes in membrane capacitance will lead to (1) reproducible transfection efficiency; (2) increased duration of gene expression; (3) enhanced therapeutic efficacy; and (4) reduced tissue damage.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0421" num="0410">An experiment was performed to determine if electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) could differentiate between data acquired in fibrotic or necrotic tissues from data acquired in healthy tissues.
