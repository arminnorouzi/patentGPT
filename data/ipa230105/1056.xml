Stents are often endovascular prostheses or implants that are used for treating, for example, stenosis or aneurysms. Stents may include a support structure or frame that is capable of supporting a wall of a vessel or bypass an aneurysm. In many cases, the structural features of the stent consist of the frame.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stents are typically inserted into a vessel in a compressed or crimped state and then expanded when properly positioned such that the frame presses against the wall of the vessel. The stents can be expanded with the aid of, for example, a balloon catheter or may be self-expandable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stents can be nondegradable or biodegradable. Nondegradable stents are designed to remain in the vessel for an unspecified period of time. Biodegradable stents are degraded over predetermined periods of time in the vessel. Preferably, a biodegradable stent begins to degrade when the vessel is healed and the support function of the stent is no longer needed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Magnesium (Mg) alloys are currently being investigated as potential materials for, among other things, biodegradable stents. However, bare Mg alloys tend to degrade too quickly when implanted in a patient for the stents to effectively operate for a desired amount of time. Accordingly, it may be desirable to modify or protect Mg alloys of stents where an Mg alloy component would otherwise be exposed to bodily fluid or tissue so that the stents can effectively operate for the desired amount of time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Developing effective Mg alloy modification or protection regimens can be challenging. For example, the modification or protection, such as a coating or surface treatment, should not only inhibit corrosion of the Mg alloy for a sufficient time after implant, but also should preferably be biodegradable and should preferably have suitable mechanical properties to inhibit cracking during implantation or use. In addition, it may also be desirable for the coating or surface treatment to serve as a good primer for a drug coating, which may be a polymer-containing or polymer-free coating.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein are a variety of modification or protection regimens for inhibiting corrosion or slowing biodegradation of Mg alloys. The modification or protection regimens include one or more of removing secondary phases, such as precipitants or defects, from a surface of the Mg alloy to provide more uniform corrosion across the surface rather than focused localized corrosion, and providing a temporary barrier to water to the surface of the Mg alloy. Removal of secondary phases can be accomplished in any suitable manner, such as conversion coating the Mg alloy surface. One particularly effective conversion coating is a hydrofluoric acid (HF) conversion coating. Providing a barrier to water to the Mg alloy surface can be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, barrier layers may be deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), physical vapor deposition, or by drawing tubes of metal over the Mg alloy surface. The thickness of the deposited layers, the material of the layers and the process conditions of depositing the layers can be tuned to adjust the amount of time that the water barrier remains in place in vivo prior to, for example, biodegrading to an extent to no longer serve as an effective water barrier.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments described herein, a biodegradable implantable medical device includes a magnesium (Mg) alloy and a coating on the Mg alloy. The coating comprises one or more of a conversion coating that at least partially removes surface secondary phases exposed on a surface of the Mg alloy, and one or more water barrier layers on or over the surface of the Mg alloy. In some embodiments, the Mg alloy surface is conversion coated with a hydrofluoric acid conversion coating; a conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of Ce<sup>3+</sup> or Ce<sup>4&#x2032;</sup>; a conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of inorganic Mg precipitating agents such as phosphates, silicates, permanganate, hydrotalcite (Mg<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>[OH]<sub>16</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O), vanadates, chromates and Rare Earth ionic solutions other than cerium; or a conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of organic Mg precipitating agents such as 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)-resorcinol, 8-hydroxy quinoline and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate. In some embodiments, one or more barrier layer is deposited on an Mg alloy device surface or on a conversion coated Mg alloy device surface by ALD. In some embodiments, one or more of cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), aluminum oxide (AlO<sub>2</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) or metallo-organic variations such as ethylene and propylene glycols of titanium, zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) or metallo-organic variations of zirconium, hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) or metallo-organic variations of hafnium, aluminum fluoride (AlF<sub>3</sub>), and magnesium fluoride (MgF<sub>2</sub>) are deposited by ALD. In some embodiments, the implantable medical device is a stent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments described herein, a biodegradable implantable medical device includes a magnesium (Mg) alloy and a coating on the Mg alloy.

One way to protect Mg alloy devices from premature degradation following implantation is to modify an exposed surface of the implant so that the Mg alloy degrades more uniformly across its surface. Mg alloys typically have secondary phases, such as precipitants or defects, exposed on their surfaces, which exposed secondary phases result in focal points for corrosion. Focused local corrosion can result in premature failure of an implanted Mg alloy device. Modifying a surface of an Mg alloy device to at least partially remove exposed secondary phases can result in more uniform corrosion across the surface, and thus extend the life of the Mg alloy device. One way to modify a surface of an Mg alloy device to remove exposed surface secondary phases is to conversion coat the surface of the device. Examples of suitable conversion coating processes include hydrofluoric acid conversion coatings; conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of Ce<sup>3+ </sup>or Ce<sup>4+</sup>; treatment with acidic or basic solutions of inorganic Mg precipitating agents such as phosphates, silicates, permanganate, hydrotalcite, vanadates, chromates and Rare Earth ionic solutions other than cerium; and conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of organic Mg precipitating agents such as 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)-resorcinol, 8-hydroxy quinoline and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another way to protect Mg alloy devices from premature degradation following implantation is to provide a barrier to water to the Mg alloy surface of the device. Suitable water barriers can be deposited on the surface of an Mg alloy surface of the device or can be placed around or over an Mg alloy device. For example, a moisture barrier can be deposited on the surface of an Mg alloy by physical vapor deposition, ALD, or by drawing tubes or sheets over a surface of an Mg alloy device. Any suitable water barrier may be deposited on or placed over a surface of an Mg alloy device. Examples of suitable water barriers include aluminum, magnesium, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide or metallo-organic variations such as ethylene and prolylene glycols of titanium, zirconium oxide or metallo-organic variations of zirconium, hafnium oxide or metallo-organic variations of hafnium, aluminum fluoride, or magnesium fluoride. Other examples of water barriers include polymeric barriers. Preferably, the barrier is biodegradable. The thickness of the barrier layers, the material of the barrier layers, and the process conditions by which the barrier layers are deposited on or disposed about the Mg alloy devices can be tuned to adjust the amount of time that the water barrier remains in place in vivo prior to, for example, biodegrading to an extent to no longer serve as an effective water barrier.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A conversion coating process, one or more coating process, or both a conversion coating process and one or more coating process can be employed to tailor the degradation rate of an Mg alloy device to delay biodegradation of an Mg alloy device for a desired amount of time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The protection processes described herein can be used for any suitable medical device that contains an Mg alloy that would otherwise be exposed to bodily tissue or fluid when implanted in a patent. In various embodiments, the protected or modified Mg alloys are employed in, or as, frames for medical stents.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the stents are endovascular stents for treating, for example, stenosis or aneurysms. The stents may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of a frame that is capable of supporting a wall of a vessel or bypass an aneurysm. The stents are typically inserted into a vessel in a compressed or crimped state and then expanded when properly positioned such that the frame presses against the wall of the vessel. In many embodiments, a balloon catheter is used to insert the stent into the vessel. The crimped stent is disposed over the balloon of the catheter. Once in a proper position within the vessel, the balloon is inflated to expand the stent. The balloon can be deflated, and the catheter can be removed from the vessel leaving the expanded stent in place within the vessel.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a schematic illustration of a stent <b>100</b> having a frame <b>110</b> is shown disposed over a balloon <b>15</b> of a balloon catheter <b>10</b>. The depicted balloon <b>15</b> is inflated and the stent <b>100</b> is thus expanded. The frame <b>110</b> of the stent <b>100</b> can be formed from a modified or protected Mg alloy as described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, the modifications or protections described herein prevent biodegradation of the Mg alloy to an extent that allows the sent to effectively support the vessel until the vessel is healed and the support function of the stent is no longer needed. The length of time needed until the vessel is healed can vary depending on the patient, the severity of the disease, and the like. In many cases, the length of time needed until the vessel is healed will be in a range from about one year to about two and a half years.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Ideally no biodegradation of the stent would occur until the vessel is healed, and once the vessel is healed biodegradation would occur rapidly. Practically, however, biodegradation over time will likely deviate from the ideal path. It should be sufficient for the protections described herein to prevent a biodegradation of an Mg alloy to an extent that allows the stent to function properly until the vessel is healed. One or more of the processes or sub-processes for protecting Mg alloys can be combined or tailored to achieve an appropriate biodegradation profile.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A frame of a stent can include any suitable magnesium alloy. Examples of suitable magnesium alloys include commercially available Mg alloys such as AZ series (Mg&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn), AM series (Mg&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Mn), AE series (Mg&#x2014;Al-RE), EZ series (Mg-RE-Zn), ZK series (Mg&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;Zr), WE series (Mg-RE-Zr), AX or AXJ series (Mg&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Ca), and AJ series, wherein RE indicates a rare earth metal. In some embodiments, a frame of a stent can includes a rare earth doped Mg alloys, such as an AE or WE series Mg alloy, which have very good mechanical properties such as high yield strength and elongation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">1. Overview of Mg Alloy Protection Processes</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Described herein are a variety of ways to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or slow biodegradation of the Mg alloys. An overview of some of the ways to inhibit corrosion and thus slow biodegradation of Mg alloys is first presented below, followed with a more detailed description of selected embodiments for protecting Mg alloys.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One way to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or to slow biodegradation is to treat the Mg alloy to make corrosion more uniform across the Mg alloy surface. Uniform corrosion spread out over the surface of the Mg alloy may be an important factor in improving the functional effectiveness, such as the structural integrity, of a biodegradable stent over time. Non-uniform, localized corrosion, which tends to focus at, for example exposed surface precipitants or defects, may result in more rapid failure of a stent frame due to localized weakness. One particularly effective way to inhibit non-uniform localized corrosion is to conversion coat the Mg alloy via a process that results in partial or complete removal of exposed metallic precipitants and defects on the Mg alloy surface to provide for more uniform corrosion. Examples of conversion coatings that may remove exposed precipitants or defects from a surface of an Mg alloy include, but are not limited to, hydrofluoric acid conversion coatings; conversion coatings with acidic or basic solutions of Ce<sup>3+ </sup>or Ce<sup>4+</sup>; conversion coatings with acidic or basic solutions of inorganic Mg precipitating agents such as phosphates, silicates, permanganate, hydrotalcite, vanadates, chromates and Rare Earth ionic solutions other than cerium; and conversion coating with acidic or basic solutions of organic Mg precipitating agents such as 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)-resorcinol, 8-hydroxy quinoline and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate. One particularly effective conversion coating is an HF conversion coating.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While HF conversion coating provides for more uniform corrosion, it may not, by itself, sufficiently slow degradation of an Mg alloy stent frame to allow the stent to function effectively for a desired amount of time. Accordingly, an additional protective layer may be placed on the HF conversion coated Mg alloy stent frame to delay the onset of corrosion. Any one or more suitable protective layers that serve as a water barrier may be used. Examples of suitable protective layers include, but are not limited to, aluminum, magnesium, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide or metallo-organic variations such as ethylene and propylene glycols of titanium, zirconium oxide or metallo-organic variations of zirconium, hafnium oxide or metallo-organic variations of hafnium, aluminum fluoride, or magnesium fluoride. The thickness of the barrier layers, the material of the barrier layers, and the process conditions by which the barrier layers are deposited on or disposed about the Mg alloy stent frame can be tuned to adjust the amount of time that the water barrier remains in place in vivo prior to, for example, biodegrading to an extent to no longer serve as an effective water barrier and allow more rapid biodegradation of the Mg alloy stent frame. In some examples, one or more additional protective layers may include magnesium, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, polymers and graphene. One particularly effective additional coating comprises alternating layers of aluminum oxide and a poly(aluminum ethylene glycol) polymer (alucone).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another way to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or to slow biodegradation is to deposit a metallic layer on the Mg alloy under conditions to form an intermetallic layer that is more resistant to corrosion than the Mg alloy. One example of an effective way to inhibit corrosion is to deposit aluminum on the Mg alloy and then heat treat the aluminum-coated Mg alloy to form an Mg/Al intermetallic layer. A commonly formed intermetallic compound is corrosion resistant Mg<sub>17</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">While aluminum coating and heat treatment can inhibit corrosion of an Mg alloy, it may not, by itself, sufficiently slow degradation of an Mg alloy stent frame to allow the stent to function effectively for a desired amount of time. Accordingly, an additional protective layer may be placed on the aluminum coated Mg alloy stent frame to delay onset of corrosion. Any one or more suitable protective layers that serve as a water barrier may be used. Examples of suitable protective layers include, but are not limited to, aluminum, magnesium, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide or metallo-organic variations such as ethylene and propylene glycols of titanium, zirconium oxide or metallo-organic variations of zirconium, hafnium oxide or metallo-organic variations of hafnium, aluminum fluoride, or magnesium fluoride.

In some examples, one or more additional protective layers include one or more layer of magnesium, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, polymers and graphene. One particularly effective additional coating comprises graphene, which provides corrosion resistance and has good elongation properties.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another way to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or to slow biodegradation is to deposit a water barrier layer on the Mg alloy or disposed a water barrier about the Mg alloy. Suitable water barriers may include one or layers of aluminum, magnesium, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide or metallo-organic variations such as ethylene and propylene glycols of titanium, zirconium oxide or metallo-organic variations of zirconium, hafnium oxide or metallo-organic variations of hafnium, aluminum fluoride, or magnesium fluoride. The thickness of the barrier layers, the material of the barrier layers, and the process conditions by which the barrier layers are deposited on or disposed about the Mg alloy stent frame can be tuned to adjust the amount of time that the water barrier remains in place in vivo prior to, for example, biodegrading to an extent to no longer serve as an effective water barrier and allow more rapid biodegradation of the Mg alloy stent frame.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">One example of a suitable barrier includes alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide. Aluminum oxide provides good corrosion resistance to Mg alloys. However, when subjected to stress, such as occurs during crimping or deployment of a stent frame or during in vivo fatigue of the stent frame, the aluminum oxide coating can crack and become less effective. Cerium can also act as a corrosion inhibitor for Mg alloys and, unlike aluminum oxide, may have self-healing properties such as the ability to fill cracks due to fatigue or corrosion. However, coating Mg alloys with cerium may present challenges. For example, cerium nitrate conversion coatings are flaky and do not adhere well to the surface of Mg alloy. By way of further example, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium oxide is typically performed at high temperatures that may cause vaporization of the Mg alloy during the ALD process. As described herein, an Mg alloy may be coated with aluminum oxide, for example by ALD at sufficiently low temperatures to not cause appreciable Mg alloy vaporization, and then the aluminum oxide-coated Mg alloy may be coated with cerium oxide, for example by ALD because the aluminum-oxide will prevent Mg alloy vaporization.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Prior to coating aluminum oxide and cerium oxide on the Mg alloy, the Mg alloy may be HF conversion coated or coated with aluminum and heat treated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Another way to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or to slow biodegradation is to place a layer of magnesium over or about the Mg alloy. Magnesium has a slower degradation rate than Mg alloys, but has poor mechanical properties, such as low yield strength and low elongation, for use as stent frames. In contrast, Mg alloys have higher strength but poor corrosion resistance due to the presence of second phases at grain boundaries that may lead to intergranular corrosion and subsequent failure of Mg alloy stent frames in corrosive environments. By providing a layer of magnesium over or around an Mg alloy layer, a combination of the desired mechanical properties of the Mg alloy and the corrosion resistance of the magnesium results.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">One effective way to provide a layer of magnesium over an Mg alloy is to draw a magnesium tube over an Mg alloy tube. The Mg alloy tube may also be drawn over an inner magnesium tube to provide a tri-layer tube that can be made into a stent frame by, for example, laser cutting.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Another effective way to provide a layer of magnesium around an Mg alloy is to draw a magnesium tube over an Mg alloy wire to form a bi-layer wire that can be, for example, formed and welded into a stent frame.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Prior to placing a magnesium layer over or around the Mg alloy, the Mg alloy tube or wire may be coated or treated as described above. For example, the Mg alloy tube or wire can be HF conversion coated, coated with aluminum and heat treated, coated with alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, coated with a polymer or graphene, or the like.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Overviews of the various ways discussed above to protect Mg alloys to inhibit corrosion or to slow biodegradation are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.

Aluminum deposition and heat treatment (e.g., as discussed above regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is an example of a coating that may prevent Mg alloy vaporization under cerium oxide deposition conditions.

Additional details regarding some embodiments of the processes and resulting frames or frame precursors are presented below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">2. HF Conversion Coating and Additional Layer</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As discussed above, an Mg alloy stent frame or stent frame precursor may advantageously be HF conversion coated to render corrosion of the frame more uniform, which can delay frame failure relative non-HF conversion coated frames that are susceptible to enhanced localized corrosion. However, it may be desirable to deposit an additional corrosion-resistant layer on the HF conversion coated Mg alloy stent frame to slow the rate of corrosion of the Mg alloy stent frame or stent frame precursor.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly and in some embodiments described herein, an Mg alloy frame or a precursor to a frame, such as a tube that can be laser cut into a frame or wire that can be formed or welded into a frame, is treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to form a HF conversion coating layer on the Mg alloy. HF conversion coatings on Mg alloys form a magnesium fluoride (MgF<sub>2</sub>) layer, which alone may not sufficiently slow corrosion of the Mg alloy.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Advantageously, HF conversion coating treatments of Mg alloys result in removal of precipitants and defects on the Mg alloy surface. Precipitants and defects may cause enhanced localized corrosion on surfaces stent frames formed from Mg alloys. Enhanced localized corrosion leads to localized weaknesses in the frame and premature mechanical failure of the frame at the localized weaknesses. By removing precipitants and defects that may cause enhanced local corrosion, HF conversion coating of Mg alloy stent frames results in more uniform corrosion of the stent frames, and thus more even degradation of the frames (as opposed to enhanced localized corrosion leading to localized failure). Uniform corrosion, which is spread out across the surface of the Mg alloy stent frame, may thus be an important factor in improving the functional effectiveness, such as the structural integrity, of a biodegradable stent over time.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An Mg alloy frame or frame precursor, which will both be referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;frame,&#x201d; can be HF conversion coated in any suitable manner. Typically, an Mg alloy frame is treated with hydrofluoric acid at a suitable concentration for a suitable amount of time and under suitable conditions to form a layer of MgF<sub>2 </sub>on a surface of the frame. By way of example, an Mg alloy frame can be immersed in a 49% HF solution for 24 hours at ambient conditions to form an HF conversion coating. The resulting coated frame tends to be uniform and dark in appearance.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Because the resulting HF conversion coating may not sufficiently slow corrosion, another coating or treatment may be applied.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a layer of aluminum or aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is deposited on the HF conversion coated Mg alloy frame. If aluminum is deposited, the resulting aluminum coated frame can be heated in the presence of oxygen to produce an outer surface of aluminum oxide. Preferably, the aluminum or aluminum oxide is initially deposited at a temperature of 150&#xb0; C. or less, such as 100&#xb0; C. or less or 95&#xb0; C. or less. Temperatures above 150&#xb0; C. may result in vaporization of the Mg alloy under vacuum, which is typically applied in deposition processes.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Because aluminum applied at such low temperatures tends to be amorphous, the resulting aluminum coated frame can be heated at a suitable temperature for a sufficient time to convert the amorphous film to a crystalline film. Once applied, the amorphous film should prevent vaporization of the underlying Mg alloy. By way of example, an aluminum coated stent can be heated at temperatures greater than 350&#xb0; C., such as greater than 400&#xb0; C. or about 450&#xb0; C. A few minutes to about an hour should be sufficient to convert amorphous aluminum to crystalline aluminum. As indicated above, heating in the presence of oxygen or an oxidizer can produce an outer layer of aluminum oxide.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Any suitable deposition process can be employed to deposit a layer of aluminum or aluminum oxide. For example, physical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition may be employed. Aluminum oxide is preferably deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which may occur at temperatures of, for example, about 75&#xb0; C. to about 95&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">While aluminum oxide films, such as ALD aluminum oxide films, can slow corrosion and thus slow the biodegradation of Mg alloy frames. ALD aluminum oxide films can be brittle and may crack upon crimping or deployment of the stent or may crack while undergoing fatigue after implantation, particularly at high stress areas. If the film is cracked, its ability to protect the Mg alloy substrate may be compromised.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, an additional layer is applied to an aluminum or aluminum oxide coated Mg alloy frame. Any suitable additional layer may be applied. In some embodiments, an additional layer contains cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>). For example, alternating layers of cerium oxide and aluminum oxide may be applied. In some embodiments, an additional layer contains graphene. In some embodiments, an additional layer is a magnesium layer. In some embodiments, an additional layer contains an organic component.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments a layer including an organic component contains a poly(aluminum ethylene glycol) polymer (alucone). Such layers can be applied in any suitable manner such as, for example, molecular layer deposition (MLD) at any suitable temperature, such as at about 120&#xb0; C. to about 130&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, layers of aluminum oxide and alucone are alternated to form a nanolaminate. In some embodiments, a cap layer of alucone is deposited. The aluminum oxide layers and alucone layers, in combination, can have any suitable thickness, whether or not in the form of a nanolaminate. In some embodiments, the combined thickness of the aluminum oxide layers and alucone layers is 100 nanometers (nm) or less.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A layer including an organic component can improve flexibility relative to the inorganic ALD films, but may have reduced barrier properties to moisture. However a layer including an organic component together with a metal or metal oxide layer, such as an aluminum oxide layer, may form an effective barrier. As discussed below in the EXAMPLES, Mg alloy frames coated with aluminum oxide and alucone nanolaminates had superior barrier and flexibility properties relative to either coating alone. When such nanolaminates were coated on bare Mg alloy, as opposed to HF conversion coated Mg alloy, the frame suffered from local corrosion issues. However, when used in combination with the HF conversion coating, the aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate resulted in slow and uniform corrosion that was not achieved with either HF conversion coating alone or nanolaminate coating alone.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As discussed above, the HF conversion coating provides for uniform corrosion of the base metal. The HF conversion coating may also improve adhesion of the aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate film. The aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate film provides a combination of flexibility and barrier properties to resist fracturing during the crimp and deploy process to effectively keep water and electrolytes away from the magnesium surface.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The combination of HF conversion coating and aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate coating provides an effective corrosion resistant barrier on Mg alloy substrates to delay biodegradation of Mg alloy-based stent frames. As discussed in the Examples below, the corrosion resistance provided by HF conversion coating alone and an aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate alone (without HF conversion coating) was substantially less effective at inhibiting corrosion of Mg alloy substrates than a combination of HF conversion coating and aluminum oxide/alucone nanolaminate coating. The unique combination of the uniform corrosion provided by the HF conversion coating with the flexibility and barrier properties of the aluminum oxide/alucone film results in slow and uniform corrosion across the stent surface and results in a stent that maintains high strength and radial stiffness.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For purposes of illustration, a schematic sectional view of an embodiment of a coated surface of an Mg alloy frame <b>600</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

Deposition of Aluminum, Heat Treatment, and Additional Layer</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As discussed above, an Mg alloy stent frame may advantageously be coated with aluminum and heat treated to produce a corrosion resistant intermetallic layer. A commonly formed intermetallic compound is corrosion resistant Mg<sub>17</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Preferably, the aluminum is initially deposited at a temperature of 150&#xb0; C. of less, such as 100&#xb0; C. or less or 95&#xb0; C. or less. Temperatures above 150&#xb0; C. may result in vaporization of the Mg alloy under vacuum, which is typically applied in deposition processes. Because aluminum applied at such low temperatures tends to be amorphous and nanoporous, the resulting aluminum coated frame can be heated at a suitable temperature for a sufficient time to convert the amorphous film to a denser less porous polycrystalline aluminum film. Once applied, the amorphous film should prevent vaporization of the underlying Mg alloy. By way of example, an aluminum coated stent can be heated at temperatures greater than 350&#xb0; C., such as greater than 400&#xb0; C. or about 450&#xb0; C. A few minutes to about an hour should be sufficient to convert amorphous aluminum to the denser polycrystalline aluminum. Heating in the presence of oxygen or an oxidizer can produce an outer layer of aluminum oxide.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Any suitable deposition process can be employed to deposit a layer of aluminum. For example, physical vapor deposition may be employed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">While aluminum coating and heat treatment can inhibit corrosion of an Mg alloy, it may not, by itself, sufficiently slow degradation of an Mg alloy stent frame to allow the stent to function effectively for a desired amount of time. Accordingly, one or more additional protective layer may be placed on the aluminum coated Mg alloy stent frame to further inhibit corrosion. Suitable additional protective layers include, for example, one or more layers of magnesium, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, polymers and graphene.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, an Mg alloy is coated according to the following process:</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">1. Mg alloy surface is sand or grit blasted to create a textured surface. The sand or grit blasting can be done with SiO<sub>2 </sub>or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particles. For stent application the grit size should be smaller than 20 microns to avoid mechanical damage to the component. In addition, the air pressure should be minimal in order to minimize mechanical damage to the component.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">2. The second step involves coating aluminum on to the textured Mg alloy surface by physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. The temperature of the stent component is preferably contained within or below 150&#xb0; C. to avoid vaporization of the Mg alloy based material in vacuum.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">3. The aluminum sputtered film can be made porous or fully dense by controlling the process parameters during the sputtering process. The films are generally amorphous in nature due to low temperature of the deposition process.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">4. The third step involves, heat treating the aluminum sputtered Mg alloy based substrates at high temperatures, such as 450&#xb0; C. for a few minutes to an hour in an argon environment to change the amorphous film to crystalline. In this process, some diffusion at the interface between the aluminum sputtered film and Mg alloy to form an MgAl intermetallic compound. The most commonly formed intermetallic compound is Mg<sub>17</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>. If the heat treatment process is carried in air or oxygen, thin oxide film will form on a surface of the aluminum. The film can be porous or dense depending upon the base sputtered aluminum layer.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">5. The fourth step involves, depositing either a graphene or polymeric coating on to the heat treated surface of sputtered aluminum. The surface texture of the heat treated sputtered aluminum film helps to better adhere the graphene or polymeric coating to protect the surface from corrosion.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Graphene can be applied in any suitable manner, such as by spray coating, and may be coated one atomic layer thick.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a schematic sectional view of a coated surface of an Mg alloy frame <b>700</b> according an embodiment described above is depicted.

Deposition of Aluminum Oxide and Cerium Oxide</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As discussed above, an Mg alloy stent frame may advantageously be coated with one or more alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide. Aluminum oxide provides good corrosion resistance to Mg alloys, but tends to crack when subjected to stress, which occurs during crimping or deployment of a stent frame or during in vivo fatigue of the stent frame. Cerium oxide can also act as a corrosion inhibitor for Mg alloys and, unlike aluminum oxide, may have self-healing properties. However, coating Mg alloys with cerium has presented challenges. For example, cerium nitrate conversion coatings are flaky and do not adhere well to the surface of Mg alloy. By way of further example, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium oxide is typically performed at high temperatures that may cause vaporization of the Mg alloy during the ALD process.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described herein, an Mg alloy stent frame may be coated with aluminum oxide, for example by ALD at sufficiently low temperatures to avoid appreciable Mg alloy vaporization, and then the aluminum oxide-coated Mg alloy may be coated with cerium oxide, for example by ALD, because the aluminum-oxide will prevent Mg alloy vaporization. The combination of the corrosion resistant properties and low temperature deposition process of aluminum oxide and the corrosion resistant and self-healing properties of cerium oxide can provide an effective corrosion resistant coating to Mg alloy stent frames to delay biodegradation of the frames.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Prior to coating aluminum oxide and cerium oxide on the Mg alloy, the Mg alloy may be HF conversion coated or coated with aluminum and heat treated; e.g., as described above. Alternatively, the Mg alloy may be coated with any other suitable material or materials prior to coating with aluminum oxide and cerium oxide.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, an Mg alloy frame is coated with aluminum oxide prior to coating with cerium oxide. As discussed above, aluminum oxide ALD can occur at temperatures less than 150&#xb0; C., such as less than 100&#xb0; C., and once deposited should prevent Mg vaporization at higher temperatures. Accordingly, cerium oxide may be deposited an aluminum oxide coated Mg alloy frame by, for example, ALD at temperatures of about 300&#xb0; C. without concern for Mg alloy vaporization.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide are deposited on an Mg alloy or on a coating that is on an Mg alloy. Each layer of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide can have any suitable thickness, such as about 5 nm or more, 20 nm or more, or about 50 nm. In some embodiments, one or more layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide have a thickness of 10 nm or less, such as from about 3 nm to about 7 nm, or about 5 nm. In some embodiments, one or more layer of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide has a thickness in a range from about 5 nm to about 60 nm. Typically, the total combined thickness of the aluminum oxide layers and the cerium oxide layers will be 100 nm or less. In some embodiments, the coatings are applied stepwise to have either 50 nm of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>followed by 50 nm of CeO<sub>2 </sub>or in the reverse order. A three-layer coating of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;CeO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is another embodiment contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For purposes of illustration, a schematic sectional view of an embodiment of a coated surface of an Mg alloy frame <b>800</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.

Protective Layer or Layers of Magnesium</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As discussed above, one or more protective layers of magnesium may be advantageously placed over or about an Mg alloy stent frame. Magnesium has a slower degradation rate than Mg alloys, but has mechanical properties that are not particularly suitable for use in stent frames. In contrast, Mg alloys have more suitably mechanical properties but tend to corrode more quickly than magnesium. As discussed above AE or WE series Mg alloys, which are rare earth metal doped Mg alloys, have particularly good mechanical properties for use as stent frames. However, the presence of second phases at grain boundaries leads to intergranular corrosion and subsequent failure of stent frames in corrosive environments. By providing a layer of magnesium over or around an Mg alloy, such as an AE or WE Mg alloy, a combination of the desired mechanical properties of the Mg alloy and the corrosion resistance of the magnesium results.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Prior to placing a magnesium layer over or around the Mg alloy, the Mg alloy may be coated or treated as described herein. For example, the Mg alloy may be HF conversion coated, coated with aluminum and heat treated, coated with alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, coated with a polymer or graphene, or the like.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As used herein &#x201c;magnesium&#x201d; and &#x201c;pure magnesium&#x201d; are used interchangeably.

In particular, &#x201c;pure&#x201d; magnesium preferably contains less than 10 ppm iron, copper and nickel. One effective way to provide a layer of magnesium over an Mg alloy is to draw a magnesium tube over an Mg alloy tube. In addition or alternatively, the Mg alloy tube may be drawn over an inner magnesium tube. The resulting bi- or a tri-layer tube can be made into a stent frame by, for example, laser cutting. Preferably, the resulting tube comprises an Mg alloy core between inner and outer layers of magnesium, if the Mg alloy tube is not corrosion resistant treated or coated; e.g., HF conversion coated, coated with aluminum and heat treated, coated with alternating layers of aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, coated with a polymer or graphene, or the like.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments a tri-layer tube is formed by drawing an Mg alloy tube over an Mg tube to form a pre-tube having an inner layer of Mg.
