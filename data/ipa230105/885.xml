INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a method, compounds and composition for managing symptoms in lactose-intolerant, IBS patients.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a clinically heterogeneous, functional bowel disorder with chronic symptoms such as abdominal pain, altered bowel movement, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, and fatigue. Routine clinical tests on patients typically show no abnormalities, although their bowels may be more sensitive to certain stimuli, such as balloon insufflation testing. The worldwide prevalence of IBS is about 10-20% but may be higher in certain countries. The causes of IBS are unknown but disruptions of the brain-gut axis, acute gastrointestinal infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, antibiotic usage and intestinal dysbiosis are thought to be important risk factors (Kim et al. <i>Digest. Dis. Sci. </i>57, 3213 (2012)). Many patients appear to have a lower abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium </i>in their faeces than healthy controls (Pittayanon et al. <i>Gastroenterology </i>157, 97 (2019)). Other risk factors are young age, prolonged fever, anxiety, and depression. Certain patients exhibit signs of chronic low-grade inflammation but there are otherwise little or no observable clinical manifestations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patients with IBS are more likely to report intolerance to dairy products than healthy individuals (Yang et al. <i>Alim. Pharm. Therap. </i>39, 302 (2014)). Also, it has been proposed that malabsorption of easily fermented carbohydrates (such as lactose in patients with lactase deficiency) is a cause of IBS in many patients. The mechanism underlying the link between IBS and food intolerance is uncertain. However, some studies suggest a shared aetiology involving both psychological (e.g. anxiety) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (e.g. altered gut transit, visceral hypersensitivity). Lactose intolerance occurs because lactose is inefficiently digested in the small intestines. This is due to reduced expression or impaired activity of the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which is produced by the cells that line the small intestine. Beta-galactosidase breaks down lactose into two sugars; glucose and galactose, which are then transported across the cell membrane and absorbed into the bloodstream. If beta-galactosidase is not present, or not present in sufficient levels, undigested lactose passes through the small intestine into the large intestine. Here, many different bacteria such as <i>Escherichia </i>and <i>Clostridium </i>have the capacity to metabolize lactose, which they convert to acids and gasses. Hence, undigested lactose can lead to increased production of gas in the colon. In addition, undigested lactose can affect the osmotic load in the colon and change colonic motility. Collectively, these events are likely to lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, cramping, bloating and abdominal pain. In fact, 33-97% of individuals with lactose intolerance do report these symptoms after dairy consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, there is no universally accepted therapy for the treatment of lactose intolerance. However, existing strategies for management of the conditions include avoidance of lactose-containing dairy foods (milks, soft cheeses and ice creams) and consuming lactase prior to a meal containing lactose. Although restricting dietary lactose may improve gastrointestinal complaints, long-term effects of a diet low or free of dairy products can be of concern, since dairy products provides a package of essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, riboflavin, vitamin A and vitamin D. Dietary calcium is an important part of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals, and for many people it is not possible to achieve recommended daily calcium intakes with a dairy low or free diet. The alternative is the consumption of a limited range of expensive lactose-reduced dairy product. The consumption of lactase is effective, but it must be consumed before meals and, although uncommon, there may be serious, allergy-related side effects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While diagnosis of lactose intolerance is relatively easy using a lactose tolerance test, diagnosis of IBS is difficult. There are no reliable biomarker-based tests to diagnose IBS. Diagnosis generally involves excluding conditions that produce IBS-like symptoms and then following a procedure to categorise a patient's symptoms. Once diagnosed, patients are usually classified in accordance with the Rome IV criteria into three symptom subtypes based on stool consistency: diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D), constipation predominant (IBS-C), and mixed subtype (IBS-M) with alternating episodes of both diarrhoea and constipation. Diagnosing patients who are lactose intolerant and who suffer from IBS is even more difficult because exclusion of lactose intolerance is part of the procedure for diagnosing IBS.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Management of IBS symptoms generally focuses on attempting to relieve symptoms. Interventions take various forms such as dietary adjustments, probiotics, antibiotics, medication, and psychological interventions. However, most treatments are unsatisfactory and most patients continue to experience abdominal pain, altered bowel movements, bloating, fatigue, and other symptoms. A recent development in IBS treatment has been the low FODMAP diet. This diet requires patients to restrict the intake of FODMAP carbohydrates. These are Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols which are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, osmotically active, and fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen. Adherence to this diet has resulted in symptom improvements for some IBS patients. A low FODMAP diet should remove or reduce lactose in the diet and therefore should help lactose intolerant, IBS patient manage their symptoms. However, some of the FODMAP carbohydrates are beneficial fibres, and foods that contain them are common, highly nutritious fruits, vegetables and legumes. Further, removal of dairy products has long term nutritional consequences. Also, it is very difficult to comply with the low FODMAP diet over longer periods.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been proposed as a possible approach to manage symptoms of IBS (WO 2016/066175). HMOs are a heterogeneous mixture of soluble glycans found in human milk. They are the third most abundant solid component after lactose and lipids in human milk and are present in concentrations of 5-25 g/I (Bode:Human milk oligosaccharides and their beneficial effects, in: Handbook of dietary and nutritional aspects of human breast milk (Zibadi et al., eds.), pp. 515-31, Wageningen Academic Publishers (2013)). HMOs are resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis in the small intestine and are thus largely undigested and unabsorbed and reach the colon intact. Most of the HMOs that reach the colon serve as substrates to shape the gut ecosystem by selectively stimulating the growth of specific bacteria. HMOs are believed to substantially modulate the infant gut microbiota and play a decisive role in the differences in the microbiota of formula-fed and breast-fed infants. These differences include the predominance of <i>Bifidobacterium </i>in the gut of breast-fed infants compared to a more diverse gut microbiota in formula-fed infants. This is viewed as beneficial for the infant because strains of <i>Bifidobacterium </i>species are believed to have a positive effect on gut health.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, HMOs contain lactose at their reducing end; usually bounded to one or more &#x3b2;-N-acetyl-lactosaminyl, &#x3b2;-lacto-N-biosyl, &#x3b1; L-fucopyranosyl and/or an &#x3b1;-N-acetyl-neuraminyl (sialyl) moieties. Further, industrial HMOs are generally produced by fermentation where lactose is used a feed solution. Consequently, industrially produced HMOs contain certain amounts of free lactose and their use in the management of symptoms of lactose-intolerant, IBS patients is counter-intuitive.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there remains a need for methods and compounds for the management of IBS symptoms in lactose-intolerant, IBS patients; particularly methods and compounds which permit the patients to include lactose-containing products in their diet.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect of the invention relates to a human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) for use in:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">prophylactically reducing gastrointestinal IBS symptom severity and/or symptom occurrence in a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">reintroducing a source of lactose into the diet of a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient while prophylactically reducing gastrointestinal IBS symptom severity and/or symptom occurrence in the IBS patient, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">reducing the severity and/or occurrence of non-gastrointestinal symptoms in a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">A second aspect of the invention relates to a synthetic composition for use in:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0015">prophylactically reducing gastrointestinal IBS symptom severity and/or symptom occurrence in a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0016">reintroducing a source of lactose into the diet of a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient while prophylactically reducing gastrointestinal IBS symptom severity and/or symptom occurrence in the IBS patient, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0017">reducing the severity and/or occurrence of non-gastrointestinal symptoms in a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient, the composition comprising at least one human milk oligosaccharide (HMO).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">Preferably the synthetic composition contains an amount of 1 g to 15 g of the HMO; more preferably 2 g to 10 g.

Further, the administration of the HMOs permits reintroduction of sources of lactose into the diet of the lactose-intolerant, IBS patient. It has also been surprisingly found that the administration of HMOs to a lactose-intolerant, IBS patient reduces the severity and/or occurrence of non-gastrointestinal symptoms in the patient. Therefore, the patient is not only able to better manage IBS symptoms, but may also be able to reintroduce sources of lactose or increase consumption of sources of lactose such as dairy.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039">The HMOs also preferentially increase the abundance of bifidobacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of the patient, in particular bifidobacteria of the <i>B. adolescentis </i>phylogenetic group, <i>Bifidobacterium longum </i>and/or <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i>. The <i>Bifidobacterium longum </i>can be a <i>Bifidobacterium longum longum </i>or a <i>Bifidobacterium longum infantis</i>. These bacteria produce metabolites such as lactate and the short chain fatty acid acetate which in turn can be converted into butyrate by butyrate-producing bacteria. The increase in short chain fatty acids improves digestive health and nourishes the intestinal barrier. A poor intestinal barrier may be a cause of IBS symptoms. Further the increase of bifidobacteria could lead to higher activity of beta-galactosidase, and hence better digestion of the undigested lactose in the colon. In addition, since bifidobacteria are able to inhibit the growth of hydrogen producers such as <i>Escherichia </i>and <i>Clostridium</i>, this shifts the bacterial digestion of lactose away from hydrogen fermentation. This reduces symptoms of lactose intolerance such as excessive gas production.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040">In this specification, the following terms have the following meanings:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0041">&#x201c;<i>Bifidobacterium </i>of the <i>B. adolescentis </i>phylogenetic group&#x201d; means a bacterium selected from a group consisting of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, Bifidobacterium </i>dentum and <i>Bifidobacterium </i>stercoris (Duranti et al. Appl. <i>Environ. Microbiol. </i>79, 336 (2013), Bottacini et al. Microbial Cell Fact. 13:S4 (2014)). Preferably, a <i>Bifidobacterium </i>of the <i>B. adolescentis </i>phylogenetic group is <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis </i>and/or <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. </i></p><p id="p-0034" num="0042">&#x201c;Effective amount&#x201d; means an amount of an HMO sufficient to render a desired outcome in a human. An effective amount can be administered in one or more doses to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043">&#x201c;Enteral administration&#x201d; means any conventional form for delivery of a composition to a patient that causes the deposition of the composition in the gastrointestinal tract (including the stomach). Methods of enteral administration include feeding through a naso-gastric tube or jejunum tube, oral, sublingual and rectal.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044">&#x201c;Human milk oligosaccharide&#x201d; or &#x201c;HMO&#x201d; means a complex carbohydrate found in human breast milk (Urashima et al.: Milk Oligosaccharides. Nova Science Publisher (2011); Chen Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 72, 113 (2015)). The HMOs have a core structure comprising a lactose unit at the reducing end that can be elongated by one or more &#x3b2;-N-acetyl-lactosaminyl and/or one or &#x3b2;-more lacto-N-biosyl units, and which core structure can be substituted by an &#x3b1; L-fucopyranosyl and/or an &#x3b1;-N-acetyl-neuraminyl (sialyl) moiety. In this regard, the non-acidic (or neutral) HMOs are devoid of a sialyl residue, and the acidic HMOs have at least one sialyl residue in their structure. The non-acidic (or neutral) HMOs can be fucosylated or non-fucosylated. Examples of such neutral non-fucosylated HMOs include lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), lacto-N-neohexaose (LNnH), para-lacto-N-neohexaose (pLNnH), para-lacto-N-hexaose (pLNH) and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH).

Examples of acidic HMOs include 3&#x2032;-sialyllactose (3&#x2032;-SL), 6&#x2032;-sialyllactose (6&#x2032;-SL), 3-fucosyl-3&#x2032;-sialyllactose (FSL), LST a, fucosyl-LST a (FLST a), LST b, fucosyl-LST b (FLST b), LST c, fucosyl-LST c (FLST c), sialyl-LNH (SLNH), sialyl-lacto-N-hexaose (SLNH), sialyl-lacto-N-neohexaose I (SLNH-I), sialyl-lacto-N-neohexaose II (SLNH-1 I) and disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046">&#x201c;Irritable bowel syndrome&#x201d; (abbreviated as IBS) means a functional bowel disorder in which recurrent abdominal pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habits. Disordered bowel habits are typically present (i.e., constipation, diarrhoea or a mix of constipation and diarrhoea), as are symptoms of abdominal bloating/distension.

For example, the nutritional composition can be a food composition, a rehydration solution, a medical food or food for special medical purposes, a nutritional supplement and the like. The nutritional composition can contain sources of protein, lipids and/or digestible carbohydrates and can be in powdered or liquid forms. The composition can be designed to be the sole source of nutrition or as a nutritional supplement.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">Suitable protein sources include milk proteins, soy protein, rice protein, pea protein and oat protein, or mixtures thereof. Milk proteins can be in the form of milk protein concentrates, milk protein isolates, whey protein or casein, or mixtures of both. The protein can be whole protein or hydrolysed protein, either partially hydrolysed or extensively hydrolysed. Hydrolysed protein offers the advantage of easier digestion which can be important for humans with inflamed or compromised GI tracts. The protein can also be provided in the form of free amino acids. The protein can comprise about 5% to about 30% of the energy of the nutritional composition, normally about 10% to 20%. Ideally, the source of protein does not include excessive amounts of lactose.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">The protein source can be a source of glutamine, threonine, cysteine, serine, proline, or a combination of these amino acids. The glutamine source can be a glutamine dipeptide and/or a glutamine enriched protein. Glutamine can be included due to the use of glutamine by enterocytes as an energy source. Threonine, serine and proline are important amino acids for the production of mucin. Mucin coats the GI tract and can improve intestinal barrier function and mucosal healing. Cysteine is a major precursor of glutathione, which is key for the antioxidant defences of the body.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">Suitable digestible carbohydrates include maltodextrin, hydrolysed or modified starch or corn starch, glucose polymers, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup, rice-derived carbohydrates, pea-derived carbohydrates, potato-derived carbohydrates, tapioca, sucrose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, honey, sugar alcohols (e.g. maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol), or mixtures thereof. Preferably the composition is reduced in or free from added lactose or other FODMAP carbohydrates. Generally digestible carbohydrates provide about 35% to about 55% of the energy of the nutritional composition. A suitable digestible carbohydrate is a low dextrose equivalent (DE) maltodextrin.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">Suitable lipids include medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and long chain triglycerides (LCT). Preferably the lipid is a mixture of MCTs and LCTs. For example, MCTs can comprise about 30% to about 70% by weight of the lipids, more specifically about 50% to about 60% by weight. MCTs offer the advantage of easier digestion which can be important for humans with inflamed or compromised GI tracts. Generally, the lipids provide about 35% to about 50% of the energy of the nutritional composition. The lipids can contain essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). Preferably these polyunsaturated fatty acids provide less than about 30% of total energy of the lipid source.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0068">Suitable sources of long chain triglycerides are rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, palm oil, soy oil, milk fat, corn oil, high oleic oils, and soy lecithin. Fractionated coconut oils are a suitable source of medium chain triglycerides. The lipid profile of the nutritional composition is preferably designed to have a polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) ratio of about 4:1 to about 10:1. For example, the n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio can be about 6:1 to about 9:1.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">The nutritional composition may also include vitamins and minerals. If the nutritional composition is intended to be a sole source of nutrition, it preferably includes a complete vitamin and mineral profile. Examples of vitamins include vitamins A, B-complex (such as B1, B2, B6 and B12), C, D, E and K, niacin and acid vitamins such as pantothenic acid, folic acid and biotin. Examples of minerals include calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, iodine, copper, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, chromium, molybdenum, selenium, nickel, tin, silicon, vanadium and boron.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0070">The nutritional composition can also include a carotenoid such as lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene. The total amount of carotenoid included can vary from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml. Lutein can be included in an amount of from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, preferably from about 0.044 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of lutein. Lycopene can be included in an amount from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, preferably about 0.0185 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of lycopene. Beta-carotene can comprise from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 mg/ml, for example about 0.034 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of beta-carotene.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">The nutritional composition preferably also contains reduced concentrations of sodium; for example, from about 300 mg/I to about 400 mg/I. The remaining electrolytes can be present in concentrations set to meet needs without providing an undue renal solute burden on kidney function. For example, potassium is preferably present in a range of about 1180 to about 1300 mg/I; and chloride is preferably present in a range of about 680 to about 800 mg/I.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">The nutritional composition can also contain various other conventional ingredients such as preservatives, emulsifying agents, thickening agents, buffers, fibres and prebiotics (e.g. fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides), probiotics (e.g. <i>B. animalis </i>subsp. <i>lactis </i>BB-12, <i>B. lactis </i>HNO19, <i>B. lactis </i>Bi07, <i>B. infantis </i>ATCC 15697, <i>L. rhamnosus </i>GG, <i>L. rhamnosus </i>HNOOI, <i>L. acidophilus </i>LA-5, <i>L. acidophilus </i>NCFM, <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT5716, <i>B. longum </i>BB536, <i>B. longum </i>AH1205, <i>B. longum </i>AH1206, <i>B. breve </i>M-16V, <i>L. reuteri </i>ATCC 55730, <i>L. reuteri </i>ATCC PTA-6485, <i>L. reuteri </i>DSM 17938), antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compounds including tocopherols, carotenoids, ascorbate/vitamin C, ascorbyl palmitate, polyphenols, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase (melon), other bioactive factors (e.g. growth hormones, cytokines, TFG-&#x3b2;), colorants, flavours, and stabilisers, lubricants, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">The nutritional composition can be formulated as a soluble powder, a liquid concentrate, or a ready-to-use formulation. The composition can be fed to a human in need via a nasogastric tube or orally. Various flavours and other additives can also be present.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The nutritional compositions can be prepared by any commonly used manufacturing techniques for preparing nutritional compositions in solid or liquid form. For example, the composition can be prepared by combining various feed solutions. A protein-in-fat feed solution can be prepared by heating and mixing the lipid source and then adding an emulsifier (e.g. lecithin), fat soluble vitamins, and at least a portion of the protein source while heating and stirring. A carbohydrate feed solution is then prepared by adding minerals, trace and ultra-trace minerals, thickening or suspending agents to water while heating and stirring. The resulting solution is held for 10 minutes with continued heat and agitation before adding carbohydrates (e.g. the HMOs and digestible carbohydrate sources). The resulting feed solutions are then blended together while heating and agitating and the pH adjusted to 6.6-7.0, after which the composition is subjected to high-temperature short-time processing during which the composition is heat treated, emulsified and homogenized, and then allowed to cool. Water soluble vitamins and ascorbic acid are added, the pH is adjusted to the desired range if necessary, flavours are added, and water is added to achieve the desired total solid level.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">For a liquid product, the resulting solution can then be aseptically packed to form an aseptically packaged nutritional composition. In this form, the nutritional composition can be in ready-to-feed or concentrated liquid form. Alternatively, the composition can be spray-dried and processed and packaged as a reconstitutable powder.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">When the nutritional product is a ready-to-feed nutritional liquid, it may be preferred that the total concentration of HMOs in the liquid, by weight of the liquid, is from about 0.1% to about 1.5%, including from about 0.2% to about 1.0%, for example from about 0.3% to about 0.7%. When the nutritional product is a concentrated nutritional liquid, it may be preferred that the total concentration of HMOs in the liquid, by weight of the liquid, is from about 0.2% to about 3.0%, including from about 0.4% to about 2.0%, for example from about 0.6% to about 1.5%.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">In another embodiment, the nutritional composition is in a unit dosage form. The unit dosage form can contain an acceptable food-grade carrier, e.g. phosphate buffered saline solution, mixtures of ethanol in water, water and emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, as well as various wetting agents or excipients. The unit dosage form can also contain other materials that do not produce an adverse, allergic or otherwise unwanted reaction when administered to a human. The carriers and other materials can include solvents, dispersants, coatings, absorption promoting agents, controlled release agents, and one or more inert excipients, such as starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents. Preferably the unit dosage form comprises primarily HMOs with a minimum amount of binders and/or excipients. Unit dosage forms are particularly suitable when nutritionally incomplete or not intended as a sole source of nutrition.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">A unit dosage form can be administered orally, e.g. as a tablet, capsule, or pellet containing a predetermined amount of the mixture, or as a powder or granules containing a predetermined concentration of the mixture or a gel, paste, solution, suspension, emulsion, syrup, bolus, electuary, or slurry, in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, containing a predetermined concentration of the mixture. An orally administered composition can include one or more binders, lubricants, inert diluents, flavouring agents, and humectants. An orally administered composition such as a tablet can optionally be coated and can be formulated to provide sustained, delayed or controlled release of the HMO.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">A unit dosage form can also be administered by naso-gastric tube or direct infusion into the GI tract or stomach.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0080">A unit dosage form can also include therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, probiotics, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">The proper dosage of a nutritional composition for a human can be determined in a conventional manner, based upon factors such as the concentration of HMO, the human's condition, immune status, body weight and age. In some cases, the dosage will be such that the HMO is delivered at a concentration similar to that found in human breast milk. The required amount of HMO would generally be in the range from about 1 g to about 15 g per day, in certain embodiments from about 2 g to about 10 g per day, for example about 3 g to about 7 g per day. Appropriate dose regimes can be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">In further embodiment, the HMO can be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. phosphate buffered saline solution, mixtures of ethanol in water, water and emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, as well as various wetting agents or excipients. The pharmaceutical composition can also contain other materials that do not produce an adverse, allergic or otherwise unwanted reaction when administered to a human. The carriers and other materials can include solvents, dispersants, coatings, absorption promoting agents, controlled release agents, and one or more inert excipients, such as starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally, e.g. as a tablet, capsule, or pellet containing a predetermined amount, or as a powder or granules containing a predetermined concentration or a gel, paste, solution, suspension, emulsion, syrup, bolus, electuary, or slurry, in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, containing a predetermined concentration.
