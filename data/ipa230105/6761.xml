These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support configuration signaling of demodulation reference signal and transmission mode. Generally, the described techniques provide for a user equipment (UE) and a base station to perform joint dynamic signaling of a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) configuration and a transmission mode indication. The UE may receive radio resource control (RRC) signaling from the base station indicating a set of transmission mode indicators or transmission mode options and a set of DMRS configurations corresponding to each one of the transmission modes from a set of transmission modes. In some examples, the base station may transmit additional control signaling to indicate a transmission mode or a combination of transmission mode indicators and DMRS configuration parameters to signal one or more DMRS configurations coupled to or jointly with the transmission mode. The base station may transmit the information in control signaling dynamically, such as via a medium access control-control element (MAC-CE), a downlink control information (DCI) message, or the like. The UE may identify a DMRS configuration and a transmission mode based on the additional control signaling. In some cases, the UE may receive one or more DMRSs from multiple transmission reception points (TRPs) based on the joint DMRS configuration and transmission mode configuration. The UE may use the transmission mode indicated in the joint DMRS configuration and transmission mode configuration to receive one or more data messages from the TRPs transmitted using the indicated transmission mode. The UE may demodulate and decode the data messages based on, or assisted by, the received one or more DMRSs depending on the transmission mode or scenario.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method for wireless communication at a UE is described. The method may include receiving, from a base station, first control signaling identifying a set of transmission mode indicators or transmission mode options and a set of corresponding DMRS configurations associated with each transmission mode of a set of transmission modes, the set of transmission modes to be addressed by a UE receiver to receive one or more data messages from multiple TRPs, receiving second control signaling indicating a transmission mode of the set of transmission modes or a combination of transmission mode indicators and a combination of one or more DMRS configuration parameters to signal one or more DMRS configurations corresponding to the indicated transmission mode, identifying, based on the transmission mode indicators and the one or more DMRS configuration parameters, at least one DMRS configuration of the set of DMRS configurations and the transmission mode of the set of transmission modes, receiving one or more DMRSs from the multiple TRPs according to the identified at least one DMRS configuration, and receiving, from the multiple TRPs, the one or more data messages based on the indicated transmission mode and the received one or more DMRSs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An apparatus for wireless communication at a UE is described.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some wireless communications systems, a user equipment (UE) may communicate with other devices, such as transmission and reception points (TRPs), using different communication schemes to increase spectral efficiency or reliability of downlink transmissions. For example, a UE may communicate with TRPs using time division multiplexing (TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), or spatial division multiplexing (SDM) communication schemes or based on dynamic TRP switching. The UE may additionally or alternatively implement a single frequency network (SFN) communication scheme with or without Doppler shift pre-compensation in which a transmission signal may be simultaneously transmitted on a same resources over multiple beams or channels from different TRPs (e.g., for a high speed train (HST) scenario). The UE may transmit reference signals establish or otherwise support data communications with the TRPs. In some cases, a TRP or a base station may dynamically configure (or reconfigure) a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) to be assumed for PDSCH reception at the UE, such as by transmitting the corresponding control signaling that dynamically conveys DMRS configuration or reconfiguration. Dynamic DMRS configuration signaling may allow DMRS configuration adaptation to a single TRP or multi-TRP channel and reception conditions. DMRS adaptation may be performed per transmission mode or between dynamically switched transmission modes. An RRC configured DMRS may become outdated (e.g., or not optimally defined) as channel or reception conditions that the UE experiences change or may be not aligned with the switched transmission mode (e.g., which may change the equivalent channel characteristics), which may cause inefficient communication or a limited communication quality between the UE and one or more TRPs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described herein, a UE may receive an RRC configuration for a set of transmission mode options and a set of DMRS configurations with possible associations between them after establishing a connection with a base station. The UE may receive a dynamic transmission mode and DMRS configuration indication or signaling from the set of RRC configured transmission modes and DMRS configuration options based on medium access control-control element (MAC-CE) or downlink control information (DCI) message dynamically indicating, configuring, or activating a transmission mode (e.g., TDM, SDM, FDM, or SFN mode with or without Doppler shift pre-compensation) and a corresponding DMRS configuration. The UE may use the indicated transmission mode to receive data messages from multiple TRPs. In some examples, the adjustment of a DMRS configuration may include one or more parameters, for example an additional DMRS position parameter (dmrs-AdditionalPosition) for one or more DMRS configurations used on the UE side per transmission mode, per TRP, or both, which may depend on the transmission mode option, channel characteristics, reception SNR, UE speed, UE location, or the like.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the control signaling is a MAC-CE, the base station may dynamically activate, switch, or reconfigure a combination of a transmission mode and the corresponding one or more DMRS configurations. In some cases, each DMRS configuration may be described using one or more different DMRS parameters. For example, the MAC-CE may switch, activate, or reactivate a configuration bundle defined by the RRC configuration. Since the base station provides the RRC configuration once and the MAC-CE based signaling addresses a specific combination of one or more indices (e.g., rather than configuration parameters explicitly), the DMRS configuration may be defined according to a relatively long list of parameters. In some examples, such as if a DCI message addresses explicit DMRS parameter signaling, the UE may use minimum parameters to reduce overhead related to the DCI message. In some cases, such as for DCI based signaling of a joint combination of transmission mode and DMRS configuration, a base station may signal a combination index from a defined list of transmission mode and DMRS configuration options. The base station may provide the DMRS configuration in terms of multiple DMRS parameters.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the control signaling is based on a DCI message with a specific DCI field having a limited length, DMRS re-configuration signaling may be performed in terms of relatively critical DMRS parameters (e.g., some minimum list of configuration options), and in this case, the base station may dynamically signal the additional DMRS position parameter for each TRP or a single parameter for both TRPs, corresponding to the transmission mode indicated for each resource allocation for the data messages. The base station may include the DMRS and the transmission mode parameters in one or more fields of the DCI message. In some cases, whether the UE uses more than one DMRS configuration simultaneously per allocation (e.g., a different DMRS configuration per TRP) and receives corresponding DCI based signaling of more than one DMRS configuration per allocation may be based on a UE capability. The UE may receive one or more DMRSs from the TRPs according to the indicated DMRS configuration or configurations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although reference is made to SFN schemes herein, the discussed techniques may be also be referred to as single frequency communication schemes, or be or use other communication schemes that use a single frequency signal to communicate with (transmit to or receive from) multiple transmitters.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Aspects of the disclosure are further described in the context of communication scheme diagrams, resource diagrams, configuration diagrams, and a process flow. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to dynamic configuration signaling of demodulation reference signal and transmission mode.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports dynamic configuration signaling of demodulation reference signal and transmission mode in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or a New Radio (NR) network. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The base stations <b>105</b> may be dispersed throughout a geographic area to form the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. The base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may wirelessly communicate via one or more communication links <b>125</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide a coverage area <b>110</b> over which the UEs <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may establish one or more communication links <b>125</b>.

The UEs <b>115</b> may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. Some example UEs <b>115</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> , the base stations <b>105</b>, or network equipment (e.g., core network nodes, relay devices, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, or other network equipment), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b>, or with one another, or both. For example, the base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through one or more backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over the backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>), or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>), or both. In some examples, the backhaul links <b>120</b> may be or include one or more wireless links.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">One or more of the base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by a person having ordinary skill in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or a giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or other suitable terminology.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A UE <b>115</b> may include or may be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client, among other examples. A UE <b>115</b> may also include or may be referred to as a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may include or be referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or a machine type communications (MTC) device, among other examples, which may be implemented in various objects such as appliances, or vehicles, meters, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> that may sometimes act as relays as well as the base stations <b>105</b> and the network equipment including macro eNBs or gNBs, small cell eNBs or gNBs, or relay base stations, among other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with one another via one or more communication links <b>125</b> over one or more carriers. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage via one or more cells, for example a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier) and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID), or others). In some examples, a cell may also refer to a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> or a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical communication entity operates. Such cells may range from smaller areas (e.g., a structure, a subset of structure) to larger areas depending on various factors such as the capabilities of the base station <b>105</b>. For example, a cell may be or include a building, a subset of a building, or exterior spaces between or overlapping with geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider supporting the macro cell. A small cell may be associated with a lower-powered base station <b>105</b>, as compared with a macro cell, and a small cell may operate in the same or different (e.g., licensed, unlicensed) frequency bands as macro cells. Small cells may provide unrestricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider or may provide restricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> having an association with the small cell (e.g., the UEs <b>115</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG), the UEs <b>115</b> associated with users in a home or office). A base station <b>105</b> may support one or multiple cells and may also support communications over the one or more cells using one or multiple component carriers.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, a carrier may support multiple cells, and different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., MTC, narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)) that may provide access for different types of devices.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have similar frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have different frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may, in some examples, not be aligned in time. The techniques described herein may be used for either synchronous or asynchronous operations.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Some UEs <b>115</b> , such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay such information to a central server or application program that makes use of the information or presents the information to humans interacting with the application program. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines or other devices. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples, half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for the UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving deep sleep mode when not engaging in active communications, operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications), or a combination of these techniques. For example, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a defined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or resource blocks (RBs)) within a carrier, within a guard-band of a carrier, or outside of a carrier.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some systems, the D2D communication link <b>135</b> may be an example of a communication channel, such as a sidelink communication channel, between vehicles (e.g., UEs <b>115</b> ). In some examples, vehicles may communicate using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, or some combination of these. A vehicle may signal information related to traffic conditions, signal scheduling, weather, safety, emergencies, or any other information relevant to a V2X system. In some examples, vehicles in a V2X system may communicate with roadside infrastructure, such as roadside units, or with the network via one or more network nodes (e.g., base stations <b>105</b>) using vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications, or with both.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MIME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to IP services <b>150</b> for one or more network operators. The IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band, or in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between the UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some examples, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a device. The propagation of EHF transmissions, however, may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. The techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally or alternatively, an antenna panel may support radio frequency beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may use MIMO communications to exploit multipath signal propagation and increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers. Such techniques may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams (e.g., different codewords). Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may use beam sweeping techniques as part of beam forming operations. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays (e.g., antenna panels) to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a signal according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by a transmitting device, such as a base station <b>105</b>, or by a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for later transmission or reception by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based on a signal that was transmitted in one or more beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions and may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal that the UE <b>115</b> received with a highest signal quality or an otherwise acceptable signal quality.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some examples, transmissions by a device (e.g., by a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may be performed using multiple beam directions, and the device may use a combination of digital precoding or radio frequency beamforming to generate a combined beam for transmission (e.g., from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>). The UE <b>115</b> may report feedback that indicates precoding weights for one or more beam directions, and the feedback may correspond to a configured number of beams across a system bandwidth or one or more sub-bands. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit a reference signal (e.g., a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)), which may be precoded or unprecoded. The UE <b>115</b> may provide feedback for beam selection, which may be a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or codebook-based feedback (e.g., a multi-panel type codebook, a linear combination type codebook, a port selection type codebook). Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>) or for transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>) may try multiple receive configurations (e.g., directional listening) when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets (e.g., different directional listening weight sets) applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive configurations or receive directions. In some examples, a receiving device may use a single receive configuration to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive configuration may be aligned in a beam direction determined based on listening according to different receive configuration directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or otherwise acceptable signal quality based on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the RRC protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback is one technique for increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise conditions). In some examples, a device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some examples, TRPs, base stations <b>105</b>, or both may communicate with one or more UEs <b>115</b> using a communication scheme, such as an SDM scheme, an FDM scheme, a TDM scheme, or a combination. In some examples, multiple TRPs may perform joint transmissions to the UE <b>115</b> using an SFN scheme, which may also be referred to as a single frequency communication scheme and is described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The SFN scheme based transmission in downlink may be with or without Doppler shift pre-compensation. In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may use an SFN scheme if the UE <b>115</b> has relatively high mobility, such as in an HST scenario. A wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support the transmission of reference signals (e.g., DMRSs) to increase an efficiency and a reliability of communications between wireless devices. A reference signal may be transmitted over communication resources in accordance with a reference signal configuration. A base station <b>105</b> may determine configurations for the different reference signals. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may select a DMRS configuration for a UE <b>115</b> and may signal the selected DMRS configuration to a UE <b>115</b> using control signaling, such as RRC signaling. In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may be RRC configured with a fixed pilot pattern for a DMRS that is based on a DMRS type, a number of DMRS positions, and other DMRS and allocation parameters. The RRC configured DMRS may become outdated (e.g., not aligned with the current channel characteristics and reception conditions) as channel or reception conditions that the UE <b>115</b> experiences change or may not be aligned with the switched transmission mode (e.g., which may change the equivalent channel characteristics). That is, the DMRS configuration may indicate a surplus of pilots (e.g., excessive DMRS density in time or frequency) or the pilot configuration may not allocate a sufficient number of pilots (e.g., too low DMRS density), which may cause an increased channel estimation error or an increased DMRS overhead and, as a result, inefficient communication between the UE <b>115</b> and one or more TRPs. Further, the DMRS configuration and transmission mode related to the transmission scheme may be configured independently or may be addressed using some joint configuration that assumes a specific combinations of transmission modes and the corresponding DMRS configuration options.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> may support joint dynamic signaling of a DMRS configuration and a transmission mode indication (e.g., HST-SFN transmission mode indication or multi TRP transmission mode in general).

In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may indicate a capability to support joint dynamic signaling of a DMRS configuration and a transmission mode indication or option to the base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit additional control signaling based on the capability signaling. The additional control signaling may dynamically indicate a transmission mode or a combination of transmission mode indicators and DMRS configuration parameters to signal one or more DMRS configurations coupled to or jointly with the transmission mode. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit the information in control signaling dynamically, such as via a MAC-CE, a DCI message, or a combination of them or the like.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may identify a DMRS configuration and a transmission mode based on the additional control signaling. The UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more DMRSs from multiple TRPs based on the joint DMRS configuration or signaling and transmission mode configuration or signaling. The UE <b>115</b> may use the transmission mode indicated in the joint DMRS configuration and transmission mode configuration to receive one or more data messages from the TRPs transmitted using the indicated transmission mode.

The TRPs <b>205</b> may coordinate a transmission of a downlink channel (e.g., a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), or both), an uplink channel (e.g., a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), or both). For example, an SDM scheme may involve TRP <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and TRP <b>205</b>-<i>b </i>performing a joint transmission over a same resource (e.g., over a same set of resource elements and OFDM symbols) based on transmitting different layers, such as spatial layers, with different transmission configuration indication (TCI) states.

The SFN scheme may be a type of multi-TRP or single-TRP communication scheme in which a downlink communication link <b>210</b> between a TRP <b>205</b> and a UE <b>115</b> and a downlink portion of a communication link <b>125</b> between the TRP <b>205</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may include the same frequency bands or channel. For example, TRP <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and TRP <b>205</b>-<i>b </i>may transmit a same transmission over the same downlink communication link <b>210</b> according to an SDM scheme, an FDM scheme, a TDM scheme, an SFN scheme, or the like, where the downlink transmission is associated with two or more TCI states corresponding to the two or more TRPs <b>205</b>. In other words, the downlink communication link <b>210</b> may be or be part of an &#x201c;SFNed&#x201d; downlink communication link. TRP <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and TRP <b>205</b>-<i>b </i>may perform joint transmissions to UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>according to various types of SFN communication schemes, such as an SFN communication scheme 0, an SFN communication scheme 1, or an SFN communication scheme 2, which is described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may use an SFN scheme if the UE <b>115</b> has relatively high mobility, such as in an HST scenario.

For example, the UE <b>115</b> may communicate signaling using an SDM scheme or an SFN scheme based on DMRS ports and TCI states. The UE <b>115</b> may have multiple DMRS ports, each DMRS port configured with one or more TCI states. The UE <b>115</b> may use an SFN scheme or SDM scheme for communications across multiple TCI states simultaneously using one or more CDM groups for DMRS ports related to different TRPs. For example, for an SDM scheme, the UE <b>115</b> may have a DMRS Port 0 and Port 1 associated with TCI states 1 corresponding to the first TRP and to the first CDM group and a DMRS Port 2 and 3 associated with TCI states 2 corresponding to the second TRP and to the second CDM group. The UE <b>115</b> may apply an SFN scheme to communications across TCI states 1 and 2, which may be referred to as SFNed layer 0 and SFNed layer 1 if two layers transmission is used. The UE <b>115</b> may also use an SDM scheme for PDSCH communications using DMRS ports associated with different TRPs/TCIs and allocated on the corresponding different CDM groups(e.g., DMRS Port 0, for SDM layer 0, and DMRS Port 2, for SDM layer 1). In some other examples, the UE <b>115</b> may have a DMRS Port 0 configured with TCI state 1 and DMRS ports 2 configured with TCI state 2, and a DMRS port 1 or/and 3 configured with TCI state 1 and 2. The UE <b>115</b> may apply an SFN scheme to simultaneously communications across TCI states 1 and 2 associated with DMRS Ports 1 or/and 3. The UE <b>115</b> may use an SDM scheme for communications using DMRS Port 0, DMRS Port 2,).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some examples, a network (e.g., including one or more TRPs <b>205</b>, a base station <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b> , or a combination) may support multi-TRP communication, single-TRP communication, or both. For example, as illustrated in wireless communications system <b>200</b>, TRP <b>205</b>-<i>a</i>, TRP <b>205</b>-<i>b</i>, or both may perform a joint transmission (e.g., multi-TCI or multi-TRP transmission) and signaling to UE <b>115</b>-<i>a</i>, may independently communicate with UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>(e.g., may perform a non-joint transmission or single TCI or TRP based transmission), or both. In some examples of multi-TRP communication, the TRPs <b>205</b> may communicate with the one or more UEs <b>115</b> using different communication schemes (e.g., the SDM, FDM,TDM, multi-TRP scheme, or one of the SFN schemes with or without Doppler shift pre-compensation or a single TRP/TCI based transmission with dynamic transmission point switching) to increase spectral efficiency. Two or more transmission scheme options or the corresponding transmission modes may be switched dynamically by the network depending on network loading, UE location, channel conditions, UE speed, UE type and other factors.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A wireless communications system <b>200</b> may support the transmission of reference signals to increase an efficiency and a reliability of communications between wireless devices (e.g., a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b>). Reference signals may be transmitted from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>, and vice versa. Reference signals transmitted to a UE <b>115</b> may be referred to as downlink reference signal and reference signals transmitted to a base station <b>105</b> may be referred to as uplink reference signals. Reference signals may be used by the wireless devices to determine characteristics of a channel. The characteristics of a channel may also be referred to as a channel estimate or channel conditions or channel metrics. Reference signals may include channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS), downlink DMRS, uplink DMRS, sounding reference signal (SRS), tracking reference signal (TRS), and phase tracking reference signal (PTRS).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A wireless communications system <b>200</b> may also support the reporting of information about a channel determined using reference signals. A UE <b>115</b> may use CSI-RS to determine preferred (e.g., optimal) transmission parameters for a channel, such as a preferred precoding matrix, rank, and/or modulation coding scheme (MCS). The UE <b>115</b> may determine a preferred transmission parameter based on determining that a transmission parameter will maximize a link efficiency metric (e.g., a spectral efficiency metric), based on a post-processing signal quality ratio (e.g., post-processing signal to interface plus noise ratio (SINR)) and the corresponding estimated spectral efficiency for a channel, or both. The UE <b>115</b> may indicate the preferred transmission parameters to a base station <b>105</b> in a channel state feedback (CSF) report (which may also be referred to as a channel state information (CSI) report) that may have different formats and may include a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) field that conveys a PMI, a rank indicator (RI) field that conveys an RI, a strongest layer indicator (SLI) field that conveys an SLI; and a channel quality indicator (CQI) field that conveys a CQI. The base station <b>105</b> may use the PMI and RI to determine a precoding matrix and rank to use for subsequent transmissions and the CQI to determine an MCS for subsequent transmission.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A UE <b>115</b> may use a CSI-RS transmission to determine a channel estimate that is used to assist in link adaptation&#x2014;e.g., by assisting in the adaptation of transmission parameters. The channel estimate may be used to determine a signal quality ratio (e.g., post-processing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or post-processing SINR) for the channel, a delay spread (&#x3c4;<sub>rms</sub>) for the channel or a classification of the channel (or channel type), a precoding matrix to use for communications over the channel, a rank to use for communications over the channel, or any combination thereof. A downlink DMRS transmission may also be used by a UE <b>115</b> to determine a data channel estimate that may be used to demodulate and decode transmissions received in a data channel. The channel estimate determined using the CSI-RS transmission (e.g., non-precoded reference signal with a 1D or a single symbol allocation pattern per CSI-RS port) may be different than the channel estimate determined using the downlink DMRS transmission (e.g., a precoded reference signal with a 2D allocation pattern per DMRS port). Thus, a downlink DMRS may be transmitted using resources that are associated with data resources allocated to a UE <b>115</b>. A TRS transmission may be used by a UE <b>115</b> for synchronization loops and for determination of mid and long-term characteristics of a channel, such as a Doppler frequency or Doppler shift and Doppler spread or time correlation of the channel, delay spread, and power delay profile and SNR per transmission point.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">An uplink DMRS may be used by a base station <b>105</b> to determine a channel estimate for an uplink channel between the base station and a UE <b>115</b> that transmitted the uplink DMRS (e.g., so the base station <b>105</b> can perform coherent demodulation of the PUCCH and the PUSCH). For example, each scheduled PUCCH and PUSCH may have its own DMRS, which may assist the base station <b>105</b> with demodulation and decoding. The uplink SRS may be used by a base station <b>105</b> for uplink link adaption, uplink transmission parameter selection, uplink channel characteristics estimation like delay spread, Doppler shift and Doppler spread or time correlation of the channel, uplink channel SNR and other uplink measurements, among other uses. In some examples, an uplink SRS may be used by a base station <b>105</b> to determine the uplink channel quality over a wide bandwidth so that the base station <b>105</b> can perform frequency-selective scheduling for the UE <b>115</b> that transmitted the uplink SRS.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A reference signal may be transmitted over communication resources in accordance with a reference signal configuration. A reference signal configuration may indicate which resource elements are allocated to a reference signal transmission&#x2014;a resource element allocated to a transmission of a reference signal may be referred to as a pilot resource element. A group of resource elements (e.g., contiguous or noncontiguous resource elements) within a symbol period allocated to a transmission of a reference signal may be referred to as a pilot symbol. In some cases, a reference signal configuration explicitly or implicitly indicates a temporal spacing (D<sub>t</sub>) between resource elements allocated to a reference signal; a frequency spacing (D<sub>f</sub>) between resource elements allocated to a reference signal; and a power boosting parameter (&#x3c1;<sub>p</sub>) that indicates a power for transmitting the reference signal resource element relative to a power for transmitting a data resource element. Different reference signal configurations may be associated with different combinations of temporal spacing or time domain pattern, frequency spacing or frequency domain pattern, and power boosting&#x2014;e.g., a first reference signal configuration may be associated with a first temporal spacing or pattern, a first frequency spacing or pattern, and a first power boosting, a second reference signal configuration may be associated with the second temporal spacing or pattern, the second frequency spacing or pattern, and a second power boosting, and so on.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">A base station <b>105</b> may determine configurations for the different reference signals. In some cases, a base station <b>105</b> determines a downlink or uplink DMRS configuration for a UE <b>115</b> by selecting the DMRS configuration from a limited or predefined set of DMRS configurations. The base station <b>105</b> may then signal the selected DMRS configuration to a UE <b>115</b> using control signaling or a configuration, such as RRC, DCI based, or MAC-CE based configuration signaling. In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may be semi statically RRC configured with a pilot pattern for a DMRS <b>220</b> that is defined by a DMRS type parameter, a number of DMRS positions parameter, and other DMRS or allocation related parameters. In some examples, a DMRS configuration per allocation may be done as a combination of explicit and implicit configuration. An explicit part may include DMRS type, the number of DMRS locations, first DMRS symbol location and the max number of DMRS symbols per location configuration. The explicit part of DMRS configuration may be RRC configured. An implicit part of the configuration may include predetermined DMRS symbols locations (time pattern) given the configured for DMRS RRC parameters while the locations are indicated implicitly depending among the rest on a combination of PDSCH mapping type (A or B) plus PDSCH allocation duration (symbols) which are signaled in the allocating (scheduling) DCI. A DMRS spacing in time, or a time domain DMRS pattern, may be based on a predetermined DMRS locations for a combination of a PDSCH and PUSCH mapping type and a PDSCH and PUSCH allocation duration in symbol time units (which may be signaled in a DCI message) and other DMRS or PDSCH and PUSCH related parameters. DMRS boosting may be predefined and fixed for some DCI types and RNTI combinations, and for other cases may be signaled by the allocating/scheduling DCI. In some examples, power boosting for a DMRS <b>220</b> may be determined based on a DMRS type and number of CDM groups that may not convey data. An accuracy of a channel estimate depends on a level of correlation of a channel in time and frequency, input SNR on DMRS resource elements and DMRS configuration or pattern. Channel parameters and SNR conditions may be different for different UEs <b>115</b> and may also vary in time. Thus, different DMRS configurations may be used to maximize a spectral efficiency of a link for different channel and SNR conditions.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may select a DMRS configuration option using spectral efficiency maximization criteria per given channel characteristics, such as &#x3c4;<sub>rms</sub>, Doppler characteristics of the channel (f<sub>D</sub>), and input (thermal) SNR (SNR<sub>in</sub>). The UE <b>115</b> may determine SINR values for each available downlink DMRS configuration candidate. In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may determine a preferred downlink DMRS configuration of the downlink DMRS configurations that maximized a communication efficiency metric for the channel.

For example, the UE <b>115</b> may perform MAC-CE based activation and complementary DCI based selection of one of the activated DMRS options. A base station <b>105</b> or other network entity may configure a number of DMRS configurations, such as in a DMRS configuration table, to be addressed in downlink (e.g., via RRC signaling). The DMRS configuration may account for network scheduling patterns or preferences and UE capabilities. Several DMRS configurations from the configured table may be activated by MAC-CE (synchronous, short latency). Reactivation may be done dynamically and may follow long term DMRS adaptation process. The activated DMRS options may be addressed as a code points for complementary DCI based selection (e.g., with a new DCI field, DCI type, DCI format, or a combination thereof). For each allocation, the scheduling DCI may select or otherwise signal one of the activated DMRS options. Usage of different activated DMRS options for different allocations may allow a higher flexibility for the network scheduler and an increased level of adaptation for different scheduling scenarios (e.g., slot based or mini slot based scheduling, MU-MIMO scenarios, PDSCH and downlink reference signal or other downlink logical channels multiplexing).

In some cases, DMRS resource element boosting may be predefined and fixed for some DCI types, radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) combinations, or both, or may be signaled implicitly by the allocating DCI based on implicitly signaled number of CDM groups without data.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0117">In some cases, RRC reconfiguration may be a nonsynchronous mechanism that involves several hundreds of milliseconds (ms) of latency for reconfiguration. During the reconfiguration period there may be an uncertainty on the base station <b>105</b> or network side regarding the currently addressed UE side configuration. For this reason, there may not be a practical way to convey RRC reconfiguration (e.g., DMRS adaptation) without introducing link interruption. Channel estimation accuracy may depend on the level of correlation of the channel in time and frequency, working SNR point of a UE <b>115</b>, and on the pilot grid option (e.g., used for chest 2D plot grid). Channel parameters and SNR conditions may be different per UE <b>115</b> and may vary in time depending on channel scenario, UE type and allocation scenario, such as HST scenario or non-HST scenario, whether the UE <b>115</b> is static or mobile, whether the UE <b>115</b> is relatively close to the base station <b>105</b> or residing at a cell edge (e.g., the edge of coverage area <b>110</b>-<i>a</i>), a single TRP or multi-TRP transmission with a different transmission mode option and with or without Doppler pre-compensation, and other factors. Different channel and SNR conditions and transmission mode options and scenarios may use different pilot configuration options in order to maximize spectral efficiency of a link per UE <b>115</b>. Using fixed DMRS configuration at the base station <b>105</b> may cause a trade off from the network in advance between average pilots overhead and the performance of the UE <b>115</b>. Thus, extra resource elements may be wasted for unnecessary pilots, in some cases, while in other cases UE performance may be floored due to improper pilot configuration.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> and base station may adopt an adaptive DMRS approach with UE-assisted DMRS selection and dynamic signaling of DMRS configuration per allocation or per some time period. An HST-SFN scenario that assumes multi TRP based transmission in SFN manner to a UE having a high mobility may be associated with extreme channel conditions that may be difficult to perform channel estimation for. The UE <b>115</b> and the network may use transmission techniques including SFN transmission scheme 1 and SFN transmission scheme 2 with and without Doppler shift pre-compensation. These techniques may be added to a portfolio of available options for the HST scenario, such as dynamic transmission point switching (DPS) technique with a single TRP based transmission, transparent SFN transmission with a transparent multi TRP transmission (e.g., SFN scheme 0), a multi TRP transmission with SDMFDM, TDM, or a combination thereof. The different techniques may cause different equivalent Doppler spread and Delay spread characteristics from the perspective of a UE receiver per UE location and UE speed scenario. Correspondingly, it may be beneficial to use a different DMRS configuration for similar SNR conditions, UE speed, and multi-TRP channel realization but with different transmission techniques.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may assume different HST-SFN techniques may be employed dynamically depending on UE location (e.g., between the two closest TRPs <b>205</b>), UE type (e.g., a customer premises equipment (CPE) mounted on the train, a pedestrian UE <b>115</b> on the train, or a UE <b>115</b> on the station), channel conditions, network loading, applicability of a Doppler shift pre-compensation and its accuracy, as well as other factors. The dynamic usage of different HST-SFN techniques may bring an additional potential or value for DMRS adaptation in addition to a basic concept of adaptive DMRS selection as a function of channel characteristics and SNR for a transmission technique (e.g., a single TRP transmission in sub 6 GHz). In some examples, the UE <b>115</b>, the base station <b>105</b>, or both may use an extension of a dynamic signaling approach for joint signaling of DMRS <b>220</b> with a variety of transmission techniques suggested for HST-SFN scenarios. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a joint MAC-CE based dynamic signaling of DMRS configuration and HST-SFN transmission mode indicators or a joint DCI based signaling of DMRS configuration and HST-SFN transmission mode indication to enable DMRS adaptation in conjunction with a variety of dynamically switched HST-SFN transmission modes. The UE <b>115</b> and base station <b>105</b> may perform joint MAC-CE based or DCI based dynamic signaling for DMRS adaptation with a multi-TRP transmission scenario or a single TRP transmission mode.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120">In some examples, the network, such as the base station <b>105</b>, one or more TRPs <b>205</b>, or the UE <b>115</b>, may apply a doppler shift pre-compensation for each TRP <b>205</b> or for one of the TRPs <b>205</b> based on Doppler shift signaling by a UE <b>115</b> per TRP <b>205</b>. The UE <b>115</b> may measure the Doppler shift based on a corresponding TRS and may indicate the measured Doppler shift explicitly (e.g., via Doppler shift reporting) or implicitly (e.g., based on an SRS transmission performed based on the estimated Doppler shifts per TRP <b>205</b>) to the network. Pre-compensation may be applied to one of the TRPs <b>205</b> such that the Doppler shift associated with the TRP <b>205</b> on the receiver side may equal a Doppler shift of another TRP <b>205</b>. In some cases, a pre-compensation mode may be enabled or disabled dynamically depending on Doppler shift measurements accuracy, network or UE mismatches, continuous Doppler shift pre-compensation ability, UE location, channel conditions, TRS or SRS overhead, etc. For example, a DCI or MAC-CE signaling may enable or disable pre-compensation dynamically.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">In some examples, the base station <b>105</b>, the one or more TRPs <b>205</b>, or the UE <b>115</b> may dynamically switch between an SFN transmission scheme and a DPS scheme or an SDM, FDM, or TDM transmission scheme. For example, the switching may be performed based on DCI or MAC-CE signaling. In some cases, the network may use the dynamic switching of transmission mode (e.g., SFN, DPS, SDM) depending on network loading, UE location, channel conditions, whether the UE <b>115</b> is on the train or on the station, or a combination thereof. Different transmission scheme options may be associated with different DMRS configurations. The preferred DMRS option per transmission scheme or transmission mode may vary in time depending on UE speed, UE location, and channel conditions. In some cases, multiple (e.g., two) different DMRS configurations may be addressed simultaneously for different TRPs <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122">In some cases, a DMRS configuration preference may be associated with an HST-SFN transmission scheme (e.g., scheme 1) with and without Doppler shift pre-compensation because of a different equivalent Doppler spread of a resulting SFN channel on DMRS ports. In some examples, a non-compensated HST-SFN case and pre-compensated HST-SFN case may be considered as two different scenarios for DMRS adaptation. Each case may be associated with a different DMRS configuration option for a similar scenario of HST-SFN geometry and similar channel and reception condition characteristics. Different preferred (e.g., optimal) DMRS configurations may be observed for scenarios with and without pre-compensation. In some cases, without pre-compensation DMRS configuration preference may vary depending on UE speed, location, and SNR because of SFN channel characteristics dynamics related to a &#x201c;breathing&#x201d; Doppler spectrum and power delay profile. In some other cases, a with pre-compensation multi-TRP SFN channel may be translated to a single TRP channel equivalent at list in terms of Doppler spectrum or Doppler spread and DMRS preference for the channel may have a relatively low dependence on UE speed and location.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0123">In some cases, for an HST-SFN transmission scheme with accurate Doppler shift pre-compensation, for a CDL channel type with a strong LOS component, DMRS patterns with one or two DMRS symbols may be a preferred choice. In some other cases, for non-pre-compensated HST-SFN transmission schemes, a preferred DMRS configuration choice may vary between patterns with two, three, and four DMRS symbols depending on UE speed, UE location, and SNR per TRP. In some examples, DMRS preference without Doppler shift pre-compensation may have a relatively strong dependence on UE speed and UE location and may be expected to change quickly for the HST-SFN scenario. In some cases, the network may assume UE assisted DMRS reporting with relatively high reporting rate. Additionally or alternatively, the network may assume that the network may manage a DMRS pattern selection based on UE speed, a Doppler shift indication from a UE <b>115</b> per TRP <b>205</b>, UE location, and operational downlink MCS. DMRS preference with accurate pre-compensation may have a relatively weak dependence (e.g., no dependence) on UE speed and location. However, the HST-SFN transmission scheme (e.g., scheme 1) scenario with Doppler shift pre-compensation may be sensitive to pre-compensation accuracy, such as accuracy and level of persistence of the indicated Doppler shifts. Non ideal and variable accuracy may introduce dynamics in preferred DMRS pattern selection for the scenario as well. Thus, UE assisted DMRS adaptation may be beneficial also for HST-SFN transmission scheme 1 with pre-compensation.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124">In some examples, for HST-SFN transmission scheme 1, a TRS may be transmitted in TRP-specific or a non-SFN manner. A DMRS <b>220</b> and PDSCH from TRPs <b>205</b> may be transmitted in an SFN manner. Each DMRS port may have two TCI states (e.g., a quasi-colocation (QCL) configuration or assumption may be with TRSs from multiple TRPs <b>205</b>) and may experience a combined SFN channel. In some cases, there may be a different time-domain correlation for a DMRS <b>220</b> with and without pre-compensation. For example, without pre-compensation, the time domain correlation (or the equivalent Doppler spread of the SFN channel per DMRS port) may be a function of UE speed and UE location between TRPs <b>205</b>. In some other examples, with accurate pre-compensation, the time domain correlation may not depend on UE speed and UE location relative to TRPs <b>205</b> since SFN channel may be translated to a single TRP channel equivalent in terms of time correlation and Doppler spread per DMRS port (e.g., CDL channel type with two dominant channel impulse response (CIR) taps with a similar or the same Doppler shift assuming that each TRP has CDL channel type with a strong LOS component).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">In some cases, each TRP <b>205</b> may be associated with a different DMRS configuration preference, such as a different Doppler spread, delay spread, and SNR per TRP <b>205</b> in an HST-SFN transmission scheme (e.g., scheme 2).

However, in case of a channel profile with a relatively less dominant line of sight (LOS) (e.g., a pedestrian UE on the train) or non-LOS (NLOS) channel type, DMRS preference per TRP <b>205</b> may be different and DMRS reselection may be more dynamic.

In some cases, such as if base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>transmits control signaling <b>225</b>-<i>b </i>(e.g., including the dynamic DMRS signaling) via a MAC-CE, the control signaling <b>225</b>-<i>b </i>may address multiple of the DMRS parameters (e.g., dmrs-Type, dmrs-AdditionalPosition, maxLength, dmrs-TypeA-Position, or a combination thereof). In some other cases, such as if base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>transmits control signaling <b>225</b>-<i>b </i>via a DCI message, the control signaling <b>225</b>-<i>b </i>may address a reduced number of DMRS parameters to reduce a number of bits in the DCI message dedicated to DMRS parameters. For example, the DCI message may include dmrs-AdditionalPosition but may not include the other DMRS parameters.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">In some examples, for dynamic switching between transmission schemes (e.g., SFN scheme 1, SFN scheme 2 with or without Doppler shift pre-compensation, a multi-TRP SDM scheme, and DPS with a single TCI), the network may select a transmission scheme that UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may use. Control signaling <b>225</b>-<i>a </i>may include an indication of the transmission scheme (e.g., one of the RRC configured transmission schemes may be switched dynamically).

The usage of multiple DMRS configurations per allocation (e.g., for an HST-SFN or other multi-TRP scenario) may be RRC configured at a UE <b>115</b> based on UE capability.

If the network performs joint signaling of transmission mode and DMRS configuration, then the signaling may be the same for multiple DMRS configurations or a single DMRS configuration. The network may select a relevant preconfigured bundle (e.g., with one or more DMRS configurations together with a transmission mode). In some cases, such as for disjoint signaling for transmission mode and DMRS configuration, the number of DMRS fields and the size of the DMRS fields in a DCI message from the transmission mode may depend on the other fields in the DCI message.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0175">At <b>625</b>, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>may switch to the identified transmission mode based on receiving the control message indicating the DMRS configuration and the transmission mode.
