In this description, reference is made to the drawings in which like reference numerals may indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be understood that elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing and/or a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing. Further, some embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A radio frequency (RF) communication system communicates by wirelessly transmitting and receiving RF signals. Such RF communication systems can include a power amplifier to amplify RF signals for transmission on an antenna. The power amplifier can provide amplification to the RF signal to provide sufficient signal strength to transmit the RF signal over far distances and/or in noisy radio environments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A power amplifier can be manufactured using a wide variety of fabrication technologies. One type of fabrication technology is gallium nitride (GaN), which is a compound semiconductor technology. In particular, GaN is a III-V semiconductor technology suitable for high power applications. For instance, a power amplifier fabricated using a GaN process can support up to about 100 times the signal output power relative to power amplifiers fabricated using other processing technologies, such as silicon. In one example, a GaN power amplifier handles up to about 45 dBm of signal power before breakdown. Another fabrication technology suitable for power amplifiers is gallium arsenide (GaAs).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Power amplifiers serve to amplify signals to high power levels, and thus operate with high current levels and large signal voltages. Accordingly, power amplifiers can often operate at very high temperatures, however, it can be a challenge to accurately measure the operating temperature of a power amplifier.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, it can be difficult to detect whether there is a problem in heat dissipation of the power amplifier. For example, in a phased array antenna system, there are often many power amplifiers associated with RF transmit channels used for beamforming. In such systems, the power amplifiers may be arranged without a sufficient thermal path for heat dissipation. Providing a temperature measurement of the power amplifier allows for the detection of potential design failures from a heat perspective, thereby enabling improvements in the design layout of the power amplifier. Moreover, temperature measurement can be used dynamically during operating of an RF communication system to disable transmissions or operate transmissions at reduced power levels in response to detecting over temperature.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, while compound semiconductor (for instance, GaN or GaAs) based power amplifiers may have advantages for high power applications, compound semiconductor chip fabrication processes may offer a limited number of metal layers available for designing the layout of the power amplifier. For example, in some implementations, there may only be two metal layers available for a GaN or GaAs based power amplifier. This can make circuit design more challenging compared to Si circuit design. In particular, it can be difficult to locate a temperature sensor at a position where the temperature of the power amplifier can be accurately measured while maintaining the routing for the normal operation of the power amplifier.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain implementations, a power amplifier fabricated in a compound semiconductor technology is implemented using at least one high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). A HEMT can also be referred to as a modulation-doped field effect transistor (MODFET) or a heterojunction field effect transistor (HFET). In one embodiment, the power amplifier includes at least one pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) that operates to provide amplification to the power amplifier's input signal.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an RF communication system <b>15</b> according to one embodiment.

In certain configurations, the filter <b>5</b> can be a bandpass filter configured to provide band filtering.

In particular, a power amplifier may be designed to operate within a certain temperature band or range, and the amount of amplification that can be provided by the power amplifier can be limited when operating outside of this band.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, if a given circuit layout for the power amplifier does not sufficiently dissipate the generated heat, the power generated by the power amplifier can be limited. Improper board design or thermal management can impact the transistor junction temperature (e.g., the maximum operating temperature, also referred to as the &#x201c;junction temperature&#x201d;) by hundreds of degrees in a GaN or GaAs power amplifier. Similarly, manufacturing defects (e.g., a void or bad connection at the backside of the power amplifier wafer) can reduce heat conduction, leading to poor dissipation of heat.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, accurate measurement of the junction temperature generated by a power amplifier can be used to improve the power amplifier design and/or diagnose manufacturing defects.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one example application, power amplifiers may be implemented in a phased array antenna system. Such phased array antenna systems may include up to thousands of 100 W GaN power amplifiers, which may be closely spaced leading to challenges in thermal dissipation. For an example, a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system can include thousands of power amplifiers for driving antenna elements of a large antenna array.

Moreover, the heat generated by the FET banks <b>110</b> may drop off quickly in accordance with the distance from the FET banks <b>110</b>. For example, heat radiates conically downward into the die's substrate, which leads to a quick fall off of heat as lateral distance from the FET bank increases. Thus, in order to accurately measure the operating junction temperature of the power amplifier <b>110</b>, a thermal temperature sensor can be placed adjacent to the FET banks <b>110</b> within a threshold distance of the FET banks.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the semiconductor resistor <b>320</b> can function as a thermal temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the FET bank <b>300</b>. Semiconductor resistors <b>320</b> may have relatively high change in resistance (e.g., a change of about 30-50% in resistance) due to temperature in the range of operating temperatures expected for a power amplifier. Thus, semiconductor resistors <b>320</b> may be particularly suited to measuring the temperature of the FET bank <b>300</b>. The semiconductor resistor <b>320</b> can be doped to a similar level as the channels of the HEMTs in the FET bank <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Constraints on layout resources can complicate integration or placement of the semiconductor resistor into a hot area of the power amplifier. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a large portion of the power amplifier <b>100</b> footprint is occupied by functional components. When formed using GaN or GaAs technology, it may not be possible to place a semiconductor resistor within the FET bank <b>300</b> due to the limited number of metal layers used for routing traces for the FET bank <b>300</b>. Thus, in certain embodiments the semiconductor resistor <b>320</b> can be placed adjacent to one end of the array forming the FET bank <b>300</b>.

Accordingly, the signal voltage of the bond pad <b>525</b> (corresponding to the divided voltage outputted from the voltage divider) indicates a voltage gradient versus temperature.
