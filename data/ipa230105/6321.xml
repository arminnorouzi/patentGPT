If a battery arrangement is damaged for example as a result of damage in the event of an accident, the coolant can pass to the outside via the fluid drainage arrangement, and this makes it possible to avoid a short circuit in the battery arrangement. The labyrinth chamber here makes it possible to prevent or at least make it more difficult for liquid, dirt or relatively small mammals to enter the battery arrangement from the surroundings in an unimpeded manner. In the closed state, the membrane preferably prevents air moisture from entering the battery arrangement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a preferred embodiment, the membrane is designed, after the transition from the closed state into the open state, no longer to transition into the closed state. This is possible for example by virtue of the fact that the membrane transitions into the open state as a result of destruction, or no resetting element or no restoring force is provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment, the membrane is designed, after the transition from the closed state into the open state, to transition again into the closed state. This is possible for example by means of a resetting spring, by means of an elastic material or by means of an additional resetting element. Here, the transition back into the closed state preferably occurs at a lower differential pressure than the first differential pressure or by means of a manual actuation by a user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment, the fluid drainage arrangement has a bottom element for a battery arrangement, which bottom element is trough-shaped and has a drainage slope for a coolant, and which drainage slope is fluidically connected to the collecting chamber in order to allow drainage of a coolant from the battery arrangement to the collecting chamber. The drainage slope allows controlled drainage of the coolant in the fluid drainage device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a preferred embodiment, the drainage slope is fluidically connected to the collecting chamber via a hose. Hoses have the advantage that they can be easily mounted and can, where appropriate, also be designed to be elastic in order to reduce temporarily occurring high pressures.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a preferred embodiment, the hose is fastened via at least one clamp. Clamps allow stable connections, even under extreme conditions with strong vibrations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a preferred embodiment, the membrane is designed to perform a transition from the closed state into the open state if a predetermined amount of coolant has collected on the first side of the membrane. This allows a noncritical amount of coolant to accumulate before the membrane transitions into the open state. By contrast, in the case of an amount which at least corresponds to the predetermined amount of coolant, the membrane is set into the open state, and the coolant can flow off.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment, the fluid drainage arrangement has a labyrinth chamber part and a cover part, which labyrinth chamber part forms the labyrinth chamber, which cover part forms the collecting chamber in a cover part extension, and which cover part is connected to the labyrinth chamber part. This facilitates the production of the labyrinth chamber and the collecting chamber.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment, a sealing element is provided between the labyrinth chamber part and the cover part. This prevents the escape of coolant at the connecting point.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a preferred embodiment, the fluid drainage arrangement contains, at least in certain regions, at least one material from the group of materials consisting of:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">plastic,</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">aluminum, and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">aluminum allloy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">These materials are lightweight and can guide the coolant well.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a preferred embodiment, the labyrinth chamber has a lateral wall, a labyrinth interior and shaped elements, which shaped elements extend from the lateral wall into the labyrinth interior in order to prevent or at least to reduce a rectilinear flow of a fluid through the labyrinth chamber. This allows the coolant to exit, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, makes it more difficult for a fluid to directly enter the battery arrangement from outside.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a preferred embodiment, the shaped elements approach the fluid outlet at least partially at least in certain portions in their extent from the lateral wall into the labyrinth interior. In a preferred arrangement of the fluid outlet below the fluid inlet, it is possible for example for a coolant to flow easily to the fluid outlet, but, on the other hand, a liquid medium is prevented from flowing in the reverse direction. Furthermore, it is more difficult for animals to crawl into the labyrinth chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a preferred embodiment, the shaped elements are at least partially designed to be flat at least in certain portions. The flat design is well-suited to preventing a strong direct fluid flow through the labyrinth chamber.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A battery arrangement has such a fluid drainage arrangement. This reduces the risk that, in the event of a failure or destruction of the cooling system of the battery arrangement, there occurs a short circuit as a result of the coolant and thus greater damage such as a fire in the vehicle. The buildup of a coolant column in the battery arrangement can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A vehicle has such a battery arrangement. Safety is important in vehicles, and the fluid drainage arrangement increases the safety.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a preferred embodiment, the fluid outlet is fluidically connected to the surroundings of the vehicle in order to allow drainage of a coolant into the surroundings of the vehicle. This leads to good separation of the coolant from the battery arrangement and reduces the risk of a short circuit. Water-glycol mixtures are frequently used as coolants or for a good heat transfer, and drainage of such a mixture in the event of damage is possible.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a preferred embodiment, the collecting chamber is arranged above the labyrinth chamber at least in certain regions. This facilitates the drainage of the coolant in the event of damage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further details and advantageous developments of the invention will emerge from the exemplary embodiments described below and illustrated in the drawings, which embodiments should in no way be understood as restricting the invention, and also from the dependent claims.

They can, for example, project like a springboard into the labyrinth interior <b>57</b>, but they can also be connected laterally to the lateral wall <b>65</b> up to their free end.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A further advantage of the labyrinth chamber <b>34</b> lies in the fact that animals are prevented from entering, or at least will find it harder to enter, from the fluid outlet <b>36</b> to the fluid inlet <b>31</b> and possibly into the battery arrangement on account of the configuration of the labyrinth interior <b>67</b>. In particular martens and other animals of the taxonomic suborder of canids can be prevented by the labyrinth chamber <b>34</b> from entering the high-voltage battery.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fluid drainage arrangement <b>20</b> preferably contains, at least in certain regions, at least one material from the group of materials consisting of:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">plastic,</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">aluminium, and</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">aluminium alloy.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">These are lightweight and nevertheless stable materials which are particularly well-suited.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the membrane <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The membrane <b>40</b> has two predetermined tearing points <b>44</b> which are arranged in a cross shape and which tear open at a predetermined differential pressure between the upper side and lower side of the membrane <b>40</b> and allow a fluid flow through the membrane <b>40</b>. The predetermined tearing points <b>44</b> can also be referred to as predetermined breaking points. In such a design, the membrane <b>40</b> can be formed, for example, from a plastic or from a thin metal sheet. By virtue of tearing open, the membrane <b>40</b> can no longer transition from the open state Z<b>2</b> into the closed state Z<b>1</b>, with the transition from the closed state Z<b>1</b> into the open state Z<b>2</b> thus being irreversible, and the membrane <b>40</b> is destroyed. In such a case, the membrane <b>40</b> can be replaced in a workshop, for example.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a further embodiment, the membrane <b>40</b> can be formed, for example, from a rubber-elastic material, and the lines <b>44</b> arranged in a cross can be formed, for example, as continuous slits. By virtue of the rubber-elastic design of the material, the membrane <b>40</b> can open in the region of the lines <b>44</b> at a differential pressure, and coolant <b>14</b> can flow through. As soon as the differential pressure is no longer present, the membrane <b>40</b> can close again. As a result, after the transition from the closed state Z<b>1</b> into the open state Z<b>2</b>, a transition of the membrane <b>40</b> into the closed state Z<b>1</b> again is possible. There can also be provision that the membrane <b>40</b> can be moved into the closed state Z<b>1</b> by means of a manual actuation by a user.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The membrane <b>40</b> is preferably designed to perform a transition from the closed state Z<b>1</b> into the open state Z<b>2</b> if a predetermined amount of coolant <b>14</b> has collected on the first side <b>51</b> of the membrane <b>40</b>. The rise of the coolant <b>14</b> in the collecting chamber <b>32</b> causes an increase in the hydrostatic pressure, and the membrane <b>40</b> opens from a certain value of the hydrostatic pressure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The membrane <b>40</b> also opens for example in the case of an overpressure arising in the battery arrangement <b>12</b> as a result of degassing and can act alone, or assisting a pressure-equalizing element such as a rupture disk, as a safety valve for the battery arrangement <b>12</b>. Such an overpressure can occur, for example, in the event of damage to the battery arrangement.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the exemplary embodiment, the membrane <b>40</b> has a round basic shape or, for example, the basic shape of an ellipse.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a further exemplary embodiment of the fluid drainage arrangement <b>20</b>.
