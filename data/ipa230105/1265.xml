Exercise programs include a combination of one or more exercise menus. Each exercise menu includes one type of exercise motion.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many systems for creating appropriate exercise programs depending on users and providing them to the respective users have been proposed in related art. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses an exercise program presenting system. In the exercise program presenting system, a server accumulates personal information of users who have performed exercise programs, the period during which the exercise programs have been performed, and the results of measuring effects of the exercise programs. The exercise program presenting system extracts, when creating an exercise program for a new user, previous cases in which the personal information on the users in these cases is similar to the personal information on the new user and automatically creates an exercise program that matches the features of this user.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2017-27192</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0005">[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2018-198707</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0006">In Patent Literature 1, when the quality of an exercise menu itself provided for a user is low, the quality of the exercise program including this exercise menu naturally becomes low. In order to provide exercise programs each having a higher quality, professionals need to appropriately update exercise menus to be used for creating the exercise programs to improve the quality of the exercise menu group. However, if the number of exercise menus used in the exercise program is large, it is difficult to determine which exercise menus in the large number of exercise menus are low-quality menus. Further, in Patent Literature 1, the quality of each of the exercise menus is not taken into account, and thus an exercise program including low-quality exercise menus may be presented.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0007">As another related art, Patent Literature 2 discloses a teaching compatibility determining device. Patent Literature 2 discloses a program for recording information on exercises performed by exercisers who participate in sports such as swimming and track and field. A computer disclosed in Patent Literature 2 acquires measurement values by measuring exercises performed by an exerciser and acquires exercise information regarding the exercises performed by the exerciser based on the measurement values. The computer displays the acquired exercise information in association with a target value of exercises performed by the exerciser.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">Patent Literature 2 displays exercise information on an exerciser in association with the target value in order to let a user know which part of the body of the exerciser should be improved by an exercise and how much the part of the body should be improved by the exercise. In Patent Literature 2, however, the effectiveness of the exercise itself is not evaluated. Therefore, regarding Patent Literature 2, like Patent Literature 1, it is difficult to determine which exercise menus in the large number of exercise menus are low-quality menus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">In view of the aforementioned circumstances, the aim of the present disclosure is to provide an exercise menu evaluation apparatus, a method, and a computer readable medium capable of evaluating effectiveness of exercise menus.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">In order to attain the above object, the present disclosure provides an exercise menu evaluation apparatus as a first aspect.

An exercise program presenting system <b>100</b> includes a sensor apparatus <b>101</b>, an exercise record database (DB) <b>102</b>, an exercise menu information DB <b>103</b>, a user information DB <b>104</b>, an exercise menu evaluation apparatus <b>105</b>, and an exercise program providing apparatus <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">The exercise menu information DB <b>103</b> stores information regarding exercise menus used in an exercise program (exercise menu information). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a specific example of the exercise menu information stored in the exercise menu information DB <b>103</b>. In this example, the exercise menu information includes a menu number, a target part, and the number of sets. The menu number indicates identification information of an exercise menu. The target part indicates the part of the body intended to be trained in the exercise menu. For example, the exercise menu identified by the menu number &#x201c;00001&#x201d; is &#x201c;shoulder rotation&#x201d;, which is an exercise menu in which &#x201c;shoulders&#x201d; are the target part. &#x201c;The number of sets&#x201d; indicates the number of times of repetition of exercise, an exercise duration time or the like. For example, the exercise menu identified by the menu number &#x201c;00001&#x201d; is an exercise menu in which two sets of exercise, each including one-minute exercise, is performed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">The user information DB <b>104</b> stores information on each user (user information) who performs an exercise menu in accordance with an exercise program. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a specific example of user information stored in the user information DB <b>104</b>. In this example, the user information includes the user name, the user identifier (ID), age, sex, height, and weight of each user. Further, the user information includes an exercise program created for each user. The exercise program includes one or more exercise menus selected from a plurality of exercise menus stored in the exercise menu information DB <b>103</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user information DB <b>104</b> stores, for example, an exercise program including exercise menus whose menu numbers are &#x201c;00001&#x201d; and &#x201c;00007&#x201d; for the user whose user ID is &#x201c;aaaaa&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">The exercise program providing apparatus <b>200</b> generates exercise programs.
