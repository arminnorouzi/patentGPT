A high entropy source is needed to generate random numbers, one example of which is a quantum entropy source based on the decay of radioisotopes. However, most entropy sources have a bias, which may require post-processing to alleviate the bias effect and may use a deterministic random number generator to increase the value of random numbers. Also, most entropy sources take physical measurements of the natural environment to produce pulses in proportion to the magnitude of the energy in the measurements; therefore, final output pulses of the entropy source are characterized by their unpredictable period. Suppose pulses with a non-deterministic period are used to generate high-speed random frequencies; then, it may make it difficult to predict a particular instruction within a uniform set of frequencies, which is one of the side-channel attack methods typically used by hackers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A related prior art is Korean registered patent No. 10-1721168, &#x201c;Method of operating random pulse generator apparatus using radioisotope.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a random number generator resistant to side-channel attacks from hackers, which generates a random frequency based on an unpredictable entropy source and inputs the random frequency when a microprocessor executes a specific instruction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A random number generator resistant to side-channel attacks according to one embodiment of the present disclosure comprises an entropy unit generating random pulses, a random frequency clock generator generating random frequencies by receiving random pulses output from the entropy unit, and an MCU externally masking a specific operation or a specific instruction based on a random frequency received from the random frequency clock generator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method for operating a random frequency clock generator resistant to side-channel attacks according to one embodiment of the present disclosure comprises generating random pulses by an entropy unit, generating random frequencies by receiving random pulses output from the entropy unit, and masking a specific instruction externally by an MCU based on a random frequency received from the random frequency clock generator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides an effect of making a hacker's side-channel attack difficult by entering a random frequency to the MCU at the time of operating a specific instruction and disturbing the time at which a target operation is executed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, the present disclosure provides a random number generator using radioisotopes capable of generating random numbers at a high rate through a deterministic random number generator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, the present disclosure may be used to implement hiding and masking techniques through a random frequency clock and random numbers, which are countermeasures against side-channel attacks.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a structure of a random number generator resistant to side-channel attacks according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a structure of an entropy unit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a structure of a random frequency clock generator according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a simulation result of a random frequency clock generator according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref> illustrate simulation results for varying pulse widths according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Specific structural or functional descriptions of embodiments according to the concept of the present disclosure described herein are illustrated solely for the purpose of describing embodiments according to the concept of the present disclosure, and embodiments according to the concept of the present disclosure may be embodied in various forms and are not limited to the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since the embodiments based on the concept of the present disclosure may be modified in various ways and may have various other forms, the embodiments will be illustrated in the appended drawings of the present disclosure and described in detail with reference to the drawings.

The entropy unit <b>100</b> may include a radioisotope emitter and detector, and the pulse width of a random pulse may be determined in proportion to the amount of energy generated due to the collision of one or more alpha particles released from the radioisotope emitter with the radioisotope detector. In other words, pulses with a random pulse width may be generated based on different amounts of energy generated when one or more alpha particles having different amounts of energy collide with the detector or one or more alpha particles having the same amount of energy collide with the detector. The pulse width of random pulses generated by the entropy unit <b>100</b> may be a value obtained by multiplying the number of random alpha particles colliding with the detector by the amount of energy of each particle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The random frequency clock generator <b>200</b> receives random pulses output from the entropy unit <b>100</b> to generate a random frequency. The random frequency clock generator <b>200</b> includes an AMP <b>210</b> and a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) <b>220</b>. The random frequency clock generator <b>200</b> may generate a random frequency based on the pulse signal width of the random pulse and the time difference between the pulse signals. In other words, the random frequency clock generator <b>200</b> may generate a frequency as the number of charges accumulated in the capacitor varies according to the width of a random pulse, the initial frequency output to the VCO <b>220</b> is changed, and the frequency is decreased in proportion to the number of charges discharged from the capacitor until the next pulse is generated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first selector <b>300</b> selectively receives a random frequency output from the random frequency clock generator <b>200</b> and the reference clock CLK based on a first selection signal sel<b>0</b> and outputs the selected signal to the random number generating unit <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The MCU <b>400</b> may be configured by firmware to control the first selection signal sel<b>0</b> of the first selector and a second selection signal sell of the second selector.

In other words, if the MCU <b>400</b> executes a specific instruction when the duty cycle is fixed, a hacker may easily make a side-channel attack; however, when the timing is varied by a random frequency, the hacker may not make the side-channel attack since it is not possible to know whether the MCU executes an instruction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The counter <b>500</b> receives random pulses output from the entropy unit <b>100</b> and outputs a random number seed.

The amplifier may be a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), which may amplify and detect a very low-level current due to the absorption of alpha particles and may perform amplification in two steps. The transimpedance gain and unity-gain bandwidth of a first TIA may be 10 MD. and 10 MHz, respectively, and the gain of a second TIA may be set to 10.
