id="p-0071" num="0070">The disclosure herein is related to rod coupling systems or assemblies. The rod coupling assemblies herein include a tulip, and wherein the assemblies are adapted and configured to be coupled to a stabilizing rod that is part of a bone stabilization construct. The rod coupling assemblies in this context may also be considered to include an implant, or have an implantable portion, that is secured in tissue (e.g. bone), wherein the implant is coupled to the tulip. The rod may be part of a larger construct that may be used to stabilize one or more regions of a patient's body, such as a spine or pelvis. In some embodiments, the rod coupling assemblies herein may be disposed in a lower region of the spine, such in the region of a sacro-iliac joint.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The disclosure herein that is related to the rod coupling assemblies is related to some aspects of the disclosure in published application WO2020/168269, which is fully incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. For example, and without limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-<b>26</b>B</figref> in publication WO2020/168269 show an exemplary rod coupling assembly that includes a head portion <b>2506</b> that may be provided with a coupler <b>2524</b> and a main body <b>2526</b> and a nut (not shown). The nut may have external threads that mate with internal threads located in the proximal recess of main body <b>2526</b> to tighten a spinal rod (not shown) against the bottom of channels <b>2528</b> in main body <b>2526</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, the proximal end of shank portion <b>2502</b> may be provided with a circumferential rib or barb <b>2530</b> for securing head portion <b>2506</b> to shank portion <b>2502</b> in a snap-fit manner. The head portion may be considered part of a rod coupling assembly. The head portion may be considered part of the implant, even though it is not directly engaging tissue.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref> herein illustrate an exemplary rod coupling assembly <b>110</b>, which is shaped and sized to be secured to implant portion <b>100</b> as well as rod <b>130</b> (only a portion of which is shown). Assembly <b>110</b> includes main body <b>111</b>, which may also be referred to herein as a tulip. Implant <b>100</b> has a rounded (optionally at least partially spherical) proximal end <b>101</b> that is shaped and sized to stably but movably interface with a curved inner surface <b>112</b> of main body <b>111</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) and a curved inner surface of implant stabilizing member <b>120</b> (e.g., a saddle), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. In the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> (as well as the fully assembled views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>E</figref>), the main body <b>111</b> is rotatable to some degree relative to the proximal end <b>101</b> of implant <b>100</b> due to the spherical surfaces of the three components (implant <b>100</b>, main body <b>111</b>, and implant stabilizing member <b>120</b>). The position of the curved surfaces is such that the implant axis &#x201c;IA&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>) is not collinear with the main body axis &#x201c;MB.&#x201d; Preferably, the angle (as shown) is at least 15 degrees, and in some embodiments is between 35 and 55 degrees, optionally around 45 degree (e.g. between 42 and 48 degrees). The orientation of the spherical surfaces can thus impart and allow a favored or preferred angle between the main body (e.g., tulip) and the implant, while allowing for some rotational freedom between the two.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>E</figref>, channel <b>113</b> in tulip <b>111</b> is in communication with and aligned with the internal channel in the implant, which includes distal port <b>102</b>. This allows, if desired, an agent to be delivered through the tulip and through the implant and into the subject. The channel or port <b>113</b> in the tulip also allows access to the rotational drive mechanism such as a hex or torx drive.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once implant stabilizing member <b>120</b> (e.g., saddle) is advanced to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, rod <b>130</b> may be positioned relative to the rod channel in the tulip such that the rod is extending through the rod channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>E</figref> illustrate a portion of a rod that is positioned in the tulip. Rods and tulips are at a high level known in the art. To secure the rod in place, rod stabilizing member <b>140</b> (e.g., a threaded set cap) may be advanced via threaded rotation into the main body until it engages the rod <b>130</b> and help secures it in place, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>E</figref>. Implant stabilizing member <b>120</b> also has a proximal curved surface (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) configured to stably interface with a portion of the rod, as shown in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>. In an exemplary use, rod <b>130</b> may be extending in a direction that is generally considered superior-to-inferior, and may be part of a spine stabilization system that includes additional bone anchors (&#x201c;implant&#x201d;). Once the rod is secured, the entire assembly, including the implant, is essentially a secure and stable construct.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref> illustrate a portion of an exemplary rod coupling assembly <b>200</b>, but excludes illustrating the rod and set cap (e.g., a set cap <b>140</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref>) for clarity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref> illustrate the portion of the rod coupling assembly that illustrates how the main body or tulip <b>220</b> is secured relative to the implant portion <b>210</b>.

The rod coupling assembly <b>200</b> includes main body or tulip <b>220</b>, distal collet portion <b>230</b>, proximal collet portion <b>240</b>, and saddle <b>250</b>. Implant <b>210</b> may be at least partially threaded, as shown, and can be sized and shaped to anchor into bone.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The tulip <b>220</b> is configured to receive in a channel therein both spherical collet portions and the saddle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. Proximal collet portion <b>240</b> includes slits formed therein, as shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>, the split collet is disengaged from the mating tapered inner surface <b>231</b>. The proximal portion of implant portion <b>210</b> may then be advanced within the collets, with the implant proximal end causing the collet fingers to deflect outward, or split. Continued advancement of the implant portion causes the collet fingers to deflect back inward about the implant groove <b>211</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E-<b>2</b>G</figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Saddle <b>250</b> may include one or more slots (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) that are sized and configured to interface with swaged bosses to limit the amount of travel relative to the tulip.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The rod, not shown for clarity, may then be advanced through tulip <b>220</b>, and a threaded set cap, not shown for clarity, can be advanced distally, causing the rod to be pushed against saddle <b>250</b>, which compresses the collet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>H-<b>2</b>J</figref>.

The slotted collet is then compressed against the tulip, which compresses and secures the collet against the proximal portion of the implant. This is the general method by which the assemblies are secured to the implant as well as the rod.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate a variation on the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>H</figref> (similar parts being similarly labeled), wherein the rod coupling assembly includes a saddle and proximal collet that are threaded to interface with threaded tool <b>260</b>. Once the threaded tool <b>260</b> is threaded into the saddle and collet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the tool is then pulled proximally with respect to the tulip <b>220</b>&#x2032;, pulling the saddle and collet proximally and disengaging from the distal spherical collet. This allows the saddle to be retracted proximally, which provides the option to remove the tulip if needed (e.g., if the implant portion were to become loose). The tulip can also have a side channel (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref>) that can provide access to the proximal end of the implant if needed, such as if the tulip is rotated and the physician cannot get access to the tulip main channel. The distal collet portion <b>230</b> (or <b>230</b>&#x2032;) allows for favored angle rotation of the tulip <b>220</b> relative to the implant portion <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>H</figref> is an exemplary embodiment of a rod coupling assembly <b>400</b> that includes main body or tulip <b>420</b>, spherical collet <b>430</b> (shown with slits in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), saddle <b>450</b>, set cap <b>460</b>, and split annular member <b>440</b>.

For example, proximal forces on the tulip from rod movement may translate to the collet, which may tend to undesirably cause the collet distal end to loosen or expand over time.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Additionally, the collect and implant interface in the exemplary embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>J</figref> is configured to resist or minimize the likelihood of becoming loose from axial forces caused by rod reduction. Rod reduction can be generally described as when a physician may position the rod proud of the tulip and reduces it (i.e., forces the rod into the implant tulip) in order to get a correction in anatomy. This step occurs before the collet is tightened in place. These reductions exert a great amount of force on the implant, and because the collet is not yet tightened, the collet may come apart. The collet and implant interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>J</figref> is an example of such an interface that is sized and configured to ensure, or increase the likelihood of, the collet remaining closed during these reductions.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">To reduce the likelihood of collet loosening or expansion in response to these forces and in these scenarios, the implant undercut creates or produces a gap <b>1102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>) between the non-parallel surface <b>1114</b> and the collet surface that faces surface <b>1114</b>. The collet surface may be orthogonal to the long axis. When an axial force is applied to tulip, gap <b>1102</b> provides space so that less distally directed force is applied to the vertical surface of collet, reducing the likelihood of collet expansion and loosening. The reduction in likelihood is compared to a system that may be alike in all ways but instead having a radially extending surface <b>1114</b> that is orthogonal to the bone implant longitudinal axis LA, or compared to systems in which a gap does not exist.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The undercut in the proximal end of the bone implant recess <b>1112</b> may be described in a variety of ways. The undercut may be described as a recessed collet receiving region <b>1112</b> in the proximal region of the implant that includes a radially extending surface (e.g., <b>1114</b>) that is disposed at an angle less than ninety degrees relative to a bone implant longitudinal axis, the angle measured distally relative to the radially extending surface, as shown as angle alpha in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>, the angle is also shown relative to axially extending surface <b>1118</b>, but axially extending surface <b>1118</b> need not be flat as is shown, but instead may be curvilinear. In any embodiments herein, however, surface <b>1114</b> or an extension thereof may form an angle with a long axis of the implant or an axis that is parallel with the long axis, which may be the same angle alpha in both cases.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The undercuts herein may also be described and claimed functionally herein, such as the radially extending surface angled so as to reduce the likelihood of a distal end of the collet expanding and becoming loose in response to an axial force (e.g., solely proximally directed), compared to a system alike in all ways but instead having a radially extending surface that is orthogonal to the bone implant longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The undercuts herein may be described as including a proximal region that includes a radially recessed collet receiving region or area including a radially extending surface that is disposed at an angle less than ninety degrees relative to the long axis.

This may allow the collet to be advanced over the proximal end of the implant, causing collet expansion. In some embodiments, the proximal end of the implant may facilitate collet expansion, such as by having chamfered surface <b>1120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>), which can help expand the distal end of the collet as it is slid distally over the proximal end of the implant. Once the collet implant interface region <b>1135</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>) is advanced distally to the recessed region <b>1112</b>, the collet implant interface region <b>1135</b> collapses into the recess <b>1112</b> due to the collapsibility of the collet distal end due to the slits/slots.
