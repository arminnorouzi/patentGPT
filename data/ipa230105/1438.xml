According to this form, uniform flow of air from the ceiling to the floor discharging section of the painting chamber can be formed in the entire painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, as disclosed in Patent Documents 1-5 identified below, for instance, various forms are known also regarding a painting facility having an air supplying section provided at a locally limited portion(s) of the ceiling, not over the entire face of the ceiling of the painting chamber. With these forms, uncoated paint mist (&#x201c;overspray&#x201d;) can be discharged or expelled from the painting chamber with a relatively small air flow amount.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">PATENT DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2017-087159</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2017-087160</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2017-124357</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0009">Patent Document 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2018-187542</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0010">Patent Document 5: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2018-192433</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0011">In the case of the painting facility having an air supplying section provided in the substantially entire ceiling face, a relatively high downflow velocity (e.g. at least 0.25 m/s or more) is required in order to maintain a favorable painting environment that can prevent color casting among painting objects while reducing soiling of the painting device or a wall of the painting chamber by uncoated paint mist, so the facility suffers a problem of difficulty in air flow amount reduction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Further, in the case of the painting facility having an air supplying section at a locally limited part of the ceiling, uncoated paint mist can be discharged with a smaller amount of air flow than the case of the painting facility having an air supplying section over the entire ceiling face. However, the effect of reducing paint adhesion to the painting device or the wall face of the painting chamber and the effect of preventing color casting phenomenon among painting objects are not necessarily sufficient, thus, there remains room for improvement in the respect of maintaining favorable painting environment. Moreover, respecting the arrangement of the air supplying section, its initial cost becomes higher with increase of its complexity. So, it is also desired that the air supplying section has a more simple arrangement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">The object of the present invention is to provide a painting facility that allows a more favorable painting environment to be maintained, yet allowing also energy saving through reduction of air flow amount as well as reduction of the initial cost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">According to a characterizing feature of a painting facility relating to the present invention, the painting facility comprises:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">a painting chamber in which a spray painting operation is effected on a painting object;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">an air supplying chamber configured to supply air into the painting chamber via an air supplying section provided in a ceiling portion of the painting chamber; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">an air discharging chamber configured to suction air and uncoated paint mist present in the painting chamber via a floor discharging section of the painting chamber;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">wherein two said air supplying sections are disposed in left-right symmetry relative to a position of the painting object in a width direction of the painting chamber as the center therebetween;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">air is released in a radial form from an outlet portion of each one of the two air supplying sections; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">in the outlet portion, there are provided at least two kinds of air velocity areas providing different air outlet velocities in accordance with outlet directions of the air.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">With the above-described arrangement, as there are provided at least two kinds of air velocity areas providing different air outlet velocities in accordance with outlet directions of the air, it becomes readily possible to form a low-velocity descending flow and a high-velocity descending flow on the upper side and the lateral side of the painting object, respectively. With the low-velocity descending flow formed on the upper side of the painting object, occurrence of scattering and stagnation of uncoated paint mist is suppressed, whereby the coating efficiency is improved and the color casting phenomenon among the painting objects is prevented also. Further, with the high-velocity descending flow formed on the lateral side of the painting object, uncoated paint mist can be caused to flow down and adhesion of paint to the painting device or the lateral wall face of the painting chamber can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Therefore, through combination of a plurality of kinds of air velocity areas providing different air outlet velocities from each other, a favorable painting environment can be maintained; and also, the air flow amount can be reduced significantly, as compared with the conventional painting facility with the air supplying section provided over the substantially entire ceiling face. This arrangement not only allows reduction of the fan power, but also leads to reduction of air-conditioning load or air-discharging treatment load, compactization of the facility and reduction of the facility cost. Furthermore, since the arrangement of the air supplying section is simple, there is no increase of the initial cost, either.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">the outlet portion includes a low air velocity area and a high air velocity area, an air outlet velocity of the air released from the low air velocity area being set lower than an air outlet velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">in the high air velocity area, the air is released in a horizontal direction on the side of the painting object and a downward perpendicular direction; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">in the low air velocity area, the air is released in an obliquely downward direction on the side of the painting object, an obliquely downward direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber and in a horizontal direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">With the above-described arrangement, as the air released in the horizontal direction on the side of the painting object is provided with a high velocity, these flows of air collide each other at the center portion between the two air supplying sections, thus being formed together into a descending flow, which eliminates uncoated paint mist present upwardly of the painting object and with increase in the air velocity between the painting objects in the advancing direction of these painting objects, color casting phenomenon is effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">Further, as the air flow released in the downward perpendicular direction is provided with a high velocity, it becomes easy to eliminate uncoated paint mist which is generated at the time of painting the lateral face of the painting object.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">Whereas, as the air flow released in the obliquely downward direction on the side of the painting object is provided with a low velocity, vortex flow will hardly occur at the portion bound between the high air velocity area corresponding to the horizontal direction on the side of the painting object and the high air velocity area corresponding to the downward perpendicular direction, so that a stagnant area where stagnation of uncoated paint mist tends to occur can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">Moreover, as the air flow released in the obliquely downward direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber and the air flow released in the horizontal direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber are provided respectively with a low velocity, in addition to the prevention of vortex flow generation, it is also possible to prevent the uncoated paint mist from reaching the painting device or the lateral wall of the painting chamber, so that soiling thereof can be lessened.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">the outlet portion includes a low air velocity area and a high air velocity area, an air outlet velocity of the air released from the low air velocity area being set lower than an air outlet velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area; and in the high air velocity area, the air is released in a horizontal direction on the side of the painting object; and in the low air velocity area, the air is released in an obliquely downward direction on the side of the painting object, a downward perpendicular direction, an obliquely downward direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber and in a horizontal direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">With the above-described arrangement, as the air released in the horizontal direction on the side of the painting object is provided with a high velocity, the these flows of air collide each other at the center portion between the two air supplying sections, thus being formed together into a descending flow, which eliminates uncoated paint mist present upwardly of the painting object and with increase in the air velocity between the painting objects in the advancing direction of these painting objects, color casting phenomenon is effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">Further, as the air flow released in an obliquely downward direction on the side of the painting object, the air flow released in a downward perpendicular direction, the air flow released in an obliquely downward direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber and the air flow released in a horizontal direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber are provided respectively with a low velocity, in addition to the prevention of vortex flow generation, it is possible to prevent the uncoated paint mist from reaching the painting device or the lateral wall of the painting chamber, so that soiling thereof can be lessened.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably, the velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area ranges from 0.3 m/s to 0.7 m/s.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">With the above-described arrangement, it becomes readily possible to discharge the uncoated paint mist from the painting chamber speedily, while reducing adhesion of paint to the painting device or the lateral wall face of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">the velocity of the air released from the low air velocity area is from 30% to 70% of the velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">With the above-described arrangement, the effect of reducing the air flow amount can be enhanced while preventing generation of vortex of the air flow upwardly of the painting object which will lead to stagnation of the uncoated paint mist.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">each one of the two air supplying section is disposed on more outer side than the right end and the left end of the painting object in the width direction of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">With the above-described arrangement, it becomes easy to block the flow of uncoated paint mist having a horizontal velocity component by the descending flows from the air supplying sections, thus reducing the possibility of soiling of the lateral wall of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">a vertical cross sectional shape of the air supplying section is an approximately semicircular shape and a curved portion of this approximately semicircular shape forms the outlet portion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">With the above-described arrangement, along the curved portion of the approximately semicircular shape, air can be released in a radial form more uniformly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">the diameter of the approximately semicircular shape of the air supplying section is set such that an average air velocity in the painting chamber ranges from 0.075 m/s to 0.25 m/s.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">With the above-described arrangement, stagnation of the uncoated paint mist hardly occurs in the low velocity descending flows formed upwardly of the painting object and also the velocity of the descending flows formed upwardly of the painting object is prevented from becoming too high, so that the flow amount reducing effect can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">In the painting facility relating to the present invention, preferably:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">a pendant wall portion is provided at the center portion between the two air supplying sections in the ceiling portion of the painting chamber.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">With the above-described arrangement, it is possible to decrease irregularity of the air flow velocities on the left and right opposed sides of the painting chamber across the center portion between the two air supplying sections, while reducing velocity energy loss of the air flow released in the horizontal direction on the side of the painting object.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

In case the velocity of the air released from the low air velocity area L is less than 30% of the velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area H, there will be formed a vortex of air flow upwardly of the painting object W, which leads to higher tendency of stagnation of the uncoated paint mist. Conversely, if the velocity of the air released from the low air velocity area L exceeds 70% of the velocity of the air released from the high air velocity area H, there may sometimes occur a situation of the effect of air flow reducing amount becoming weaker.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0091">As described above, with provision in the outlet portion <b>40</b> of at least two kinds of air velocity areas providing air outlet velocities different from each other according to the air discharging directions, it becomes easier to form a low velocity descending flow and a high velocity descending flow on the upper side and the lateral sides of the painting object W, respectively. The low velocity descending flow formed upwardly of the painting object W serves to reduce the possibility of scattering and stagnation of the uncoated paint mist, whereby the coating efficiency is improved and color casting phenomenon among the painting objects is prevented also.

This leads also to not only reduction in the fan power, but also to reduction of the air conditioning load and air discharging treatment load, compactization of the facility and cost reduction of the facility.

Incidentally, if the air flow released in the obliquely downward direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber <b>3</b> and the air flow released in the horizontal direction on the side of the lateral wall of the painting chamber <b>3</b> are provided with high velocity, this may invite generation of vortex, thus providing adverse opposite effect.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0097">Further, in the foregoing embodiment, the descending flow at the center portion (upwardly of the painting object W) in the width direction of the painting chamber <b>3</b> provides an air flow velocity distribution having a chevron shape. Namely, by increasing the air flow velocity (dynamic pressure) at the center of the chevron and by decreasing the air flow velocity (dynamic pressure) on the left and right opposed sides of the center of the chevron, it is possible to reduce the static pressure at the center of the chevron and to increase the static pressures on the left and right opposed sides of the center, whereby air flows will be gathered at the center and prevention of scattering and speedy discharge of uncoated paint mist are made possible.

By the air supplying method combining these low velocity descending flows and the high velocity descending flow, it becomes possible to reduce the air flow amount of the painting facility as a whole by 40% to 50%, in comparison with the conventional painting facility (forming uniform descending flow of 0. 3 m/s) having an air supplying section provided over the substantially entire ceiling face.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">(Maintenance Method of Air Supplying Sections]</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">In case the dustproof filter <b>42</b> of the air supplying section in this embodiment is to be replaced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the used dustproof filter <b>42</b> can be removed by upwardly rotating the air flow adjusting punching member <b>41</b> having the rectifying plate <b>20</b> about the hinge portion <b>21</b> as the pivotal center.
