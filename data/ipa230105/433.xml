Applications</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Generally, the EEG headset <b>100</b> defines a singular structure containing a set of integrated electrodes arranged across a set of adjustable bands that can be expanded and retracted to fit heads of various shapes and sizes. The set of adjustable bands are arranged in particular orientations and are configured to locate both fixed and adjustable electrodes in specific locations according to the 10-20 system (or other electrode placement standard). The set of integrated electrodes in the EEG headset <b>100</b> includes both: fixed electrodes, such as arranged at each junction and along the anteroposterior centerline of various bands; and adjustable electrodes that can be adjusted along a limited adjustment range to re-center these electrodes following adjustment of their corresponding bands. In particular, the EEG headset <b>100</b> includes mechanisms supporting both a limited number of macro adjustments at various bands and a limited number of micro adjustments at adjustable electrodes to realize electrode placement rules defined by the 10-20 system (or other electrode placement standard) within a positional tolerance of the 10-20 system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">During setup of the EEG headset <b>100</b> on a user in preparation for an EEG test, an EEG test administrator can place the EEG headset <b>100</b> on the user's head and adjust the effective length of each band via band adjusters in order to achieve a sufficiently close fit between each band and the user's scalp. Because certain electrodes within the EEG headset <b>100</b> (e.g., electrodes at the F<b>7</b>, F<b>3</b>, F<b>4</b>, F<b>8</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, T<b>5</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>, and T<b>6</b> positions, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) may no longer be properly centered between adjacent fixed electrodes, the EEG test administrator can then adjust these electrodes locally via their electrode adjusters to bring the complete set of electrodes back into alignment with the 10-20 system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The junctions and bands within the EEG headset <b>100</b> can define semi-rigid structures configured to accurately and repeatably locate electrodes on a user's head according to the 10-20 system (or other electrode placement standard). Furthermore, each electrode can be integrated into and irremovable from the EEG headset <b>100</b> (except for electrode tips, which may be replaceable, as described below) such that sense signals read from each electrode during an EEG test can be automatically tagged&#x2014;by the EEG headset <b>100</b> or connected computing device&#x2014;with a correct channel label based on predefined locations of each electrode within the EEG.

For example, the EEG headset <b>100</b> can include: a first support block <b>161</b> arranged on the first band <b>121</b> between the first electrode <b>140</b> and the second electrode <b>152</b>, extending toward a median of a lateral axis coinciding with the left junction <b>110</b> and the right junction <b>112</b>, and defining a first surface facing the lateral axis and configured to rest against a head of a user; and a second support block <b>162</b> arranged on the first band <b>121</b> adjacent the second electrode <b>152</b> laterally opposite the first support block <b>161</b>, extending toward the median of the lateral axis, and defining a second surface facing the lateral axis and configured to rest against the head of the user.

In particular, the electrode tip <b>144</b> of the second element can extend inwardly past the soft surfaces of the support blocks by a minimal distance (e.g., approximately three millimeters) at full extension, and the spring element <b>149</b> can bias the second electrode <b>152</b> to full extension. When the EEG headset <b>100</b> is placed on a user's head, the tip of the second electrode <b>152</b> can fall against the user's scalp, and the weight of the EEG headset <b>100</b> over the second electrode <b>152</b> can compress the spring element <b>149</b> in the second electrode <b>152</b>, thereby collapsing the second electrode <b>152</b> until the adjacent support blocks contact the user's scalp.

In particular, rather than maintaining contact between the electrode tip <b>144</b> of the second electrode <b>152</b> and the user's scalp while moving the second electrode <b>152</b> laterally along its electrode adjuster <b>141</b>, while may be uncomfortable for the user and cause the electrode tip <b>144</b> to separate from the electrode body <b>142</b>, an EEG test administrator may: grip the shoulder <b>145</b> between her thumb and forefinger (with the base of the thumb adjacent the first band <b>121</b>); retract the second electrode <b>152</b> toward the first band <b>121</b> to separate the electrode tip <b>144</b> from the user's scalp; draw the second electrode <b>152</b> laterally to a target position&#x2014;indicated by electrode position labels <b>147</b>&#x2014;on the electrode adjuster <b>141</b>; and then release the shoulder <b>145</b>. The spring element <b>149</b> can thus drive the electrode tip <b>144</b> forward and back into contact with the user's scalp and retain the electrode tip <b>144</b> in contact with the user's scalp within the target electrode tip <b>144</b> force range.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the electrodes can include replaceable electrode tips <b>144</b> of various geometries.

Furthermore, each sense electrode in an electrode array can include: a discrete substrate; a discrete set of electrically-conductive prongs extending from a first side of the substrate; and a discrete amplifier coupled to the substrate opposite the set of prongs and configured to amplify an electrical signal passing through the set of prongs. In particular, each electrode in an electrode array can be electrically isolated from other electrodes in the electrode array and can be selectively activated and deactivated independently of other electrodes in the same electrode array, such as by connecting and disconnecting the electrode from both power and ground terminals in the EEG headset <b>100</b>.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">5.1 Manual Activation</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one implementation, an EEG test administrator (or the user, etc.) enters a final adjustment position for each band&#x2014;such as read from a scale arranged between the left and right junctions <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and each band&#x2014;into the native EEG test application executing on the connected computing device; and the native EEG test application maps a final adjustment position for each band to known positions of electrode arrays along each band to select a particular electrode in each electrode array that best fulfills electrode position rules specified by the 10-20 system.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one example, for the second band <b>122</b> that supports an F<b>3</b> electrode array at the F<b>3</b> position, an F<b>4</b> electrode array at the F<b>4</b> position, and a fixed Fz electrode at the Fz position, the native EEG test application accesses a lookup table or electrode map defining a position of each electrode in each of the F<b>3</b> and F<b>4</b> electrode arrays relative to the fixed Fz electrode. The native EEG test application can also retrieve a lookup table or parametric model (e.g., a mathematical equation) linking adjustment positions of the second band <b>122</b> to an effective distance between the fixed Fz electrode and the fixed T<b>3</b> (or T<b>4</b>) electrode. The native EEG test application then divides this effective distance by t<b>100</b>, selects a particular electrode from the electrode array at the F<b>4</b> position that falls nearest this halved effective distance, activates this particular electrode in the F<b>4</b> electrode array, and deactivates all other electrodes in the F<b>4</b> electrode array. The native EEG test application can implement similar methods and techniques to activate a particular electrode in the F<b>3</b> electrode array.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the native EEG test application can access a lookup table or other model that directly specifies electrodes in electrode arrays throughout the EEG headset <b>10</b>o that meet electrode position rules of the 10-20 system for specific adjustment positions of each band. The native EEG test application can then implement similar methods and techniques described above to select specific electrodes in electrode arrays at the F<b>7</b>, F<b>8</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>, O<b>1</b>, and O<b>2</b> positions along the first, third, fourth, and fifth bands.

The EEG headset <b>100</b> (e.g., a controller <b>184</b>) can: sample linear potentiometers coupled to each band and transform voltages read from these linear potentiometers into adjustment positions of each band; and then transform a voltage read across each linear potentiometer (or a resistance of each potentiometer) into an adjustment position of the corresponding band, such as by passing the voltage read from the potentiometer into a lookup table or mathematical model. The controller <b>184</b> can then implement methods and techniques described above to select particular electrodes in each electrode array that best fit the 10-20 system. Alternatively, the EEG headset <b>100</b> can access a lookup table that directly maps a voltage read across each potentiometer (or a resistance of each potentiometer) to a particular electrode in each electrode array on the corresponding band, as described above. The EEG headset <b>10</b>o can then activate these select electrodes and deactivate all other electrodes in the electrode arrays in the EEG headset <b>10</b>o during the subsequent EEG test.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, in this variation each band can include a positional sensor of any other type, such as a mechanical, optical, or magnetic optical encoder, as described above.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">6. Replacement Electrodes Tips</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one implementation, the sense electrodes include replaceable tips. For example, each sense electrode can include a magnetic element <b>143</b> adjacent or behind a terminal electrically coupled to an input of an amplifier within the sense electrode and configured to retain a removable electrode tip containing a ferrous element <b>148</b>. In this example, the magnetic element <b>143</b> in each sense electrode can be configured to retain any of: an elastic bristle electrode tip; a rigid prong electrode tip; a flat contact disk electrode tip; a domed contact disk electrode tip; and/or any other type or geometry of electrode tip. Alternatively, each electrode can include a mechanical electrode tip retainer (e.g., a latch) configured to accept, retain, and then release an electrode tip.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the variation described above in which the EEG headset <b>10</b>o includes electrode arrays, each electrode array can similarly include a magnetic element <b>143</b> or other mechanical feature configured to retain a removable array of like electrode tips <b>144</b> containing a ferrous element <b>148</b> or other mating feature. In this example, each array of electrode tips <b>144</b> can include multiple discrete and electrically isolated electrode tips <b>144</b> arranged in a single assembly that can be installed and then removed from an electrode array.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">However, each electrode or electrode array in the EEG headset <b>100</b> can be configured to transiently receive electrode tips <b>144</b> (e.g., replacement electrode tips) of any other type or geometry.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">7. Control Module</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the EEG headset <b>100</b> further includes a controller <b>184</b>, a signal processor, a battery, and/or a wireless communication module <b>183</b> arranged within a control module <b>180</b> coupled to or physically coextensive with the fifth band <b>125</b> (or with the central body described above). Generally, the control module <b>180</b> can contain various controls, communication, and power components of the EEG headset <b>100</b> and can be mounted to or integrated into the rearmost (e.g., the fifth) band in order to: maintain access to various related controls and ports; limiting obstruction to the user's vision and movements; and/or to counterbalance the EEG headset <b>100</b>, thereby improving stability of the EEG headset <b>100</b> during an EEG test.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, the EEG headset <b>100</b> can include: a fifth band <b>125</b> spanning the left junction <b>110</b> and the right junction <b>112</b> and configured to extend proximal a base of a skull of a user when the EEG headset <b>100</b> is <b>100</b>rn on the head of the user; a housing <b>181</b> arranged on the fifth band <b>125</b>; and a battery <b>182</b>, a controller <b>184</b>, and a wireless transmitter <b>183</b> arranged in the housing <b>181</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. In this example, the controller <b>184</b> can be configured to read a set of analog sense signals from active electrodes within the EEG headset <b>100</b> (e.g., the first electrode <b>140</b>, the second electrode <b>152</b>, the third electrode <b>153</b>, etc.) during an EEG test performed at the EEG headset <b>100</b>, such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/351,016. In this example, the wireless transmitter <b>183</b> can wirelessly transmit digital representations of the set of analog sense signals recorded by the controller <b>184</b>, such as to a remote database via a local hub or wireless router in real-time during the EEG test.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The EEG headset <b>100</b> can also include a set of wires passing from the control module <b>180</b> (or the fifth band <b>125</b>) to sense electrodes in other bands throughout the EEG headset <b>100</b> and configured to communicate sense signals from the sense electrodes back to the controller <b>184</b> and/or signal processor.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">However, the control module <b>180</b> can be arranged within or distributed across the EEG headset <b>100</b> in any other form or format. Elements of the control module <b>180</b> can also be integrated into the connected computing device (e.g., the controller <b>184</b> or processor), and sensor signals and control commands can be communicated between the connected computing device and the EEG headset <b>100</b> via a wired or wireless connection.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">8. Drive and Reference Electrodes</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The EEG headset <b>100</b> can also include a reference electrode and a drive electrode (or a &#x201c;driven right leg&#x201d; electrode), as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/351,016. Like each sense electrode, the drive electrode can define a dry EEG sensor, and including: a substrate; an electrode tip extending from or (transiently) electrically coupled to a first side of the substrate; and an amplifier coupled to the substrate opposite the electrode tip and configured to amplify an electrical signal detected by the electrode tip. In this implementation, the amplifier can output a low-impedance reference signal that follows a high-impedance reference signal read at the electrode tip to the signal processor or controller <b>184</b> described above. However, the drive electrode can include any other type of dry- or wet-type EEG electrode and can output any other signal to the signal processor or controller <b>184</b>. The drive electrode can include a fixed or interchangeable electrode tip of a similar geometry.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one implementation, the drive electrode is fixedly mounted to the first band <b>121</b> between sense electrodes in the FP<b>1</b> and FP<b>2</b> positions. Alternatively, the drive electrode can be mounted to a beam that pivots or extends downwardly from the right junction <b>112</b> or from the right side of the control module <b>180</b>; the beam can be configured to locate and depress the drive electrode onto the user's skin, such as below the user's right ear. The reference electrode can be similarly mounted to a beam that pivots or extends downwardly from the left junction <b>110</b> or from the left side of the control module <b>180</b> to locate and depress the reference electrode onto the user's skin, such as below the user's left ear.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Alternatively, the EEG headset <b>100</b> can include a sixth band configured to drop (e.g., pivot downwardly) from the fifth band <b>125</b>, and the drive and reference electrodes can be mounted to the sixth band. In yet another implementation, the drive and reference electrodes can be coupled to loose, elastic wires configured to (transiently) plug into the control module <b>180</b> and can be configured to stick onto or to be taped onto the user's skin substantially remotely from the user's scalp. However, the drive and reference electrodes can be arranged within the EEG headset <b>100</b> in any other way.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">9. Optical Detector</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one variation, the EEG headset <b>100</b> further includes an optical detector <b>190</b> facing outwardly from the front band (e.g., configured to lie across a user's forehead) and configured to output a signal that follows variations in local light intensity. In this variation, the controller <b>184</b> can record a first EEG signal output by a first electrode <b>140</b> in the EEG headset <b>100</b> to a first sense channel and record a second EEG signal output by a second electrode <b>152</b> in the EEG headset <b>100</b> to a second sense channel; record a third EEG signal output by the third electrode <b>153</b> in the EEG headset <b>100</b> to a third sense channel; etc., as described above. The controller <b>184</b> can also record a signal output by the optical detector <b>190</b> to a strobe channel synchronized to the first sense channel, the second sense channel, and the third sense channel.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, in this variation, the optical detector <b>190</b> can output a signal that follows the intensity of light output by an active strobe light (or &#x201c;photic stimulator&#x201d;) facing a user during an EEG test; and the controller <b>184</b> can record the output of the optical detector <b>190</b> to a strobe channel temporally synchronized to sense channels for each sense electrodes in the EEG headset <b>100</b>. For example, during each sampling period (e.g., at a rate of 500 Hz) during an EEG test, the controller <b>184</b> can: write digital representations of the voltage at each sense electrode during the current sampling period to its corresponding sense channel; read the analog output of the optical detector <b>190</b> during the current sampling period; write a HI (or &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;) value to the strobe channel if the value of the analog output signal of the optical detector <b>190</b> exceeds a threshold value; and write a LO (or &#x201c;o&#x201d;) value to the strobe channel if the value of the analog output signal of the optical detector <b>190</b> is less than a threshold value. In this example, the controller <b>184</b> can repeat this process for each sampling period to record synchronized, temporal representations of electrical activity at various regions of the user's brain and strobe light activity near the user over the duration of an EEG test.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="2">10. Tape</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one variation, the EEG headset <b>100</b> accompanies a measurement tape. In this variation, the measurement tape can include: a first side containing a centerline measurement scale; and a second side containing a circumferential measurement scale. During setup, an EEG test administrator can run the measurement tape&#x2014;first side facing up&#x2014;from the base of a user's skull to the user's forehead, read a value from the measurement tape representing this centerline distance, and then set band adjusters in the second, third, and fourth bands in the EEG headset <b>100</b> such that their corresponding scales read this value. The EEG test administrator can thus adjust the second, third, and fourth bands&#x2014;that extend over the top of the user's skull&#x2014;to initial positions that may accept the user's upper skull shape and size and that may approximate final adjustment settings of the EEG headset <b>100</b> for the user, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The EEG test administrator can then run the measurement tape&#x2014;second side facing out&#x2014;from around the circumference of the user's skull just above the user's ears, read a value from the measurement tape representing this circumferential distance, and then set band adjusters in the first and fifth bands in the EEG headset <b>100</b> such that their corresponding scales read this value. The EEG test administrator can thus adjust the first and fifth bands&#x2014;that wrap around the circumference of the user's skull&#x2014;to initial positions that may accept the full breadth and length of the user head and that may approximate final adjustment settings of the EEG headset <b>100</b> for the user.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once initial adjustment positions of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth bands of the EEG headset <b>100</b> are thus set based on values read from the measurement tape, the EEG test administrator can place the EEG headset <b>100</b> onto the user's head and make final adjustments to the bands via the band adjusters to achieve proper contact between the sense electrodes and the user's skin.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The systems and methods described herein can be embodied and/or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer-readable medium storing computer-readable instructions.
