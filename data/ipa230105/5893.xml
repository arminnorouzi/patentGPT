In addition, the light-emitting element <b>220</b> and its driving circuit layer <b>230</b> are integrated into the light-emitting unit <b>200</b>, so that the light-emitting unit <b>200</b> can be manufactured by using the same photomasks and can be matched with the circuit board <b>100</b> of different designs, so as to reduce the number of photomasks required to manufacture different products of the circuit board <b>100</b>, thereby reducing the production costs.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the implementation of each element of the display device <b>10</b> will be described, but the disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> both, the light-emitting unit <b>200</b> of the display device <b>10</b> may be arranged in an array on the circuit board <b>100</b>, but the disclosure is not limited thereto.

In addition, the light-emitting element and its driver circuit are integrated into the light-emitting unit, so that the same type of photomasks can be used for manufacturing the light-emitting units, thereby reducing production costs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Although the present disclosure has been disclosed in the above embodiments, it is not intended to limit the present disclosure. Anyone with ordinary knowledge in the relevant technical field can make some changes and modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.
