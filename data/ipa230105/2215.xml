The void fraction reduces mass and/or thermal mass of the extender <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example of an apparatus <b>1</b>. The apparatus <b>1</b> comprises the thermally-actuated microactuator <b>10</b> and the extender <b>12</b>. A combination of a microactuator <b>10</b> and an extender <b>12</b> may form a beam <b>3</b> (microactuator beam). The microactuator <b>10</b> is the part of the apparatus <b>1</b> configured to supply mechanical energy in dependence on the applied stimulus. The extender <b>12</b> does not supply actuation energy. For example, the extender <b>12</b> may be configured not to receive the stimulus.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, but not necessarily in all examples, the mechanical energy output by the microactuator <b>10</b> is resilient deflection. Resilient deflection implies that the microactuator <b>10</b> stays in its elastically deflected state while held in that state by actuation force and returns to its neutral equilibrium shape when the actuation force is released. Elastic deflection implies that the deflection is reproducible without causing plastic deformation. The applied stimulus may be configured to control curvature of the microactuator <b>10</b>, to cause the deflection. Therefore, the deflection may be a form of contortion that controls curvature. The applied stimulus may be electrical resistive heating as described herein, or another stimulus causing thermal actuation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown, the beam <b>3</b> may be cantilevered, because a cantilever is more flexible than a beam supported at multiple locations along its length. In some, but not necessarily all examples, a beam <b>3</b> may comprise no more than one microactuator <b>10</b>. The microactuator <b>10</b> may be operably coupled to a component <b>14</b> to be actuated via the extender <b>12</b>. The beam <b>3</b> may at least partially support the component <b>14</b>. In the Figures, a fixed end <b>2</b> of the microactuator <b>10</b> is secured to a rigid body such as a substrate. The extender <b>12</b> is located to the free end of the microactuator <b>10</b>. The extender <b>12</b> terminates at a free end which is a tip region of the cantilever.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The component <b>14</b> is operably coupled to the free end of the extender <b>12</b>, for example at a tip region of the extender <b>12</b>. The component <b>14</b> may be coupled to the extender <b>12</b> via a separate coupling means (e.g. coupling member <b>16</b>) as illustrated, or alternatively the component <b>14</b> may be directly coupled to the extender <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The coupling member <b>16</b> comprises the same or a different material from the extender <b>12</b>. The coupling member <b>16</b> may have a smaller cross-sectional area than the extender <b>12</b>. In some, but not necessarily all examples the coupling member <b>16</b> comprises a spring such as a serpentine spring.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, but not necessarily all examples, the component <b>14</b> is suspended from the ends of the beams <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>d </i>by the coupling members <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<b>16</b><i>d</i>. This floating method of supporting the component <b>14</b> reduces the energy required to deflect the component <b>14</b> and/or enables more degrees of freedom of deflection.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The extender <b>12</b> functions as a length-extending beam (&#x2018;extender beam&#x2019;) to enable a reduced-length microactuator <b>10</b> without substantially reducing the range of deflection. Reducing the length of the microactuator <b>10</b> reduces the thermal response time of the microactuator <b>10</b>. Therefore, an applied stimulus can achieve the same range of deflection in a shorter time period. In this case, the tip region is moved by a similar distance as achievable with a full-length microactuator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some, but not necessarily all examples the length L<b>2</b> of the extender <b>12</b> is at least 25% of the length of the microactuator <b>10</b>. The length L<b>1</b> of the microactuator <b>10</b> may be some or all of the remaining span from the fixed end <b>2</b>. For the purposes of this disclosure, the span does not include the coupling member <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The length L<b>2</b> may be equal to or less than L<b>1</b> within a suitable margin. Alternatively, L<b>2</b> could be longer than L<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top-down view of the example apparatus <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the extender <b>12</b> comprises one or more voids <b>22</b>, to reduce thermal mass of the extender <b>12</b>. A high thermal mass increases response times, defined as the time taken to reach steady state. This is because heat is conducted through the microactuator <b>10</b> to the extender <b>12</b>, so an extender <b>12</b> with a greater thermal mass would require a greater amount of heat to pass through the microactuator <b>10</b>, to achieve steady state. Therefore, it is desirable for the extender <b>12</b> to have the lowest possible thermal mass relative to that of the microactuator <b>10</b>. A technical effect of the one or more voids <b>22</b> is that response times are improved.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thermal mass depends on mass, density and specific heat capacity, and in this case the void fraction reduces the mass of the extender <b>12</b>, and the effective density of the shape.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some, but not necessarily all examples the void fraction of the extender <b>12</b> is at least 25% and/or less than 85%. Void fraction is a percentage/fraction of the volume of void space relative to the total volume of the extender <b>12</b>. This range provides an optimum compromise of: reduced response time due to a sufficient reduction in thermal mass; and sufficient mechanical stability.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The voids <b>22</b> may comprise accessible (open) voids as shown herein, and/or internal inaccessible voids.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the extender <b>12</b> may comprise a framework <b>20</b> of spaced members (<b>20</b><i>a</i>- . . . <b>20</b><i>n</i>)- . . . <b>20</b><i>n</i>) (&#x2018;frame members&#x2019;) separated by voids (<b>22</b><i>a</i>- . . . <b>22</b><i>n</i>) where &#x2018;n&#x2019; is the total number of members. The members are elongated and thin relative to the width of the microactuator <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although four voids <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the extender <b>12</b> may be regarded as comprising one or more voids <b>22</b>. The number of voids <b>22</b> is dependent on the specific implementation. However, having multiple spatially distributed voids <b>22</b> can provide greater mechanical strength against bending and/or twisting than having only one large void <b>22</b>. In the Figures, the framework <b>20</b> defines a matrix pattern of voids <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>arranged in a plurality of rows and a plurality of columns, such as 2&#xd7;2 or 5&#xd7;2.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the Figures, but not necessarily in all examples, the frame members comprise first members <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c</i>, and one or more second cross-members <b>20</b><i>d</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>interconnecting two or more first members <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c</i>. The first members <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>may be relatively long members and the cross-members <b>20</b><i>d</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>may be relatively short members. A void <b>22</b> is the internal area defined by three or more of the members <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e</i>, in cross-section view.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a plurality of parallel first members <b>20</b><i>a</i>- . . . <b>20</b><i>n</i>, separated across the width of the microactuator <b>10</b>.

Optical coherence tomography is an imaging technique that uses low-coherence light to capture micrometre-resolution images (2D or 3D) from within optical scattering samples such as biological tissue. Optical coherence tomography can be used for medical imaging and nondestructive testing. Optical coherence tomography generally uses low-coherence interferometry, and usually the light is in the near-infrared spectrum.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Optical coherence tomography systems may be used for non-invasive health monitoring. Optical coherence tomography systems generally scan a laser at discrete points in a shaped (e.g. rectangular) array on the skin surface that is being scanned. A depth scan is performed at each array point by sweeping the wavelength. The scanned volume could be up to ten millimetres cubed or more, depending on factors such as required resolution and scanning speed. Back-scattered light is detected during each array point scan and provides structural and/or chemical composition information. It is desirable to perform this scan quickly, so that information is acquired as rapidly as possible, which aids in the usefulness and applicability of the approach. A related factor is that if a scan takes too long, a patient may move, and the scan is no longer accurate. Some fast MEMS-based techniques require high electrical voltage to maintain high scan rates. High required voltages is impeding the development of portable optical coherence tomography systems with handheld scanners. Some MEMS-based techniques are too slow when using lower electrical voltages.

Thus &#x2018;example&#x2019;, &#x2018;for example&#x2019;, &#x2018;can&#x2019; or &#x2018;may&#x2019; refers to a particular instance in a class of examples. A property of the instance can be a property of only that instance or a property of the class or a property of a sub-class of the class that includes some but not all of the instances in the class. It is therefore implicitly disclosed that a feature described with reference to one example but not with reference to another example, can where possible be used in that other example as part of a working combination but does not necessarily have to be used in that other example.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although examples have been described in the preceding paragraphs with reference to various examples, it should be appreciated that modifications to the examples given can be made without departing from the scope of the claims. For example, the component <b>14</b> could be an optical component for other applications that require fast movement, such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Alternatively, the component <b>14</b> could be other than an optical component, such as a capacitor plate. Features of the apparatus such as the extender may be applied to a microactuator beam configured to be actuated by another means than thermal actuation, such as magnetic actuation or electro-static actuation. This can provide advantages such as reducing the overall material mass required to span a particular distance, as the extender is lighter per unit length than many types of microactuator beam.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Features described in the preceding description may be used in combinations other than the combinations explicitly described above.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although functions have been described with reference to certain features, those functions may be performable by other features whether described or not.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although features have been described with reference to certain examples, those features may also be present in other examples whether described or not.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The term &#x2018;a&#x2019; or &#x2018;the&#x2019; is used in this document with an inclusive not an exclusive meaning. That is any reference to X comprising a/the Y indicates that X may comprise only one Y or may comprise more than one Y unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. If it is intended to use &#x2018;a&#x2019; or &#x2018;the&#x2019; with an exclusive meaning then it will be made clear in the context. In some circumstances the use of &#x2018;at least one&#x2019; or &#x2018;one or more&#x2019; may be used to emphasis an inclusive meaning but the absence of these terms should not be taken to infer and exclusive meaning.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The presence of a feature (or combination of features) in a claim is a reference to that feature or (combination of features) itself and also to features that achieve substantially the same technical effect (equivalent features). The equivalent features include, for example, features that are variants and achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way. The equivalent features include, for example, features that perform substantially the same function, in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this description, reference has been made to various examples using adjectives or adjectival phrases to describe characteristics of the examples. Such a description of a characteristic in relation to an example indicates that the characteristic is present in some examples exactly as described and is present in other examples substantially as described.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Whilst endeavoring in the foregoing specification to draw attention to those features believed to be of importance it should be understood that the Applicant may seek protection via the claims in respect of any patentable feature or combination of features hereinbefore referred to and/or shown in the drawings whether or not emphasis has been placed thereon.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-15" num="01-15"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>15</b>.
