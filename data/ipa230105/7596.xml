When the following description refers to the drawings, unless otherwise indicated, the same numerals in different drawings indicate the same or similar elements. The embodiments described below do not represent all embodiments consistent with the present disclosure. Rather, they are merely examples of apparatus and method consistent with some aspects of the present disclosure, as recited in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">It should be understood that &#x201c;several&#x201d; as referred to herein means one or more, and &#x201c;a plurality&#x201d; as referred to herein means two or more. &#x201c;And/or&#x201d; describes an association relationship between associated objects and indicates that there may be three relationships. For example, A and/or B may indicate that there are three cases where A exists separately, A and B exist at the same time, and B exists separately. The character &#x201c;/&#x201d; generally indicates that an &#x201c;or&#x201d; relationship exists between contextual objects.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">At present, the safety standard for electromagnetic radiation of terminals on human body is expressed by electromagnetic wave absorption ratio or rate (i.e., Specific Absorption Rate, SAR) and maximum permissible exposure (MPE) internationally. SAR is mainly for a low frequency band, such as a frequency band below 6 GHz, while MPE is mainly for a millimeter wave band.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">To reduce the impact of terminal transmitting on human safety, it is usually to perform a certain power reduction on the basis of transmit power or reduce an uplink dutycycle of terminal transmitting to meet requirements of SAR or MPE. For example, in 3rd generation partner project (3GPP) radio frequency (RF) standards, a maximum allowed UE output power reduction (P-MPR) is specially introduced, and for a high power terminal, the terminal needs to report a maximum uplink dutycycle capability. When a scheduled uplink dutycycle is greater than the maximum uplink dutycycle, the terminal reduces a transmit level or transmit power. The above method is very effective to meet requirements of low frequency SAR.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">However, in a millimeter wave band, since a beam is narrow, the radiation is concentrated. Once the beam is toward a human body, a power reduction of up to 20 dB may be required to meet the requirements of MPE. For such a sudden large power reduction, it is extremely easy to cause the sudden failure of communication links.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">On the other hand, since the terminal needs to continuously detect whether the beam is toward the human body, the terminal needs to consume more power for the detection of a beam direction, which affects the cruise ability of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">Subsequent embodiments of the present disclosure provide a solution for electromagnetic radiation safety control in a beamforming scenario, so that the power consumption of the terminal in the process of the electromagnetic radiation safety control can be reduced while the terminal meets the standard for electromagnetic radiation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an implementation environment involved in safety control methods according to some embodiments.
