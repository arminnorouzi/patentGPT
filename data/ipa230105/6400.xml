The spike <b>14</b> can penetrate a support surface <b>16</b> thereby retaining the housing <b>12</b> on the support surface <b>16</b>. The support surface <b>16</b> may be the ground or other horizontal support surface. The housing <b>12</b> has a bottom wall <b>18</b>, a top wall <b>20</b> and an outer wall <b>22</b> extending between the top wall <b>20</b> and the bottom wall <b>18</b>, and the bottom wall <b>18</b> has a well <b>24</b> extending upwardly toward the top wall <b>20</b>. The well <b>24</b> has a bounding surface <b>26</b> and the bounding surface <b>26</b> is threaded. The outer wall <b>22</b> has a front side <b>28</b> and a back side <b>30</b>, and the front side <b>28</b> has a pair of outlet openings <b>32</b> each extending into an interior of the housing <b>12</b>. The outlet openings <b>32</b> are spaced apart from each other and are distributed between the bottom wall <b>18</b> and the top wall <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The spike <b>14</b> has a top end <b>34</b> and a bottom end <b>36</b>, and the spike <b>14</b> tapers to a point between the top end <b>34</b> and the bottom end <b>36</b>, and an outer surface <b>38</b> of the spike <b>14</b> has a threaded portion <b>40</b> located adjacent to the top end <b>34</b>. The well <b>24</b> in the bottom wall <b>18</b> of the housing <b>12</b> insertably receives the top end <b>34</b>. Additionally, the threaded portion <b>40</b> threadably engages the bounding surface <b>26</b> of the well <b>24</b> for attaching the spike <b>14</b> to the housing <b>12</b>. The spike <b>14</b> may have a length ranging between approximately 3.0 inches and 5.0 inches.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A pair of female electrical outlets <b>42</b> is provided and each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> is integrated into the housing <b>12</b> to have a male power cord <b>44</b> plugged into the female electrical outlets <b>42</b>. The male power cord <b>44</b> may be a power cord of an electronic device <b>46</b> that requires alternating current to function. Each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> extends through a respective one of the outlet openings <b>32</b> in the front side <b>28</b> of the outer wall <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. Additionally, each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> has an exposed surface <b>48</b> with respect to the front side <b>28</b>. The exposed surface <b>48</b> of each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> has a plurality of ports <b>50</b> each is recessed into the exposed surface <b>48</b> to insertably receive a respective contact <b>51</b> on the male power cord <b>44</b>. Additionally, each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> may include electrical contacts that are positioned in each of the ports <b>50</b> and connection points that are located inside of the housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A solar panel <b>52</b> is coupled to the top wall <b>20</b> of the housing <b>12</b> such that the solar panel <b>52</b> is exposed on the housing <b>12</b> such that the solar panel <b>52</b> is exposed to sunlight. The solar panel <b>52</b> is in electrical communication with each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> to supply electrical power to the male power cord <b>44</b> that is plugged into the female electrical outlets <b>42</b>. Thus, the solar panel <b>52</b> facilitates the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> to supply electrical power in a remote location. A power converter <b>54</b> is integrated into the housing <b>12</b> and the power converter <b>54</b> has an input <b>56</b> and an output <b>58</b>. The solar panel <b>52</b> is electrically coupled to the input <b>56</b> and the output <b>58</b> is in communication with each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b>. The power converter <b>54</b> converts direct current produced by the solar panel <b>52</b> into alternating current supplied to the female electrical outlets <b>42</b>. Moreover, the power converter <b>54</b> may comprise an electronic power converter that has sufficient capacity to produce approximately 120.0 volts of alternating current.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A mating member <b>60</b> is coupled to the back side <b>30</b> of the outer wall <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b> to engage a support surface <b>16</b> for retaining the housing <b>12</b> on the support surface <b>16</b>. The mating member <b>60</b> may comprise an adhesive strip to adhesively engage the support surface <b>62</b>. The support surface <b>16</b> may be a wall, for example, or other type of vertical support surface. The mating member <b>60</b> may include a protective sheet that is removable from the mating member <b>60</b> prior to adhering the mating member <b>60</b> to the support surface <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In use, the housing <b>12</b> is positioned in a desired location outdoors and either the mating member <b>60</b> is mated to the vertical support surface <b>16</b>, or the spike <b>14</b> is attached to the housing <b>12</b> and the spike <b>14</b> is urged into the horizontal support surface <b>16</b>. In this way the solar panel <b>52</b> is exposed to sunlight and each of the female electrical outlets <b>42</b> supplies electrical power for the male power cord <b>44</b>. In this way an electronic device <b>46</b> that requires alternating current can be employed in a location that does not have electrical power.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure.
