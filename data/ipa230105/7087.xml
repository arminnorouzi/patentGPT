Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of mobile communication technology, mobile electronic devices with enhanced mobility and portability, such as smartphones, are in the spotlight. These mobile electronic devices may provide multimedia services such as music and video playback and network-based communication services such as calls, wireless Internet access, and message transmission and reception through various applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, as convergence solutions such as an integrated control and synchronization function of various electronic devices has recently become an issue, a technique for improving convenience of a user who wants to use a plurality of devices has been actively developed. As an example, there is an emerging execution environment sharing technique (e.g., a Samsung DeX service) for operating an electronic device, such as a mobile electronic device, which is becoming lighter, thinner, and smaller, in an execution environment similar to a general Personal Computer (PC) such as a desktop computer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The execution environment sharing technique may include, for example, a function by which an execution screen of an application installed in an electronic device is configured in accordance with a graphic environment of an external electronic device and the execution screen is displayed on a display of the external electronic device. In order to perform such a function, when the electronic device is coupled directly to the external electronic device via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable or mounted to a docking device coupled to the external electronic device or is coupled through wireless communication, the electronic device may transmit, to the external electronic device, data of a screen configured in accordance with the graphic environment of the external electronic device and display the screen on the display of the external electronic device by using the received data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the existing execution environment sharing technique was limited to a function of sharing the graphic environment, and thus was not able to provide a function of sharing a communication environment for a network connection. For example, when an electronic device is not able to connect to a network, even if an external electronic device is able to connect to a network, the electronic device was not able to obtain data from the network.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide a method of connecting to a network via an external electronic device connected to share an execution environment when an electronic device is not able to connect to the network, and the electronic device supporting the method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide a method of improving network connection performance via an external electronic device connected to share an execution environment when a network connection state of an electronic device is less than or equal to a specified level, and the electronic device supporting the method.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.
