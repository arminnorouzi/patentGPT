The use of those solutions for subcutaneous injection, results in demand of high concentration of solutions due to limitations on injection volume.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">General methods for purification of antibodies are well-known in the art and are for instance described in Pete Gagnon: Purification Tools for monoclonal Antibodies (1996) ISBN-9653515-9-9.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After purification of the antibody in solution, the concentration of the antibody is increased by use of ultrafiltration (UF) and then, at some point (usually around a concentration of 50 g/L antibody (mAb), the formulation buffer is diafiltrated into the solution by ultrafiltration, then the formulated solution is usually further concentrated to its final concentration of between 100 g/L and 300 g/L, without sucrose, which normally will be added to the product after final ultrafiltration concentration. During concentration of protein/antibodies by ultrafiltration, the protein concentration at the membrane surface, the so called wall concentration may increase to high levels. This can prove harmful to the protein/antibody and causes it to denature and precipitate. This is often assumed to be the reason for observed differences in the calculated protein concentration and the measured protein concentration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The problem with different concentration by calculation on basis of reduction factors against the actual measured concentration by UV280 nm absorbance in the retentate affects the yield of the ultrafiltration process. The know solution to this problem is to try to recover the protein by washing the module several times with buffers but the recovered protein will appear in greatly reduced concentrations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore a need for a method that solves the problem of denaturation and precipitation of high concentrated protein solutions during ultrafiltration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been shown that high concentration of sucrose in protein solutions can stabilize the protein in solution, especially against aggregation during prolonged storage of such solutions. However, the risk of infections may have resulted in avoiding sucrose as a component during ultrafiltration or other purification or concentration steps.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a method of ultrafiltration of a highly concentrated protein solution.

The present invention furthermore provides a method of stabilizing a highly concentrated protein solution during ultrafiltration.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It has surprisingly been discovered that the addition of sucrose to a highly concentrated protein solution before further concentration by ultrafiltration seems to protect the protein from denaturating and precipitating during ultrafiltration. This results in higher yield or recovery % of the protein and less turbidity and formation of aggregates, as measured by % HMWP during the ultrafiltration.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;protein&#x201d;, &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; as used herein means a compound composed of at least five constituent amino acids connected by peptide bonds. The constituent amino acids may be from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g. hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (a-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (&#x3b1;-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), &#x3b2;-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid and anthranilic acid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;mAb&#x201d; as used herein covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256: 495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991), for example.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The monoclonal antibodies herein may extend to include &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain (s) is (are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat.

Chemical covalent changes in the protein structure leading to formation of chemical degradation products with potential less biological potency and/or potential increased immunogenic properties compared to the native protein structure, during manufacturing process. Various chemical degradation products can be formed depending on the type and nature of the native protein and the environment to which the protein is exposed. Elimination of chemical degradation can most probably not be completely avoided and increasing amounts of chemical degradation products is often seen during storage and use of the protein composition is well-known by the person skilled in the art. Most proteins are prone to deamidation, a process in which the side chain amide group in glutaminyl or asparaginyl residues is hydrolysed to form a free carboxylic acid. Other degradation pathways involve formation of high molecular weight transformation products where two or more protein molecules are covalently bound to each other through transamidation and/or disulfide interactions leading to formation of covalently bound dimer, oligomer and polymer degradation products (Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals, Ahern. T. J. &#x26; Manning M. C., Plenum Press, New York 1992). Oxidation (of for instance methionine residues) can be mentioned as another variant of chemical degradation. The chemical stability of the protein composition can be evaluated by measuring the amount of the chemical degradation products at various time-points after exposure to different environmental conditions (the formation of degradation products can often be accelerated by for instance increasing temperature). The amount of each individual degradation product is often determined by separation of the degradation products depending on molecule size and/or charge using various chromatography techniques (e.g. SEC-HPLC and/or RP-HPLC).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There are various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability available in the art (<i>Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, </i>247-301, Vincent Lee Ed. &#x26; Marcel Dekker, N.Y. Pubs 1991; and Jones, A. <i>Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. </i>10: 29-90, 1993).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">SEC-H PLC is in particular used for quantification of protein aggregates. The samples may for instance be analysed using a TSK G3000 SWXL column, isocratic elution and subsequent UV detection at 214 or 280 nm. This method is used to determine monomeric IgG content and % High Molecular Weight Proteins (HMWP) consisting of dimeric species or larger which are separated according to size by the gel resin. The monomeric content and % HMWP are determined relative to the total protein content detected by the method.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Physical stability of protein solution can be measured by well-known methods, including measurement of attenuation of light by measurement of absorbance or optical density. Such measurements relate to the turbidity of solution.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;turbidity&#x201d; of a solution as used herein refer to the presence of cloudiness or haze in the protein solution. In protein solutions, turbidity is typically measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer at wavelengths between 320-800 nm. The degree of turbidity can be calculated by reference to a standard curve generated by solutions with known turbidity. For protein containing pharmaceutical solutions, reference standards can be based on the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) Section 2.2.1, that defines visual clarity and describes standard levels of turbidity in relation to water.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term ultrafiltration (UF) as used herein refers to a variety of membrane filtration in which hydrostatic pressure forces a liquid or a solution against a semipermeable membrane. Solutes of high molecular weight are retained (retentate), while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane (permeate or filtrate). This separation process is used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>6 </sup>Da) solutions, especially protein solutions. Ultrafiltration is especially applied in cross-flow filtration mode. The term retentate, as used herein, refers to what is retained, that is the portion or content of the liquid or solution that does not pass through the ultrafiltration membrane. The term filtrate, as used herein, refers to the portion or part of the liquid or solution that does pass the membrane during ultrafiltration and is not retained.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Concentration factor is a number which is reciprocal to the volume reduction of the retentate during ultrafiltration concentration. When the retentate volume is reduced to &#xbd;, the concentration factor will be 2. The term &#x201c;calculated concentration&#x201d; as used herein refers to an estimated concentration that is calculated by multiplying the original mAb concentration by the concentration factor.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term &#x201c;yield&#x201d; or &#x201c;recovery %&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the amount of protein recovered in during the ultrafiltration step or steps, in the retentate or retentates if multiply ultrafiltration or washing steps have been performed, compared with the total amount of protein in the starting protein solution to be ultrafiltrated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term cross-flow filtration as used herein refers to a protein purification method, also known as tangential flow filtration that is a type of filtration (a particular unit operation). Cross-flow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially across the surface of the filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise dead-end filtration.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In cross-flow filtration, the feed is passed across the filter membrane (tangentially) at positive pressure relative to the permeate side. A proportion of the material which is smaller than the membrane pore size passes through the membrane as permeate or filtrate; everything else is retained on the feed side of the membrane as retentate.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The volume of the fluid is reduced by allowing permeate flow to occur. Solvent, solutes, and particles smaller than the membrane pore size pass through the membrane, while particles larger than the pore size are retained, and thereby concentrated. In bioprocessing applications, concentration may be followed by diafiltration.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term diafiltration, as used herein, refers to a dilution and re-concentration of the solution or liquid, where in order to effectively remove permeate components from the solution or liquid, fresh solvent may be added to the feed to replace the permeate volume, at the same rate as the permeate flow rate, such that the volume in the system remains constant. This is analogous to the washing of filter cake to remove soluble components.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to perform an optimisation programme on the ULTRAFILTRATION of an solution containing Anti-IL-20 antibody, solution A was diafiltrated against solution B (5&#xd7; retentate volume) on a &#xc4;kta crossflow equipped with a Pellicon 3, Ultracel 30 K membrane, 88 cm2 module (Millipore).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Solution A:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">100 g/L Anti IL20</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">150 mM Sucrose</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">25 mM Arg</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">25 mM NaCl</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">33 mM His</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">pH 6.5</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Solution B:</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">25 mM Arg</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">25 mM NaCl</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">33 mM His</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">pH 6.5</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The &#xc4;kta crossflow was also equipped with a heat exchanger (Exergy, series 17 model00402) used to regulate the retentate temperature to 45 C.
