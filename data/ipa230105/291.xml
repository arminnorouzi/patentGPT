Thus, an individual is not aware whether the soap reservoir is consumed or not. It is often that the individual may try a number of times to activate the soap dispenser. However, it not only frustrates the individual but also causes the soap dispenser to malfunction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, the need for improvement still exists.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore one object of the invention to provide a soap dispensing apparatus comprising a spout; a controller; a barcode scanner electrically connected to the controller; a power supply electrically connected to the controller; and a soap reservoir including a label having a barcode containing information including kind of liquid stored in the soap reservoir, a predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir, and a current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir, the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir being initially set as zero; wherein the spout includes an electromagnetic switch, an infrared sensor, and a pump in fluid communication with the soap reservoir and electrically connected to the electromagnetic switch respectively; wherein the barcode scanner is configured to scan the barcode and sends same to the controller for storage; wherein the controller is configured to compare the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir with the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir prior to activating the pump; wherein in response to activating the infrared sensor, an act of pumping begins if the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir is greater than the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir; and wherein in response to the act of pumping, the controller increases the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir by one.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically depicts a soap dispensing apparatus of the invention; and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically depicts the soap dispensing apparatus mounted in a sink.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a soap dispensing apparatus of the invention comprises a spout <b>1</b>, a controller <b>2</b>, a barcode scanner <b>3</b> electrically connected to the controller <b>2</b>, a power supply (e.g., battery or adapter) <b>4</b> electrically connected to the controller <b>2</b>, and a soap reservoir <b>5</b> including a label <b>51</b> for identifying the soap reservoir <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The spout <b>1</b> includes an infrared sensor <b>11</b> for tracking proximity of an object, an electromagnetic switch <b>12</b>, and an internal pump <b>13</b> in fluid communication with the soap reservoir <b>5</b> and electrically connected to the electromagnetic switch <b>12</b> respectively. The barcode scanner <b>3</b> can be used to scan a barcode on the label <b>51</b> and sends same to the controller <b>2</b>. The barcode contains kind of liquid (e.g., soap) stored in the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, a predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, and a current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> in which the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is set as zero when the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is newly installed. Thus, the kind of liquid stored in the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, and the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> are stored in the controller <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the soap dispensing apparatus is installed in a sink <b>100</b>. In use, a user may place the hand in close proximity to the infrared sensor <b>11</b>. The infrared sensor <b>11</b> may sense the hand and sends a signal to the controller <b>2</b> which in turn turns on the electromagnetic switch <b>12</b> which in turn activates the pump <b>13</b>. The pump <b>13</b> transfers liquid in the soap reservoir <b>5</b> to the spout <b>1</b> for washing the hand. After the washing (i.e., after performing the act of pumping for a predetermined period of time (e.g., 10 seconds)), the electromagnetic switch <b>12</b> is automatically turned off by the controller <b>2</b> and the controller <b>2</b> increases the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> by one.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Prior to the dispensing operation, the controller <b>2</b> compares the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> with the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>. The dispensing operation will begin if the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is greater than the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>. To the contrary, the dispensing operation will not begin if the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is equal to the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> (i.e., the soap reservoir <b>5</b> consumed).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An individual may fill up the consumed soap reservoir <b>5</b> with soap and adhere a new label <b>51</b> on the soap reservoir <b>5</b>. Next, the individual uses the barcode scanner <b>3</b> to scan a barcode on the label <b>51</b> and sends same to the controller <b>2</b>. The barcode contains kind of liquid stored in the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, a predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, and a current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> in which the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is set as zero when the soap reservoir <b>5</b> is full of liquid (e.g., soap). Thus, the kind of liquid stored in the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, the predetermined count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b>, and the current count of dispensing times of the soap reservoir <b>5</b> are stored in the controller <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
