in order to resist the above external force, but the dimensions of the &#x201c;plate <b>11</b>&#x201d; cannot be simply increased due to constraints in terms of, for example, the required space in the &#x201c;base frame <b>3</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, for example, in the &#x201c;base frame <b>3</b>&#x201d; as described above, the durability of the &#x201c;base frame <b>3</b>&#x201d; declines as the external force or the like in the event of the fall-direction deformation of the &#x201c;stationary platen <b>4</b>&#x201d;

It should be noted that in the illustrated example, the mold unit <b>101</b> has a stationary mold <b>102</b> and a movable mold <b>103</b> having a partition-formed cavity inside in the mold clamping state and a movable member <b>104</b> such as an ejector pin displaced by the ejector unit <b>41</b> to push out and eject the molding product. The mold unit <b>101</b> can be appropriately attached to the injection molding machine <b>1</b> and be replaced in accordance with, for example, the shape of the molding product to be manufactured, and the mold unit <b>101</b> is not regarded as a part of the injection molding machine <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Of these components, the mold clamping unit <b>31</b> mainly has a platen <b>32</b> disposed so as to sandwich the mold unit <b>101</b> from both sides and a platen operation mechanism <b>33</b> making the platen <b>32</b> movable. The platen <b>32</b> includes a stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>positioned between the injection unit <b>21</b> and the mold unit <b>101</b> and having a lower end portion fixed to the base frame <b>2</b> and a movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>positioned across the mold unit <b>101</b> from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and displaceable toward and away from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>. As for the mold unit <b>101</b> positioned between the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b</i>, the stationary mold <b>102</b> is attached to the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>side, and the movable mold <b>103</b> is attached to the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side. In addition, the mold clamping unit <b>31</b> is provided with one or a plurality of tie bars <b>32</b><i>c </i>extending from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>toward a rear platen <b>34</b> (described later) to connect the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the rear platen <b>34</b>. Although the displacement of the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>away from and toward the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is guided by the tie bar <b>32</b><i>c </i>in this example, the tie bar <b>32</b><i>c </i>may not guide the displacement.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be noted that at the position where the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>is away from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the movable mold <b>103</b> of the mold unit <b>101</b> is open from the stationary mold <b>102</b>, which is the mold opening state. By bringing the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>close to the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>from this position of separation, the movable mold <b>103</b> is closed with respect to the stationary mold <b>102</b> to result in a mold closing state. By bringing the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>closer to the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the movable mold <b>103</b> is pressed against the stationary mold <b>102</b> to result in the mold clamping state. Here, a direction toward the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>to which the stationary mold <b>102</b> of the mold unit <b>101</b> is attached is a front side, and a direction away from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is a rear side. As for many parts of the mold clamping unit <b>31</b> excluding the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a rightward direction toward the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is the front side, and a leftward direction away from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is the rear side.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>with the lower end portion fixed and attached to the base frame <b>2</b> holds the stationary mold <b>102</b> of the mold unit <b>101</b>, and thus a load corresponding to the weight of the stationary mold <b>102</b> acts. In addition, by the tie bar <b>32</b><i>c </i>being attached to, for example, the four corners therearound, the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be deformed due to the tensile force acting on the tie bar <b>32</b><i>c </i>when, for example, the mold unit <b>101</b> is sandwiched between the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>by the platen operation mechanism <b>33</b> to result in the mold clamping state. Along with this, various external forces act on the base frame <b>2</b> to which the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is attached. In addition, the rear platen <b>34</b> and the like are also placed on the base frame <b>2</b> and, for example, a load attributable to the weight of the rear platen <b>34</b> also acts. The embodiment described here is mainly to improve the durability of the base frame <b>2</b> on which such an external force is capable of acting.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">One Base Frame</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The base frame <b>2</b> of the illustrated embodiment is a structure that combines members including a plurality of beams and struts as illustrated in the partially enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

It should be noted that although not illustrated, there is also a base frame where a mold clamping side frame and an injection unit side frame are integrated, and not only a mold clamping unit but also an injection unit and the like are placed on such a base frame.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The mold clamping unit side frame <b>2</b><i>a </i>mainly includes a pair of main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>spaced apart from each other in a width direction of the base frame <b>2</b> (direction perpendicular to the direction in which the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the mold clamping unit <b>31</b> separate and approach in a horizontal plane) and extending side by side in a longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b> (direction in which the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the mold clamping unit <b>31</b> separate and approach), and a platen attachment plate <b>4</b> disposed on the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>near the end portion on the injection unit side frame <b>2</b><i>b </i>side. In the present embodiment, the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> is divided in the width direction of the base frame <b>2</b> and is configured to include two side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>disposed on the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, respectively.

More specifically, in the illustrated example, the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>as a whole has a substantially square or rectangular plate shape with the four corners substantially rounded in a front view, and a bottom surface of the lower end portion of the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is provided with a pair of leg portions <b>32</b><i>e </i>having, for example, a block shape, spaced apart in the width direction of the base frame <b>2</b>, protruding from the bottom surface, and having steps on the outside in the width direction. Each of the four corners of the plate-shaped stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is formed with a through-hole <b>32</b><i>f </i>through which the tie bar <b>32</b><i>c </i>is passed and a recessed portion <b>32</b><i>g </i>where the surface part around the through-hole <b>32</b><i>f </i>is recessed in relation to the other part. Meanwhile, as for the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, platen fixing parts used for fixing to the leg portions <b>32</b><i>e </i>are provided at positions corresponding to the arrangement positions of the leg portions <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Although not illustrated, the platen fixing part can be, for example, a hole portion where a bolt used for fastening to the leg portion <b>32</b><i>e </i>of the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is inserted. However, the method of attaching the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is not limited thereto. It should be noted that although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>is positioned on the side opposite to the injection unit side frame <b>2</b><i>b </i>across the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and this interval changes in accordance with the operation of the platen operation mechanism <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The platen attachment plate <b>4</b> is welded at welding points and is joined to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The welding points between the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> and the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>include at least one of outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, which are in the longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>C</figref>. Although the welding part of the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> and/or Ed<b>2</b> can be changed as appropriate, in this example, in the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side, the width-direction insides thereof are partially welded to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>and, in the outer edge portion Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> on the injection unit <b>21</b> side, the entire part of contact with the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is welded. In addition, in the present embodiment, the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> are wholly joined by welding to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>not only in the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> but also at outer ends Ee positioned outside in the width direction of the base frame <b>2</b>, and thus the outer end Ee is also a welding point. The outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> and the outer ends Ee of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> can be regarded as welding points insofar as the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> and the outer ends Ee of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> are at least in part welded to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a case where a platen attachment plate has such a welding point in an outer edge portion, various external forces from a stationary platen may act to result in a welding crack at the welding point. More specifically, in the stationary platen that has a lower end portion fixed to a base frame with tie bars attached at the four corners therearound, when, for example, a mold unit is put into a mold clamping state, with the lower end portion and the four corners restrained, deformation may occur such that the middle portion against which the mold unit is pressed falls toward a movable platen while bulging toward an injection unit. At this time, on the platen attachment plate to which the leg portion in the lower end portion of the stationary platen is attached, an external force acts with the deformation of the stationary platen, particularly in the direction in which the longitudinal outer edge portion is pulled away from a main beam, which may lead to a welding crack in the outer edge portion. This becomes conspicuous in a case where high-cycle molding is performed to repeatedly manufacture a molding product in a relatively short cycle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to mitigate the stress at the welding point attributable to the external force as described above and to prevent such a welding crack, it is conceivable to longitudinally lengthen the platen attachment plate to move the outer edge portion away from where the stationary platen is attached and to increase a dimension such as the surface area of the platen attachment plate so as to be capable of sufficiently withstanding the external force.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, the lower space between the stationary platen and the movable platen needs to be left empty when taking out the molding product molded in the mold unit and, for such a reason, the dimension of the platen attachment plate cannot simply be increased.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, in the present embodiment, the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> has a shape in which the length in the longitudinal direction is longer at the outer ends Ee than at width-direction inside parts Pi of the base frame <b>2</b>. As a result, the welding points of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> can be positioned sufficiently away from the platen fixing parts at least in the vicinity of the outer ends Ee, and it is possible to effectively suppress welding cracks at the welding points. In addition, the width-direction inside parts Pi of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> have a relatively short length in the longitudinal direction, and a required space is easily ensured in the vicinity of the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> and/or Ed<b>2</b> at the inside part Pi. In this example, the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> is configured to include the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and the longitudinal lengths of the inside parts Pi of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> can be the longitudinal lengths at the width-direction inner ends Ei of the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. It should be noted that the longitudinal length of the outer end Ee or the inside part Pi of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> can be a length measured along the longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">More preferably, at least one of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> has a protruding edge portion <b>6</b>, which protrudes longitudinally outward beyond the inside part Pi, at the outside part including the width-direction outer end Ee described above. By the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> being formed at the width-direction outside part of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, the points of welding to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>provided in the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> are more reliably spaced apart from the platen fixing parts while the required space on the inside in the width direction is ensured.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, only the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> positioned on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side is formed with the protruding edge portion <b>6</b>. As a result, at the position adjacent to the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side at the inside part Pi of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, an empty space <b>7</b> recessed in, for example, a rectangular shape in a plan view is formed inside the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> in the longitudinal direction. The empty space <b>7</b> configures a part of a molding product take-out space Se, which is the lower space between the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b</i>. In this case, when the molding product is molded in the mold unit <b>101</b> and is then dropped downward from the mold unit <b>101</b> in the mold opening state and taken out, it is possible to further prevent the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> from affecting the molding product take-out. As for this platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, the side surface of the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> that faces the empty space <b>7</b> is L-shaped in a plan view.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be noted that as in the modification example that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, it is also possible to form the protruding edge portions <b>6</b> on both the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the side plate member <b>5</b><i>a</i>. In the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the outside parts of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> in the width direction are formed with the protruding edge portions <b>6</b> protruding longitudinally outward and, in this case as well, it is preferable that the inside part Pi is provided with the empty space <b>7</b> recessed in a rectangular shape or the like inside the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> in the longitudinal direction. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> as well, as is apparent from the drawing, the longitudinal length is longer at the width-direction outer end Ee than at the width-direction inside part Pi (inner end Ei) of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> has a side surface parallel to the width direction in a plan view and the longitudinal length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> is constant over the entire width direction in the above description, the longitudinal length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> may, for example, change in the width direction smoothly or stepwise. For example, in the modification example that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> is formed on each of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the side plate member <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and the longitudinal length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> gradually decreases toward the inside in the width direction. This side plate member <b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed with the longitudinal length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> on each of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> gradually decreasing from the outer end Ee to the inner end Ei, and this side plate member <b>5</b><i>a </i>is trapezoidal in a plan view as a result.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate only one side plate member <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, the other side plate member <b>5</b><i>b </i>is capable of being similar in shape to the side plate member <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The width-direction length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> can be appropriately determined in view of the necessary size of the empty space <b>7</b>, which becomes a part of, for example, the molding product take-out space Se, and other conditions. Depending on various conditions, the width-direction length of the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> being equal to the width of the main beam <b>3</b><i>a </i>as in the present embodiment or being shorter than the width of the main beam <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be preferable from the viewpoint of, for example, ensuring the required molding product take-out space Se.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">From the viewpoint of, for example, also suppressing a welding crack in welding the inner ends Ei of the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>and the width-direction outer ends of the center plate member <b>5</b><i>c</i>, it is preferable that the inner ends Ei of the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are positioned inside in the width direction so as to be somewhat away from the platen fixing parts. In this example, the inner ends Ei of the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are positioned so as to protrude inside, in the width direction, width-direction inside surfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>where the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are disposed, respectively.

In addition, also in the modification example that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it is preferable that at least one of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, for example, the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side, has the protruding edge portion <b>6</b> protruding longitudinally outward beyond the inside part Pi at the outside part including the width-direction outer end Ee.

Meanwhile, as for the side plate members <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, platen fixing parts used for fixing to the leg portions <b>32</b><i>e </i>are provided at positions corresponding to the arrangement positions of the leg portions <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Although not illustrated, the platen fixing part can be, for example, a hole portion where a bolt used for fastening to the leg portion <b>32</b><i>e </i>of the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is inserted. However, the method of attaching the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>is not limited thereto. It should be noted that although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>is positioned on the side opposite to the injection unit side frame <b>2</b><i>b </i>across the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and this interval changes in accordance with the operation of the platen operation mechanism <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The platen attachment plate <b>4</b> is welded at welding points and is joined to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The welding points between the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> and the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>include at least one of the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>, which are in the longitudinal direction of the base frame <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B, and <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref>. Although the welding part of the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> and/or Ed<b>2</b> can be changed as appropriate, in this example, in the outer edge portion Ed<b>1</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side, the width-direction insides thereof are partially welded to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>and, in the outer edge portion Ed<b>2</b> of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> on the injection unit <b>21</b> side, the entire part of contact with the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is welded.

The outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> and the outer ends Ee of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> can be regarded as welding points insofar as the outer edge portions Ed<b>1</b> and Ed<b>2</b> and the outer ends Ee of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> are at least in part welded to the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a case where a platen attachment plate has a welding point as described above, various external forces from a stationary platen may act to result in a welding crack at the welding point. More specifically, in the stationary platen that has a lower end portion fixed to a base frame with tie bars attached at the four corners therearound, when, for example, a mold unit is put into a mold clamping state, with the lower end portion and the four corners restrained, deformation may occur such that the middle portion against which the mold unit is pressed falls toward a movable platen while bulging toward an injection unit. With such deformation, the leg portions in the lower end portion of the stationary platen may be deformed toward the inside in the width direction. At this time, an external force directed inward in the width direction acts on a pair of main beams via the platen attachment plate, where the main beams are welded and the stationary platen leg portions are attached. Such an external force may cause the welding crack at, for example, the welding point between the main beam and the platen attachment plate. This becomes conspicuous in a case where high-cycle molding is performed to repeatedly manufacture a molding product in a relatively short cycle.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, in the present embodiment, the connecting beam <b>10</b> extending between the pair of main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>in the width direction and interconnecting the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is provided on the frame installation surface Si side of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b>. According to this, the connecting beam <b>10</b> provided between the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>stretches against the external force that acts on the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>via the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> from the leg portion <b>32</b><i>e </i>of the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and thus the stress that is applied to, for example, the welding point of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> due to the action of the external force can be mitigated, and a welding crack can be effectively suppressed. As a result, the durability of the base frame <b>2</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, the connecting beam <b>10</b> can be configured by one or more connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>.

Each of the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be configured by members having various shapes. For the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>exemplified in this specification, tubular square pipes having square or rectangular inner and outer contour shapes in a cross section perpendicular to an axial direction are used, and a required resistance in the axial direction can be sufficiently exhibited as a result. Here, each of the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>is disposed such that each of the four surfaces around the square pipe with a rectangular cross section is in the direction parallel to the longitudinal direction or to the height direction (vertical direction perpendicular to the longitudinal and width directions). However, the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>may be configured by non-square pipe members. It should be noted that the connecting beam <b>10</b>, the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>to be specific, have end portions that can be joined by welding to the inside surfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The two connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>configuring the connecting beam <b>10</b> can be spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>11</b></figref>. It should be noted that although not illustrated, when three or more connecting beam members are provided, at least one pair of the connecting beam members adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction among the connecting beam members can be disposed so as to be separated from each other in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Here, the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>spaced apart from and adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction are capable of having longitudinal dimensions (that is, beam widths) equal to each other.

More specifically, as for the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, although a longitudinal dimension Wa of one connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>a </i>positioned on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side may be made larger than a longitudinal dimension Wb of the other connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>b </i>positioned on the injection unit <b>21</b> side, it is more preferable that the longitudinal dimension Wa of the connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>a </i>on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side is smaller than the longitudinal dimension Wb of the connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>b </i>on the injection unit <b>21</b> side. The connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>a </i>on the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side is often positioned closer to the movable platen <b>32</b><i>b </i>side than the platen fixing part of the platen attachment plate <b>4</b> in the longitudinal direction and, by relatively reducing the longitudinal dimension Wa of the connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>a </i>with a small beam width is capable of exhibiting a large endurance with respect to bending attributable to a vertically downward external force in the direction in which the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>falls. Meanwhile, in the connecting beam member <b>10</b><i>b </i>on the injection unit <b>21</b> side, where the longitudinal dimension Wb is relatively large, the load attributable to the weight received from the stationary platen <b>32</b><i>a </i>can be effectively supported.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Alternatively, the two connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>configuring the connecting beam <b>10</b> can be disposed in contact with each other in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. In this case, the adjacent connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are brought into contact with each other on side surfaces thereof and, for example, adjacent corner portions thereof or the like can be joined by, for example, performing welding continuously or intermittently in the width direction at least in part in the width direction. Although not illustrated, as for a connecting beam including three or more connecting beam members, at least a pair of the connecting beam members adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction among the connecting beam members can be disposed in contact with each other in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are disposed in contact with each other in the longitudinal direction, it is preferable that the adjacent connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>have equal height-direction dimensions (that is, beam depths). When connecting beam members with different beam depths are disposed in contact with each other, a corner portion of the low-beam depth connecting beam member abuts against a side surface of the high-beam depth connecting beam member, and stress concentration there may deform the high-beam depth connecting beam member. As for the equal dimensions mentioned here, the two dimensions do not necessarily have to strictly match, and a difference to the extent of a potential tolerance in manufacturing a connecting beam member such as a square pipe is allowed. The connecting beam members can be regarded as having equal dimensions in, for example, the height direction insofar as the members have a dimensional difference that one procurable from the market is capable of having equal dimensions in, for example, the height direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be noted that the height-direction dimensions of the connecting beam members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be, for example, approximately equal to the height-direction dimensions of the main beams <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>.
