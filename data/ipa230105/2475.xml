Treatment of these injuries has been limited to mechanical repair (when possible) of the iris, replacement of the crystalline lens with plastic lens implants, and repair of retinal detachments. There has been no treatment to repair the cellular architecture of the retina or the anterior chamber. Furthermore, traumatic optic neuropathy and optic nerve avulsion are among the six leading types of ocular injury that required specialized ophthalmic care during Operation Iraqi Freedom (Cho and Savitsky, &#x201c;Ocular Trauma Chapter 7&#x201d;, in Combat Casualty Care: Lessons learned from Oef and Oif, by Brian Eastbridge and Eric Savitsky, pp. 299-342, Ft. Detrick, Md.: Borden Institute (US) Government Printing Office, 2012), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Sixty percent of traumatic head injuries result in neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities (Van Stavern, et al., <i>J Neuro</i>-<i>Ophthamol </i>21(2):112-117, 2001) (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) half of which involve the optic nerves or visual pathways. Traumatic injury to neurons results in axonal damage and irreversible neuronal loss resulting in permanent deficits. While a number of potential neuroprotective therapies have been identified in animals, these single agents have generally failed to translate to therapies in human clinical trials (Turner, et al., <i>J Neurosurg </i>118(5):1072-1085, 2013, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Combination therapies that affect several cellular targets are likely needed to prevent neuronal damage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The cornea serves a protective role as the outermost tissue of the eye; however it is highly vulnerable to severe injury and disease. Its lack of blood vessels enables its transparency but also limits its ability to heal. Comeal injury, due to its potential to cause irreversible blindness, requires prompt intervention and aggressive treatment. The critical need for improved ocular surface healing therapies is particularly apparent for chemical burns and in severe corneal diseases, such as ocular manifestations of acute Chronic Graft v. Host Disease (GvHD), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Ocular Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid and other conditions giving rise to persistent corneal epithelial defect, which collectively comprise an incidence of over 100,000 cases per year.

In the case of corneal wounds, the initial insult causes rifts in the corneal epithelium thereby enabling the passage of topically applied MSC-S to penetrate the epithelial layers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a large unmet need in the art for ocular therapies that can target the eye and deliver a therapeutic payload to difficult-to-reach sensory tissue which may have degenerated due to inflammation secondary to trauma (such as for example, burns, acute inflammation, age, and/or oxidative stress).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention meets this need by providing compositions comprising fibronectin, optionally one or more growth factors that are non-covalently attached to the fibronectin (FN), for use in such treatments, as well as methods for making such compositions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the FN is MSC-derived FN.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the FN is MSC-secreted FN.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the FN is cellular FN.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the cellular FN is cellularly derived FN, and wherein the FN is non-covalently attached to one or more growth factors.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the cellular FN is EDA+ and/or EDB+.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the cellular fibronectin is obtained from a conditioned medium.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the cellular fibronectin is secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the conditioned medium is obtained from a culture of MSCs.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the composition comprises an MSC secretome.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the MSCs are derived from bone marrow.

Introduction</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">Fibronectin (FN) is a large glycoprotein containing around 5% carbohydrate. The characteristic form of plasma fibronectin is a disulfide-bonded dimer of 440,000 daltons, each subunit having a molecular weight of about 220,000 daltons. Normally found in plasma at a concentration of about 300 &#x3bc;g/mL, fibronectin is extracted and purified using a method described by Hynes, R. O., Methods for identification of fibronectin (chap. 2, page 12), IN: Fibronectins New-York: Springer-Verlag, 1990. Plasma fibronectin is also known by various other names, including cold-insoluble globulin, anti-gelatin factor, cell attachment protein, cell spreading factor, and opsonic &#x3b1;2-surface binding glycoprotein. These names reflect biological activities of fibronectin such as cell recruitment, opsonization of particulate debris, and promotion of wound contraction. Descriptions of structure and activities of fibronectin can be found in Hynes, R. O., Methods for identification of fibronectin (chap. 2, page 12), IN: Fibronectins New-York: Springer-Verlag, 1990, and Hynes, R. O., Methods for identification of fibronectin (chap. 2, pages 7-23) and Wound healing, inflammation, and fibrosis (chap. 14, pages 349-64), IN: Fibronectins New-York: Springer-Verlag, 1990. 3, and Brotchie, H., Wakefield, D. <i>Australas J Dermatol </i>1990; 31:47-56 (all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Wound healing is usually divided into three phases: the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the remodeling phase. Fibronectin has been reported to be involved in each stage of the wound healing process, particularly by creating a scaffold to which the invading cells can adhere. Initially, many mediators, such as fibronectin and fibrinogen, are released to the wound site. Fibronectin promotes inflammatory cells migration into the wound and debris phagocytosis by the monocytes. Thereafter, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization take place. At this stage fibronectin exerts chemotactic activity on endothelial cells and promotes the migration of epithelial cells and fibroblasts onto the basal membrane.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">Fibronectin also appears to be an essential component of the remodeling phase where it plays a major role in the organization of collagen fibrils. The fibrillar collagen ultimately forms fibrous bundles that greatly enhance the tissue tensile strength, leading to wound closure. Plasma fibronectin has been reported as being useful for increasing the rate of wound healing such as in corneal wounds and leg ulcers.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">There are two forms of fibronectin: plasma fibronectin and cellular fibronectin. Plasma fibronectin is synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes into the blood plasma, while cellular fibronectin is produced by many cell types such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, stem cells, myocytes and chondrocytes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">In wound healing, it has been reported that plasma fibronectin accumulates remarkably in the wound after wounding in vivo, which is crucial for various functions of platelets, fibroblasts and endothelial cells such as adhesion, migration and aggregation, revealing that plasma fibronectin is likely to serve as a suitable substrate to accelerate wound repair in vivo. Indeed, in animal model, provisional matrix containing plasma fibronectin significantly supports epidermal cell adhesion and migration in the re-epithelialization process, showing the clinical potential of plasma fibronectin in human wound healing and tissue repair.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">Despite extensive physical and immunologic similarities, the two classes of fibronectin differ in electrophoretic behavior, solubility, and biologic activities. Tamkun et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>258(7):4641-47 (1983); Yamada et al., <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>80:492-98 (1979); Yamada et al. <i>Biochemistry </i>16(25):2552-59 (1977).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">Moreover, primary structural differences between plasma and cellular fibronectins have been found by peptide mapping, Hayashi et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>256(21):11,292-11,300 (1981), and immunologic techniques, Atherton et al. <i>Cell </i>25:133-41 (1981). Recently, a difference region encoding for exactly one 90 amino acid type III structural repeat was identified in mRNA from human fibroblasts and two human tumor cell lines, but could not be detected in human liver mRNA. Komblihtt et al. <i>EMBO J. </i>4(7):1755-59 (1985); Komblihtt et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>3(1):221-26 (1984); Komblihtt et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>12(14):5853-68 (1984). Since plasma fibronectin is synthesized by hepatocytes, it is likely that the extra type III repeat is a unique domain of cellular fibronectins. Schwarzbauer et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., </i>82:1424-28 (1985); Komblihtt et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>3(1):221-26 (1984); Komblihtt et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>12(14):5853-68 (1984). Additional discussion of the differences between plasma fibronectin and cellular fibronectin are provided in W. S., et al., <i>Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair </i>4, 21 (2011).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">Cellular fibronectin is characterized by fibronectin splice variants that are absent in the circulating plasma fibronectin pool. These alternative splice variants render Fibronectin sequences harboring extra domains (type III domains), called EIIIA and EIIIB (or EDA and EDB). White et al. <i>The Journal of pathology</i>. vol. 216(1): 1-14 (2008); White and Muro, IUBMB Life, 63: 538-546 (2011). Therefore, in some embodiments, cellular fibronectin is EDA+ and/or EDB+. In some embodiments, cellular fibronectin is EDA+, EDB+, and/or V+. In some embodiments, cellular fibronectin is EDA+. In some embodiments, cellular fibronectin is EDB+. In some embodiments, cellular fibronectin is V+. One or both type III domains may be incorporated. Cellular fibronectin may be a mixture of these isoforms.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">Despite the tremendous interest in the therapeutic application of fibronectin in promoting wound healing, clinical studies to date have been focused on plasma fibronectin. No clinical study on cellular fibronectin has so far been reported and clinical studies on plasma fibronectin showed inconsistent results among patients with ocular diseases. For example, McCulley, J P. et al. reported that patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects disappointingly failed to respond to plasma fibronectin treatment. McCulley J P, Horowitz B, Husseini Z M, Horowitz M. <i>Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. </i>1993; 91:367-86; discussion 386-90.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">A growing body of studies show that growth factors can bind to FN at various sites. As such, FN may act as an effective reservoir retaining growth factors to increase their local concentrations in physiological microenvironment. For example, it was reported that HGF binds the HGF receptor and integrins as well as FN to assemble into multimeric complexes in promoting cell migration. Rahman, Salman et al., <i>BMC cell biology </i>vol. 6,18. 17 Feb. 2005. FN was also found to bind via its C-terminal heparin-II domain (FN III) to various growth factors in the PDGF/VEGF and FGF families, and some growth factors from the transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; (TGF-&#x3b2;) and neurotrophin families. Although FN-sequestered growth factors supposedly possess localized, prolonged and enhanced GF activity, development of recombinant combination therapy with recombinant FN and growth factors that retain their endogenous biochemical and biophysical attributes remains challenging.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">A. Definitions</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0063">Terms used in the claims and specification are defined as set forth below unless otherwise specified. In the case of direct conflict with a term used in a parent provisional patent application, the term used in the instant specification shall control.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">As used herein &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to material removed from its original environment and is thus altered &#x201c;by the hand of man&#x201d; from its natural state.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">As used herein, &#x201c;enriched&#x201d; means to selectively concentrate or to increase the amount of one or more materials by elimination of the unwanted materials or selection and separation of desirable materials from a mixture (e.g., separate cells with specific cell markers from a heterogeneous cell population in which not all cells in the population express the marker).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially purified&#x201d; means a population of cells substantially homogeneous for a particular marker or combination of markers. By substantially homogeneous is meant at least 90%, and preferably 95% homogeneous for a particular marker or combination of markers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;multipotent stem cells&#x201d; are true stem cells but can only differentiate into a limited number of types. For example, the bone marrow contains multipotent stem cells that give rise to all the cells of the blood but may not be able to differentiate into other cells types.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">By the term &#x201c;animal-free&#x201d; when referring to certain compositions, growth conditions, culture media, etc. described herein, is meant that no non-human animal-derived materials, such as bovine serum, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, vitamins, etc., are used in the preparation, growth, culturing, expansion, storage or formulation of the certain composition or process. By &#x201c;no non-human animal-derived materials&#x201d; is meant that the materials have never been in or in contact with a non-human animal body or substance so they are not xeno-contaminated. Generally, clinical grade materials, such as recombinantly produced human proteins, are used in the preparation, growth, culturing, expansion, storage and/or formulation of such compositions and/or processes.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">By the term &#x201c;expanded&#x201d;, in reference to cell compositions, means that the cell population constitutes a significantly higher concentration of cells than is obtained using previous methods. For example, the level of cells per gram of amniotic tissue in expanded compositions of AMP cells is at least 50-fold and up to 150-fold higher than the number of cells in the primary culture after 5 passages, as compared to about a 20-fold increase in such cells using previous methods. In another example, the level of cells per gram of amniotic tissue in expanded compositions of AMP cells is at least 30-fold and up to 100-fold higher than the number of cells in the primary culture after 3 passages. Accordingly, an &#x201c;expanded&#x201d; population has at least a 2-fold, and up to a 10-fold, improvement in cell numbers per gram of amniotic tissue over previous methods. The term &#x201c;expanded&#x201d; is meant to cover only those situations in which a person has intervened to elevate the number of the cells.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">As used herein, &#x201c;conditioned medium&#x201d; is a medium in which a specific cell or population of cells has been cultured, and then removed. When cells are cultured in a medium, they may secrete cellular factors that can provide support to or affect the behavior of other cells. Such factors include, but are not limited to, hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix (ECM), proteins, vesicles, antibodies, chemokines, receptors, inhibitors and granules. The medium containing the cellular factors is the conditioned medium. Examples of methods of preparing conditioned media have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,494 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. As used herein, conditioned medium also refers to components, such as proteins, that are recovered and/or purified from conditioned medium or from for example, MSC cells.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">As used herein, the term &#x201c;mesenchymal stem cell composition&#x201d; or &#x201c;MSC composition&#x201d; means conditioned medium that has been derived from MSCs and in some instances has undergone further processing. In some embodiments, &#x201c;MSC secretome&#x201d; can refer to the crude conditioned media derived from the MSC. In some embodiments, &#x201c;MSC secretome&#x201d; can refer to the composition obtained from the crude conditioned media after it has been subjected to further processing as described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">As used herein, the term &#x201c;suspension&#x201d; means a liquid containing dispersed components, e.g., cytokines. The dispersed components may be fully solubilized, partially solubilized, suspended or otherwise dispersed in the liquid. Suitable liquids include, but are not limited to, water, osmotic solutions such as salt and/or sugar solutions, cell culture media, and other aqueous or non-aqueous solutions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">&#x201c;Amino acid&#x201d; refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, e.g., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that function in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, can be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">An &#x201c;amino acid substitution&#x201d; refers to the replacement of at least one existing amino acid residue in a predetermined amino acid sequence (an amino acid sequence of a starting polypeptide) with a second, different &#x201c;replacement&#x201d; amino acid residue. An &#x201c;amino acid insertion&#x201d; refers to the incorporation of at least one additional amino acid into a predetermined amino acid sequence. While the insertion will usually consist of the insertion of one or two amino acid residues, the present larger &#x201c;peptide insertions,&#x201d; can be made, e.g. insertion of about three to about five or even up to about ten, fifteen, or twenty amino acid residues. The inserted residue(s) may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring as disclosed above. An &#x201c;amino acid deletion&#x201d; refers to the removal of at least one amino acid residue from a predetermined amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">&#x201c;Polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;peptide&#x201d;, and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">&#x201c;Nucleic acid&#x201d; refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences and as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions can be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081, 1991; Ohtsuka et al., Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608, 1985; and Cassol et al, 1992; Rossolini et al, Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98, 1994). For arginine and leucine, modifications at the second base can also be conservative. The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, and mRNA encoded by a gene. Polynucleotides used herein can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which can be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that can be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide can also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. &#x201c;Modified&#x201d; bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">As used herein, the term &#x201c;secretome composition&#x201d; refers to a composition comprising one or more substances which are secreted from a cell. In certain embodiments, a secretome composition may include one or more cytokines, one or more exosomes, and/or one or more microvesicles. A secretome composition may be purified or unpurified. In some embodiments, a secretome composition may further comprise one or more substances that are not secreted from a cell (e.g., culture media, additives, nutrients, etc.). In some a secretome composition does not comprise and or comprises only trace amounts of one or more substances that are not secreted from a cell (e.g., culture media, additives, nutrients, etc.).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">The terms &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; or &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and the like, as used herein covers any treatment of a human or nonhuman mammal (e.g., rodent, cat, dog, horse, cattle, sheep, and primates etc.), and includes preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a subject who may be predisposed to the disease or condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it. It also includes inhibiting (arresting development of), relieving or ameliorating (causing regression of), or curing (permanently stopping development or progression) the disease, condition and/or any related symptoms.

A wound is dynamic and the process of healing is a continuum requiring a series of integrated and interrelated cellular processes that begin at the time of wounding and proceed beyond initial wound closure through arrival at a stable wound closure. These cellular processes are mediated or modulated by humoral substances including but not limited to cytokines, lymphokines, growth factors, and hormones. In accordance with the subject invention, &#x201c;wound healing&#x201d; refers to improving, by some form of intervention, the natural cellular processes and humoral substances of tissue repair such that healing is faster, and/or the resulting healed area has less scaring and/or the wounded area possesses tissue strength that is closer to that of uninjured tissue and/or the wounded tissue attains some degree of functional recovery.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; means one or more or at least one.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective&#x201d; or &#x201c;effective&#x201d; dosage or amount of a composition is an amount sufficient to have a positive effect on a given medical condition.

While all adult stem cells are cable of self-renewal and are considered multipotent, their therapeutic functions vary depending on their origin. As a result, each type of adult stem cell has unique characteristics that make them suitable for certain diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are typically derived from the mesoderm and are multipotent, nonhematopoietic (non-blood) stem cells isolated from (derived from) capable of differentiating into a variety of tissues, including osteoblasts (e.g., bone cells), chondrocytes (e.g., cartilage cells), myocytes (e.g., muscle cells) and adipocytes (e.g., fat cells which give rise to marrow adipose tissue). As used herein, &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to cells removed from their original environment. Stem cells produce factors, such as growth factors, that regulate or are important for regulating multiple biological processes. A growth factor is an agent, such as a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth and/or proliferation and/or cellular differentiation. Typically, growth factors are proteins or steroid hormones. While the terms &#x201c;growth factor&#x201d; and &#x201c;factor&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably herein, the term &#x201c;biological factor&#x201d; is not limited to growth factors.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), can be characterized by the surface marker profile of CD45&#x2212;/CD31&#x2212;/CD73+/CD90+/CD105+/CD44+(or any suitable subset thereof). (See, Bourin et al., Cytotherapy, 15(6):641-648 (2013)). Further, appropriate stem cells display the CD34+ positive at the time of isolation, but lose this marker during culturing. Therefore, the full marker profile for one stem cell type that may be used according to the present application includes CD45&#x2212;/CD31&#x2212;/CD73+/CD90+/CD105+. In another embodiment utilizing mouse stem cells, the stem cells are characterized by the Sca-1 marker, instead of CD34, to define what appears to be a homologue to the human cells described above, with the remaining markers remaining the same.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0087">The phrase &#x201c;conditioned medium&#x201d; or &#x201c;CM&#x201d; refers to media which includes biological factors secreted by MSCs.

In certain embodiments, the mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from bone marrow. &#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; refers to cells removed from their original environment. MSCs may differentiate into cells of mesodermal lineage, for example, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. MSCs have a small cell body with few cell processes that are long and thin. The cell body contains a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, which is surrounded by finely dispersed chromatin particles, giving the nucleus a clear appearance. The remainder of the cell body contains a small amount of Golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and polyribosomes. The cells, which are long and thin, are widely dispersed and the adjacent extracellular matrix is populated by a few reticular fibrils but is devoid of the other types of collagen fibrils [Brighton, et al. 1991 The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery 73(6):832-47].

For example, as described above under step (v) harvesting the second culture media from step (iv) as conditioned media. The filtration membranes used herein may be selected from any of those known in the art having a suitable membrane and configuration, such that they are capable of retaining the desired MSC secretome components while allowing the cell particulate and/or other detrimental components pass through. Thus, one may employ any suitable membrane which permits the retention of cells under the fluid dynamic conditions selected whilst allowing the detrimental components to pass through for removal. In some embodiments, an upper limit of pore size of about 5 microns and a lower limit of about 0.1 microns would be suitable.

In some embodiments, a filter size of less than 3 kD is used to filter the conditioned medium, while in other embodiments a filter size of greater than 3 kD is used, depending on the application for which the processed conditioned medium is used. In other embodiments, ultra-filtration of harvested conditioned medium is carried out using a filter of a different pore size (e.g., 2 kD, &#x3c;2 kD or &#x3e;2 kD) selected to determine the size of components of the resulting processed conditioned medium comprising the MSC secretome.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0162">In some embodiments, the detrimental components in the growth supporting media are removed by medium exchange, preferably via &#x201c;cross-flow filtration&#x201d;. Cross-flow filtration refers to a mode of filtration where a suspension of MSC secretome cells flows substantially parallel to a filter which is permeable to a component of the suspension other than cells. The cross-flow filtration process is characterized by a set of fluid dynamic parameters including Re=Reynolds number, &#x3b3;w=wall shear rate, &#x394;P=pressure drop and TMP=transmembrane pressure. Re, &#x3b3;w and &#x394;P will depend on the geometry of the filtration system, flow conditions and fluid properties.
