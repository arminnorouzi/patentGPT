When designed effectively, an active deaeration system can effectively purge all gases from the system via a degas bottle, sending only liquid coolant to the heat exchangers and water pump inlet, while preserving relatively high pressure at the water pump inlet. However, at flow rates above the degas bottle flow limit, the deaeration capability can become compromised and the pressure drop between bottle and water pump inlet can potentially lead to water pump cavitation. Thus, while such conventional systems work well for their intended purpose, there remains a desire for improvement in the relevant art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to one example aspect of the invention, a centrifugal coolant gas separator (CCGS) for a cooling system is provided.

The CCGS device is disposed upstream of the degas bottle and is configured to assist with coolant liquid and gas separation, for example, when the coolant system operates with a flow rate greater than what the degas bottle can handle. The CCGS receives high pressure coolant flows from the integrated exhaust manifold and turbocharger, and utilizes those high pressure flows to induce a relatively lower pressure flow from the EGR system. The CCGS then utilizes centrifugal forces to separate the gas and liquid coolant. The gas coolant is sent to the degas bottle, while the remaining (mostly) liquid coolant is sent to the water pump inlet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example engine system for a vehicle is shown and generally identified by reference numeral <b>10</b>. In the example embodiment, the engine system <b>10</b> generally includes an internal combustion engine <b>12</b> that includes a cylinder block <b>13</b>, a cylinder head with an integrated exhaust manifold system <b>14</b>, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system <b>16</b>, and a turbocharger system <b>18</b>. An engine cooling system <b>20</b> is configured to circulate a coolant through one or more loops or circuits to cool one or more portions of the engine system <b>10</b>. As described herein in more detail, the cooling system <b>20</b> includes a centrifugal coolant gas separator (CCGS) <b>22</b> configured to separate a gas and liquid coolant for recirculation in the cooling system <b>20</b> or for further separation. Although described for use with engine cooling system <b>20</b>, it will be appreciated that CCGS <b>22</b> may be utilized in various other types of thermal fluid systems.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the example embodiment, cylinder head and integrated exhaust manifold system <b>14</b> generally includes a cylinder head <b>24</b> with a first or rear integrated exhaust manifold (IEM) <b>26</b> and a second or front integrated exhaust manifold (IEM) <b>28</b>. The cylinder head <b>24</b> includes an internal water jacket <b>30</b> fluidly coupled a cylinder block water jacket (not shown), a first or R-IEM outlet port <b>34</b>, a second or F-IEM outlet port <b>36</b>, a third outlet port <b>38</b>, a fourth or engine outlet port <b>40</b>, a fifth or degas outlet port <b>42</b>, and a sixth or coolant bypass port <b>44</b>. The cylinder head water jacket <b>30</b> receives coolant from the cylinder block water jacket for cooling exhaust gas and portions of the combustion chambers and related components (not shown). At least a portion of the liquid coolant vaporizes as it cools the surrounding components, and the resulting vapor tends to accumulate at local isolated high points of the water jacket <b>30</b>, which need to be deaerated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the example embodiment, the R-IEM outlet port <b>34</b> is located at or near an isolated high point of the rear IEM <b>26</b>, and the F-IEM outlet port <b>36</b> is located at or near an isolated high point of the front IEM <b>28</b>. In this way, the first and second outlet ports <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are configured to vent coolant vapor to a vent line <b>50</b>, which is fluidly coupled to the CCGS <b>22</b>. The outlet port <b>38</b> is configured to supply coolant to the EGR system <b>16</b> via a conduit <b>52</b>, and the engine outlet port <b>40</b> is configured to supply coolant to the engine <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the engine outlet port <b>40</b> is not located at the highest point on the engine, so to avoid a gas trap, the degas outlet port <b>42</b> is located nearby and configured to vent coolant vapor to a degas bottle <b>54</b> via a conduit <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the example implementation, the EGR system <b>16</b> includes a heat exchanger or cooler <b>60</b> with an inlet port <b>62</b>, a first or vapor outlet port <b>64</b>, and a second or liquid outlet port <b>66</b>. The EGR cooler <b>60</b> is configured to receive coolant from the outlet port <b>38</b> via conduit <b>52</b>. The supplied coolant subsequently indirectly cools exhaust gas passing through the EGR cooler <b>60</b> (e.g., via thin tubes). The large temperature gradient between the coolant and the exhaust temperature causes at least some of the coolant to vaporize. The vaporized coolant is then directed through the vapor outlet port <b>64</b> to a conduit <b>68</b>, which is fluidly coupled to the CCGS <b>22</b>. Liquid coolant not vaporized in the heat exchange is directed through the liquid outlet port <b>66</b> to a pump <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some example implementations, the EGR cooler <b>60</b> is disposed between the engine outlet port <b>38</b> and inlet <b>71</b> of pump <b>70</b>. However, the pressure drop between the outlet port <b>38</b> and the pump inlet <b>71</b> that drives EGR coolant flow is much lower than in other types of engine systems. To meet the EGR cooler coolant flow requirement, much of the pressure drop is consumed, which puts the EGR cooler vapor outlet port <b>64</b> and liquid outlet port <b>66</b> nearly at water pump inlet pressure, which is the lowest pressure in the cooling system <b>20</b>. Thus, it is difficult to get coolant to flow from &#x201c;near&#x201d; the pump inlet pressure to anywhere else in the cooling system <b>20</b> due to the lower pressure. Accordingly, the CCGS <b>22</b> is configured to induce coolant flow through the vapor outlet port <b>64</b>, as described herein in more detail.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example embodiment, the turbocharger system <b>18</b> includes a first turbocharger assembly <b>72</b> and a second turbocharger assembly <b>74</b>, but turbocharger system <b>18</b> may include any suitable number of turbochargers (e.g., one). Each turbocharger assembly <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> includes a turbocharger housing <b>76</b> having an internal water jacket <b>78</b> fluidly coupled between an inlet port <b>80</b> and an outlet port <b>82</b>. The inlet ports <b>80</b> are fluidly coupled to receive coolant from a supply line <b>32</b> of pump <b>70</b>, and the outlet ports <b>82</b> are fluidly coupled to the CCGS <b>22</b> via conduits <b>84</b>. In the example implementation, the turbocharger assemblies <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> need to be cooled at the center housing to prevent coking of the oil film on the bearing, especially immediately after engine shut down. Given the high heat load of the turbochargers, coolant is expected to boil within the center housing <b>76</b> and thus conduits <b>84</b> are treated as a vent line.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cooling system <b>20</b> includes the CCGS <b>22</b>, degas bottle <b>54</b>, pump <b>70</b>, and a plurality of conduits. The pump <b>70</b> is configured to circulate coolant through cooling system <b>20</b> to cool various components such as the cylinder block <b>13</b>, cylinder head and IEM system <b>14</b>, EGR system <b>16</b>, and turbocharger system <b>18</b>. The degas bottle <b>54</b> is configured as a reservoir to allow for fluid expansion in the cooling system <b>20</b> and deaerates and degases the coolant letting air pockets and bubbles escape as they travel through the cooling system <b>20</b>. The degas bottle <b>54</b> generally includes a first inlet <b>86</b>, a second inlet <b>88</b>, and an outlet <b>90</b>. The first inlet <b>86</b> is fluidly coupled to the CCGS <b>22</b> to receive coolant therefrom, and the second inlet <b>88</b> is fluidly coupled to conduit <b>56</b> to receive coolant from degas outlet port <b>42</b>. The outlet port <b>90</b> is configured to return liquid coolant to the pump <b>70</b> via conduit <b>91</b> for recirculation through cooling system <b>20</b>. Similarly, pump <b>70</b> is configured to receive liquid coolant from the engine <b>12</b>, EGR system <b>16</b>, and CCGS <b>22</b> for further recirculation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the CCGS <b>22</b> will be described in more detail. In the example embodiment, the CCGS <b>22</b> is configured to be an intermediary gas/liquid separator before a degas bottle <b>54</b> and generally includes an upper housing <b>100</b> and a lower housing <b>102</b> with inner walls <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) defining a cyclone or centrifugal separation chamber <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The CCGS <b>22</b> receives vapor-rich coolant and is configured to create a high velocity vortex with high pressure at the inner wall <b>104</b> of the chamber <b>106</b> and low pressure at the center of the chamber <b>106</b>. The pressure difference drives low density gas towards the chamber center, leaving the higher density liquid clinging to the inner walls <b>104</b>. The separator chamber <b>106</b> narrows at the bottom and creates a pinch that makes it difficult for the gas to get through a lower exit, thereby forcing the separated gas upward toward an upper exit.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the example embodiment, the upper housing <b>100</b> includes a main body <b>110</b> generally defining a first inlet port <b>112</b>, a second inlet port <b>114</b>, a third inlet port <b>116</b>, an internal passage <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and a gas coolant outlet port <b>120</b>. The first inlet port <b>112</b> is fluidly coupled to the internal passage <b>118</b> and is configured to supply a relatively high pressure forced flow of coolant from the turbochargers <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> via conduit <b>84</b>. The second inlet port <b>114</b> is fluidly coupled to the internal passage <b>118</b> and is configured to supply a relatively high pressure forced flow of coolant from the IEMs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> via vent line <b>50</b>. Downstream of the first and second inlet ports <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, the internal passage <b>118</b> defines a tuned orifice <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) followed by a spiral or centrifugal passage <b>124</b>. The tuned orifice <b>122</b> reduces the size of internal passage <b>118</b>, thereby increasing the coolant flow velocity as it enters the centrifugal passage <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the example embodiment, the third inlet port <b>116</b> is fluidly coupled to the centrifugal passage <b>124</b> at or near a full turn (e.g., approximately 360&#xb0;) of the centrifugal passage <b>124</b>. The high flow, high pressure coolant supplied by the tuned orifice <b>122</b> passes over the third inlet port <b>116</b> and creates a &#x201c;cave under the waterfall&#x201d; or Venturi effect, which creates a low pressure zone <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that incudes flow from the EGR cooler <b>60</b> via conduit <b>68</b> and the third inlet port <b>116</b>. As such, the tuned orifice <b>122</b> and Venturi effect induce flow of the relatively lower pressure coolant at the EGR cooler outlet <b>64</b> into the CCGS <b>22</b>. In this way, coolant flows from the cylinder head and IEM system <b>14</b>, the EGR system <b>16</b>, and the turbocharger system <b>18</b> are directed through the centrifugal passage <b>124</b> into the chamber <b>106</b> for liquid/gas separation, as described herein in more detail.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With particular reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the lower housing <b>102</b> generally includes a main body <b>130</b> defining an open end <b>132</b> with a shoulder <b>134</b> to receive a lower portion of the upper housing main body <b>110</b> therein. A seal <b>136</b> (e.g., O-ring) is disposed within a channel or seat <b>138</b> formed in the lower portion of the upper housing main body <b>110</b> to establish a seal between the upper and lower housings <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>. A pair of projections <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) extend outwardly from the main body <b>130</b> and include an aperture <b>142</b> configured to receive a fastener <b>144</b> (e.g., bolt). The apertures <b>142</b> align with apertures <b>146</b> formed in a pair of flanges <b>148</b> extending outwardly from the upper housing main body <b>110</b>. The fasteners <b>144</b> are inserted through apertures <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> to couple the upper housing <b>100</b> to the lower housing <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the inner walls <b>104</b> of the lower housing <b>102</b> converge as they extend from the upper housing <b>100</b> to a liquid outlet <b>150</b> defined in the lower housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The primary function of the CCGS <b>22</b> is to receive the liquid/gas flow mixture from the inlet ports <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and separate it into mostly vapor and mostly liquid. The high velocity vortex of the centrifugal separation chamber <b>106</b> drives low density vapor toward the center, and the mostly vapor flow mixture is directed through gas coolant outlet port <b>120</b> to the degas bottle <b>54</b> via a conduit <b>152</b> for final gas/liquid separation. At the same time, the high velocity vortex drives the higher density liquid to the inner walls <b>104</b> and the mostly liquid flow mixture is directed through the liquid outlet <b>150</b> to the pump <b>70</b> via conduit <b>154</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example operation, engine system <b>10</b> is cooled by liquid coolant circulated by the water pump <b>70</b> through the cooling system <b>20</b>. More specifically, the liquid coolant is circulated by the water pump <b>70</b> through various conduits to a plurality of engine system components including cylinder head and IEM system <b>14</b>, EGR system <b>16</b>, and a turbocharger system <b>18</b>. The coolant flowing through these components absorbs heat therefrom thus reducing the temperature of the component. However, during this heat exchange, liquid coolant may be heated to its boiling point, thereby converting some liquid coolant to a vapor or gas. Air or vapor trapped in the coolant can potentially lead to adverse effects on the system <b>10</b>, thus it is desirable to remove the trapped gas by deaeration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the present example, pump <b>70</b> supplies coolant to rear and front IEMs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> for cooling thereof. The warmed coolant exits the IEMSs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> into vent line <b>50</b> and subsequently flows to the CCGS <b>22</b>. Another portion of warmed coolant exits through the degas outlet port <b>42</b> into conduit <b>56</b> and subsequently flows to the degas bottle <b>54</b>. Still another portion of the coolant exits through the outlet port <b>38</b> into conduit <b>52</b> and subsequently flows to the EGR cooler <b>60</b>. After absorbing heat from the EGR cooler <b>60</b>, vaporized coolant subsequently flows through vapor outlet port <b>64</b> and conduit <b>68</b> to the CCGS <b>22</b>. Any remaining liquid coolant subsequently flows through liquid outlet port <b>66</b> and returns to pump <b>70</b>. Pump <b>70</b> supplies another portion of the coolant to turbocharger assemblies <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The warmed coolant is then directed via outlet ports <b>82</b> and conduits <b>84</b> to the CCGS <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the current example, CCGS inlet ports <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> receive relatively higher pressure forced flows from the cylinder head and IEM system <b>14</b> and the turbocharger system <b>18</b>. This forced flow is supplied through internal passageway <b>118</b> and then passes through the tuned orifice <b>122</b>, which increases flow velocity. The high pressure, high velocity coolant is directed through centrifugal passage <b>124</b> and passes a fluid connection to third inlet port <b>116</b>, which via a Venturi effect, induces a flow of relatively lower pressure coolant from the EGR cooler <b>60</b> through the third inlet port <b>116</b>. Since coolant exiting the EGR cooler <b>60</b> is flowing at a lower pressure relative to CCGS inlet ports <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, flow from the EGR cooler <b>60</b> to the CCGS <b>22</b> must be induced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly, in the example embodiment, the flows of relatively higher pressure coolant flows into the centrifugal passage <b>124</b> and is combined with the relatively low pressure flow of coolant from EGR cooler <b>60</b> at the induced inlet <b>116</b>. The combined coolant flows are then directed into the centrifugal separation chamber <b>106</b>, which creates a high velocity vortex. Pressure differences in the vortex drive low density gas towards the center of the chamber <b>106</b> while higher density liquid coolant is driven by centrifugal forces toward the inner walls <b>104</b>. The converging walls <b>104</b> force separated gas upward and out of the CCGS <b>22</b> through the gas-rich coolant outlet port <b>120</b> and to the degas bottle <b>54</b> for further deaeration. The separated liquid coolant flows through outlet port <b>150</b> and is returned back to pump <b>70</b> for recirculation through the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Described herein are systems and methods for cooling system intermediate deaeration with flow induction features. The system includes a centrifugal coolant gas separator with one or more high pressure flow inlet ports and one or more low pressure flow inlet ports. A tuned orifice and centrifugal passage induce flow through the low pressure flow inlet port. The combined coolant flows then enter a centrifugal separation chamber to separate the gas and liquid coolant. Mostly gaseous coolant is directed to the center of the chamber and forced upward to an outlet and then to a degas bottle for final separation. Mostly liquid coolant is directed outward and downward in the chamber to another outlet and then to a pump for recirculation in the system. Accordingly, the centrifugal coolant gas separator advantageously provides intermediate deaeration and separation prior to the degas bottle, thereby reducing the amount of overall flow the degas bottle is required to handle. Further, the separator induces inlet flow from relatively lower pressure portion of the cooling system, thereby obviating additional delivery components (e.g., pumps) or plumbing, and avoiding flow reversal when source pressure is too low. As such, the CCGS gas and liquid outlets are tuned to ensure the degas bottle flow limit is not exceeded even when total coolant deaeration flow from all components (IEM's, turbo's, EGR cooler, and cylinder head) exceeds (e.g., doubles) the flow capacity of the degas bottle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be understood that the mixing and matching of features, elements, methodologies, systems and/or functions between various examples may be expressly contemplated herein so that one skilled in the art will appreciate from the present teachings that features, elements, systems and/or functions of one example may be incorporated into another example as appropriate, unless described otherwise above.
