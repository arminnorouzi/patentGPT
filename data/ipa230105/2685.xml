Because of regulatory requirements for the reduction of the sulfur content of fuels for environmental reasons, refineries have been, and continue to be faced with the disposal of large volumes of sulfur-containing by-products.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disulfide oil (DSO) compounds are produced as a by-product of the MEROX process in which the mercaptans are removed from any of a variety of petroleum streams including liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, and other hydrocarbon fractions. It is commonly referred to as a &#x2018;sweetening process&#x2019; because it removes the sour or foul smelling mercaptans present in crude petroleum. The term &#x201c;DSO&#x201d; is used for convenience in this description and in the claims, and will be understood to include the mixture of disulfide oils produced as by-products of the mercaptan oxidation process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As noted above, the designation &#x201c;MEROX&#x201d; originates from the function of the process itself, that is, the conversion of mercaptans by oxidation. The MEROX process in all of its applications is based on the ability of an organometallic catalyst in a basic environment, such as a caustic, to accelerate the oxidation of mercaptans to disulfides at near ambient temperatures and pressures. The overall reaction can be expressed as follows:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RSH+&#xbc;O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;&#xbd;RSSR+&#xbd;H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">where R is a hydrocarbon chain that may be straight, branched, or cyclic, and the chains can be saturated or unsaturated. In most petroleum fractions, there will be a mixture of mercaptans so that the R can have 1, 2, 3 and up to 10 or more carbon atoms in the chain. This variable chain length is indicated by R and R&#x2032; in the reaction. The reaction is then written:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2R&#x2032;SH+2RSH+O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;2R&#x2032;SSR+2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">This reaction occurs spontaneously whenever any sour mercaptan-bearing distillate is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, but proceeds at a very slow rate. In addition, the catalyzed reaction (1) set forth above requires the presence of an alkali caustic solution, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mercaptan oxidation proceeds at an economically practical rate at moderate refinery downstream temperatures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">The MEROX process can be conducted on both liquid streams and on combined gaseous and liquid streams. In the case of liquid streams, the mercaptans are converted directly to disulfides which remain in the product so that there is no reduction in total sulfur content of the effluent stream.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">The MEROX process typically utilizes a fixed bed reactor system for liquid streams and is normally employed with charge stocks having end points above 135&#xb0; C.-150&#xb0; C. Mercaptans are converted to disulfides in the fixed bed reactor system over a catalyst, for example, an activated charcoal impregnated with the MEROX reagent, and wetted with caustic solution. Air is injected into the hydrocarbon feedstream ahead of the reactor and in passing through the catalyst-impregnated bed, the mercaptans in the feed are oxidized to disulfides. The disulfides are substantially insoluble in the caustic and remain in the hydrocarbon phase. Post treatment is required to remove undesirable by-products resulting from known side reactions such as the neutralization of H<sub>2</sub>S, the oxidation of phenolic compounds, entrained caustic, and others.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">The vapor pressures of disulfides are relatively low compared to those of mercaptans, so that their presence is much less objectionable from the standpoint of odor; however, they are not environmentally acceptable due to their sulfur content and their disposal can be problematical.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In the case of mixed gas and liquid streams, extraction is applied to both phases of the hydrocarbon streams. The degree of completeness of the mercaptan extraction depends upon the solubility of the mercaptans in the alkaline solution, which is a function of the molecular weight of the individual mercaptans, the extent of the branching of the mercaptan molecules, the concentration of the caustic soda and the temperature of the system. Thereafter, the resulting DSO compounds are separated and the caustic solution is regenerated by oxidation with air in the presence of the catalyst and reused.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Referring to the attached drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic of a generalized version of a conventional MEROX process employing liquid-liquid extraction for removing sulfur compounds.

A variety of catalysts have been developed for the commercial practice of the process. The efficiency of the MEROX process is also a function of the amount of H<sub>2</sub>S present in the stream.

No standards were measured against the components; however, the data in Table 1 is accurate as representing relative quantities. Quantitative total sulfur content was determined by energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy which indicated 63 W % of sulfur, and this value will be used in later calculations. The GC-MS results provide evidence of trace quantities of tri-sulfide species; however, the majority of the disulfide oil stream comprises the three components identified in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The by-product disulfide oils produced by the MEROX unit can be processed and/or disposed of in various other refinery units' operations. For example, the DSO can be added to the fuel oil pool at the expense of a resulting higher sulfur content of the pool. The DSO can be processed in a hydrotreating/hydrocracking unit at the expense of higher hydrogen consumption. The disulfide oil also has an unpleasant foul or sour smell, which is somewhat less prevalent because of its relatively lower vapor pressure at ambient temperature; however, problems exist in the handling of this oil.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">An enhanced MEROX process (&#x201c;E-MEROX&#x201d;) is a modified MEROX process where an additional step is added. In the additional step, the DSO compounds are oxidized with an oxidant in the presence of a catalyst to produce a mixture of oxidized disulfide oil (ODSO) compounds. By-product DSO compounds from the mercaptan oxidation process can be oxidized, preferably in the presence of a catalyst, and constitute an abundant source of ODSO compounds that are sulfoxides, sulfonates, sulfinates, sulfones and their corresponding di-sulfur mixtures.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The oxidant can be a liquid peroxide selected from the group consisting of alkyl hydroperoxides, aryl hydroperoxides, dialkyl peroxides, diaryl peroxides, peresters and hydrogen peroxide. The oxidant can also be a gas, including air, oxygen, ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The catalyst is preferably a homogeneous water-soluble compound that is a transition metal containing an active species selected from the group consisting of Mo (VI), W (VI), V (V), Ti (IV), and their combination.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">The ODSO compounds produced in the E-MEROX process generally comprise two phases: a water-soluble phase and water-insoluble phase. The E-MEROX process can be tuned depending on the desired ratio of water-soluble to water-insoluble compounds presented in the product ODSO mixture. Partial oxidation of DSO compounds results in a higher relative amount of water-insoluble ODSO compounds present in the ODSO product and a near or almost complete oxidation of DSO compounds results in a higher relative amount of water-soluble ODSO present in the ODSO product.

The fractionation zone can include a distillation unit. In certain embodiments, the distillation unit can be a flash distillation unit with no theoretical plates in order to obtain distillation cuts with larger overlaps with each other or, alternatively, on other embodiments, the distillation unit can be a flash distillation unit with at least <b>15</b> theoretical plate in order to have effective separation between cuts. In certain embodiments, the distillation unit can operate at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature in the range of from 100&#xb0; C. to 225&#xb0; C. In other embodiments, the fractionation can be carried out continuously under vacuum conditions. In those embodiments, fractionation occurs at reduced pressures and at their respective boiling temperatures. For example, at 350 mbar and 10 mbar, the temperature ranges are from 80&#xb0; C. to 194&#xb0; C. and 11&#xb0; C. to 98&#xb0; C., respectively. Following fractionation, the wastewater is sent to the wastewater pool (not shown) for conventional treatment prior to its disposal. The wastewater by-product fraction can contain a small amount of water insoluble ODSO compounds, for example, in the range of from 1 ppmw to 10,000 ppmw. The wastewater by-product fraction can contain a small amount of water soluble ODSO compounds, for example, in the range of from 1 ppmw to 50,000 ppmw, or 100 ppmw to 50,000 ppmw. In embodiments where alcohol is the by-product alcohol, the alcohol can be recovered and sold as a commodity product or added to fuels like gasoline. The alcohol by-product fraction can contain a small amount of water insoluble ODSO compounds, for example, in the range of from 1 ppmw to 10,000 ppmw. The alcohol by-product fraction can contain a small amount of water soluble ODSO compounds, for example, in the range of from 100 ppmw to 50,000 ppmw</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">As described in U.S. Pat.

No. 10,793,782, the ODSO compounds have also been found to have utility as solvents for aromatic solvent extraction processes, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event that a refiner has produced or has on hand an amount of DSO compounds that is in excess of foreseeable needs for these or other uses, the refiner may wish to dispose of the DSO compounds in order to clear a storage vessel and/or eliminate the product from inventory to reduce refinery waste.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In a conventional refinery arrangement, it is known to use several hydroprocessing zones in order to treat specific fractions of hydrocarbon feeds, such as crude oil. Hydroprocessing is useful for the purpose of improving the hydrocarbon feed for example, by reduction of sulfur content of the hydrocarbon feeds, an increase in the API gravity of the hydrocarbon feeds, a reduction in the metal content of the hydrocarbon feeds, or a combination thereof. Conventional hydroprocessing technologies such as hydrocracking and two-stage hydrotreating offer solutions to refiners for the production of clean transportation fuels. These technologies are available and can be applied as new grassroots production facilities are constructed. Examples of conventional hydroprocessing technologies include naphtha hydrotreating units, diesel hydrotreating units, vacuum gas oil hydrotreating units and vacuum gas oil hydrocracking units.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">Thus, there is a clear and long-standing need to provide an efficient and economical process for the treatment of the large volumes of DSO by-products and their derivatives to effect and modify their properties in order to facilitate and simplify their environmentally acceptable disposal, and/or to permit the utilization of the modified products within the refinery, and thereby enhance the value of this class of by-products to the refiner.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0032">The above needs are realized and other advantages are provided by the process of the present invention that economically uses oxidized disulfide oils or a blend of oxidized disulfide oils and disulfide oils, which are of relatively low value, as a reactant in a hydroprocessing zone.

Single-stage once through hydrocracking is the simplest of the hydrocracker configuration and typically occurs at operating conditions that are more severe than hydrotreating processes, and less severe than conventional higher pressure hydrocracking processes. It uses one or more reactors for both treating steps and cracking reaction, so the catalyst must be capable of both hydrotreating and hydrocracking. This configuration is cost effective, but typically results in relatively low product yields (for example, a maximum conversion rate of about 50 wt %). Single stage hydrocracking is often designed to maximize mid-distillate yield over a single or dual catalyst systems. Dual catalyst systems can be used in a stacked-bed configuration or in two different reactors. The effluents are passed to a fractionator column to separate the H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, light gases (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), naphtha and middle distillate products, boiling in the temperature range including and below atmospheric gas oil range fractions (for instance in the temperature range of 36-370&#xb0; C.).
