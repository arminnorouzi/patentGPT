Fifth generation (5G) wireless systems refer to the next generation (NG) of radio systems and network architecture. 5G is mostly built on a new radio (NR), but the 5G (or NG) network can also build on E-UTRAN radio. It is estimated that NR will provide bitrates on the order of 10-20 Gbit/s or higher, and will support at least enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency-communication (URLLC) as well as massive machine type communication (mMTC). NR is expected to deliver extreme broadband and ultra-robust, low latency connectivity and massive networking to support the Internet of Things (IoT). With IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication becoming more widespread, there will be a growing need for networks that meet the needs of lower power, low data rate, and long battery life. It is noted that, in 5G, the nodes that can provide radio access functionality to a user equipment (i.e., similar to Node B in UTRAN or eNB in LTE) are named gNB when built on NR radio and named NG-eNB when built on E-UTRAN radio.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some example embodiments are directed to a method.

The following is a detailed description of some example embodiments of systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for multiport phase tracking reference signal (PTRS) for new radio (NR) discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) spread orthogonal frequency division multiplex (DFT-s-OFDM).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The features, structures, or characteristics of example embodiments described throughout this specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments. For example, the usage of the phrases &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in other embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments, and the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, if desired, the different functions or steps discussed below may be performed in a different order and/or concurrently with each other. Furthermore, if desired, one or more of the described functions or steps may be optional or may be combined. As such, the following description should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles and teachings of certain example embodiments, and not in limitation thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Certain example embodiments may relate to radio frequency (RF) impairment and/or channel compensation in discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) spread orthogonal frequency division multiplex (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform based new radio (NR) cellular systems operating in cm- or mm-bands (or THz-bands). For instance, certain example embodiments may be related to time-domain phase tracking reference signal (PTRS) designs for the DFT-s-OFDM waveform including, for example, for scenarios above 52.6 GHz. Although certain example embodiments focus on DFT-s-OFDM waveform, the solution can be applied to other single carrier waveforms, such as ZHT-SC-FDM (zero head tail single carrier FDM) or SC-FDE (single carrier frequency domain equalization).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Operation for frequencies up to 52.6 GHz has been defined, and existing physical layer channels have been designed and optimized for scenarios under 52.6 GHz. The frequencies beyond that may contain large spectrum allocations, and may support many high capacity use cases. In addition, 5G NR beyond 52.6 GHz spectrum ranges, use cases, development scenarios, and requirements have been described in 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">3GPP study items (SI) assume that the existing downlink/uplink (DL/UL) waveforms may also be used in the 60 GHz band. Although this may be a reasonable assumption for unlicensed band scenarios, for licensed band scenarios, such as licensed band operation at 66-71 GHz, the waveform may become the bottleneck. As such, the design may take into consideration certain aspects including, for example, an efficient transceiver design, including power efficiency and complexity. It may also take into consideration improvement of coverage to cope with extreme propagation loss. Moreover, it may consider inheriting physical layer channel design for frequencies below 52.6 GHz when applicable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next generation systems above 52.6 GHz may have to cope with increased path loss, larger antenna arrays, and less efficient RF components such as power amplifiers (PAs), and increased transceiver impairments such as phase noise (PN). Further, increased path loss and low-efficiency RF components may result in limited coverage and, thus, it may be desirable to maximize coverage. Choice of the waveform may have a crucial role in providing sufficient coverage. In this regard, 3GPP Rel-15 supports cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM in DL, and both CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM (also known as single carrier frequency division multiplex (SC-FDM)) in UL (DFT-s-OFDM supports only rank-1 transmission).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, DFT-s-OFDM may be supported for coverage-limited scenarios since it may have a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and, thus, may provide better coverage. Another benefit of DFT-s-OFDM is that it may use time-domain PTRS, which may be significantly more robust for phase noise than frequency-domain PTRS, which is used in CP-OFDM. As such, DFT-s-OFDM may be a good option for both DL and UL in NR systems operating in carrier frequencies greater than 52.6 GHz.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In NR systems greater than 52.6 GHz, it may be necessary to cope with wide ranges of bandwidth and, thus, multiple subcarrier spacings. NR may provide support for multiple numerologies as shown in Table 1. In particular, Table 1 presents the existing numerologies in 5G NR (below 52.6 GHz), and the numerology may scale higher in &#x3e;52.6 GHz. For example, as shown in Table 1 (Note: 240 kHz SCS is supported currently only for synchronization signal block (SSB)), larger subcarrier spacing leads to larger carrier bandwidth for a given fast Fourier transform (FFT) size, reduced sensitivity to phase noise, and reduced CP length.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Supported Transmission Numerologies</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>&#x3bc;</entry><entry>&#x394;f = 2<sup>&#x3bc;</sup> &#xb7; 15[kHz]</entry><entry>Cyclic prefix</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>0</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>Normal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>Normal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>60</entry><entry>Normal, Extended</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>Normal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>240</entry><entry>Normal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">A bandwidth part (BWP) size of 275 physical resource blocks (PRBs) may be supported in NR Rel-15. Thus, the maximum BWP size according to NR Rel-15 may be 396 MHz (0.12 MHz times12 times 275). However, this is not enough for scenarios above 52.6 GHz where channel bandwidth may be as high as 10 GHz. Additionally, phase noise and the Doppler effect in case the user equipment (UE) is moving may also be increased. Further, larger subcarrier spacings may need to be introduced to address the phase noise, and to provide larger carrier bandwidth with reasonable FFT size. This may be achieved by extending numerology scaling framework defined in NR-Rel 15 to support additional values for &#x3bc; according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which illustrates various numerology candidates for scenarios above 52.6 GHz. For example, extending the numerology framework may include features of 2<sup>&#x3bc;</sup> scaling of subcarrier spacing, inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT)/FFT block length 2<sup>&#x3bc;</sup>, and clock rate 2<sup>&#x3bc;</sup> related to LTE.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">At carrier frequencies above 52.6 GHz, oscillator induced PN due to implementation imperfections may become gradually more significant with increasing frequency. In general, PN may increase 6 dB when the carrier frequency is doubled. This may result in severe degradation of detection performance, especially when higher order modulation schemes are used. In other words, this may result in the system not working in scenarios above 52.6 GHz if the PN is not properly taken into account. In addition to oscillator induced PN, time-domain phase variations may also exist due to other phenomena such as frequency drifts due to Doppler shift, or due to insufficient frequency synchronization. Thus, depending on the receiver's operation point, which may be characterized by factors including, for example, carrier frequency, subcarrier spacing, scheduled bandwidth and modulation and coding scheme (MCS), and UE velocity, the phase variation due to any of the above-mentioned effects may require compensation to guarantee successful data transmission.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">As described in NR Rel-15/16, UL DFT-s-OFDM may support single port transmission. However, changes may be necessary due to various reasons. For instance, changes may be necessary because single-port transmission is inefficient since there is no support for space-division multiple access (SDMA). This will reduce the achievable data rate and the spectrum efficiency. In addition, SDMA may be a primary multiplexing method over, for example, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) because the power consumption of digital parts may drive the use of analog RF beamforming. This may result in a single (or very few) RF beam being steered at one time. In addition, SDM may allow for use of lower order modulation for the same rate, resulting in improved coverage compared to higher order modulation needed with FDM. This may be due to the fact that PA output power back-off increases significantly when increasing modulation order. Furthermore, use of higher modulation order may be more limited by PN, which further reduces the coverage. Thus, a way to provide larger throughput and coverage may be to increase transmission rank, and use spatial multiplexing such as multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Low-PAR transmission mode (i.e., low-order modulations) with spatial multiplexing may be an effective transmission mode in greater than 52.6 GHz UL DFT-s-OFDM. In particular, if the data rate needs to be doubled, the transmission (TX) rank may be doubled or the modulation order may be doubled. Both of these may double the required TX power, but increasing the rank may maintain the PA output power, whereas increasing modulation order may decrease the PA output power (and increase PN impact) and, thus, the coverage. Furthermore, there can also be differences in the link performance. Typically, with certain data rate and BLER operation point, MIMO with a lower modulation and coding scheme may allow for a smaller SNR requirement compared to SIMO using a higher modulation and coding scheme.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Since SDMA may be required to make the system more efficient from the spectrum efficiency and coverage point of view, UL DFT-s-OFDM may need to support both single user (SU)-MIMO and multiuser (MU)-MIMO, and it may be necessary to provide a method to design the PTRS allocations. In certain examples, MU-MIMO may require antenna port specific PTRS since PN is uncorrelated between antenna ports. With SU-MIMO, the necessity of antenna port specific PTRS may depend on the architecture because the local oscillator (LO) may be common or separate for different antenna ports. Further, architecture based on separate LO (distributed) may require antenna port specific PTRS since PN is uncorrelated between antenna ports, while single-port PTRS may generally be enough with localized (centralized) architectures based on the common LO.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">However, even in the centralized case, the minimal interference for the PTRS may need to be guaranteed to obtain reliable estimates. A further issue may be that the system may have to support multiple bandwidths and subcarrier spacings (e.g., bandwidths from 400 MHz to 2 GHz and/or subcarrier spacings from 120 kHz to 3840 kHz). In addition, increased sub-carrier spacing (SCS) means that the effect of PN may be reduced and, thus, less PTRSs may be required to compensate it, and significantly more PTRSs may be required with 120 kHz SCS than with 960 kHz or 3840 kHz. In addition to the number of required PTRSs, optimum time domain pattern may depend on the subcarrier spacing. Thus, certain example embodiments described herein may provide solutions for performing PTRS allocation in cases of when multiport transmission with MU-MIMO or SU-MIMO using centralized or localized architecture is supported for DFT-s-OFDM.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In NR Rel-15, DFT-s-OFDM is supported in UL, and the presence of a PTRS pattern is UE-specifically configurable (i.e., whether it exists or not), and multiple patterns/densities are supported. Furthermore, NR Rel-15/16, provides a description of UL DFT-s-OFDM support for single port transmission. Further, PTRSs may be inserted in groups so that there exists certain number of groups per DFT-s-OFDM symbol, and a certain number of consecutive PTRSs per group.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of DFT-s-OFDM (left) and OFDM (right) rank-2 performance in 90 GHz carrier frequency based on Rel-15 PTRS.

The UE may also assume the phase tracking reference signal (PT-RS) antenna ports' presence and PT-RS group pattern are a function of the corresponding scheduled bandwidth in a corresponding BWP. Further, the UE may assume no PT-RS is present when the number of scheduled RBs is less than N<sub>RB0 </sub>if N<sub>RB0</sub>&#x3e;1, or if the radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) equals temporary cell (TC)-RNTI.

For instance, code division multiplexing (CDM) across the L consequent PT-RS samples in time within a PT-RS burst has been described. This is to separate multiple PT-RS ports of a given UE or multiple PT-RS ports among different MU-MIMO users. However, the subcarrier spacing and/or transmission mode dependent time domain PTRS patterns have not been considered. In other words, it has not been considered how to optimally allocate available resources as a function of subcarrier spacing by taking into account MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO with different transceiver architectures.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">NR Rel-15 supports multiple UE-specifically configurable patterns and densities. Thus, a similar approach may be used also for scenarios greater than 52.6 GHz (for rank-1 transmission). However, this approach may result in several challenges. For instance, one challenge is that the system may require a significant amount of signaling related to configurations of optimum patterns for different numerologies. In addition, scenarios above 52.6 GHz may support a wide range of different PHY configuration options, which may require different PTRS approaches. Furthermore, it does not scale to Rank&#x3e;1 transmission. Another challenge is that there may be high receiver complexity because receiver needs may be separately optimized for different patterns. Further, a third challenge may be due to a complex conformance test since every pattern may need to be tested with every possible subcarrier spacing in order to be sure that the system works as expected.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In view of the above challenges, certain example embodiments may provide a PTRS design for multiport DFT-s-OFDM transmission, which may be efficiently operated with different transmission rank (e.g., MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO with different transmitter architectures), SCS, MCSs, and bandwidths with neither incurring extra signaling overhead nor receiver complexity. In certain example embodiments, several scenarios may be provided including, for example, physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH)/physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) MU-MIMO/SU-MIMO based on single carrier waveform. According to certain example embodiments, scalable clustered PTRS allocation may be used such that the amount of PTRS symbols varies according to channel rank depending on the MIMO mode.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">According to certain example embodiments, a rank dependent PTRS configuration (pattern) may be provided. In an example embodiment, the rank dependent PTRS configuration may be dependent upon the communication scenario. For example, PTRS configuration for rank-1 may be characterized by means of two parameters: M and N (M&#xd7;N), where M represents the number of PTRS groups per DFT-s-OFDM symbol, and N is the number of PTRS samples (symbols) per group.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Certain example embodiments may provide a design that scales to rank&#x3e;1, and that can effectively operate with multiple SCSs/MCSs, quality of service (QoS) level, and bandwidths without significant signaling overhead, receiver complexity, or testing efforts. For instance, certain example embodiments may provide PTRS configuration with M&#xd7;N, and how to use M&#xd7;N when rank&#x3e;1 is used since M&#xd7;N is needed for every antenna port. Certain example embodiments may also scale M and N in a specific manner, and then design CDM to handle the interference. Other example embodiments may provide certain M&#xd7;N designs depending on SCS/MCS/numerology/rank so that it explicitly depends on those to ultimately provide a simple design.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">To support rank&#x3e;1 transmission, certain example embodiments may define PTRS configuration according to a maximum rank, which may take into account both SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO. For instance, in one example embodiment, the number of resource elements for PTRS (M times N&#x2032;) may be increased with increasing the maximum rank, where N&#x2032;=rank times N. According to an example embodiment, the increase may be made by determining the number of resource elements in the PTRS group (N&#x2032;) in a way that it supports CDM multiplexing of PTRS antenna ports according to the maximum rank. In certain example embodiments, when max rank=1, N&#x2032; may be an integer. When max rank=2, N&#x2032; may be a multiple of 2, and when max rank=4, N&#x2032; may be a multiple of 4.
