For example, nonwoven glass mats are used as facers for gypsum boards and polyisocyanurate (&#x201c;polyiso&#x201d;) boards. One problem associated with nonwoven glass mats used as facers for gypsum and polyiso boards is that the nonwoven glass mats are somewhat permeable, which leads to the gypsum or polyiso material bleeding through the nonwoven glass mat. A known solution to the bleed-through problem is to provide a coating layer containing inorganic fillers and a polymer binder on a surface of a pre-formed nonwoven glass mat. The coating layer fills void spaces in the nonwoven glass mat to make the nonwoven glass mat less permeable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, application of a coating layer to the nonwoven glass mat requires additional raw materials to form the coating material and additional processing equipment, both of which increase the cost of producing the nonwoven glass mat. In addition, application of a coating layer increases the basis weight of the nonwoven glass mat, which may further increase the costs (e.g., transportation costs) associated with the coated nonwoven glass mat.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The general inventive concepts relate to a nonwoven mat that includes a plurality of reinforcing fibers and a binder composition that contains a polycarboxy polymer and a plurality of polymer microspheres, and a method of making such a nonwoven mat.

Accordingly, the general inventive concepts are not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The materials and methods described herein are intended to be used to provide nonwoven articles with improved characteristics. More specifically, nonwoven mats having a less permeable (i.e., more closed) structure and increased caliper (i.e., thickness) are disclosed. It is believed that the interactions between components of the binder composition used to form the nonwoven mats synergistically provide a less permeable structure and increased caliper. Both characteristics are desirable when the nonwoven mats are used as facer materials for gypsum boards and polyiso boards, as both characteristics can substantially reduce or prevent bleed-through of the gypsum and polyiso material when these materials are deposited onto the nonwoven mat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The terms &#x201c;binder&#x201d; and &#x201c;binder composition,&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to mean a material that holds one or more components of a nonwoven article together. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a binder composition is often an aqueous mixture or solution of dissolved ingredients that is cured to bond reinforcing fibers together.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;polymer microspheres,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to particles of thermoplastic resin material that have a blowing agent encapsulated therein and which expand upon heating.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;low-density fiber,&#x201d; as used herein, refers generally to fibers which have one or more of the following characteristics: i) the fiber can be easily dispersed and suspended into an aqueous solution or binder composition without sedimentation over time (e.g., over a 24-hour period); and ii) the fiber can flow easily when the fiber/binder composition is applied on a nonwoven mat in a wet-laid process with a relatively low viscosity (e.g., a viscosity of less than 500 cps at room temperature). In certain embodiments, the low-density fiber may have a fiber length of less than 1 mm. Fiber lengths such as this prevent excess fiber buildup over time, which can reduce line cleanup and downtime.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Ranges as used herein are intended to include every number and subset of numbers within that range, whether specifically disclosed or not. Further, these numerical ranges should be construed as providing support for a claim directed to any number or subset of numbers in that range. For example, a disclosure of from 1 to 10 should be construed as supporting a range of from 2 to 8, from 3 to 7, from 5 to 6, from 1 to 9, from 3.6 to 4.6, from 3.5 to 9.9, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">All references to singular characteristics or limitations of the present disclosure shall include the corresponding plural characteristic or limitation, and vice versa, unless otherwise specified or clearly implied to the contrary by the context in which the reference is made.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">All combinations of method or process steps as used herein can be performed in any order, unless otherwise specified or clearly implied to the contrary by the context in which the referenced combination is made.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an exemplary embodiment, the general inventive concepts relate to a nonwoven mat. The nonwoven mat comprises a plurality of reinforcing fibers and a binder composition comprising a polycarboxy polymer and a plurality of polymer microspheres. Each of the polymer microspheres comprises a thermoplastic shell encapsulating a blowing agent, and magnesium hydroxide distributed throughout the thermoplastic shell, which means that magnesium hydroxide is present on an inner surface of the thermoplastic shell, magnesium hydroxide is present on an outer surface of the thermoplastic shell, and magnesium hydroxide is present within the material forming the thermoplastic shell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an exemplary embodiment, the general inventive concepts relate to a method of making a nonwoven mat. The method includes the steps of: a) depositing an aqueous reinforcing fiber slurry onto a processing line to form a wet laid mat having a first major surface and a second major surface; b) applying a binder composition to at least one of the first major surface and the second major surface of the wet laid mat, wherein the binder composition comprises a polycarboxy polymer and a plurality of polymer microspheres, wherein each of the polymer microspheres comprises a thermoplastic shell encapsulating a blowing agent, and magnesium hydroxide distributed throughout the thermoplastic shell; and c) heating the wet laid mat to cure the binder composition and cause the polymer microspheres to expand, thereby forming the nonwoven mat.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an exemplary embodiment, the general inventive concepts relate to a construction board comprising a substrate and a nonwoven mat attached to the substrate. The nonwoven mat comprises a plurality of reinforcing fibers and a binder composition comprising a polycarboxy polymer and a plurality of polymer microspheres. Each of the polymer microspheres comprises a thermoplastic shell encapsulating a blowing agent, and magnesium hydroxide distributed throughout the thermoplastic shell. In certain embodiments, the binder composition comprises a plurality of low-density fibers, as described herein. In certain embodiments, the substrate comprises gypsum. In certain embodiments, the substrate comprises a foam.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Nonwoven mats according to the general inventive concepts may be formed using conventional processes including, but not limited to, wet laid processes. For example, in a wet laid process, wet chopped reinforcing fibers are dispersed in a water slurry that contains surfactants, viscosity modifiers, defoaming agents, and/or other chemical agents. The slurry containing the chopped reinforcing fibers is then agitated so that the reinforcing fibers become dispersed throughout the slurry. The slurry containing the reinforcing fibers is deposited onto a moving screen where a substantial portion of the water is removed to form a web of randomly oriented reinforcing fibers. A binder composition is then applied, and the resulting nonwoven mat is dried to remove any remaining water and to cure the binder composition. The formed nonwoven mat is an assembly of dispersed, individual chopped reinforcing fibers interconnected by the binder composition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Nonwoven mats comprised of reinforcing fibers are used in a variety of applications. For example, nonwoven fiberglass mats are used as reinforcement in ceiling tiles, roofing shingles, and construction boards (e.g., wall boards, insulation boards), among other applications. The mats are used to provide strength and other favorable properties to the ultimate product. One drawback of nonwoven fiberglass mats is the relatively permeable structure of the mat, especially when used to form a construction board comprised of gypsum or polyiso materials. While a relatively permeable structure may be desirable in certain applications, it can be a hindrance in other applications. In general, when using a nonwoven fiberglass mat to form a gypsum wall board or a polyiso insulation board, the nonwoven fiberglass mat requires additional binder materials to &#x201c;close&#x201d; the voids present in the mat (i.e., to reduce its permeability) to prevent bleed-through. Due to issues such as increased viscosity, additional binder materials can only be added to a binder composition up to a certain point. Thus, nonwoven fiberglass mats used as a facer material for gypsum boards and polyiso boards often require a second application (or more) of a binder composition or even a separately applied coating layer to provide the nonwoven mat with a desired level of permeability. These solutions, however, increase the loss on ignition (LOI) (a measure of the amount of binder composition present in the nonwoven mat) and the basis weight of the nonwoven mat and, hence, the overall cost of the nonwoven mat. Accordingly, there is a need for a nonwoven mat that is sufficiently closed to prevent bleed-through without having to significantly increase the LOI and/or the basis weight of the nonwoven mat.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The general inventive concepts are based, at least in part, on the discovery that nonwoven mats formed with a binder composition that includes a polycarboxy compound and polymer microspheres exhibit reduced permeability and increased caliper. It is believed that the interaction between the polycarboxy compound and the polymer microspheres present in the binder composition lead to the reduced permeability and the increased caliper of the resulting nonwoven mats. The reduced permeability and increased caliper are also achieved without having to significantly increase the LOI or the basis weight of the nonwoven mat.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with the present disclosure, a nonwoven mat comprises a plurality of reinforcing fibers and a binder composition comprising a polycarboxy polymer and a plurality of polymer microspheres. Each of the polymer microspheres comprises a thermoplastic shell encapsulating a blowing agent, and magnesium hydroxide distributed throughout the thermoplastic shell.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The nonwoven mat of the present disclosure may be formed from a variety of reinforcing fibers. Exemplary reinforcing fibers for forming the nonwoven mat of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, glass fibers, synthetic fibers (e.g., polyester fibers, polyethylene fibers, polypropylene fibers, polyethylene terephthalate fibers, polyamide fibers, aramid fibers, polyaramid fibers), mineral fibers, cellulose fibers, carbon fibers, ceramic fibers, or a blend of two or more different types of reinforcing fibers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the nonwoven mat comprises glass fibers as the reinforcing fibers. The glass fibers can be made from any suitable type of glass. Exemplary glass fibers include, but are not limited to, A-type glass fibers, C-type glass fibers, E-type glass fibers, S-type glass fibers, ECR-type glass fibers (e.g., Advantex&#xae; glass fibers commercially available from Owens Corning of Toledo, Ohio), wool glass fibers, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat may have a variety of fiber diameters.

In certain other embodiments, the glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat have an average fiber diameter of 13 microns to 16 microns.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is also contemplated that a blend of glass fibers having different fiber diameters, such as a blend of smaller diameter glass fibers (e.g., average fiber diameter of 6.5 microns to 10 microns) and larger diameter glass fibers (e.g., average fiber diameter of 13 microns to 16 microns) may be used to form the nonwoven mat. In certain embodiments, the plurality of reinforcing fibers of the nonwoven mat comprise a blend of 50% to 70% by weight first glass fibers and 30% to 50% by weight second glass fibers, wherein the first glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 13 microns and the second glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 10 microns. In certain embodiments, the plurality of reinforcing fibers of the nonwoven mat comprise a blend of 55% to 65% by weight first glass fibers and 35% to 45% by weight second glass fibers, wherein the first glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 13 microns and the second glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 10 microns.

In certain embodiments, the glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat have an average fiber length of 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) to 2 inches (50.8 mm). In certain embodiments, the glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat have an average fiber length of 0.5 inches (12. 7 mm) to 1.5 inches (38.1 mm). In certain other embodiments, the glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat have an average fiber length of 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) to 1 inch (25.4 mm). In certain embodiments, the glass fibers used to form the nonwoven mat have an average fiber length of 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) to 0.5 inches (12. mm), including an average fiber length of 0.39 inches (10 mm). It is also contemplated that a blend of glass fibers having different fiber lengths, such as a blend of shorter glass fibers (e.g., average fiber length of 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) to 0.5 inches (12.7 mm)) and longer glass fibers (e.g., average fiber length of 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) to 1.25 inches (31.75 mm)) may be used to form the nonwoven mat. In certain embodiments, the plurality of reinforcing fibers of the nonwoven mat comprise a blend of 60% by weight first glass fibers and 40% by weight second glass fibers, wherein the first glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 13 microns and an average fiber length of 0.75 inches (19.05 mm), and the second glass fibers have an average fiber diameter of 10 microns and an average fiber length of 0.39 inches (10 mm).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As mentioned above, the nonwoven mat of the present disclosure also includes a binder composition that binds the reinforcing fibers together.

However, for this example, the average LOI achieved was around 21.4% (as opposed to 25%). During production of the mats in this example it was found that the mats couldn't be cured effectively, even after the cure temperature was increased to 500&#xb0; F. When evaluating the mats by scanning electron microscope (SEM) through a backscattered electron (BSE) imaging process, it was discovered that polymer microspheres had ruptured. After rupturing, the polymer microspheres would not have much of an impact on the air permeability or caliper of the mat. It was concluded that the polymer microspheres were unable to survive the curing conditions that were utilized.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As disclosed and suggested herein, the general inventive concepts relate to and contemplate an improved binder composition and nonwoven mats made using the binder composition.
