In general, a metal in liquid state is applied on the surface of the heat source and to contact a heat dissipation shell, so that the heat generated by the heat source can be exported rapidly through heat conduction. However, it is understood that the metal in liquid state is flowable. As a result, because of the carrying angles of the device or the shaking of the device, the metal in liquid state may flow to other places to cause inefficient heat dissipation. Moreover, when the metal in liquid state flows to other places to contact other components, short-circuit condition occurs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, in one embodiment of the instant disclosure, a heat dissipation structure assembly applicable to a heat source assembled on a circuit carrier plate is provided. The heat dissipation structure assembly comprises an elastic limiting member, a paste-type heat dissipation wall, a fitting member, a phase-change metal, and an assembling plate. The elastic limiting member is adapted to be disposed on the circuit carrier plate and to be at a periphery of the heat source, and the elastic limiting member has a first height. The paste-type heat dissipation wall is adapted to be disposed on the circuit carrier plate, to be between the heat source and the elastic limiting member, and to be in contact with the periphery of the heat source.

The fitting member is in contact with a top of the paste-type heat dissipation wall and engaged with a side portion of the elastic limiting member. The phase-change metal is adapted to be filled into a region among the fitting member, the paste-type heat dissipation wall, and the heat source. When a temperature of the phase-change metal exceeds a critical temperature, a state of the phase-change metal is changed to a liquid state.

The paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b> has a second height. The second height is greater than the first height, and the second height is greater than a height of the heat source <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the heat source <b>510</b> may be a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). The paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b> may be implemented by normal thermal pastes or other insulation thermal-conductive pastes with ceramic particle. The paste may be directly applied on the periphery of the heat source <b>510</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the paste may be filled into the space between the elastic limiting member <b>10</b> and the heat source <b>510</b> after the elastic limiting member <b>10</b> is disposed on the circuit carrier plate <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fitting member <b>30</b> is in contact with a top of the paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b> and engaged with a side portion of the elastic limiting member <b>10</b>. The phase-change metal <b>40</b> is filled into a region among the fitting member <b>30</b>, the paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b>, and the heat source <b>510</b>. When the temperature of the phase-change metal <b>40</b> exceeds a critical temperature, the state of the phase-change metal <b>40</b> is changed to a liquid state. In some embodiments, the phase-change metal <b>40</b> is applied on the surface of the heat source <b>510</b> after the elastic limiting member <b>10</b> and the paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b> are arranged on the circuit carrier plate <b>500</b>, and then the fitting member <b>30</b> is in contact with and positioned with the paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b>, thus limiting the position of the phase-change metal <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The assembling plate <b>50</b> is connected to the fitting member <b>30</b>, and a portion of the assembling plate <b>50</b> is in contact with the top of the elastic limiting member <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the fitting member <b>30</b> is a copper block, and the assembling plate <b>50</b> is a metal plate. Accordingly, in one or some embodiments of the instant disclosure, the heat generated by the heat source <b>510</b> can be transmitted outwardly through the phase-change metal <b>40</b>, the fitting member <b>30</b>, and the assembling plate <b>50</b> that are connected to each other, and then the heat energy can be removed by thermal pipe or fan (not shown).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the fitting member <b>30</b> and the assembling plate <b>50</b> are soldered with each other to form a one-piece member.

Moreover, in some embodiments, the assembling plate <b>50</b> may be positioned on the circuit carrier plate <b>500</b> by, e.g., screws.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the critical temperature of the phase-change metal <b>40</b> is in a range between 50&#xb0; C. and 65&#xb0; C.

In a further preferred embodiment, the critical temperature of the phase-change metal <b>40</b> is 58&#xb1;0/5&#xb0; C. In other words, if the electronic device (such as notebook computer and tablet computer) with the heat source <b>510</b> is powered off, or is turned off and cooled for a period of time, the state of the phase-change metal <b>40</b> is changed from the liquid state back to the solid state. Therefore, when the electronic device is being carrying or shaken, the phase-change metal <b>40</b> does not flow to prevent from spilling out of or detaching off the surface of the heat source <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, the surface of the heat source <b>510</b> may have concave or convex structures, or different portions of the surface of the heat source <b>510</b> may have height difference owing to the manufacturing tolerance.

Moreover, even if the paste-type heat dissipation wall <b>20</b> has gaps to cause leakage of the phase-change metal <b>40</b>, the elastic foam provides the absorbing function to prevent the phase-change metal <b>40</b> from leaking outside to affect the electrical connection between the components on the circuit carrier plate <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of a heat dissipation structure assembly according to another exemplary embodiment of the instant disclosure.
