No. 13/374,669, filed Jan. 6, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an umbilical splint, and more particularly towards an umbilical splint for post-operative care and methods of use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During certain types of abdominal surgery, incisions are made in the umbilicus or the surrounding umbilical (belly button) region. Examples of such procedures include abdominoplasty (i.e. tummy tuck), panniculectomy, Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap procedures, endoscopic surgeries, and the like. Circumferential umbilical incisions can lead to contracture and closure of the umbilicus or umbilical opening due to the physiological forces of scar contracture. This can lead to deformities of the umbilicus, as well as infections.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Deformity of the umbilicus can also occur after pregnancy, especially if a caesarean section is required, and after weight loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current products used to counteract the forces of scar contracture following umbilical or other abdominal surgery include using a marble or a foam earplug. However, marbles are difficult to keep in place and may be difficult to ensure sterility. Furthermore, foam earplugs are not stiff enough to counteract the forces of scar contracture and can lead to infection due to its porous nature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for a device and method to counteract the forces of scar contracture within the umbilicus and to reduce the risk of infection after abdominal surgery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to at least partially overcome some of the disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to an umbilical splint for post-operative care. For example, the umbilical splint may be used post-abdominoplasty or after other cosmetic procedures. Similarly, the umbilical splint may be used after an endoscopic, abdominal or laparoscopic surgery or after a hernia repair. The umbilical splint may also be used as a paediatric device, such as, for example, for children recovering from congenital abdominal repair. In some instances, the umbilical splint may also be used to transform a protruding umbilicus (i.e. &#x201c;an outie&#x201d;) into a depression (i.e. &#x201c;an innie&#x201d;). In general, the present invention may be used to avoid stenosis of the belly button. Other uses within the umbilicus may also be possible.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The umbilical splint is designed to be inserted into the umbilicus at the time of surgery to counteract the forces of scar contracture. In this way, in at least one embodiment, the umbilical splint may be configured to decrease stenosis of the umbilicus following surgery. The umbilical splint may be configured to prevent cosmetic deformities and late infections at the site. In post-partum women, the splint may be inserted immediately post-partum to help shape the umbilicus during retraction of the distended pregnant abdomen. Once inserted, the umbilical splint may be worn periodically or continuously, except for personal hygiene purposes, to aid in the healing process. In some embodiments, the umbilical splint may be maintained within the umbilicus for a pre-determined period of time.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The shape of the umbilical splint is designed to promote the healing of the umbilicus and to reduce scarring by applying constant pressure to the entire umbilical region. In surgical patients where a scar is present, a silicone gel sheet may be applied to the splint following suture removal to improve the overall cosmesis (i.e. physical appearance) of the scar. Past research has shown that application of silicone to scars, as well as the application of pressure, improves the overall cosmesis of the mature scar.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The umbilical splint may be configured to have several advantages, such as, resist the forces of scar contracture to maintain an aesthetically pleasing shape and size of the umbilicus, apply pressure to the surrounding scar tissue, and apply silicone gel sheeting in combination with the applied pressure to promote healing. Furthermore, a slow-release antibiotic covering or medicament may be used to decrease the chances of wound infection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The overall form of the umbilical splint is designed both to improve the shape of the umbilicus and to retain the splint within the umbilicus. Accordingly, the umbilical splint may be configured with a bulbous section with a pre-determined shape. The bottom bulbous portion may be manufactured out of hard plastic. However, it should be understood that other materials may be used, such as glass, metal, medical ceramic, silicone, medical plastics, minerals, and the like. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the umbilical splint may have a rigid core surrounded by a softer more flexible outer material for improved comfort. For example, the outer material may be a soft, flexible plastic or an alternative material such as medical grade silicone, and the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The bulbous section may be configured to provide an idealized shape for the umbilicus to conform to. Furthermore, the bulbous section may stretch or otherwise provide pressure to the umbilicus to resist the forces of scar contracture. In some embodiments, the shape of the bulbous section may be symmetric. A symmetric bulbous section may provide even, constant pressure to the umbilical tissue. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the cross-section of the bulbous section or the entire insertion portion may be selected for aesthetic purposes and may be symmetric or asymmetric. The cross-sectional shape of the bulbous section provided in the preferred embodiments should not be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To retain the umbilical splint within the umbilicus, the umbilical splint may have a retaining section located adjacent the bulbous section. The retaining section and the bulbous section may form the insertion portion of the umbilical splint. The bulbous section of the insertion portion may be between an insertion end of the insertion portion and the retaining section.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The retaining section may be configured to engage the umbilicus so as to retain the umbilical splint within the umbilicus. For example, the retainment section may engage an umbilical lip of the umbilicus near the umbilical opening, with the bulbous section being inserted further into the umbilicus to apply pressure to the tissue inside the umbilicus.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The shape of the bulbous section may also help to retain the umbilical splint within the umbilicus. In some embodiments, a bulbous section with an asymmetric shape may be better at being retained within the umbilicus or may provide an advantageous distribution of pressure to the surrounding tissue. Finally, in some embodiments, an adhesive may be used or a further mechanism, such as a tape or a bandage, may be placed over the umbilical splint and against the abdominal wall in order to retain the umbilical splint within the umbilicus.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the umbilical splint may have an external flange for covering the umbilical opening, protecting against dust and pathogens entering the umbilical opening. The external flange may also apply direct pressure to the external circumferential umbilical scar. In this manner, the external flange may reduce the formation and/or the appearance of scars. Furthermore, the external flange may help retain any medicament placed inside the umbilicus prior to the insertion of the umbilical splint.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The external flange may be manufactured out of a rigid material; for example, the same hard plastic as the rest of the umbilical splint. In such embodiments, the umbilical splint may be formed as a single piece. Alternatively, the protective lip may be manufactured out of a softer plastic or a flexible material. A flexible external flange may be operable to bend and move with the abdominal wall when inserted into the umbilical cavity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect, the present invention resides in a use of an umbilical splint for shaping an umbilicus after an abdominal operation. The umbilical splint may comprise an insertion portion extending in a longitudinal direction and terminating at an insertion end for insertion into the umbilicus. Furthermore, the insertion portion may comprise a bulbous section near the insertion end. The bulbous section may be operable to apply pressure to a tissue of the umbilicus after the abdominal operation. Finally, the insertion portion may be configured to engage the umbilicus such that the umbilical splint is retained within the umbilicus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect, the present invention resides in an umbilical splint. The umbilical splint may include an insertion portion extending in a longitudinal direction and terminating at a insertion end for insertion into an umbilicus. The insertion portion may include a bulbous section having a bulbous circumference, the bulbous section near the insertion end; a retaining section having a retaining circumference less than the bulbous circumference; and an external flange coupled to the insertion portion. The bulbous section may be disposed between the retaining section and the insertion end. The external flange may include an underside surface facing the insertion end of the insertion portion, and an exterior surface, opposite the underside surface. In a preferred embodiment, a ratio of the bulbous circumference to the retaining circumference may be between 1.0 and 1.4. In a more preferred embodiment, the ratio of the bulbous circumference to the retaining circumference may be between 1.1 and 1.2.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In yet another aspect, the present invention resides in a method of post-operative care. The method may include inserting an umbilical splint into an umbilicus after an abdominal operation, the umbilical splint comprising an insertion portion extending in a longitudinal direction and terminating at an insertion end; retaining the umbilical splint within the umbilicus using a retaining section of the insertion portion to engage the umbilicus; applying pressure to the umbilicus using a bulbous section of the insertion portion to shape the umbilicus after the abdominal operation; and maintaining the umbilical splint within the umbilicus for a period of time until the umbilicus has healed from the abdominal operation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further and other features of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the embodiments thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference may now be had to the following detailed description taken together with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a patient with the various parts of the umbilicus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a side view of a patient with an umbilical splint inserted into the umbilicus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a frontal view of a patient with an umbilical splint inserted into the umbilicus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint in accordance with a third preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a side profile view of an umbilical splint having an application layer in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a flow chart of a method for using an umbilical splint in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of an umbilical splint having an ovular insertion portion in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows a top view of the umbilical splint seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> shows a front view of the umbilical splint seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref> shows a side profile view of the umbilical splint seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of an umbilical splint having an ovular insertion portion in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>813</b></figref> shows a top view of the umbilical splint seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> shows a front view of the umbilical splint seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>;

For example, the application layer <b>50</b> may include a medicament or a silicone gel sheet. For example, an antibiotic may be used to reduce the chances of infection. Furthermore, other forms of silicone than silicone gel sheets may be added.

In Block <b>61</b>, the umbilical splint <b>10</b> is inserted into an umbilicus <b>3</b> after an abdominal operation.

While lengths will vary by patient <b>2</b>, different approaches may be used.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">In a preferred embodiment, a patient <b>2</b> may use the umbilical splint <b>10</b> continuously. The umbilical splint <b>10</b> may be removed for personal hygiene purposes such as cleaning the umbilicus <b>3</b>, applying medication to the umbilicus <b>3</b> or scar, applying an application layer <b>50</b> to the insertion portion <b>20</b> of the umbilical splint <b>10</b> and/or washing the umbilical splint <b>10</b>. Otherwise, the umbilical splint <b>10</b> may be retained within the umbilicus <b>3</b> until the umbilicus <b>3</b> has healed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">In another preferred embodiment, the patient <b>2</b> may use multiple umbilical splints <b>10</b> during the healing process. For example, the patient <b>2</b> may begin with a first umbilical splint <b>10</b> having a relatively small bulbous section <b>24</b>. The bulbous section <b>24</b> is configured with a first bulbous circumference. Subsequently, as the umbilicus <b>3</b> of the patient <b>2</b> heals, the patient <b>2</b> may progress to one or more larger umbilical splints <b>10</b> having progressively larger bulbous sections <b>24</b> (and corresponding larger bulbous circumferences). In this manner, the umbilical splint <b>10</b> will continue to apply pressure to the umbilicus <b>3</b> as the umbilicus <b>3</b> heals and may allow the umbilical splint <b>10</b> to progressively shape the umbilicus <b>3</b> after an abdominal operation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">In other embodiments, the patient <b>2</b> may use or begin to use the umbilical splint <b>10</b> for repeated brief periods of time. For example, a patient <b>2</b> may use the umbilical splint three times a day for 20 minute intervals. In other embodiments, a patient <b>2</b> may insert the umbilical splint <b>2</b> for longer periods of hours, days or weeks. Furthermore, different regimens may be used to steadily increase the period of time the umbilical splint <b>10</b> is worn by the patient <b>2</b>. The patient <b>2</b> may continue to use the umbilical splint <b>10</b> until the umbilicus <b>3</b> has healed from the abdominal operation or the chance of scar contracture is reduced or no longer present.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">Although the insertion portion <b>20</b> of the umbilical splint <b>10</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref> as being round such that its bulbous circumference and retaining circumference have a substantially circular cross-section, it should be understood that other shapes, sizes and perimeters for the insertion portion <b>20</b> are possible.

Furthermore, an ovular insertion portion <b>20</b> may result in a more pleasing umbilicus <b>3</b>, once the umbilicus <b>3</b> has healed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">In other embodiments, the bulbous, retaining and/or opening circumferences may be asymmetric and/or different shapes from each other. For example, in one embodiment, the bulbous circumference may be an asymmetric shape, or even free-form, and the retaining circumference may be ovular. It should be understood that other shapes and configurations for the insertion portion <b>20</b> are possible and that the bulbous circumference, retaining circumference and opening circumference are not limited to the shapes described herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>D</figref>, an umbilical splint <b>10</b>E having an insertion portion <b>20</b> with an ovular opening circumference or cross-section is shown.
