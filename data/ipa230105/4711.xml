Nowadays, online users are exposed to misleading and propagandist news articles and media posts on a daily basis. To counter this, a number of approaches have been designed aiming to achieve a healthier and safer online news and media consumption. Automatic systems are able to support humans in detecting such content; yet, a major impediment to their broad adoption is that, besides being inaccurate, such systems need to provide explanations for their decisions in order to be trusted and widely adopted by users. Since misleading and propagandist content influences the readers through the use of a number of deception techniques, the present disclosure provides for the detection and illustration of the use of such techniques as a way to ultimately provide explainability for downstream tasks. In particular, the present disclosure defines qualitatively descriptive features and that are analyzed for suitability for detecting deception techniques. The present disclosure further demonstrates that the described methods can be readily combined with pre-trained language models, yielding state-of-the-art results.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Explainability is indispensable if propaganda detection systems are to be trusted and accepted by the users. According to the confirmation bias theory, persons generally easily accept new information that is consistent with existing beliefs, but are less likely to do so when that information contradicts what those persons already know. Thus, even if a model can correctly predict which news is propaganda, if the model fails to explain why this is the case, persons are more likely to reject the results and to stick to what they want to believe. In order to address this issue, the present disclosure reformulates the propaganda detection task via a model that can explain the prediction results. The described method can detect propaganda for each sentence in a given article and can explain what propaganda technique is used with the human-understandable semantic and syntactic features.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, the described model selectively operates with using veracity as a propagandizing tactic. As many pieces of propaganda include outright falsehoods (e.g., &#x201c;fake news&#x201d;, &#x201c;the big lie&#x201d;, conspiracy theories, etc.), veracity may be a useful feature in detecting propaganda. However, as factual errors can also be accidental or the result of facts changing over time, veracity may only be useful to help detect propaganda in a subset of cases. Additionally, fact checking is a laborious and computationally difficult task. Accordingly, the described model may selectively operate with checking the veracity of statements included in certain articles, thereby allowing the model to conserve computing resources when veracity is an unreliable indicator of propaganda and improving the end result for a reader. Additionally, the described model may selectively operate without checking the veracity of statements included in certain articles, thereby allowing the model to identify falsehoods as the propaganda type and avoid reanalyzing those sentences according to other propagandizing tactics when veracity is a reliable indicator of propaganda, thereby also conserving computing resources and improving the end result for a reader.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>100</b> for providing explainable propaganda detection, according to aspects of the present disclosure. Method <b>100</b> begins with operation <b>110</b>, where the model parses each sentence of a plurality of sentences in an article for structural details. In various aspects, the article may be an electronic document, a website, a transcript of a spoken conversation, a printed work (e.g., a book, magazine, newspaper), an excerpt therefrom, or an amalgamation of two or more articles. The structural details of the sentences include various features and arrangements of the words such as whether the sentence is or contains: a simple declarative, an introductory subordinating conjunction, a direct question, an inverted declarative, an inverted yes/no question, an adjective phrase, an adverb phrase, a conjunction phrase, a fragment, an interjection, a list marker, a no constituent, a noun phase, a head complex noun phrase, a prepositional noun phrase, a parenthetical, a particle, a quantifier phrase, a reduced relative clause, an unlike coordinated phrase, a verb phrase, a wh-adjective phase (e.g., the &#x201c;wh&#x201d; referring to the inclusion of who/what/where/when/why/how in the phrase), a wh-verb phrase, a wh-adverb phrase, an wh-noun phrase, a wh-prepositional phrase, or an unknown/unclassifiable phrase. Although these examples are given in relation to the English language, the present disclosure contemplates that similar structural details of sentences constructed in other languages can be parsed, which may include more or fewer structures according to the grammatical rules of that language.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In various aspects, the model identifies a title of the article, which is treated as a sentence, but may be referenced by the model in comparison to other sentences. In some aspects, the model, to conserve computing resources, may limit the number of sentences analyzed to a threshold number. Because human readers often do not finish reading articles, and many writing styles emphasize stating important points earlier in an article, the model may restrict analysis to the first N sentences (including the title) of the article, thereby creating an except for analysis in place of the entire article. Additionally or alternatively, the model (or a reader application in communication with the model) can indicate that a human reader has progressed through an initial section of the article (e.g., the first N sentences or the first N-M sentences, where M is a padding threshold selected by the model or human reader to allow the model time for processing before the human reader reaches the end of the Nth sentence), and the model may select a subsequent excerpt (including the title and, for example, sentences N+1 through 2N) or a remainder of the article to provide analysis to the human reader according to method <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At operation <b>120</b>, the model identifies, dimensional features across the plurality of sentences based on the structural details. In various aspects, the dimensional features include: a relative position of a given sentence in the article relative to other sentences; a semantic stance of the given sentence relative to a title of the article; a sentiment of the given sentence; and an article-level prediction of the article as a whole being propaganda. In some aspects, the semantic stance is selected from available categories of: related agreeing; related disagreeing; related discussing; and unrelated in relation to the topic or theme of the sentence and the topic or theme of the title. In some aspects, the sentiment is selected from available categories of: positive; negative; neutral; and compound.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At operation <b>130</b>, the model determines whether to verify the truthfulness of the statements as part of identifying propagandizing tactics. The model does not need to identify the truthfulness of the sentences when analyzing for propagandizing tactics, and the use of such analysis may have inconsistent results. For example, an older article may include out-of-date facts that, while true at the time the article was first created, as false now, and may result in false positives for the inclusion of &#x201c;lying&#x201d; as a propagandizing tactic. In a contrasting example, an article may be facially neutral in many of its sentences but include &#x201c;the big lie&#x201d; as a propagandizing tactic. Additionally, fact-checking is a computationally difficult task that may include the use of human fact checkers in the loop where a machine learning model has difficulty in differentiating true or false statements. Accordingly, the presently described model may selectively use fact-checking when identifying propagandizing tactics in an article.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various aspects, the model may receive a veracity selection from a human user for whether the model is to include the veracity of information included in the sentence when identifying the propagandizing tactic demonstrated in each sentence of the plurality of sentences. When the model is to verify the statements included in the sentences, method <b>100</b> proceeds to operation <b>140</b>. Otherwise, when the model is not to verify the statements included in the sentences, method <b>100</b> proceeds to operation <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At operation <b>140</b>, the model verifies the true/false statements included in the sentences. In various aspects, the model may identify the sentences that include verifiable facts and compare those facts against a database of known values corresponding to those facts, pass the sentences to human reviewers, or perform a combination of machine and human review.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At operation <b>150</b>, the model marks sentences that include false statements as propagandizing by lying (e.g., the propagandizing tactic is lying). Because these sentences have been identified as propagandizing, the model may remove these sentences from further analysis according to other propagandizing tactics, thereby conserving computing resources when analyzing the article. However, any sentence that does not include a false statement, may include other propagandizing tactics and is analyzed for such by the model (e.g., by selecting the propagandizing tactics for any sentences that exclude false statements according to operation <b>160</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At operation <b>160</b>, the model identifies the propagandizing tactic demonstrated in each sentence according to a covariance score between the propagandizing tactic and the plurality of dimensional features identified for a given sentence. When the model is instructed to use the veracity of the statements in the sentences (e.g., yes, at operation <b>130</b>) any sentences that include falsehoods may be excluded from analysis as already being categorized for exhibiting the propagandizing tactic of lying, while the sentences that were not found to include falsehoods are analyzed according to the covariance score. When the model is instructed to not use the veracity of the statements in the sentences (e.g., no, at operation <b>130</b>), the model categories all of the statements according to the covariance score (e.g., false statements are categorized identically to true statements, as the model does not know and does not use as an input the veracity of the statements).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The model is trained to develop covariance scores between various propagandizing tactics and the dimensional features parsed from the sentences, as many of these techniques (regardless of content) display similar grammatical and structural elements across different articles. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a classification chart <b>200</b> for providing explainable propaganda detection, according to aspects of the present disclosure, where each propagandizing tactic is correlated to various dimensional features, where darker entries in the matrix indicate a stronger correlation than lighter entries in the matrix. The example classification chart <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is populated based on how the model is trained, and the present disclosure contemplates that different training datasets and different model types may result in different covariance scoring results in other classification charts <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the distribution of scores illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is presented as a non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various aspects, the propagandizing tactics are selected from a list of available techniques that includes: name calling; repetition; the use of slogans; making appeals to fear; raising doubt; making or using exaggerations; flag-waving (e.g., appealing to patriotism or in-group status); using loaded or intentionally provocative language; associating a behavior with an out-group or despised person; appeals to bandwagon (e.g., &#x201c;everyone else is doing/believing/saying this&#x201d;; casual oversimplification (e.g., minimizing complicated details or nuance); use obfuscation or confusing language; making an appeal to authority; presenting a binary fallacy (&#x201c;either option A or option B,&#x201d; with no alternatives or middle positions presented as possible); the use of thought-terminating clich&#xe9;s to prematurely end contemplation of a topic; the use of red herrings to draw away from a topic; the use of strawman arguments to &#x201c;win&#x201d; a position against a simple-to-defeat counter position; the use of whataboutisms to deflect criticism back to the failings or shortcomings of another party (e.g., &#x201c;what about the time when my opponent did X?&#x201d;) and none (e.g., when no propagandizing tactic is identified for the sentence).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various aspects, the model ranks the covariance scores assigned to the sentence based on all of the dimensional features and combines (e.g., via addition, multiplication, weighted addition, etc.) the scores for all of the dimensional features in each category of propagandizing tactic. The model then selects one propagandizing tactic from among the available propagandizing tactics to output to the human reader. In various aspects, when the highest covariance score for any of the other propagandizing tactics is below a propaganda threshold value, the model selects &#x201c;none&#x201d; as the propagandizing tactic for the sentence. In various aspects, when two or more propagandizing tactics satisfy the propaganda threshold value, the model may select the technique with the higher score, the technique identified first in the sentence (e.g., according to reading order), or based on a priority of techniques seen in the article. For example, a sentence demonstrating &#x201c;exaggeration&#x201d; may also represent &#x201c;repetition&#x201d; if following another sentence demonstrating &#x201c;exaggeration&#x201d;, and the model may select &#x201c;repetition&#x201d; as the demonstrated propaganda technique even when &#x201c;exaggeration&#x201d; has a higher covariance score for that sentence. In another example, when a sentence is identified as including &#x201c;exaggeration&#x201d; and &#x201c;name calling,&#x201d; the model may select &#x201c;name calling&#x201d; as the demonstrated propaganda technique even when &#x201c;exaggeration&#x201d; has a higher covariance score for that sentence when name calling occurred earlier in the sentence.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at operation <b>170</b>, the model displays, in a user interface that includes the article, propaganda labels corresponding to the propagandizing tactic identified for each sentence from the article. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a user interface <b>300</b>, such as may be used to display the results of method <b>100</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the fictional account presented in the article <b>320</b> shown in the user interface <b>300</b>, each sentence <b>330</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>(generally or collectively, sentence <b>330</b>) is highlighted as shown with a corresponding propaganda label <b>310</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>(generally or collectively, label <b>310</b>) that shows the output of the model's analysis to the human reader in the user interface <b>300</b> for each sentence <b>330</b>. The present disclosure contemplates other representations of the determined propagandizing tactics, which may include colors, shapes, words, and positions different than those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> based on the display device, user preferences, and design considerations that are considered within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art to select without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated example, the first sentence <b>330</b><i>a </i>is identified as a title for the article <b>320</b> that includes the propagandizing tactic of using loading language (e.g., the use of the word &#x201c;treachery&#x201d;), which is demonstrated in the first label <b>310</b><i>a </i>as &#x201c;loaded&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second sentence <b>330</b><i>b </i>is identified as not including any propagandizing tactics, which is demonstrated in the second label <b>310</b><i>b </i>as &#x201c;none&#x201d;, although in some aspects, when a sentence is identified as not demonstrating a propagandizing tactic, a label <b>310</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The third sentence <b>330</b><i>c </i>is identified as demonstrating the propagandizing tactic of using name calling (e.g., the use of the word &#x201c;pompous&#x201d; to describe the ambassador), which is demonstrated in the third label <b>310</b><i>c </i>as &#x201c;name calling&#x201d;. However, the third sentence <b>330</b><i>c </i>may also demonstrate &#x201c;flag-waving&#x201d; by calling out that the ambassador was acting as a spy and attempting to cause a disturbance in the human reader's country, and the model may have selected &#x201c;name calling&#x201d; in favor of &#x201c;flag waving&#x201d; based on &#x201c;name calling&#x201d; having a higher covariance score, occurring earlier in the third sentence <b>330</b><i>c</i>, or having a higher priority for display than &#x201c;flag-waving&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The fourth sentence <b>330</b><i>d </i>is identified as demonstrating the propagandizing tactic of using over simplification (e.g., the ambassador's emotional state may not be a direct or sole cause of his later action), which is demonstrated in the third label <b>310</b><i>c </i>as &#x201c;oversimp.&#x201d; In various aspects, different abbreviations or codes may be used to represent the propagandizing tactics according to the space and readability restrictions of the user interface.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fifth sentence <b>330</b><i>e </i>is presented with two labels <b>310</b>; the fifth label <b>310</b><i>e </i>stating &#x201c;false&#x201d; and the sixth label <b>310</b><i>f </i>stating &#x201c;repetition&#x201d;.

When the model was instructed to not verify the truthfulness of the sentences <b>330</b> (e.g., no at operation <b>130</b> in method <b>100</b>), the model may determine that the fifth sentence <b>330</b><i>e </i>includes a repetition of the claim that the ambassador was engaged (from the fourth sentence <b>330</b><i>d</i>) and is to be categorized as demonstrating the propagandizing tactic of repetition, and is therefore displayed in the user interface <b>300</b> with the sixth label <b>310</b><i>f </i>(and not the fifth label <b>310</b><i>e</i>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a computer system <b>400</b>, such as may be used to perform method <b>100</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to aspects of the present disclosure.
