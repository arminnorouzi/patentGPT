Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Kinases mediate a reaction in which a phosphate group from high-energy molecules, in particular, ATP, is transferred to a substrate. Kinases stabilize phosphoric anhydride bonds, and locate the substrate and the phosphate group at a specific position to increase a reaction rate. In most cases, the transition state resulting from the interaction with a phosphate group having a negative charge is electrostatically stabilized through surrounding amino acids having a positive charge, and some kinases may be coordinated with the phosphate group through a metal cofactor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Kinases can be classified as, for example, protein kinases, lipid kinases, and carbohydrate kinases, according to the substrate and characteristics. Proteins, lipids, or carbohydrates may vary in their activity, reactivity, ability to bind to other molecules, etc., depending on the phosphorylation state. Kinases affect intracellular signal transduction and regulate complex biological mechanisms within cells. Due to phosphorylation, some molecules may have enhanced or reduced activities, and their ability to interact with other molecules may be controlled. Because many kinases respond to environmental conditions or signals, cells may control intracellular molecules by using kinases, depending on the situation. As such, kinase plays a crucial role in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival, metabolism, signal transduction, cell transport, secretion, and many other cellular reaction pathways.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Kinases have been found in a variety of species including bacteria, fungi, insects, and mammals, and 500 or more kinases have been found in humans to date.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Protein kinases may increase or decrease the activity of a protein, become a marker for stabilization or degradation, place a protein in a specific cell compartment, or initiate or disturb interactions of a protein with other proteins. Protein kinases are known to account for the majority of kinases and are considered to be an important research target. Protein kinases regulate, together with phosphatase, proteins and enzymes as well as cell signal transduction. Although cell proteins are subject to numerous covalent bonds, not many of these bonds are reversible. Accordingly, it can be said that phosphorylation of proteins has a regulatory function. Protein kinases may often have multiple substrates, and sometimes, a particular protein may act as a substrate for at least one kinase. For this reason, protein kinases are named using factors that regulate their activities. For example, a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is regulated by calmodulin. In some cases, kinases may be classified as sub-groups. For example, type I and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases include identical enzyme subunits, but their regulatory subunits binding to cyclic AMP are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A protein kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of the hydroxy group located in tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues of proteins and plays an important role in signaling growth factors that induce cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation (Melnikova, I. et al., Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 3 (2004), 993), and it is reported that abnormal expression or mutation of a specific kinase frequently occurs in cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As one of the ways that cells recognize external stimuli, recognition via tyrosine kinase, which is a receptor in the cell membrane, may be used. A receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) consists of an extracellular part exposed to the outside of a cell, an intracellular part exposed to the intracellular cytoplasm, and a transmembrane part passing through the plasma membrane between the extracellular part and the intracellular part. The extracellular part of the receptor is the part to which a specific ligand binds, and the intracellular part functions to transmit the activation signal of the receptor activated by the ligand into the cell. The RTK has a domain having tyrosine kinase activity at the C-terminal region exposed inside the cell, and when a specific ligand attaches to the extracellular part, the kinase enzyme of the C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain exposed to the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor protein is activated, and the two RTKs cross-phosphorylate the tyrosines at the C-terminals of the neighboring RTKs. This phosphorylation process of tyrosine is the most important process in the transmission of signals corresponding to extracellular stimulation into cells. There are many known receptors that have tyrosine kinase activities for transmitting extracellular stimuli into cells based on this mechanism. Examples of such receptors are FLT3, VEGFR, and SYK.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">From among them, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase, is normally expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells by hematopoietic blast cells and plays an important role in the expression of normal stem cells and the immune system. Abnormal overexpression and mutations of FLT3 are often found in patients with leukemia. In particular, various mutations of FLT3, such as D835V, D835Y and internal tandem duplication (ITD), are found in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation and differentiation of blast cells in myeloid and peripheral blood. FLT3 has recently been regarded as one of the most important targets in the therapeutic aspects of AML.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">RAS and p53 gene mutations in adult AML are reported to be about 20% and 5% of adult AML, respectively, whereas FLT3 gene mutations are found in about 30% of adult AML. The most typical problem with AML is that FLT3 mutations, which cause poor prognosis, are activated. FLT3 mutations are classified into two types: one is internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and the other is point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). About 23% of early AML patients experience the activation of FLT3-ITD, the most frequently found mutation. Patients with an ITD mutation show poor prognosis and high recurrence rates. Another major FLT3 mutation is the FLT3 TKD mutation, which accounts for about 7% of the initial AML cases. Point mutations in residues of aspartate 835 (D835), which are replaced by various amino acids, are one of the most frequently occurring mutations, although they occur less than ITD mutations. In addition, another major activation method of FLT3 in AML is the overexpression of the wild type FLT3 protein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The activation of ITD mutations in FLT3 occurs in about 20% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, which is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that FLT3-ITD is a driver lesion that causes the pathogenesis of malignancy and can be an effective therapeutic target in human AML (Non-patent document 1). Mutations in the FLT3 gene frequently occur in AML, and are usually accompanied by ITD mutations in a juxtamembrane domain coding region or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). FLT3-ITD mutations and FLT3-TKD mutations cause ligand-independent proliferation due to dimerization of components and activation of the FLT3 receptor. The high mutation rate of FLT3-ITD with respect to wild-type allele is associated with poor prognosis in adults and children (Non-patent document 2). Other types of leukemia, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), may also have an activation mutation of FLT3. Thus, FLT3 with activated mutations is an important target for several cancer types (Non-patent document 3 and Non-patent document 4).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) is a kinase known to be involved in the regulation of the angiogenesis process. Solid tumors require more nutrients and oxygen than normal tissues. Therefore, insufficiency of blood supply occurs compared to normal states, and the overexpression or activation of VEGFR induces neovascularization, being involved in the angiogenesis required for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells (Non-patent document 5). Therefore, various clinical studies for the treatment of tumors through inhibition of angiogenesis have been performed, and several promising results have been obtained. In addition, VEGF plays an important role in blood cancer and is overexpressed in various malignant solid tumors. The overexpression of VEGF is known to have a high correlation with disease progression of malignant tumors. VEGFRs are classified according to subtypes including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. VEGFR-2 (KDR) is a typical target for tumor diseases having VEGFR expression. Representative diseases caused by the overexpression of VEGFR-2 are lung cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, etc. VEGF, which is a ligand of VEGFR, may have angiogenic activity and promote tumor growth by a direct pro-survival effect in tumor cells (Non-patent document).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is mainly expressed in blood cells, and plays an important role in the signal transduction pathways of other immunoreceptors such as B-cell receptors and mast cells. SYK is expressed in non-hematopoietic cells such as nerve cells and vascular endothelial cells. Recent studies show that SYK acts in oxidization of stimuli of various cells including IL-1, TNF-&#x3b1;, and ITGB1. SYK is known to be a good potential target for a variety of hematologic malignant tumor, autoimmune diseases, and other inflammatory responses (Non-patent document 7 and Non-patent document 8).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0014">(Non-patent document 1) Catherine et al., Nature, 2012, 485: 260-263</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0015">(Non-patent document 2) A S Moore et al., Leukemia, 2012, 26: 1462-1470</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0016">(Non-patent document 3) Cancer Cell, (2007), 12: 367-380</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0017">(Non-patent document 4) Current Pharmaceutical Design (2005), 11: 3449-3457</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0018">(Non-patent document 5) Kliche, S. et al., J., Life, 52, (2001), 61</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0019">(Non-patent document 6) Simons, M. et al., Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, 17, (2016), 611</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0020">(Non-patent document 7) Liu et al., Journal of Hematology &#x26; Oncology (2017) 10:145</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0021">(Non-patent document 8) Yamada T et al., J.

molecular formula and a different structure. The compounds of Formula 1 according to an aspect of the present disclosure may exist as various compounds having the isomer relationship in a three-dimensional aspect, and these isomers and mixtures are within the scope of the present disclosure. In one or more embodiment, the compounds of Formula 1 according to an aspect of the present disclosure may exist as a stereoisomer or structural isomer, for example, a tautomer.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0159">The term &#x201c;stereoisomer&#x201d; used herein refers to a compound that has the same molecular formula and the same connection order of atoms and is different in stereoscopic or optical aspects. That is, a stereoisomer refers to a compound having the same chemical composition but being different in the three-dimensional arrangement aspect, that is, being different in the arrangement of atoms or groups. The stereoisomer includes geometric isomers, enantiomeric isomers, and partial stereoisomers.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0160">The term &#x201c;geometrical isomer&#x201d; used herein refers to the type of a stereoisomer depending on the direction of a functional group in a molecule, and may be called a cis-trans isomer. Generally, these isomers contain non-rotatable double bonds and the substituents of compounds containing double bonds may be in an E form or a Z form. For example, when the compound contains a 2-substituted cycloalkyl group, the compound may have the cis-trans form. When the compound of Formula 1 contains a bridged ring, the compound may exist as an exo or endo isomer.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0161">The term &#x201c;chiral&#x201d; used herein refers to a molecule having a non-overlapping enantiomeric partner, and the term &#x201c;achiral&#x201d; used herein refers to a molecule having an overlapping enantiomeric partner. The term &#x201c;enantiomer&#x201d; used herein refers to the case where two molecules having optical activity are mirror-symmetrical. That is, the enantiomer indicates an isomer that does not overlap an original molecule, and does not have any of the symmetry elements including the symmetry plane and the symmetry center, and has the stereoscopic center (chiral center). The term &#x201c;diastereomer&#x201d; used herein refers to the case in which molecules having two or more chiral centers are not enantiomers but stereoisomers. Since the compounds of Formula 1 according to an aspect of the present disclosure may have chiral centers or asymmetric carbon centers (absent carbons), the compounds may exist as the enantiomer (R or S isomer), racemates, diastereoisomers, or a mixture thereof, and all of these isomers and mixtures are included within the scope of the present disclosure. The optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers may be decomposed by using techniques of the related art or chiral synthon or chiral reagents.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0162">The term &#x201c;constitutional isomers&#x201d; used herein refers to isomers having the same molecular formula but different connection orders of atoms, and may include tautomer. The term &#x201c;tautomers&#x201d; used herein refers to constitutional isomers having different energy structures that are interchanged through low energy barriers. For example, a photon tautomer (also a proton tautomer) includes interconversion through the transfer of photons, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerization. Valence tautomers include interconversions by the rearrangement of some electrons in the bound electrons. The compound of Formula 1 according to an aspect, and the stereoisomer or tautomer thereof may exist in the form of solvate. The term &#x201c;solvate&#x201d; may include a molecular complex including the compound and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecule, e.g., ethanol or water. A complex, in which the solvent molecule is water, is also referred to as &#x201c;hydrate&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0163">The compound of Formula 1 according to an aspect, and the stereoisomer, tautomer, and solvate thereof may exist in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; used herein refers to a salt that is low in toxicity to humans and does not adversely affect the biological activity and physicochemical properties of the parent compound. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of the compound represented by Formula 1, which would be understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0164">The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared by a conventional method.
