Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and uterine fibroids, and to methods for reducing the levels of androgen receptor-full length (AR-FL) including pathogenic or resistance mutations. AR-splice variants (AR-SV), and pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) polymorphisms of AR in a subject.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancers among men in the US and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths with more than 200,000 new cases and over 30.000 deaths each year in the United States. PCa therapeutics market is growing at an annual rate of 15-20% globally.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of treatment for advanced PCa. Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergo ADT, either by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, LHRH antagonists or by bilateral orchiectomy. Despite initial response to ADT, disease progression is inevitable and the cancer emerges as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Up to 30% of patients with prostate cancer that undergo primary treatment by radiation or surgery will develop metastatic disease within 10 years of the primary treatment. Approximately 50,000 patients a year will develop metastatic disease, which is termed metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patients with CRPC have a median survival of 12-18 months. Though castration-resistant, CRPC is still dependent on the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis for continued growth. The primary reason for CRPC re-emergence is re-activation of AR by alternate mechanisms such as: 1) intracrine androgen synthesis, 2) AR splice variants (AR-SV), e.g., that lack ligand binding domain (LBD), 3) AR-LBD mutations with potential to resist AR antagonists (i.e., mutants that are not sensitive to inhibition by AR antagonists, and in some cases AR antagonists act as agonists of the AR bearing these LBD mutations), and 4) amplifications of the AR gene within the tumor. A critical barrier to progress in treating CRPC is that AR signaling inhibitors such as enzalutamide, bicalutamide, and abiraterone, acting through the LBD, fail to inhibit growth driven by the N-terminal domain (NTD)-dependent constitutively active AR-SV such as AR-V7, the most prominent AR-SV. Recent high-impact clinical trials with enzalutamide and abiraterone in CRPC patients demonstrated that just 13.9% of AR-V7-positive patients among 202 patients starting treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) had PSA responses to either of the treatments (Antonarakis E S, Lu C. Luber B, et al. <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>2017 Apr. 6, doi: 10.1200/JCO.2016.70.1961), indicating the requirement for next generation AR antagonists that target AR-SVs. In addition, a significant number of CRPC patients are becoming refractory to abiraterone or enzalutamide, emphasizing the need for next generation AR antagonists.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current evidences demonstrate that CRPC growth is dependent on constitutively active AR including AR-SV's that lack the LBD such as AR-V7 and therefore cannot be inhibited by conventional antagonists. AR inhibition and degradation through binding to a domain that is distinct from the AR LBD provides alternate strategies to manage CRPC.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Molecules that degrade the AR prevent any inadvertent AR activation through growth factors or signaling pathways, or promiscuous ligand-dependent activation. In addition, molecules that inhibit the constitutive activation of AR-SVs are extremely important to provide extended benefit to CRPC patients.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Currently only a few chemotypes are known to degrade AR which include the SARDs ARN-509. AZD-3514, and ASC-J9. However, these molecules degrade AR indirectly at much higher concentrations than their binding coefficient and they fail to degrade the AR-SVs that have become in recent years the primary reason for resurgence of treatment-resistant CRPC.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention describes novel AR antagonists with unique pharmacology that strongly (high potency and efficacy) and selectively bind AR (better than known antagonists in some cases; bind to LBD and/or NTD), antagonize AR, and degrade AR full length (AR-FL) and AR-SV. Selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) compounds possess dual degradation and AR-SV inhibitory functions and hence are distinct from any available CRPC therapeutics. These novel selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) compounds inhibit the growth of PCa cells and tumors that are dependent on AR-FL and AR-SV for proliferation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">SARDs have the potential to evolve as new therapeutics to treat CRPCs that are untreatable with any other antagonists. This unique property of degrading AR-SV has extremely important health consequences for prostate cancer. Till date only one series of synthetic molecules (EPI-001, EPI-506, etc.) and some marine natural products such as the sinkotamides and glycerol ether Naphetenone B, are reported to bind to AR-NTD and inhibit AR function and PCa cell growth, albeit at lower affinity and inability to degrade the receptor. The SARDs reported herein also bind to AR-NTD and inhibit NTD-driven (e.g., ligand independent) AR activity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The positive correlation between AR and PCa and the lack of a fail-safe AR antagonist, emphasizes the need for molecules that inhibit AR function through novel or alternate mechanisms and/or binding sites, and that can elicit antagonistic activities within an altered cellular environment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although traditional antiandrogens such as enzalutanmide, bicalutamide and flutamide and androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) were approved for use in prostate cancer, there is significant evidence that antiandrogens could also be used in a variety of other hormone dependent and hormone independent cancers. For example, antiandrogens have been tested in breast cancer (enzalutamide; Breast Cancer Res. (2014) 16 (1): R7), non-small cell lung cancer (shRNAi AR), renal cell carcinoma (ASC-J9), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) associated malignancies such as gonadal tumors and seminoma, advanced pancreatic cancer (<i>World J. Gastroenterology </i>20(29), 9229), cancer of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, cancer of the salivary gland (<i>Head and Neck </i>(2016) 38, 724-731; ADT was tested in AR-expressing recurrent/metastatic salivary gland cancers and was confirmed to have benefit on progression free survival and overall survival endpoints), bladder cancer (<i>Oncotarget </i>6(30), 29860-29876); <i>Int J. Endocrinol </i>(2015), Article ID 384860), pancreatic cancer, lymphoma (including mantle cell), and hepatocellular carcinoma. Use of a more potent antiandrogen such as a SARD in these cancers may more efficaciously treat the progression of these and other cancers. Other cancers may also benefit from SARD treatment such as breast cancer (e.g., triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)), testicular cancer, cancers associated with partial androgen insensitivity syndromes (PAIS) such as gonadal tumors and seminoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of the fallopian tubes or peritoneum, salivary gland cancer, bladder cancer, urogenital cancer, brain cancer, skin cancer, lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, colon cancer, perianal adenoma, or central nervous system cancer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer lacking the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 receptor kinase. As such, TNBC lacks the hormone and kinase therapeutic targets used to treat other types of primary breast cancers. Correspondingly, chemotherapy is often the initial pharmacotherapy for TNBC. Interestingly, AR is often still expressed in TNBC and may offer a hormone targeted therapeutic alternative to chemotherapy. In ER-positive breast cancer, AR is a positive prognostic indicator as it is believed that activation of AR limits and/or opposes the effects of the ER in breast tissue and tumors. However, in the absence of ER, it is possible that AR actually supports the growth of breast cancer tumors. Though the role of AR is not fully understood in TNBC, we have evidence that certain TNBC's may be supported by androgen independent activation of AR-SVs lacking the LBD or androgen-dependent activation of AR full length. As such, enzalutamide and other LBD-directed traditional AR antagonists would not be able to antagonize AR-SVs in these TNBC's. However, SARDs of this invention which are capable of destroying AR-SVs (see Table 1 and Example 5) through a binding site in the NTD of AR (see Example 9) would be able to antagonize AR including AR-SV observed in TNBC patient derived xenograpfts and provide an anti-tumor effect, as shown in Example 8.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Traditional antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and flutamide were approved for use in prostate cancer. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the utility of antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide, spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, finasteride and chlormadinone acetate) in androgen-dependent dermatological conditions such as androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness), acne vulgaris, and hirsutism (e.g., in female facial hair). Prepubertal castration prevents sebum production and androgenic alopecia but this can be reversed by use of testosterone, suggesting its androgen-dependence.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The AR gene has a polymorphism of glutamine repeats (polyQ) within exon <b>1</b> which when shortened may augment AR transactivation (i.e., hyperandrogenism). It has been found that shortened polyQ polymorphisms are more common in people with alopecia, hirsutism, and acne. Classic antiandrogens are undesirable for these purposes because they are ineffective through dermal dosing and their long-term systemic use raises the risks of untoward sexual effects such as gynecomastia and impotence. Further, similar to CPRC discussed above, inhibition of ligand-dependent AR activity alone may not be sufficient as AR can be activated by various cellular factors other than the endogencous androgens testosterone (T) and dihydrotestostcrone (DHT), such as growth factors, kinases, co-activator overexpression and/or promiscuous activation by other hormones (e.g., estrogens or glucocorticoids). Consequently, blocking the binding of T and DHT to AR with a classical antiandrogen may not be sufficient to have the desired efficacy.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An emerging concept is the topical application of a SARD to destroy the AR locally to the affected areas of the skin or other tissue without exerting any systemic antiandrogenisn. For this use, a SARD that does not penetrate the skin or is rapidly metabolized would be preferable.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Supporting this approach is the observation that cutaneous wound healing has been demonstrated to be suppressed by androgens. Castration of mice accelerates cutaneous wound healing while attenuating the inflammation in the wounds. The negative correlation between androgen levels and cutaneous healing and inflammation, in part, explains another mechanism by which high levels of endogenous androgens exacerbate hyperandrogenic dermatological conditions. Further, it provides a rationale for the treatment of wounds such as diabetic ulcers or even trauma, or skin disorders with an inflammatory component such as acne or psoriasis, with a topical SARD.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Androgenic alopecia occurs in &#x2dc;50% of Caucasian males by midlife and up to 90% by 80 years old. Minoxidil (a topical vasodilator) and finasteride (a systemic 5alpha reductase type II inhibitor) are FDA approved for alopecia but require 4-12 months of treatment to produce a therapeutic effect and only arrest hair loss in most with mild to moderate hair regrowth in 30-60%. Since currently available treatments have slow and limited efficacy that varies widely between individuals, and produce unwanted sexual side effects, it is important to find a novel approach to treat androgenic alopecia and other hyperandrogenic dermatologic diseases.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of upper and lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle atrophy. Epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggest the involvement of androgens in ALS pathogenesis (&#x201c;Anabolic/androgenic steroid nandrolone exacerbates gene expression modifications induced by mutant SOD1 in muscles of mice models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&#x201d; Galbiati M. Onesto E. Zito A, Crippa V. Rusmini P, Mariotti R, Bentivoglio M. Bendotti C, Poletti A. <i>Pharmacol. Res. </i>2012, 65(2), 221-230), but the mechanism through which androgens modify the ALS phenotype is unknown. A transgenic animal model of ALS demonstrated improved survival upon surgical castration (i.e., androgen ablation). Treatment of these castrated animals with the androgen agonist nandrolone decanoate worsened disease manifestations. Castration reduces the AR level, which may be the reason for extended survival. The survival benefit is reversed by androgen agonist (&#x201c;Androgens affect muscle, motor neuron, and survival in a mouse model of SOD1-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&#x201d; Aggarwal T, Polanco M J, Scaramuzzino C, Rocchi A, Milioto C. Emionite L, Ognio E, Sambataro F, Galbiati M. Poletti A, Pennuto M. <i>Neurobiol. Aging. </i>2014 35(8), 1929-1938). Notably, stimulation with nandrolone decanoate promoted the recruitment of endogenous androgen receptor into biochemical complexes that were insoluble in sodium dodecyl sulfate, a finding consistent with protein aggregation. Overall, these results shed light on the role of androgens as modifiers of ALS pathogenesis via dysregulation of androgen receptor homeostasis. Antiandrogens should block the effects of nandrolone undecanoate or endogencous androgens and reverse the toxicitics due to AR aggegregation. Further, an antiandrogen that can block action of LBD-dependent AR agonists and concomitantly lower AR protein levels, such as the SARDs of this invention, would be therapeutic in ALS. Riluzole is an available drug for ALS treatment, however, it only provides short-term effects. There is an urgent need for drugs that extend the survival of ALS patients.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Androgen receptor action promotes uterine proliferation. Hyperandrogenicity of the short polyQ AR has been associated with increased leiomyoma or uterine fibroids. (Hsieh Y Y, Chang C C, Tsai F J, Lin C C, Yeh L S, Peng C T. <i>J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. </i>2004, 21(12), 453-457). A separate study of Brazilian women found that shorter and longer [CAG](n) repeat alleles of AR were exclusive to the leiomyoma group in their study (Rosa F E, Canevari Rde A, Ambrosio E P, Ramos Cirilo P D, Pontes A, Rainho C A. Rogatto S R. <i>Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. </i>2008, 46(6), 814-823). Similarly, in Asian Indian women long polyQ AR was associated with endometriosis and leiomyoma and can be regarded as high-risk markers. SARDs could be used in women with uterine fibroids, especially those expressing shorter and longer [CAG](n) repeat alleles, to treat existing uterine fibroids, prevent worsening of fibroids and/or ameliorate carcinogenicity associated with fibroids.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlarged area in the lower part of the aorta, the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. The aorta, about the thickness of a garden hose, runs from your heart through the center of your chest and abdomen. Because the aorta is the body's main supplier of blood, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause life-threatening bleeding, Depending on the size and the rate at which your abdominal aortic aneurysm is growing, treatment may vary from watchful waiting to emergency surgery. Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm is found, doctors will closely monitor it so that surgery can be planned if it is necessary. Emergency surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can be risky. AR blockade (pharmacologic or genetic) reduces AAA. Davis et al. (Davis J P, Salmon M, Pope N H, Lu G, Su G, Meher A, Ailawadi G, Upchurch G R Jr. J Vasc Surg (2016) 63(6):1602-1612) showed that flutanide (50 mg/kg) or ketoconazole (150 mg/kg) attenuated porcine pancreatic elastase (0.35 UImL) induced AAA by 84.2% and 91.5% compared to vehicle (121%), Further AR &#x2212;/&#x2212; mice showed attenuated AAA growth (64.4%) compared to wildtype (both treated with elastase). Correspondingly, administration of a SARD to a patient suffering from an AAA may help reverse, treat or delay progression of AAA to the point where surgery is needed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">X-linked spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA&#x2014;also known as Kennedy's disease) is a muscular atrophy that arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome. Proximal limb and bulbar muscle weakness results in physical limitations including dependence on a wheelehair in some cases. The mutation results in a protracted polyglutamine tract added to the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor (polyQ AR). Binding and activation of this lengthened polyQ AR by endogeneous androgens (testosterone and DHT) results in unfolding and nuclear translocation of the mutant androgen receptor. The androgen-induced toxicity and androgen-dependent nuclear accumulation of polyQ AR protein seems to be central to the pathogenesis. Therefore, the inhibition of the androgen-activated polyQ AR might be a therapeutic option (A. Baniahmad. Inhibition of the androgen receptor by antiandrogens in spinobulbar muscle atrophy. <i>J. Mol. Neurosci. </i>2016 58(3), 343-347). These steps are required for pathogenesis and result in partial loss of transactivation function (i.e., an androgen insensitivity) and a poorly understood neuromuscular degeneration. Support of use antiandrogen comes in a report in which the antiandrogen flutamide protects male mice from androgen-dependent toxicity in three models of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Renier K J, Troxell-Smith S M, Johansen J A, Katsuno M, Adachi H, Sobue G, Chua J P, Sun Kim H, Lieberman A P, Breedlove S M, Jordan C L. <i>Endocrinology </i>2014, 155(7), 2624-2634). Currently there are no disease-modifying treatments but rather only symptom directed treatments. Efforts to target the polyQ AR of Kennedy's disease as the proximal mediator of toxicity by harnessing cellular machinery to promote its degradation, i.e., through the use of a SARD, hold promise for therapeutic intervention. Selective androgen receptor degraders such as those reported herein bind to and degrade all androgen receptors tested (full length, splice variant, antiandrogen resistance mutants, etc.) so degradation of polyQ AR polymorphism is also expected, indicating that they are promising leads for treatment of SBMA.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Here we describe, inter alia, pyrrole, pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, and morpholine based selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) compounds that may bind to the LBD and/or an alternate binding and degradation domain (BDD) located in the NTD, antagonize AR, and degrade AR thereby blocking ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR activities. This novel mechanism produces improved efficacy when dosed systemically (e.g., for prostate cancer) or topically (e.g., dermatological diseases).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One embodiment of the invention encompasses a selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) compound represented by the structure of formula I:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="22.69mm" wi="55.96mm" file="US20230002326A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">wherein<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0025">T is H, OH, OR, OCOR, CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>, or NHCOR;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0026">R<sup>1 </sup>is H, CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F, CHF<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, or CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0027">or T and R<sup>1 </sup>form a 3-8 carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0028">Y is H, CF<sub>3</sub>, F, I, Br, Cl, CN, or C(R)<sub>3</sub>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0029">Z is H, NO<sub>2</sub>, CN, halide, COOH, COR, NHCOR, CONHR,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0030">or Y and Z form a 5 to 8 membered fused ring;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0031">X is CH or N;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0032">R is H, alkyl, alkenyl, haloalkyl, aleohol, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, CF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl, aryl, F, Cl, Br, I, or OH;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0033">A is R<sup>2 </sup>or R<sup>3</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0034">R<sup>2 </sup>is a five or six-membered saturated or unsaturated ring having at least one nitrogen atom and 0, 1, or 2 double bonds, optionally substituted with at least one of Q<sup>1</sup>, Q<sup>2</sup>, Q<sup>3</sup>, or Q<sup>4</sup>, each independently selected from hydrogen, keto, substituted or unsubstituted linear or branched alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, haloalkyl.

However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0194">Androgens act in cells by binding to the AR, a member of the steroid receptor superfamily of transcription factors. As the growth and maintenance of prostate cancer (PCa) is largely controlled by circulating androgens, treatment of PCa heavily relies on therapies that target AR. Treatment with AR antagonists such as enzalutamide, bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide to disrupt receptor activation has been successfully used in the past to reduce PCa growth. All currently available AR antagonists competitively bind AR and recruit corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT to repress transcription of target genes. However, altered intracellular signaling, AR mutations, and increased expression of coactivators lead to functional impairment of antagonists or even transformation of antagonists into agonists. Studies have demonstrated that mutation of W741 and T877 within AR converts bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, to agonists. Similarly, increased intracellular cytokines recruit coactivators instead of corepressors to AR-responsive promoters subsequently converting bicalutamide to an agonist. Similarly, mutations that have been linked to enzalutamide resistance include F876, H874, T877, and di-mutants T877/S888, T877/D890, F876/1T877 (i.e., MR49 cells), and H874IT877 (<i>Genome Biol</i>. (2016) 17:10 (doi: 10.1186/s13059-015-0864-1)). Abiraterone resistance mutations include L702H mutations which results in activation of the AR by glucocorticoids such as prednisone, causing resistance to abiraterone because abiraterone is usually prescribed in combination with prednisone. If resistance develops to enzalutamide then often the patient is refractory to abiraterone also and vice versa; or the duration of response is very short. This situation highlights the need for a definitive androgen ablation therapy to prevent AR reactivation in advanced prostate cancers.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0195">Despite initial response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), PCa disease progression is inevitable and the cancer emerges as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

As such, TNBC lacks the hormone and kinase therapeutic targets used to treat other types of primary breast cancers. Correspondingly, chemotherapy is often the initial pharmacotherapy for TNBC. Interestingly, AR is often still expressed in TNBC and may offer a hormone targeted therapeutic alternative to chemotherapy. In ER-positive breast cancer, AR is a positive prognostic indicator as it is believed that activation of AR limits and/or opposes the effects of the ER in breast tissue and tumors. However, in the absence of ER, it is possible that AR actually supports the growth of breast cancer tumors. Though the role of AR is not fully understood in TNBC, we have evidence that certain TNBC's may be supported by androgen independent activation of AR-SVs lacking the LBD or androgen-dependent activation of AR full length. As such, enzalutamide and other LBD-directed traditional AR antagonists would not be able to antagonize AR-SVs in these TNBC's. However, SARDs of this invention which are capable of destroying AR-SVs (see Table 1 and Example 5) through a binding site in the NTD of AR (see Example 9) would be able to antagonize AR in these TNBC's and provide an anti-tumor effect, as shown in Example 8.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0511">Treatment of Kennedy's Disease</p><p id="p-0275" num="0512">Muscle atrophy (MA) is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example, post-polio MA is muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post-polio syndrome (PPS). The atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain. Another type of MA is X-linked spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA&#x2014;also known as Kennedy's Disease). This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in late adolescence to adulthood. Proximal limb and bulbar muscle weakness results in physical limitations including dependence on a wheelchair in some cases. The mutation results in an extended polyglutamine tract at the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor (polyQ AR).</p><p id="p-0276" num="0513">Binding and activation of the polyQ AR by endogeneous androgens (testosterone and DHT) results in unfolding and nuclear translocation of the mutant androgen receptor. The androgen-induced toxicity and androgen-dependent nuclear accumulation of polyQ AR protein seems to be central to the pathogenesis. Therefore, the inhibition of the androgen-activated polyQ AR might be a therapeutic option (A. Baniahmad. Inhibition of the androgen receptor by antiandrogens in spinobulbar muscle atrophy. <i>J. Mol. Neurosci. </i>2016 58(3), 343-347). These steps are required for pathogenesis and result in partial loss of transactivation function (i.e., an androgen insensitivity) and a poorly understood neuromuscular degeneration. Peripheral polyQ AR anti-sense therapy rescues disease in mouse models of SBMA (Cell Reports 7, 774-784, May 8, 2014), Further support of use antiandrogen comes in a report in which the antiandrogen flutamide protects male mice from androgen-dependent toxicity in three models of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Renier K J, Troxell-Smith S M, Johansen J A, Katsuno M, Adachi H. Sobue G, Chua J P, Sun Kim H, Lieberman A P, Breedlove S M, Jordan C L. <i>Endocrinology </i>2014, 155(7), 2624-2634). These steps are required for pathogenesis and result in partial loss of transactivation function (i.e., an androgen insensitivity) and a poorly understood neuromuscular degeneration. Currently there are no disease-modifying treatments but rather only symptom directed treatments. Efforts to target the polyQ AR as the proximal mediator of toxicity by harnessing cellular machinery to promote its degradation hold promise for therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0514">Selective androgen receptor degraders such as those reported herein bind to, inhibit transactivation, and degrade all androgen receptors tested to date (full length, splice variant, antiandrogen resistance mutants, etc.), indicating that they are promising leads for treatment diseases whose pathogenesis is androgen-dependent such as SBMA.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0515">The invention encompasses methods of treating Kennedy's disease comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0516">As used herein, the term &#x201c;androgen receptor associated conditions&#x201d; or &#x201c;androgen sensitive diseases or disorders&#x201d; or &#x201c;androgen-dependent diseases or disorders&#x201d; are conditions, diseases, or disorders that are modulated by or whose pathogenesis is dependent upon the activity of the androgen receptor.

For example, antiandrogens have been successfully tested in breast cancer (enzalutamide; Breast Cancer Res (2014) 16 (1): R7), non-small cell lung cancer (shRNAi AR), renal cell carcinoma (ASC-J9), partial androgen insensitivity associated malignancies such as gonadal tumors and seminoma, advanced pancreatic cancer (World J Gastroenterology 20(29):9229), cancer of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, cancer of the salivary gland (Head and Neck (2016) 38: 724-731; ADT was tested in AR-expressing recurrent/metastatic salivary gland cancers and was confirmed to have benefit on progression free survival and overall survival endpoints), bladder cancer (Oncotarget 6 (30): 29860-29876); Int J Endocrinol (2015), Article ID 384860), pancreatic cancer, lymphoma (including mantle cell), and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The aorta, about the thickness of a garden hose, runs from your heart through the center of your chest and abdomen. Because the aorta is the body's main supplier of blood, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause life-threatening bleeding. Depending on the size and the rate at which your abdominal aortic aneurysm is growing, treatment may vary from watchful waiting to emergency surgery. Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm is found, doctors will closely monitor it so that surgery can be planned if it is necessary. Emergency surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can be risky. AR blockade (pharmacologic or genetic) reduces AAA. Davis et cal. (Davis J P, Salmon M, Pope N H, Lu G, Su G, Meher A, Ailawadi G, Upchurch G R Jr. J Vase Surg (2016) 63(6):1602-1612) showed that flutamide (50 mg/kg) or ketoconazole (150 mg/kg) attenuated AAA induced by porcine pancreatic elastase (0.35 U/mL) by 84.2% and 91.5% compared to vehicle (121%), Further AR &#x2212;/&#x2212; mice showed attenuated AAA growth (64.4%) compared to wildtype (both treated with elastase).

A wound may be a result of a soft tissue defect or a lesion or of an underlying condition. The term &#x201c;wound&#x201d; denotes a bodily injury with disruption of the normal integrity of tissue structures, sore, lesion, necrosis, and/or ulcer. The term &#x201c;sore&#x201d; refers to any lesion of the skin or mucous membranes and the term &#x201c;ulcer&#x201d; refers to a local defect, or excavation, of the surface of an organ or tissue, which is produced by the sloughing of necrotic tissue. &#x201c;Lesion&#x201d; generally includes any tissue defect. &#x201c;Necrosis&#x201d; refers to dead tissue resulting from infection, injury, inflammation, or infarctions. All of these are encompassed by the term &#x201c;wound.&#x201d; which denotes any wound at any particular stage in the healing process including the stage before any healing has initiated or even before a specific wound like a surgical incision is made (prophylactic treatment).</p><p id="p-0303" num="0540">Examples of wounds which can be treated in accordance with the present invention are aseptic wounds, contused wounds, incised wounds, lacerated wounds, non-penetrating wounds (i.e. wounds in which there is no disruption of the skin but there is injury to underlying structures), open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds, puncture wounds, septic wounds, subcutaneous wounds, etc. Examples of sores include, but are not limited to, bed sores, canker sores, chrome sores, cold sores, pressure sores, etc. Examples of ulcers include, but are not limited to, peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gouty ulcer, diabetic ulcer, hypertensive ischemic ulcer, stasis ulcer, ulcus cruris (venous ulcer), sublingual ulcer, submucous ulcer, symptomatic ulcer, trophic ulcer, tropical ulcer, veneral ulcer, e.g., caused by gonorrhoea (including urethritis, endocervicitis and proctitis). Conditions related to wounds or sores which may be successfully treated according to the invention include, but are not limited to, burns, anthrax, tetanus, gas gangrene, scalatina, erysipelas, sycosis barbac, folliculitis, impetigo contagiosa, impetigo bullosa, etc. It is understood, that there may be an overlap between the use of the terms &#x201c;wound&#x201d; and &#x201c;ulcer.&#x201d; or &#x201c;wound&#x201d; and &#x201c;sore&#x201d; and, furthermore, the terms are often used at random.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0541">The kinds of wounds to be treated according to the invention include also: i) general wounds such as, e.g., surgical, traumatic, infectious, ischemic, thermal, chemical and bullous wounds; ii) wounds specific for the oral cavity such as, e.g., post-extraction wounds, endodontic wounds especially in connection with treatment of cysts and abscesses, ulcers and lesions of bacterial, viral or autoimmunological origin, mechanical, chemical, thermal, infectious and lichenoid wounds; herpes ulcers, stomatitis aphthosa, acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and burning mouth syndrome are specific examples; and iii) wounds on the skin such as, e.g., neoplasm, burns (e.g. chemical, thermal), lesions (bacterial, viral, autoimmunological), bites and surgical incisions. Another way of classifying wounds is by tissue loss, where: i) small tissue loss (due to surgical incisions, minor abrasions, and minor bites) or ii) significant tissue loss. The latter group includes ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, lacerations, severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds (in soft and hard tissues) and infarctions. Other wounds include ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, severe bites, thermal burns, or donor site wounds.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0542">Ischemic ulcers and pressure sores are wounds, which normally only heal very slowly and especially in such cases an improved and more rapid healing is of great importance to the patient. Furthermore, the costs involved in the treatment of patients suffering from such wounds are markedly reduced when the healing is improved and takes place more rapidly.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0543">Donor site wounds are wounds which e.g. occur in connection with removal of hard tissue from one part of the body to another part of the body e.g, in connection with transplantation.

Apart from the stratum corneum, the epidermal layer of the skin is the outer (epithelial) layer and the deeper connective tissue layer of the skin is called the dermis.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0548">Since the skin is the most exposed part of the body, it is particularly susceptible to various kinds of injuries such as, e.g., ruptures, cuts, abrasions, burns and frostbites or injuries arising from various diseases. Furthermore, much skin is often destroyed in accidents. However, due to the important barrier and physiologic function of the skin, the integrity of the skin is important to the well-being of the individual, and any breach or rupture represents a threat that must be met by the body in order to protect its continued existence.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0549">Apart from injuries on the skin, injuries may also be present in all kinds of tissues (i.e, soft and hard tissues). Injuries on soft tissues including mucosal membranes and/or skin are especially relevant in connection with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0550">Healing of a wound on the skin or on a mucosal membrane undergoes a series of stages that results either in repair or regeneration of the skin or mucosal membrane. In recent years, regeneration and repair have been distinguished as the two types of healing that may occur. Regeneration may be defined as a biological process whereby the architecture and function of lost tissue are completely renewed. Repair, on the other hand, is a biological process whereby continuity of disrupted tissue is restored by new tissues which do not replicate the structure and function of the lost ones.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0551">The majority of wounds heal through repair, meaning that the new tissue formed is structurally and chemically unlike the original tissue (sear tissue). In the early stage of the tissue repair, one process which is almost always involved is the formation of a transient connective tissue in the area of tissue injury. This process starts by formation of a new extracellular collagen matrix by fibroblasts. This new extracellular collagen matrix is then the support for a connective tissue during the final healing process. The final healing is, in most tissues, a scar formation containing connective tissue. In tissues which have regenerative properties, such as, e.g., skin and bone, the final healing includes regeneration of the original tissue. This regenerated tissue has frequently also some scar characteristics, e.g, a thickening of a healed bone fracture.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0552">Under normal circumstances, the body provides mechanisms for healing injured skin or mucosa in order to restore the integrity of the skin barrier or the mucosa. The repair process for even minor ruptures or wounds may take a period of time extending from hours and days to weeks. However, in ulceration, the healing can be very slow and the wound may persist for an extended period of time, i.e, months or even years.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0553">Burns are associated with reduced testosterone levels, and hypogonadism is associated with delayed wound healing. The invention encompasses methods for treating a subject suffering from a wound or a burn by administering at least one SARD compound according to this invention. The SARD may promote resolving of the burn or wound, participates in the healing process of a burn or a wound, or, treats a secondary complication of a burn or wound.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0554">The treatment of burns or wounds may further use at least one growth factor such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforning growth factor-&#x3b1; (TGF-&#x3b1;), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) including acidic fibroblast growth factor (&#x3b1;-FGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (&#x3b2;-FGF), transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; (TGF-&#x3b2;) and insulin like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2), or any combination thereof, which promote wound healing.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0555">Wound healing may be measured by many procedures known in the art, including, but not limited to, wound tensile strength, hydroxyproline or collagen content, procollagen expression, or re-epithelialization. As an example, a SARD as described herein may be administered orally or topically at a dosage of about 0.1-100 mg per day. Therapeutic effectiveness is measured as effectiveness in enhancing wound healing as compared to the absence of the SARD compound. Enhanced wound healing may be measured by known techniques such as decrease in healing time, increase in collagen density, increase in hydroxyproline, reduction in complications, increase in tensile strength, and increased cellularity of scar tissue.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0556">The term &#x201c;reducing the pathogenesis&#x201d; is to be understood to encompass reducing tissue damage, or organ damage associated with a particular disease, disorder or condition.

Typically, the dermatological preparation will be applied to the affected area from 1 to 4 times daily. &#x201c;Dermatologically acceptable&#x201d; refers to a carrier which may be applied to the skin or hair, and which will allow the drug to diffuse to the site of action. More specifically &#x201c;site of action&#x201d;, it refers to a site where inhibition of androgen receptor or degradation of the androgen receptor is desired.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0565">The compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB, may be used topically to relieve alopecia, especially androgenic alopecia. Androgens have a profound effect on both hair growth and hair loss. In most body sites, such as the beard and pubic skin, androgens stimulate hair growth by prolonging the growth phase of the hair cycle (anagen) and increasing follicle size. Hair growth on the scalp does not require androgens but, paradoxically, androgens are necessary for the balding on the scalp in genetically predisposed individuals (androgenic alopecia) where there is a progressive decline in the duration of anagen and in hair follicle size. Androgenic alopecia is also common in women where it usually presents as a diffuse hair loss rather than showing the patterning seen in men.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0566">While the compounds of formulas I-VI, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB will most typically be used to alleviate androgenic alopecia, the compounds may be used to alleviate any type of alopecia. Examples of non-androgenic alopecia include, but are not limited to, alopecia areata, alopecia due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, scarring alopecia, or stress related alopecia.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0567">The compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IA. B, VIIA, or VIIB can be applied topically to the scalp and hair to prevent, or treat balding. Further, the compound of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB can be applied topically in order to induce or promote the growth or regrowth of hair on the scalp.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0568">The invention also encompasses topically administering a compound of formula I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB to treat or prevent the growth of hair in areas where such hair growth in not desired. One such use will be to alleviate hirsutism. Hirsutism is excessive hair growth in areas that typically do not have hair (e.g., a female face). Such inappropriate hair growth occurs most commonly in women and is frequently seen at menopause. The topical administration of the compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB will alleviate this condition leading to a reduction, or elimination of this inappropriate, or undesired, hair growth.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0569">The compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VTB may also be used topically to decrease sebum production. Sebum is composed of triglycerides, wax esters, fatty acids, sterol esters and squalene. Sebum is produced in the acinar cells of the sebaceous glands and accumulates as these cells age. At maturation, the acinar cells lyse, releasing sebum into the luminal duct so that it may be deposited on the surface of the skin.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0570">In some individuals, an excessive quantity of sebum is secreted onto the skin. This can have a number of adverse consequences. It can exacerbate acne, since sebum is the primary food source for Propionbacterium acnes, the causative agent of acne. It can cause the skin to have a greasy appearance, typically considered cosmetically unappealing.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0571">Formation of sebum is regulated by growth factors and a variety of hormones including androgens. The cellular and molecular mechanism by which androgens exert their influence on the sebaceous gland has not been fully elucidated. However, clinical experience documents the impact androgens have on sebum production. Sebum production is significantly increased during puberty, when androgen levels are their highest. The compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB inhibit the secretion of sebum and thus reduce the amount of sebum on the surface of the skin. The compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB can be used to treat a variety of dermal diseases such as acne or seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0572">In addition to treating diseases associated with excess sebum production, the compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB can also be used to achieve a cosmetic effect. Some consumers believe that they are afflicted with overactive sebaceous glands. They feel that their skin is oily and thus unattractive. These individuals may use the compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB to decrease the amount of sebum on their skin. Decreasing the secretion of sebum will alleviate oily skin in individuals afflicted with such conditions.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0573">To treat these topical indications, the invention encompasses cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions (such as dermatological compositions), comprising at least one of the compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB, Such dermatological compositions will contain from 0.001% to 10% w/w % of the compound(s) in admixture with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, and more typically, from 0.1 to 5 w/w % of the compounds. Such compositions will typically be applied from 1 to 4 times daily. The reader's attention is directed to Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, Edition 17, Mark Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., for a discussion of how to prepare such formulations.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0574">The compositions of the invention may also include solid preparations such as cleansing soaps or bars. These compositions are prepared according to methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0575">Formulations such as aqueous, alcoholic, or aqueous-alcoholic solutions, or creams, gels, emulsions or mousses, or aerosol compositions with a propellant may be used to treat indications that arise where hair is present. Thus, the composition can also be a hair care composition. Such hair care compositions include, but are not limited to, shampoo, a hair-setting lotion, a treating lotion, a styling cream or gel, a dye composition, or a lotion or gel for preventing hair loss. The amounts of the various constituents in the dermatological compositions are those conventionally used in the fields considered.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0576">Medicinal and cosmetic agents containing the compounds of formulas I-VII, IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIB, VIIA, or VIIB will typically be packaged for retail distribution (i.e., an article of manufacture). Such articles will be labeled and packaged in a manner to instruct the patient how to use the product. Such instructions will include the condition to be treated, duration of treatment, dosing schedule, etc.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0577">Antiandrogens, such as finasteride or flutamide, have been shown to decrease androgen levels or block androgen action in the skin to some extent but suffer from undesirable systemic effects. An alternative approach is to topically apply a selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) compound to the affected areas. Such SARD compound would exhibit potent but local inhibition of AR activity, and local degradation of the AR, would not penetrate to the systemic circulation of the subject, or would be rapidly metabolized upon entry into the blood, limiting systemic exposure.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0578">To prepare such pharmaceutical dosage forms, the active ingredient may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0579">As used herein &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents&#x201d; are well known to those skilled in the art. The carrier or diluent may be a solid carrier or diluent for solid formulations, a liquid carrier or diluent for liquid formulations, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0580">Solid carriers/diluents include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g, corn starch, pregelatinized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose), an acrylate (e.g, polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, tale, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0581">Oral and Parenteral Administration: In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as, suspensions, elixirs, and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like. For solid oral preparations such as, powders, capsules, and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like. Due to their case in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0582">For parenteral formulations, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients may be included, such as ingredients that aid solubility or for preservation. Injectable solutions may also be prepared in which case appropriate stabilizing agents may be employed.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0583">In some applications, it may be advantageous to utilize the active agent in a &#x201c;vectorized&#x201d; form, such as by encapsulation of the active agent in a liposome or other encapsulant medium, or by fixation of the active agent, e.g., by covalent bonding, chelation, or associative coordination, on a suitable biomolecule, such as those selected from proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0584">Methods of treatment using formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Optionally, a suspension in an aqueous liquor or a non-aqueous liquid may be employed, such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion, or a draught.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0585">A tablet may be made by compression or molding, or wet granulation, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, with the active compound being in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules which optionally is mixed with, for example, a binder, disintegrant, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active agent, or discharging agent. Molded tablets comprised of a mixture of the powdered active compound with a suitable carrier may be made by molding in a suitable machine.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0586">A syrup may be made by adding the active compound to a concentrated aqueous solution of a sugar, for example sucrose, to which may also be added any accessory ingredient(s). Such accessory ingredient(s) may include flavorings, suitable preservative, agents to retard crystallization of the sugar, and agents to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as a polyhydroxy alcohol, for example glycerol or sorbitol.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0587">Formulations suitable for parenteral administration may comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound, which preferably is isotonic with the blood of the recipient (e.g., physiological saline solution). Such formulations may include suspending agents and thickening agents and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose form.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0588">Parenteral administration may comprise any suitable form of systemic delivery. Administration may for example be intravenous, intra-arterial, intrathecal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-abdominal (e.g., intraperitoneal), etc., and may be effected by infusion pumps (external or implantable) or any other suitable means appropriate to the desired administration modality.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0589">Nasal and other mucosal spray formulations (e.g, inhalable forms) can comprise purified aqueous solutions of the active compounds with preservative agents and isotonic agents. Such formulations are preferably adjusted to a pH and isotonic state compatible with the nasal or other mucous membranes. Alternatively, they can be in the form of finely divided solid powders suspended in a gas carrier. Such formulations may be delivered by any suitable means or method, e.g., by nebulizer, atomizer, metered dose inhaler, or the like.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0590">Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable carrier such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated fats, or hydrogenated fatty carboxylic acids.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0591">Transdermal formulations may be prepared by incorporating the active agent in a thixotropic or gelatinous carrier such as a cellulosic medium, e.g., methyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose, with the resulting formulation then being packed in a transdermal device adapted to be secured in dermal contact with the skin of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0592">In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, formulations of this invention may further include one or more ingredient selected from diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, disintegrants, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including antioxidants), and the like.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0593">The formulations may be of immediate release, sustained release, delayed-onset release or any other release profile known to one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0594">For administration to mammals, and particularly humans, it is expected that the physician will determine the actual dosage and duration of treatment, which will be most suitable for an individual and can vary with the age, weight, genetics and/or response of the particular individual.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0595">The methods of the invention comprise administration of a compound at a therapeutically effective amount.

Log P was calculated using ChemDraw Ultra version is 12.0.2.1016 (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass. 02451). Caleulated Log P values are reported in Table 1 in the column labeled &#x2018;Log P (&#x2212;0.4 to +5.6)&#x2019;. Lipinski's rule of five is a set of criteria intended to predict oral bioavailability. One of these criteria for oral bioavailability is that the Log P is between the values shown in the column heading (&#x2212;0.4 (relatively hydrophilic) to +5.6 (relatively lipophilic) range), or more generally stated &#x3c;5. One of the goals of SARD design was to improve water solubility. The monocyclic templates of this invention such as the pyrazoles, pyrroles, etc, were more water soluble than earlier analogs. For instance, one may compare the Log P values of SARDs from other templates, e.g., alkyl-amine 17, indoline 100 and indole 11, to the monocyclics of the invention (1001-1049).</p><p id="p-0564" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="441pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>In vitro screening of LBD binding (Ki), AR antagonism (IC50), SARD activity. and metabolic stability</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="126pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>SARD Activity</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>wtAR Binding (K<sub>i</sub></entry><entry>(% inh); Full Length</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(left))&#x26;</entry><entry>(left) and S.V.

level="1">Transactivation Assay</heading><p id="p-0566" num="0796">Methods: HEK-293 cells were transfected with the indicated receptors and GRE-LUC and CMV-<i>renilla </i>luc. Cells were treated 24 h after transfection and luciferase assay performed 48 h after transfection. The SARD compounds did not inhibit transactivation of receptors other than AR until 10 &#x3bc;M. The experimental method is described below.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0797">Human AR was cloned into a CMV vector backbone and was used for the transactivation study. HEK-293 cells were plated at 120,000 cells per well of a 24 well plate in DME+5% csFBS. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with 0.25 &#x3bc;g GRE-LUC, It 0.01 &#x3bc;g CMV-LUC (<i>renilla </i>luciferase) and 25 ng of the AR. The cells were treated 24 h after transfection and the luciferase assay performed 48 h after transfection. Transactivation results were based on measured luciferase light emissions and reported as relative light unit intensity (RLU). The assay was run in antagonist mode (IC<sub>50</sub>) using known agonist R1881 at its EC<sub>50 </sub>concentration of 0.1 nM and increasing concentrations of SARDs of this invention. Agonist mode data was reported qualitatively, e.g., partial agonist or an approximate EC<sub>50 </sub>for enobosarm, for some compounds in Table 1. Antagonist data are represented as IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM) obtained from four parameter logistics curve and are reported in Table 1 in the column labeled &#x2018;IC<sub>50</sub>&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0798">Results; Representative example graphs are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A</figref> (1002), <b>2</b>A (11 vs. 1002), <b>3</b>A (1003), <b>4</b>A (1004), <b>5</b>A (1005), <b>6</b>A (1006), <b>8</b>-<b>12</b> (1007-1011), and <b>13</b>A (1001) with results plotted as RLU reported on the y-axis and SARD concentration on the x-axis (nM). In these Figures, antagonist mode data was shown as curve fitted data, whereas agonist mode data (if present) is reported without curve fitting. Only weak and partial agonism was seen. In vivo pharmacodynamics demonstrate potent and highly efficacious antagonism of androgen dependent tissues (see Examples 7 and 10 herein), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a direct comparison of antagonism between 11 (closed dots) and 1002 (open dots). Other IC % values reported in Table 1 were calculated by the same method.</p><p id="p-0569" num="0799">1002 was a potent antagonist (199.36 nM; Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) with comparable inhibition as 11 (85.1 nM; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) which is an extremely potent indole SARD lacking oral bioavailability. Despite the 2-fold increased IC<sub>50 </sub>(Table 1) and lack of AR-LBD binding (see Example 4 and Table 1), 1002 was a more potent AR degrader in vitro (see Example 5 and Table 1), Further and unlike 11, 1002 was very stable in vitro in mouse (Table 1) and human liver microsomes (Table 2) which translated into improved in vivo pharmacodynamics (see Example 7 herein) in mice and rats. Based on the structural differences alone, the increased SARD activity in vitro and metabolic stability were each unexpected results. Likewise, the greatly improved in vivo efficacy could not have been predicted (i.e., was unexpected) based on structural differences alone. 1012, 1014, and 1017 also demonstrated improved metabolic stability in vitro suggesting that the pyrazole moiety may be responsible for the unexpected stability of 1002.</p><p id="p-0570" num="0800">As discussed below, 1002 and 1014 also demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in in vivo xenograft studies (see Examples 8 and 10), suggesting that the bioavailability of these compounds is sufficient for their intended uses.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0801">1004 (pyrrole) and 1006 (imidazole) demonstrated potent inhibition (178.77 nM and 148.94 nM; Table 1; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>6</b>A</figref>) but weak SARD activity, whereas 1005 and 1016 demonstrated weak inhibition but strong SARD activity, suggesting that in vitro inhibition is not well correlated with SARD activity. However, 1010 (pyrrole), 1012 (pyrazole), and 1014 (pyrazole) were potent inhibitors and degraders. In general, LBD binding or LBD-dependent inhibition and in vitro SARD activity seem to be separate but highly tolerant structure activity relationships. Values for other compounds of the invention are reported in Tables 1 and 2.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0802">Potent inhibition of transactivation was also seen for 1020 (192 nM), 1022 (92 nM), and 1024 (464 nM). 1020 is an R-isomer of pyrazole 1002, and like 1002, does not bind to the LBD yet has strong SARD activity. Similarly, the indole SARD 11 and the R-isomer of 11 have comparable SARD activities (Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) for AR-FL (LNCaP) and AR-SV (22RV1). This is in sharp contrast to propanamide SARMs such as enobosarm which typically have 100-fold lower LBD binding and agonist activity for R-isomers (data not shown). This is further evidence that SARD activity is not mediated through the LBD, as will be discussed in more detail in Example 9 below. Example 9 demonstrates a novel binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD), providing a basis for the distinct structure activity relationships from traditional AR antagonists that bind to the LBD and SARD of this invention which act through the NTD. The retention of SARD activity in opposite isomers (unlike SARMs) suggests that the NTD binding site does not require stereospecificity in its ligands. Further, the NTD binding site does not seem to require the chiral hydroxyl group which is conserved for LBD-binding (agonists and) antagonists. E.g., 1024 is a non-chiral propanamide racemate which lacks the hydroxyl but retains SARD activity (Table 1: 60% degradation of AR-FL) and the ability to inhibit the AR (Table 1: IC<sub>50</sub>=464 nM) despite not binding the LBD (Table 1: K<sub>i</sub>: no binding). Also, 1029 replaces the chiral center with a methylene group and yets retains some SARD activity (Table 1: 35% degradation of AR-FL) and AR antagonism (Table 1: IC<sub>50</sub>=2124 nM). 1032 has its hydroxyl group protected by acylation and and does not bind the LBD yet is an antagonist of AR. Another possible divergence in SAR's is the A-ring which is conserved for LBD binders as 4-cyano or nitro and 3-trifluoromethyl or 3-chloro. However, changing the CF<sub>3 </sub>of 1002 to the Cl of 1007 ablated SARD activity. Further, 1022 has a novel pyridine A-ring and does not bind to the LBD yet retains potent inhibition of transactivation (92 nM) and SARD activity (Table 1). Similarly. SARD activity is shown for 1037 and 1041 that contain pyridine A-rings (Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>C</figref>), and 1043 is a highly potent pyridine antagonist but weak SARD activity (Table 1). Further, 1037 is a 3-bromopropanamide (i.e., lacks a heterocyclic B-ring) which binds weakly to the LBD (4547 nM) but is a potent antagonist (350.5 nM) and retains SARD activity, demonstrating that the B-ring may not be necessary (Table 1) for SARDs of this invention. Such observations confirm that SARD activity can be optimized in the absence of LBD binding data and provide a rationale for the degradation of AR splice variants lacking the LBD.</p><heading id="h-0096" level="1">Example 4</heading><heading id="h-0097" level="1">Human Androgen Receptor (hAR) Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) Affinity Assay</heading><p id="p-0573" num="0803">Methods: hAR-LBD (633-919) was cloned into pGex4t.1.

The reduction in seminal vesicles weight, which is representative of androgen receptor (AR) antagonism, was more pronounced than that of the 20 mg/kg/day enzalutamide dose. 1002 was effective even in castrated mice, indicating that even any residual AR activity in castrated AR-target tissues was further inhibited by the potent activity of 1002 which bodes well for the abilities of SARDs of this invention to treat ADT-treated prostate cancer patients. This suggests that even though some weak partial AR agonism is observed in in vitro transactivation experiments, the predominant tone in vivo is AR antagonism. Further, in vivo activity at 40 mg/kg (40 mpk) for 1002 was a dramatic improvement over previously tested SARDs from our laboratory which typically only produced in vivo effects at 100 mg/kg or more despite comparable in vitro transcriptional inhibition potencies. This suggests the unexpected metabolic stability of 1002 translated into clinically significant oral bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0589" num="0819">The Hershberger experiments were repeated in rats since rats are known to be more sensitive models of androgenic and anabolic activities of AR agonists and antagonists.

After 13 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed and the weights of prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani were measured. 1002 at 40 mg/kg antagonized the weights of seminal vesicles, prostate and levator ani muscle to approximately the same extent as 20 mg/kg enzalutamide and 60 mg/kg 1002 further suppressed the weights of each of these tissues to near castration levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> shows the reductions in absolute organ weights in intact rats and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> represents the same data of % inhibition relative to vehicle treated control.

Correspondingly, the unexpectedly superior in vivo antagonism of 1002 compared to enzalutamide (the IND of enzalutamide indicated that 100 mpk and 30 mpk had comparable in vivo efficacy, so the 20 mpk dose presumably was near E<sub>max </sub>and was barely soluble) is not explainable in terms of conventional inhibition of the AR through the LBD but rather suggests that the AR antagonism is attributable to the potent degradation of the AR which is a unique property to compounds of this invention.</p><p id="p-0590" num="0820">See also Example 9 for multiple biophysical lines of evidence supporting NTD binding of 1002 and other SARDs of this invention.

The tissues were minced finely and treated with collagenase for 2 h. The digested tissues were washed with serum-free medium and implanted as 1 mm<sup>3 </sup>fragments subcutaneously in female Nod Scid Gamma (NSG) mice. Two such PDX from triple-negative patients (TNBC), HBrT-1071 and HBrT-1361, characterized as TNBC at the time of collection, were implanted in ovariectonized mice. All animal studies were conducted under the UTHSC Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) approved protocols, Female NSG mice (6-8 weeks old) purchased from JAX labs (Bar Harbor, Me.) were housed as five animals per cage and were allowed free access to water and commercial rodent chow (Harlan Teklad 2215 rodent diet-8640).

This observation helps to rationalize why 1002, an NTD-binding SARD (see Example 9 below for biophysical evidence of NTD binding), was able to inhibit tumor growth whereas the LBD-dependent AR antagonist enzalutamide failed. This suggests that SARDs are able to inhibit AR splice variant dependent cancers such as TNBC and advanced prostate cancers (see Example 10), e.g, those expressing AR-V7 or other AR's lacking the LBD, Further, this is confirmation that the unexpected oral bioavailability of 1002 and other SARDs of this invention, e.g. 1014 and 1010, allowed serum and tumor (see also Example 10) levels following oral administration to be sufficient for treatment of advanced and refractory AR-dependent cancers.</p><heading id="h-0107" level="1">Example 9</heading><heading id="h-0108" level="1">SARDs Bind to AF-1 Region of the N-Terminal Domain (NTD) of the Androgen Receptor</heading><p id="p-0593" num="0823">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR): AF-1 and various fragments of AF-1 were cloned in pGex4t.1 and pGex6p.1 vectors.

As opposed to other biophysical methods, it is easier to use one dimension NMR to observe changes in line-width or line broadening as a high-throughput method to identify the binding of the molecules to proteins and then use Water ligand-observed spectroscopy (WaterLOGSY) or Saturation-Transfer Difference (STD) NMR as confirmatory methodologies. These experiments are based on the fact that NMR observables such as linewidths and NOEs vary dramatically between small molecules and large molecules. The decreased rotational correlation times upon binding of a small molecule ligand to a heavy target molecule produces an atypical heavy molecule NMR result characterized by broadening and weakening of ligand peaks in <sup>1</sup>H NMR and negative NOE peaks in the waterLOGSY as compared to the free state. In the absence of any affinity, the small molecule NMR result is obtained (sharp peaks in <sup>1</sup>H NMR and positive NOEs) even in the presence of target protein.

While 1002 alone exhibited sharp peaks revealing the ligand present in the free state, 1002 in combination with AF-1 provided broad, diffused, and shorter ligand peaks revealing that 1002 has affinity for AF-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). To further confirm the 1D NMR results, we performed WaterLOGSY with 1002 alone or in combination with AF-1. While the 1002 alone gave a flattened positive signal, 1002 in combination with AF-1 provided a negative signal, characteristic of binding to the protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>).

This suggested that significant in vivo bioavailabilities may be possible for 1002 and 1014.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="210pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Liver microsomes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>MLM/RLM</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="210pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>t<sub>1/2</sub></entry><entry>CL<sub>int</sub></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(min)</entry><entry>(&#x3bc;L/min/mg)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="210pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1002</entry><entry>77.96</entry><entry>0.89</entry></row><row><entry>1014</entry><entry>infinity</entry><entry>~0</entry></row><row><entry>96</entry><entry>54.44</entry><entry>12.73</entry></row><row><entry>(S)-N-(4-Cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(4-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indazol-1-yl)propanamide</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>1010</entry><entry>17.93</entry><entry>38.66</entry></row><row><entry>36</entry><entry>11.77</entry><entry>58.8</entry></row><row><entry>(S)-N-(3-Chloro-4-cyanophenyl)-3-(4-fluoro-1H-indol-1-yl)-2 hydroxy-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>2-methylpropanamide</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>34</entry><entry>15.50</entry><entry>58.87</entry></row><row><entry>(S)-N-(3-Chloro-4-cyanophenyl)-3-(5-fluoro-6-phenyl-1H-indol-1-yl)-2-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>11</entry><entry>14.35</entry><entry>48.30</entry></row><row><entry>(S)-N-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(5-fluoro-1H-indol-1-yl)-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>103</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>46.22</entry></row><row><entry>(S)-N-(3-Chloro-4-cyanophenyl)-3-(4-fluoroindolin-1-yl)-2-hydroxy-2-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>methylpropanamide</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>1022</entry><entry>58.06</entry><entry>11.94</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0614" num="0842">In Vivo Characteristics:</p><p id="p-0615" num="0843">1014 drug concentrations in serum and tumor in a xenograft experiment: Nude mice implanted with 22RV1 cells subcutaneously were randoinized when the tumors reached between 100 and 200 mm<sup>3</sup>. The mice were treated with vehicle (20:80 water:PEG-400) or 60 mg/kg/day 1014 (or indicated doses of other SARDs) in vehicle for 21 days. At the end of 21 days, the mice were sacrificed and blood and tumors were collected for further analysis. Measurement of drug concentration in animals treated with 1014 demonstrated a significant accumulation of the drug in serum (20.1 &#x3bc;M) and tumor (35.6 &#x3bc;M) (Table 4 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>) compared to other molecules tested in parallel in the same experiment. These in vivo levels for 1014, even in view of structurally similar pyrazoles 1002 and 1012, was unexpected. Further, these levels help to explain the efficacy in LNCaP-EnzR xenografts (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> and its description below). Although 22RV1 tumors were not susceptible to SARDs in this particular experiment, likely due to androgen independent growth, this result suggests that androgen-dependent tumors, e.g., LNCaP-EnzR, would be susceptible. Another observation from these data is that tumor concentrations were in excess of serum concentrations, suggesting accumulation of drug in the tumor.

At the end of 14 days, the mice were sacrificed and seminal vesicles were weighed. 1014 demonstrated the best inhibition of seminal vesicles weight compared to other compounds, following by 1002, suggesting that these orally administered SARDs were present in levels sufficient to antagonize the AR in androgen-dependent tissues of intact animals.

Once the tumors reached 100-200 mm<sup>3</sup>, the animals were randomized and were treated with vehicle (20:80 water:PEG-300) or 1014 (60 mg/kg/day) in vehicle. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed, tumors isolated, weighed, and stored for further analysis. The experiment was performed twice with two different batches of cells and the results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. Results: In two separate experiments, 1014 was able attain high efficacy tumor growth inhibition, reducing tumor volumes by approximately 60-70% compared to vehicle treated animals. These results suggest that 1014 and other SARDs of this invention administered orally were capable of therapeutic efficacy in enzalutamide resistant (i.e., advanced and refractory) prostate cancers.</p><p id="p-0619" num="0846">Conclusion: All these results indicate that 1014 has unexpected properties due to its slow metabolism and tumor accumulation. Although, 1014 structurally is comparable to 1002, only differing slightly in the substitution with a CF<sub>3 </sub>in the third position of the pyrazole ring (vs. 4-fluoro for 1002), it is extremely resistant to metabolism by liver microsomes and thereby has significant accumulation in serum, androgen dependent organs, and in tumors which is unexpected in view of other SARDs tested and in the prior art. This allowed for unexpected in vivo efficacies following oral administration, such as pharmacodynamics (Hershberger assay demonstrated most efficacious seminal vesicles weight effect seen with a SARD) and xenograft tumor growth inhibition (LNCaP-EnzR xenograft), that would not have been possible with our earlier reported SARD templates such as 11,100, and 17, or other SARDs known in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0115" level="1">Example 11</heading><heading id="h-0116" level="1">SARDs Antagonize F876L</heading><p id="p-0620" num="0847"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-<b>29</b>C</figref> illustrate that SARDs antagonized F876L AR at doses comparable to the wildtype AR and do not have any intrinsic agonist activity in F876L, showing their ability to overcome enzalutamide resistance.

Chimeric constructs were created in which the AR and GR were cloned such that the entire sequence was AR or GR, or the N-terminal domain was derived from AR but the DNA binding and ligand binding domains were derived from GR (AGG) or vice versa (GAA). Several lines of evidence summarized below suggested either NTD binding and/or dependence upon NTD for SARD activity. Further to that line of reasoning, the SARD 1002 was tested for its ability to degrade the AR, GR. AGG or GAA constructs as a way to demonstrate that AR NTD was required in order for the SARD to degrade the protein (i.e., demonstrate NTD-dependence).

Example 8 discusses the ability of 1002 to inhibit SV-driven growth (i.e., FL AR is not expressed) of TNBC xenografts with SARD 1002, suggesting NTD binding.
