Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to masks for use in delivering a flow of a breathing gas to an airway of a patient, and, more particularly, to the headgear of such masks that are used to secure the patient interfaces, also of such masks, to the head of a patient. Even more particularly, the present invention pertains to arrangements for use in such headgear that manages/positions one or more ends of the straps of such headgear in a predictable manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many individuals suffer from disordered breathing during sleep. Sleep apnea is a common example of such sleep disordered breathing suffered by millions of people throughout the world. One type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is a condition in which sleep is repeatedly interrupted by an inability to breathe due to an obstruction of the airway; typically the upper airway or pharyngeal area. Obstruction of the airway is generally believed to be due, at least in part, to a general relaxation of the muscles which stabilize the upper airway segment, thereby allowing the tissues to collapse the airway. Another type of sleep apnea syndrome is a central apnea, which is a cessation of respiration due to the absence of respiratory signals from the brain's respiratory center. An apnea condition, whether obstructive, central, or mixed, which is a combination of obstructive and central, is defined as the complete or near cessation of breathing, for example a 90% or greater reduction in peak respiratory air-flow.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Those afflicted with sleep apnea experience sleep fragmentation and complete or nearly complete cessation of ventilation intermittently during sleep with potentially severe degrees of oxyhemoglobin desaturation. These symptoms may be translated clinically into extreme daytime sleepiness, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary-artery hypertension, congestive heart failure and/or cognitive dysfunction. Other consequences of sleep apnea include right ventricular dysfunction, carbon dioxide retention during wakefulness, as well as during sleep, and continuous reduced arterial oxygen tension. Sleep apnea sufferers may be at risk for excessive mortality from these factors as well as by an elevated risk for accidents while driving and/or operating potentially dangerous equipment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Even if a patient does not suffer from a complete or nearly complete obstruction of the airway, it is also known that adverse effects, such as arousals from sleep, can occur when there is only a partial obstruction of the airway. Partial obstruction of the airway typically results in shallow breathing referred to as a hypopnea. A hypopnea is typically defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the peak respiratory air-flow. Other types of sleep disordered breathing include, without limitation, upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) and vibration of the airway, such as vibration of the pharyngeal wall, commonly referred to as snoring.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is well known to treat sleep disordered breathing by applying a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) to the patient's airway. This positive pressure effectively &#x201c;splints&#x201d; the airway, thereby maintaining an open passage to the lungs. It is also known to provide a positive pressure therapy in which the pressure of gas delivered to the patient varies with the patient's breathing cycle, or varies with the patient's breathing effort, to increase the comfort to the patient. This pressure support technique is referred to as bi-level pressure support, in which the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) delivered to the patient is higher than the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). It is further known to provide a positive pressure therapy in which the pressure is automatically adjusted based on the detected conditions of the patient, such as whether the patient is experiencing an apnea and/or hypopnea. This pressure support technique is referred to as an auto-titration type of pressure support, because the pressure support device seeks to provide a pressure to the patient that is only as high as necessary to treat the disordered breathing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pressure support therapies as just described involve the placement of a patient interface including a mask component having a soft, flexible sealing cushion on the face of the patient. The mask component may be, without limitation, a nasal pillow mask, a nasal mask that covers the patient's nose, a nasal/oral mask that covers the patient's nose and mouth, or a full face mask that covers the patient's face. The patient interface is connected to a gas delivery tube or conduit and interfaces the pressure support device with the airway of the patient, so that a flow of breathing gas can be delivered from the pressure/flow generating device to the airway of the patient via the patient interface. Such patient interfaces may also employ other patient contacting components, such as forehead supports, cheek pads and chin pads.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The patient interface is typically secured to the patient's head by a headgear component, typically referred to simply as headgear. The headgear serves not only to secure the patient interface to the patient's head but also serves to provide stability to the patient interface, as instability of the patient interface can result in leaks and discomfort to the patient. Although the function of headgear in providing stability to the patient interface is vital, the position of headgear by nature lends itself to several usability issues. When removing headgear with more than one strap (e.g., upper strap(s) and lower strap(s)), the lower headgear strap(s) will often fall behind a user's shoulder and back due to the force of gravity. While this movement of the lower strap(s) upon headgear detachment allows for the CPAP system to be easily removed, the specific location of the fallen strap(s) introduces problems for many users, especially those with limited upper body mobility who may not possess the range of motion required to reach free-hanging headgear straps that often fall in the area between a user's shoulder blades. Additionally, the free-hanging location of bottom headgear straps upon detachment from a CPAP mask is often outside of a user's direct field of vision, which can make locating such straps time-consuming and frustrating for the user. Further, the falling movement of two bottom headgear straps following detachment from a CPAP mask in combination with their proximity when unmanaged and free-hanging creates an ideal environment for strap entanglement.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention improve upon known arrangements and address shortcomings such as previously described by creating a location to which lower headgear straps of a headgear are located upon detachment from the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As one aspect of the present invention a headgear arrangement for use in securing a patient interface to the head of a patient is provided.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;number&#x201d; shall mean one or an integer greater than one (i.e., a plurality).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a &#x201c;coupling assembly&#x201d; includes two or more couplings or coupling components. The components of a coupling or coupling assembly are generally not part of the same element or other component. As such the components of a &#x201c;coupling assembly&#x201d; may not be described at the same time in the following description.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, a &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; is one element of a coupling assembly. That is, a coupling assembly includes at least two components, or coupling components, that are structured to be coupled together. It is understood that the elements of a coupling assembly are compatible with each other.

Thus, an opening which &#x201c;corresponds&#x201d; to a member is sized slightly larger than the member so that the member may pass through the opening with a minimum amount of friction. This definition is modified if the two components are said to fit &#x201c;snugly&#x201d; together or &#x201c;snuggly correspond.&#x201d; In that situation, the difference between the size of the components is even smaller whereby the amount of friction increases. If the element defining the opening and/or the component inserted into the opening is/are made from a deformable or compressible material, the opening may even be slightly smaller than the component being inserted into the opening. This definition is further modified if the two components are said to &#x201c;substantially correspond.&#x201d; &#x201c;Substantially correspond&#x201d; means that the size of the opening is very close to the size of the element inserted therein. That is, not so close as to cause substantial friction, as with a snug fit, but with more contact and friction than a &#x201c;corresponding fit,&#x201d; i.e. a &#x201c;slightly larger&#x201d; fit.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A respiratory interface system <b>2</b> adapted to provide a regimen of respiratory therapy to a user/patient P is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

Meanwhile, headgear arrangement <b>12</b>&#x2032; also includes a pair of lower straps <b>14</b> (only the right side is shown) that are positioned and selectively directly coupled to patient interface <b>10</b>&#x2032; in a similar manner as lower straps <b>14</b> of headgear <b>12</b> previously discussed in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As previously discussed in the Background section, a problem with lower strap members <b>14</b> of a headgear arrangement such as either of headgear arrangements <b>12</b> or <b>12</b>&#x2032; (as well as any other headgear arrangement having similar lower straps) is that upon uncoupling from the associated patient interface, each free end <b>18</b> of each lower strap member <b>14</b> will often fall behind a user's shoulder and back, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>B</figref>, due to the force of gravity, which can be problematic for a user in several ways. For example, users with limited upper body mobility may not possess the range of motion required to reach the free-hanging lower headgear straps <b>14</b> in such location. Additionally, such location is generally out of the user's field of view, thus adding to the frustration of locating and grasping lower headgear straps <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present invention address such problems caused by uncoupled lower headgear straps <b>14</b> by providing strap management arrangements that locate/place free ends <b>18</b> of the uncoupled lower headgear straps <b>14</b> in known areas that are readily and conveniently accessible to a user. One approach in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention locate/hold free ends <b>18</b> of lower headgear straps <b>14</b> in strap management locations A (shown as a dashed circle), such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, with a strap management location A located on each side (i.e., the left and right sides) of the patient's head (only location A on the right side of the head of patient P is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, it is to be appreciated that the left side that is not shown is generally symmetrical to the right side as shown and thus not described in further details herein).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When located in each location A, free end <b>18</b> of each lower headgear strap <b>14</b> is readily accessible to patient P for grasping and reattaching to patient interface <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; when adorning mask <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>&#x2032; and securing patient interface <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; thereof to their face for receiving treatment. Strap management locations A are toward the front of the patient's head, forward of each ear of the patient. In some example embodiments of the present invention, each strap management location A is within close proximity to the patient's cheek, preferably on or within one inch thereof. By locating each free end <b>18</b> of each lower headgear strap <b>14</b> in a defined strap management location A, each free end <b>18</b> is much more readily accessible and within a user's field of vision. Hence, the time needed and frustration involved with locating free ends <b>18</b> of lower headgear straps <b>14</b> for reattachment to patient interface <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; is greatly reduced. Further, the creation of separate strap management locations A for the management of free end <b>18</b> of each lower headgear strap <b>14</b> eliminates the various problems that users currently face concerning headgear entanglement as the falling movement of two lower headgear straps <b>14</b> following detachment from patient interface <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; in combination with their proximity when unmanaged and free-hanging creates an ideal environment for strap entanglement.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For bottom headgear straps <b>14</b> that utilize Velcro technology in their adjustability features, the implementation of separate strap management locations reduces the chances for the Velcro systems of the two straps to merge. Keeping the Velcro system of each strap separate ensures the simplest and fastest experience for when a user goes to reattach their headgear to their patient interface. For bottom headgear straps <b>14</b> that utilize magnets in their connection to a patient interface, the implementation of separate strap management locations reduces the chances for the two straps' magnetic systems to merge. Preventing this magnetic attraction between both bottom headgear straps <b>14</b> allows users to more easily distinguish the left from right straps for eventual reattachment to their patient interface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, masks <b>108</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>508</b> in accordance with some example embodiments of the present invention are each shown positioned on a head of a patient P.
