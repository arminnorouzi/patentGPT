Embodiments also relate to reliability prediction models.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The reliability of electrical hardware can be predicted based on some standards (e.g., MIL217) and prediction models, which in-turn can make use of proven failure modes and the failure rate of components used at specific environmental conditions. These predictions are helpful for the comparative performance benchmarking of products, since predictions are typically made for standard conditions. These models are not intended to provide actual real-life health information of hardware at runtime in the field where the subsystems may be undergoing various stresses, which may be far different from standard conditions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In practice the environmental conditions at which each component of hardware operates may be different. Electrical stresses may vary, along with the operating duties and environmental parameters in which a hardware device and its electrical components may operate. For example, consider the case of two units of a given sensor type, with one sensor exposed to 70&#xb0; C. and the other sensor to 20&#xb0; C. The first sensor may fail faster than the second sensor. Generally, the failure rate of electrical devices may depend on the ambient temperature to which the electrical devices may be exposed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, tools do not exist that adequately address reliability reporting for hardware such as sensors, battery energy storage systems, and other types of electrical hardware devices. Tools are not available, for example, which can provide a live reliability dashboard for a customer displaying the health conditions of hardware, the rate at which each unit is degrading in its &#x2018;health&#x2019;, and a predicted end-of-life (EOL) of given hardware based on the &#x2018;real&#x2019; stress in field. Tools are also not available, which can provide a dashboard for an end user that displays the stress levels associated with electrical hardware and storage systems at run-time or near run-time. Tools are also not available which can provide reliability conditions for given hardware based on the field conditions and the real stress this hardware may have experienced during its tenure in the field. Furthermore, tools are not available, which can provide a customer or a user with information regarding the hardware health condition, which in turn may improve the preparedness of the maintenance team and reduce down time by proactively replacing parts, which may be close to failure, and ensuring that spare parts may be in stock for parts which may be nearing failure, etc.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the features of the disclosed embodiments and is not intended to be a full description.

For example, terms such as &#x201c;and,&#x201d; &#x201c;or,&#x201d; or &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as used herein may include a variety of meanings that may depend, at least in part, upon the context in which such terms are used.

In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x2018;run-time&#x2019;, &#x2018;run time&#x2019;, or &#x2018;runtime&#x2019; can relate to a device or system or process that operates in real time or close to real time, and which can implement a live calculation of reliability rather than an off-line calculation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x2018;hardware&#x2019; can relate to the physical components of a system including electrical components and other electronic components such as, for example, batteries. Examples of &#x2018;hardware&#x2019; can include electrical hardware such as a BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), and process control hardware. The term &#x2018;hardware&#x2019; may also relate to an &#x2018;electrical hardware system&#x2019; and components such as semiconductor hardware, switch gears, fuses, battery storage systems, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An embodiment can be implemented in the context of electrical hardware such as a BESS (Battery Energy Storage System). It should be appreciated that the discussion here regarding a BESS is presented for general illustrative and exemplary purposes only and should not be considered a limiting feature of the embodiments. That is, the disclosed approach can be used for other types of electrical hardware, such as, for example, various types of sensors, and other electrical systems, particular in the context of industrial automation and &#x2018;in the field&#x2019; operations such as in industrial processing facilities. The disclosed embodiments are thus not limited to BESS applications. BESS applications and systems are discussed herein, in the context of a use case or an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A BESS can collect and process several physical as well as electrical parameters related to ESS (Energy Storage System) hardware and cells, which can be critical for reliability calculations of the BESS. Below are some of the parameters, which can be considered.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Ambient Temperature. Most BESS hardware can be provided with temperature probes wherein the ambient temperature data measured by such temperature probes can be available for system software. Example BESS hardware may include battery racks, a system cabinet, etc. Generally, a BESS can include a battery management system, which can collect cell level temperature data during operations. Once the ambient temperature is known, the possible local ambient temperature experienced by each subsystem can be calculated (or in some cases it may be possible to measure local ambient&#x2014;example cells). With this information, the possible ambient temperature experienced by each sub-component, for example, can be calculated. This may be critical information. In case more accurate temperature measurements may be necessary, we can insist that the customer or user provide more than one temperature probe, for example, where necessary.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain cases, the rate of change of temperature may be critical information for use with reliability and failure mode calculations. For example, if there is a quick ramp-up or ramp-down of temperature, solder joints may become stressed at a much higher level than a steady High&#x2032; temperature.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Operating Duty and Electrical Stress. A number of ESS sub-systems may possess real-time information regarding the operating duty and electrical stress experienced by the ESS and its various components and sub-systems. In some cases, this information may need to be derived based on available information. Based on this information, exact power dissipation and stress levels on each of the critical subsystem in a given unit can be calculated. Thus, data indicative of operating duty and electrical stress can be critical for reliability calculations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Active/Standby State of Hardware. Some subsystems of a BESS may be in active/passive standby at run-time in a BESS. For example, one unit out of four HVAC units may be in stand-by during normal operations. This information may helpful for use in generating generate a health state and de-ratings applicable for various subsystems of the BESS or other components, such as the aforementioned HVAC units.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">BESS Charging/Discharging Profiles. This information can be critical when it comes to BESS battery life and related reliability calculations. Monitoring and recording of cell charging/discharging profiles, SOC &#x26; SOH information, any specific instance of deep charging/discharging, any overheating of cells, etc can be critical information, which can contribute to cell life estimation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">MIL217. The acronym &#x2018;MIL217&#x2019; refers to a reliability prediction standard and/or a model. MIL217 has been used by both commercial companies and the defense industry, and contains failure rate models for numerous electronic components such as integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, relays, switches, connectors and so on. Reliability predictions are an important tool for making design trade-off decisions and estimating future system reliability. They are often used for making initial product support decisions such as how many spares are required to support fielded systems. Inaccurate predictions can lead to overly conservative designs and/or excessive spare parts procurement resulting in additional life cycle cost (LCC).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other Parameters. Additional information may be needed for a more accurate calculation of reliability parameters. That is, some additional information can be fetched without adding too much to the cost to the cabinets. An example of such additional information may include data derived from a humidity sensor at the cabinet level. In this case, relative humidity data collected from a humidity sensor can be used as additional information for calculating the stress on subsystems. Other additional information can include power supply output voltage levels. The voltage readings and related variations can be a source of helpful information. Vibration data collected from a vibration sensor can also be a source of additional information. Vibration data is useful for sensing cabinet-level vibration. Shock and vibration data can be contribute, for example, to the reliability calculations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once these parameters are gathered from each subsystem, in soft-real time mode (or even by periodic fetch), this information can be used to calculate the practical stress levels in each of the electrical hardware, cable joints, cells and so on. Based on the real stress parameters, corrections can be applied to the predicted reliability profile (e.g., MIL217) and provide the customer with reliability data, which can be more accurate considering a practical field scenario for each hardware subsystem. Apart from run-time stress data, the stress experienced by hardware during factory test in production, transportation and shipment, etc., also can be accounted so that the calculations can be more accurate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a system <b>100</b> for run-time reliability reporting for electrical hardware (e.g., BESS hardware), in accordance with an embodiment.
