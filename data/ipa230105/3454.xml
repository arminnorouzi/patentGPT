Conventionally, an engine cooling system of a vehicle includes a heat exchanger in the form of a radiator to facilitate coding of an engine of the vehicle. Further, Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system of the vehicle also includes another heat exchanger such as for example, a condenser, The radiator and the condenser are disposed at the front of the vehicle, so that air impinges on and passes through the radiator and the condenser arranged parallel to each other, as the vehicle traverses in a forward direction. The sequence in which the radiator and the condenser or any other heat exchanger are disposed may vary, for example, sometimes the radiator is at the front to first receive the air and in other cases the condenser is at the front to first receive the air. The position of the radiator and the condenser configuring a radiator-condenser assembly can interchange. However, considering packaging, serviceability, pricing and other factors, the radiator and the condenser of the radiator-condenser assembly are arranged to attain a compact configuration, reduced number of fixation points, reduced interface size and achieve proper routing of the fluid flow lines for minimum flow and pressure losses. Often, with use of jumper lines, more fixation points, longer fluid flow lines and larger connector interface size, the packaging of the heat exchange assembly in a confined space becomes complicated and the overall cost of the heat exchanger assembly increases.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In case of a conventional heat exchanger assembly, such as for example, a radiator-condenser assembly <b>01</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a radiator <b>10</b> and a condenser <b>20</b> are arranged sequentially parallel to each other. The condenser <b>20</b> includes inlet and outlet blocks <b>2</b><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b </i>configured on at least one manifold thereof, also simply referred to as at least one condenser manifold <b>24</b>. The inlet and outlet blocks <b>2</b><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b </i>are connected to heat exchange fluid flow lines, particularly, refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b> and deliver vapour refrigerant to and collects condensed refrigerant from the at least one condenser manifold <b>24</b>, i.e. performs fluid connection function. The at least one condenser manifold <b>24</b> in turn distributes vapour refrigerant to the condenser core <b>22</b> and collects condensed refrigerant from the condenser core <b>22</b>. The radiator-condenser assembly <b>01</b> further includes separate brackets <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>4</b><i>b </i>for mounting or fixing the condenser <b>20</b> over the radiator <b>10</b>. One end of each bracket <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>4</b><i>b </i>is secured to the at least one condenser manifold <b>24</b> while the other end of each bracket <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>4</b><i>b </i>is secured to at least one radiator tank <b>14</b>. Such configuration of using separate dedicated elements, particularly, inlet and outlet blocks <b>2</b><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b </i>for fluid connection function and brackets <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>4</b><i>b </i>for fixing function, increases the total number of parts, increases inventory and inventory costs, overall size of the assembly, assembly time and efforts and reduces reliability. Further, such configuration increases assembly time. Also, in case the condenser <b>20</b> is disposed downstream of the radiator <b>10</b> and the refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b> are emanating from upstream of the radiator <b>10</b> in the direction of air depicted by arrow R, the refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b> are required to go around the at least one radiator tank <b>14</b> to reach the at least one condenser manifold <b>24</b>. Such configuration, increases bends along the refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b> and overall length of the refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b>, thereby causing pressure losses in the refrigerant flow lines <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a heat exchanger assembly, particularly, a radiator-condenser assembly that involves comparatively fewer fixation points and reduced interface size. Further, there is a need for a radiator-condenser assembly that is compact in configuration. Furthermore, there is a need for a radiator-condenser assembly that achieves proper routing of the refrigerant flow lines such that the number of bends along the refrigerant flow lines and length of the refrigerant flow lines is reduced. Still further, there is a need for a radiator-condenser assembly that prevents or reduces pressure losses due to longer refrigerant flow lines or refrigerant flow lines following torturous path. Further, there is a need for a radiator -condenser assembly that provides better serviceability while still addressing packaging issues. Furthermore, there is a need for a radiator-condenser assembly that involves fewer parts, reduced inventory and inventory costs, reduced assembly efforts and assembly time as compared to conventional radiator-condenser assembly and exhibits improved reliability as compared to conventional radiator-condenser assembly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a heat exchanger assembly, particularly, a radiator-condenser assembly that obviates drawbacks associated with the conventional radiator-condenser assembly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that involves comparatively fewer fixation points and reduced interface size.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that is of compact configuration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that achieves proper routing of the refrigerant flow lines such that the length of and bends along the refrigerant flow lines is reduced and pressure losses due to longer refrigerant flow lines or refrigerant flow lines following torturous path is reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that provides better serviceability while still addressing packaging issues.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that involves fewer parts, reduced inventory, inventory costs, reduced assembly efforts and assembly time as compared to conventional radiator-condenser assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a radiator-condenser assembly that exhibits improved reliability as compared to conventional radiator-condenser assembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present description, some elements or parameters may be indexed, such as a first element and a second element.
