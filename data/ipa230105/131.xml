The first coating is a sanitizer in one embodiment, and the second treatment may include mineral salts, or buffering agents. In yet another embodiment, essential oils are used to inhibit microbes while improving flavor and aroma. While this patent publication is a step forth in the art of food preservation, it does not teach the use of natural coatings to preserve smokable products, or the use of coating that provide aesthetic features. Light, including ultraviolet light, can oxidize materials. This publication fails to teach the creation and application of crystalline substances to reflect light to improve shelf life.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Korean Patent No. KR101396784B1 teaches a way to preserve dried flowers using a mixture of a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate.

For example, the tobacco is tumbled and sprayed with diammonium phosphate, glucose and water. Then it is dried and heated to between 310&#xb0; F. and 320&#xb0; F. This process yields a roasted, sweet and chocolate-like flavor with fruity notes. The use of between 0.1 mg to 25 mg per cigarette is expressed. In five (5) lbs of tobacco, about 301 grams of the sprayed treatment solution is used in one example.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Coating with diammonium phosphate and a simple sugar may improve flavor for some smokable plants. However, many in the natural products community may try to limit the consumption of additives that don't arise from the consumable plant material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Notwithstanding the technology discussed above, which is intended to provide a broad background only, there is still a need to preserve plants, such as herbs, so that it can be safely steeped into a tea, smoked, mixed with foods, or otherwise ingested by humans or mammals. The technology discussed above also fails to teach that the bioactivity of the plant material can be enhanced with a coating.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is desired is a way of protecting smokable herbal flowers and biomass that is easy to handle, is not sticky to enable grinding, has a superior shelf life, and has visual aesthetic appeal.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention includes herbage having a reflective coating that sparkles and improves herbage shelf life. The herbage is dried. Preferably the dried herbage has a moisture content of between 4-15%, and preferably a moisture content of between 7-12%. The herbage has trimmed flowers that form agglomerated flowers having an initial shape. The shape is preserved by the present invention to improve shelf life from a mechanical perspective.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to improve shelf life from a mechanical perspective, to create a moisture barrier, to inhibit volatilization of volatile components, and to inhibit oxidation due to light and air, a first coating of a first <i>Cannabis </i>plant extract is applied to the herbage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first coating includes at least 60%-98% Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and preferably greater than 90% THC. Between 2-40% of the first coating may include various other plant-derived components. These plant-derived components include classical and non-classical cannabinoids, terpenes, plant flavonoids, lipids, and other components derived from the <i>Cannabis </i>plant. It can be appreciated that plant components from other plants is included, including essential oils of citrus, lavender or any botanical essential oil. The selected concentration of THC is important so that the THC can form a glass like, hardened coating that is grindable in a mechanical grinder, is non-sticky at room temperature, holds the shape of the <i>Cannabis </i>flower or other herbage, and that enables ready adherence to subsequent coatings.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">THC is decarboxylated and easily forms a hardened layer on the dried herbage to mechanically preserve the shape of the herbage, the hardened surface enables handling and grinding of the herbage without sticking at room temperature. The term non-sticky, or &#x201c;without sticking&#x201d; are relative terms and phrases that mean: less sticky than traditional <i>Cannabis </i>essential oil. <i>Cannabis </i>essential oil is a whole plant extract typically having greater than 60% THC content. This traditional <i>Cannabis </i>essential oil is sometimes commonly termed &#x201c;Rick Simpson Oil&#x201d; and it is quite sticky to handle, even after application to a <i>Cannabis </i>flower.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention includes a second coating of a second <i>Cannabis </i>plant extract applied over the first coating and adhering thereto. The second coating including at least 90-99% Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa), which is not decarboxylated. THCa is well known to form crystals. The crystals are embedded in the first coating to improve aesthetics by reflecting light. When displayed in a merchandising display including transparent glass jars, the present invention makes the <i>Cannabis </i>flower visually attractive compared to competing <i>Cannabis </i>flowers lacking any coating that may also be presented for merchandising purposes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention enables cooperation between the first coating and the second coating to both seal the <i>Cannabis </i>flower, preserve its shape, and also to improve shelf life by reducing absorption of light by the <i>Cannabis </i>flower or other herbage. In particular the crystals reflect some light and absorb some light to inhibit penetration of visible light and ultraviolet (UV) light onto the <i>Cannabis </i>flower or herbage.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, the crystals of the second coating and the hardened surface of the first coating cooperate to enable handling, storage, and processing of the herbage without a sticky mess, and while maximizing shelf life. The aesthetics of presenting the herbage or <i>Cannabis </i>flower with sparkling crystals makes it attractive to the eye of a prospective purchaser.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention also amplifies the bio-effect of the <i>Cannabis </i>flower by concentrating THC and other cannabinoids. The combined coatings are in a particular ratio to the herbage, the ratio is between 1:4 and 2:1 on a weight to weight basis to optimally cause the herbage sparkle to improve the shelf life. This ratio also enables a consistent burn for smoking the herbage. This consistent burn enables using the present invention in a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette, pipe, or other smoking device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ratio of the combined coatings to the herbage or <i>Cannabis </i>flower, also preserve the <i>Cannabis </i>flower shape, inhibit oxidation, create an effective humidity barrier, function as an anti-microbial or anti-fungal agent to maximize shelf life.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Testing by the inventor hereof clearly demonstrates that the shelf life of a coated <i>Cannabis </i>flower is enhanced as compared to uncoated <i>Cannabis </i>flowers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, <i>Cannabis </i>flower is ground to a desired particle size to form a smokable product, and the crystals are visible in the ground <i>Cannabis </i>flower. Preferably, the crystals have an average grain size of less than 2.0 millimeters in diameter and greater than 0.1 millimeters in diameter.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the ground herbage is packaged in rolling paper to form a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette. In one embodiment, the rolling paper is transparent to reveal the crystals through the rolling paper.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet another embodiment, the ground herbage is packaged in rolling paper to form a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette having an open end, the crystals are visible at the open end to create aesthetic appeal and to block UV light that may have penetrated the rolling paper. The <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette can have two open ends where the crystals are visible at both of the two open ends.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Enhancing the aesthetic appeal, the <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette can have the open end coated with the first coating and the second coating in addition to having the enclosed herbage being coating with the coatings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the rolling paper is impregnated with the crystals to inhibit ultraviolet degradation of the ground herbage within the rolling paper, and to sparkle. Such can indicate that the herbage is also coated with sparkling crystals if viewed. Where the rolling paper is impregnated with the crystals, the crystals inhibit ultraviolet degradation of the ground herbage within the rolling paper. Preferably these crystals impregnating the rolling paper have an average particle size diameter of less than 0.3 mm, which is smaller than the crystals coating the herbage. It can be appreciated that the herbage can also be mixed with crystals in embodiments including the use of rolling paper that can hold the crystals with the herbage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention also envisions that the herbage is <i>Cannabis </i>flower in the form of trimmed buds packaged in a transparent glass jar, or jars. The glass jars are presented in a merchandising display to bring attention to the crystals that reflect incident light. The herbage can also be packaged in a transparent bag.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments of the invention, the crystals can be designed to mimic naturally occurring trichomes that coat a <i>Cannabis </i>flower during cultivation, but that usually fall off when the <i>Cannabis </i>flower is dried and trimmed. Since naturally occurring trichomes have crystals of between 0.05 to 0.5 mm, the present invention can be designed to have similarly sized crystals to visually mimic naturally occurring <i>Cannabis </i>trichomes. More preferably, the trimmed <i>Cannabis </i>buds have a coating with crystals having an average of between 0.05 to 0.1 mm to visually mimic average sized naturally occurring <i>Cannabis </i>trichomes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention yields herbage that is non-sticky and can be readily ground for smoking. Preferably, the <i>Cannabis </i>flower has a reflective coating that sparkles, and is capable of being ground in a mechanical grinder such as a grinder with an electrical motor attached to a rotating blade.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, the <i>Cannabis </i>flower is dried to less than 10% moisture content and is trimmed to have a defined shape. The first coating of a first <i>Cannabis </i>plant extract including at least 60%-98% Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the first coating is hardened so that the <i>Cannabis </i>flower is easy to grind without sticking within and fouling the mechanical grinder. The second coating of the second <i>Cannabis </i>plant extract includes at least 90-99% Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The THCa forms crystals that are embedded in the first coating to reflect light. The crystals are also readily passed through a grinder without fouling the grinder. The ratio of the summed weight of the combined coatings to the weight of the <i>Cannabis </i>flower is between 1:4 and 2:1 on a weight to weight basis to enable the <i>Cannabis </i>flower to be easily ground in a mechanical grinder without sticking within and fouling the mechanical grinder. Further, the <i>Cannabis </i>flower can be coated and displayed in a clear glass jar; the coatings cooperate to enable the <i>Cannabis </i>flowers to be displayed without sticking to and fouling the clear glass jar. Though the glass jar is transparent, the coatings cooperate to inhibit oxidation of the <i>Cannabis </i>flower due to incident light. The coatings also cooperate to inhibit volatilization of flavonoids and terpenes from the first coating and from the <i>Cannabis </i>flower due to incident light.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">During manufacture, the first coating is applied while warm, below 180&#xb0; F. The second coating is applied sequentially while the first coating is warm.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second coating, in one embodiment of the invention, can commonly be characterized as &#x201c;THCa diamonds&#x201d;, which is THCa manufactured by creating a non-decarboxylated THCa concentrate, subjecting it to winterization to remove excess waxes, chlorophyll, flavonoids and terpenes. The winterized remainder forms THCa diamonds.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, various terpenes and flavonoids are added to the THCa to achieve a desirable flavor and aroma while preserving the THCa diamonds. These diamonds, or crystals, can be transparent in one embodiment of the invention. The diamonds can be golden, yellow, purple, blue or other color. Viewing the <i>Cannabis </i>flower, or herbage, through the diamonds gives the appearance of a colored flower. The flower is colored due to color components and sparkles due to reflective characteristics of the diamonds. The color components can be derived from <i>Cannabis </i>and include several <i>Cannabis </i>derived terpenes or polyphenols. The color components can be derived from plant polyphenols or herbage. Polyphenols, for example, can include flavonoids, tannic acid, and ellagitannin, some of which have been used historically as dyes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><i>Cannabis</i>-derived terpenes including myrcene, limonene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-pinene, and beta-pinene can be added either to the first coating, the second coating, or both. These terpenes can enhance flavor, aroma, and inhibit microbial growth, for example fungal growth.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Coating for the purposes of the present invention differs from the infusion of <i>Cannabis </i>flowers because coating soaks into the flowers less deeply than infusing flowers with a sub stance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the present invention is described herein by way of example, such as by using THC and THCa, it can be appreciated that various cannabinoids can be utilized in accord with the present invention. In the present invention, the first and second coatings increase potency of the <i>Cannabis </i>flower when smoked or otherwise consumed. One puff of a coated <i>Cannabis </i>flower delivers less harmful particulates to the lungs of a user than smoking a whole <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette. Both may deliver the same level of potency.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a merchandising display including glass jars enclosing <i>Cannabis </i>flowers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a group of trimmed <i>Cannabis </i>flowers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a group of <i>Cannabis </i>cigarettes with an open end showing crystals.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette with a foot, paper, and an open end with visible crystals.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette with crystals visible at an open end and having paper impregnated with crystals.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a <i>Cannabis </i>cigarette with a transparent paper that enables ground <i>Cannabis </i>flowers having crystals to be viewed through the paper.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a merchandising display generally designated with the reference numeral <b>10</b>.
