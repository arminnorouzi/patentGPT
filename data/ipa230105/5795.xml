In the field of semiconductor device structures and manufacturing processes, high-k refers to a dielectric constant that is greater than the dielectric constant of SiO<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., greater than about 3.9).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x201c;p-type&#x201d; defines a structure, layer, and/or region as being doped with p-type dopants, such as boron.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the term &#x201c;n-type&#x201d; defines a structure, layer, and/or region as being doped with n-type dopants, such as phosphorus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within 5% of the value (e.g., &#xb1;1%, &#xb1;2%, &#xb1;3%, &#xb1;4%, &#xb1;5% of the value). These values are merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. The terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can refer to a percentage of the values as interpreted by those skilled in relevant art(s) in light of the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The layers within a gate structure or gate stack of a field effect transistor (FET) control, in part, the transistor's threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>). More particularly, the V<sub>t </sub>value of a transistor depends on the collective thickness and/or material composition of the layers included in its gate stack. Therefore, by controlling the thickness (or the number of layers) and/or material composition of these layers in each FET, FETs can be manufactured with different V<sub>t</sub>. For example, FETs with a low V<sub>t </sub>(e.g., between about 50 mV and about 160 mV) can be used for &#x201c;low&#x201d; or &#x201c;ultra-low&#x201d; power applications within a chip, and FETs with high V<sub>t </sub>(e.g., greater than about 200 mV) can be used for high power applications within the chip. In addition, n-type FET (also referred to as &#x201c;NFET&#x201d;) and p-type FET (also referred to as &#x201c;PFET&#x201d;) can be manufactured with different V<sub>t </sub>suitable for each type of FET. In FETs, in some embodiments, a way to control (e.g., lower) the V<sub>t </sub>is to control the aluminum concentration in the FET's work function stack layers. In some embodiments, a way to control the V<sub>t </sub>in FETs is to use different compositions and thicknesses for the FET's work function stack layers of the gate stack. Different complementary MOS (CMOS) devices (e.g., an inverter logic device, a NOR logic device, a NAND logic device, a ring oscillator device, and an SRAM device) can be formed by various adjacent NFETs and PFETs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With increasing demand of lower power consumption, high performance, and small area for semiconductor devices, FETs with different V<sub>t </sub>can have their challenges. For example, distances between FETs with different V<sub>t </sub>decreases due to continuous device scaling down. In some semiconductor devices, two or more FETs with different V<sub>t </sub>can have connected gates and the gate stacks of these FETs abut each other at a metal boundary. In some embodiments, the metal boundary can be a boundary where one metal stack of one FET device borders another metal stack of an adjacent FET device, For example, the gates of the NFET and PFET in an inverter are connected and the gate stacks of the NFET and PFET abut each other at the N-P metal boundary. The V<sub>t </sub>of one FET can shift due to diffusion of metals (e.g., aluminum) from the gate stack layers of the adjacent FET across the metal boundary, which is referred to as &#x201c;metal boundary effect&#x201d; (MBE). As a result, the metals (e.g., aluminum) in the gate stack layer of one FET device can decrease with the diffusion of metals, and the metals (e.g., aluminum) in the gate stack layer of the adjacent FET device with a different V<sub>t </sub>can increase with the diffusion of metals. The decrease of metals (e.g., aluminum) in the one FET device can increase an effective work function of the one FET device, which can increase the absolute value of a Vt of an NFET and can decrease the absolute value of a Vt of a PFET. Similarly, the increase of metals (e.g., aluminum) in the adjacent FET device can decrease an effective work function of the adjacent FET device, which can decrease the absolute value of a Vt of an NFET and can increase the absolute value of a Vt of a PFET. With decreasing distances between adjacent FETs, V<sub>t </sub>shifts due to the MBE effect can exacerbate and further degrade device performance.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various embodiments in the present disclosure provide methods for forming a semiconductor device having metal boundary trench isolation with an electrically conductive intermediate structure acting as a metal diffusion barrier.

In some embodiments, p-type work function layers are present on both n-type and p-type FETs (not shown). In some embodiments, each of p-type work function layers <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b </i>can include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, ruthium and/or nitrogen (e.g., in the form of titanium nitride (TiN)) and has a thickness between about 5 &#x212b; and about 35 &#x212b;.

For example, the greater the number of p-type work function layers in work function stack <b>301</b>A or the thicker the p-type work function layers, the lower the absolute threshold voltage value for a PFET device and the higher the absolute threshold voltage value for an NFET device. Though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> and subsequent figures show two p-type work function layers <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b </i>in work function stack <b>301</b>A and no p-type work function layers in work function stack <b>301</b>B, work function stack <b>301</b>A and work function stack <b>301</b>B can include any number of p-type work function layers respectively. Work function stack <b>301</b>A and work function stack <b>301</b>B can include different numbers of p-type work function layers from each other. Therefore, it is possible to form, within the same chip, FET devices with different threshold voltages for different power applications as discussed above. As discussed above, p-type work function layers tune primarily the threshold voltage of p-type FETs, while n-type FETs may be unaffected by the presence of the p-type work function layers. In some embodiments, n-type FETs can have fewer number of p-type work function layers, or feature a thinner p-type work function layer, compared to the p-type FETs. In some embodiments, each of p-type work function layers <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b </i>can be deposited with an ALD process using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) at a deposition temperature between about 300&#xb0; C. and about 550&#xb0; C. Further, removal of the p-type work function layer can be achieved with an SC<b>1</b>, an SC<b>2</b>, or a phosphoric acid wet clean after the removal of the photoresist. As discussed above, each of p-type work function layers <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b </i>can have a different thickness because each layer is individually deposited.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">FET devices with a different number of p-type work function layers, or with a p-type work function layer having different thicknesses, can be accomplished by photolithography and etching operations. In some embodiments, the first p-type work function layer can be deposited concurrently on both n-type and p-type FET devices of the chip. In some embodiments, transistors receiving more p-type work function layers (e.g., FET <b>105</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) are subsequently masked with a photoresist so that the first p-type work function layer can be removed via etching from the transistors receiving fewer p-type work function layers (e.g., FET <b>105</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Once the first p-type work function layer has been removed from the transistors receiving fewer p-type work function layers (e.g., FET <b>105</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), the photoresist is removed from the transistors receiving more p-type work function layers (e.g., FET <b>105</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and the process resumes with a second p-type work function layer deposition. A photoresist is subsequently used to mask the transistors receiving the largest and the second largest number of p-type work function layers. A subsequent etching process removes the second p-type work function layer from the transistors receiving fewer p-type work function layers from the transistors with the largest and the second largest number of p-type work function layers. The aforementioned sequence repeats until all the FET devices (p-type and n-type) receive the appropriate number of p-type work function layers (e.g., 0 to 1 p-type work function layers for n-type FETs and 2 to 4 p-type work function layers for p-type FETs). The p-type work function formation sequence described above is not limiting and other sequences to form p-type work function layers <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b </i>of work function stack <b>301</b>A using similar or different operations may be performed.
