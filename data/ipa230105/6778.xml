The standard institutes employ not only a feedback-based retransmission procedure which is based on automatic retransmission request (ARQ), but also a hybrid ARQ (HARQ) technology which combines ARQ and an error correction encoding technology, and delivers different or same information or a bit corresponding thereto when retransmitting, and restores information that is originally intended to be transmitted, by combining information or bits received in response to a plurality of transmissions.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0116">The HARQ technique requires a terminal to identify that a group of a plurality of pieces of information or bits received is based on the same data information, and this brings necessity of an indicator for informing that each retransmission process is used for restoring the same data. Such an indicator may be referred to as an HARQ indication (HARQ ID), and the HARQ ID may operate as an indicator for allowing a terminal and a base station to recognize the same data unit or information, and may inform the terminal that newly received retransmission information should be combined with information bits previously received through the same HARQ ID. The HARQ ID may be referred to as a HARQ process ID.

Such a CA technology combines a plurality of frequency elements and utilizes the same for communication with a terminal, thereby enabling an individual terminal to have a higher data throughput. An area of a terminal that is responsible for frequency elements which serves as a base of operations may be referred to as PCell, SpCell, PSCell, etc., and an area of an additional frequency element which is dependently utilized in addition to the basic frequency elements may be referred to as SCell. The PSCell refers to a PCell of a secondary node (SN), and the SpCell refers to a PCell and a PSCell. The SCell refers to a cell other than a SpCell.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0119">In the case of the above-described CA technology, success or failure to receive downlink transmit data of each SpCell and SCell should be delivered from the terminal to the base station in the form of HARQ ACK/NACK. In this case, the ACK/NACK information may be combined and delivered through a certain cell, other than each cell to which the downlink transmission data is transmitted. For example, HARQ ACK/NACK information regarding the SpCell and one or more SCells may be delivered through a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) of SpCell. HARQ ACK/NACK information may be multiplexed with PUSCH transmission of the SpCell or a certain SCell, and may be delivered. In addition, for example, HARQ ACK/NACK information may be delivered through a SCell in which a PUCCH is configured.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0120">When the CA technology is utilized by the HARQ ACK/NACK delivery method in the above-described CA technology, there may be a delay for exchanging information between a cell to which HARQ ACK/NACK information comes up and a cell where downlink transmission indicated by the corresponding information occurs. For example, there may be a delay on a backhaul network regarding cells. Due to physical separation between a cell to which HARQ ACK/NACK information is delivered and a cell to which downlink transmission is provided, there may be an information delay occurring in a backhaul network between two cells. This may occur when a CA operation is configured between devices having a meaningful delivery delay in delivering information, not in one processor or device. For example, in the case of an NR communication system, numerology may be different between cells. As mentioned above through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as numerology is configured differently between cells, an absolute length may be different between the two cells even if the number of symbols or the number of slots is the same. For example, as there is a difference in an absolute length between a transmission unit of a channel for transmitting real data and a transmission unit of a feedback channel, HARQ-ACK information on data of an HARQ process may arrive at the base station later than expected by the base station.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0121">Due to such a delay, a cell that fails to receive the HARQ ACK/NACK information does not cause a change in operations to the HARQ process which is mapped onto a corresponding HARQ ID until it is identified whether ACK/NACK on corresponding downlink transmission is received, and may use a retransmission bit combination according to a HARQ method. Thereafter, when the base station receives NACK information in the corresponding cell, the base station may retransmit a bit which is the same as or different from a previous bit, and the terminal may operate to decipher an original signal by combining previously delivered information and newly received information with the corresponding HARQ ID. For example, the terminal may obtain a combining gain by combining retransmission data received on the same HARQ process with data of a soft buffer (data received at a corresponding HARQ process), and decoding.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0122">However, in order to obtain a gain by an HARQ operation in the above-described operation, new data (or a transport block (TB)) should not be delivered to the HARQ process corresponding to the HARQ ID in which transmission and retransmission procedures are in progress until retransmission succeeds or the number of retransmissions reaches a predetermined maximum value, and this may put restrictions on the transmission procedure due to a shortage of HARQ ID even when there are a radio resource of downlink transmission and information to be transmitted, because of restrictions on the number of HARQ IDs and the delay in transmission of ACK/NACK in the CA environment mentioned above. The restrictions on the transmission may increases the number of lost transmission opportunities as the delay in transmission of information between two devices which are targets of CA is longer, and eventually, results in very linear data throughput degradation. In other words, the restrictions on the number of HARQ IDs may cause restrictions on the number of transmissions that a communication system using a HARQ technique may transmit using the HARQ technique, and the restrictions may affect a transmission window size through which the base station may continuously transmits without a HARQ response. That is, the restrictions on the number of HARQ IDs may affect a transmission window size in base station-terminal communication, and, when a time delayed until a HARQ response is received and processed from a time of transmission is longer than a time spent to process data through the transmission window size, it may be impossible to transmit data due to the lack of the transmission window size.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0123">Transmission Opportunity-Based HARQ Process Technique</p><p id="p-0084" num="0124">In order to address the above-described problems, various embodiments of the disclosure provide a new HARQ process technique for reducing a loss caused by a delay, instead of a HARQ process technique for acquiring a combining gain (a gain obtained by a bit combination).

Accordingly, due to the operation for acquiring the HARQ combining gain and the delay until ACK information is received, a transmission procedure through a corresponding resource is not initiated due to a shortage of the number of HARQ processes even through there are time-frequency resources for transmission, and as a result, a problem that a throughput of the system is reduced arises. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>, after transmitting first data (a) of HARQ process #0, the base station may await until feedback on the first data (a) of HARQ process #0 arrives.

For example, the base station may add second transmission data to a corresponding HARQ process when a transmission opportunity comes. Existing first transmission data may not be utilized in the corresponding HARQ process. Due to the restrictions on the maximum number of HARQ processes, a delay occurs when a response (HARQ ACK information) of the corresponding HARQ process is awaited, although there is data to be transmitted. To prevent and/or reduce this, the base station according to various embodiments may configure data to be transmitted through the HARQ process, that is, a TB, irrespective of HARQ ACK information on the HARQ process.

That is, transmission data may be new data from the viewpoint of the terminal, but may correspond to pre-transmitted data from the viewpoint of the base station.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0146">Since contents of a real TB are configured independently from an HARQ process ID, the base station may need to manage information regarding which HARQ process is related to data (MAC SDU or RLC PDU) received on a MAC layer. The base station may determine whether to retransmit the TB or to transmit a new TB, based on received feedback (ACK/NACK/NACK) information irrespective of the terminal (transparent). The base station may expect the terminal to always recognize the corresponding TB as new data. For example, the base station may manage retransmission independently from the HARQ process on the MAC layer. The base station may transmit information that the base station intends to really transmit to the terminal, by retransmitting transmission data based on feedback information of the terminal, without a retransmission procedure on a higher layer (for example, ARQ of RLC). An HARQ process of feedback information and an HARQ process of retransmitted transmission data may be independent from each other, and may be configured differently. The base station may transmit data that it really intends to transmit without a delay even if the terminal does not know retransmission and does not acquire a combining gain.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0147">For example, according to various embodiments of the disclosure, the base station may store a corresponding PDU or SDU at a time when a MAC service data unit (SDU) transmitted from a higher layer to a MAC layer, or a PDU (for example, an RLC PDU) generated on the higher layer are transmitted to an HARQ process. Hereinafter, the PDU or SDU may be RLC PDU/MAC SDU, or MAC PDU, that is, TB, according to an embodiment. The base station may map the corresponding PDU or SDU onto HARQ processing ID information based on which the corresponding PDU or SDU is delivered, and may store the mapping information along with data. The mapping information may be retained (preserved) until ACK information on the information transmitting the corresponding PDU or SDU is received, as long as the mapping information does not expire by various timers applied to manage a system or a separate event. An embodiment of such a mapping relationship and the mapping information will be described hereinbelow in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0148">The mapping information is information between the PDU or SDU and the HARQ process ID, and may share a storage space for the PDU or SDU in the system, and may directly map the PDU or SDU and the HARQ process ID. However, the mapping information may be mapping between at least one of logical identification information of the PDU or SDU, such as a logical address for storing the corresponding PDU or SDU information, a sequence number (SN) defined by standards, a separate index number defined according to an embodiment, and the HARQ process ID. For example, the base station may store and manage a mapping relationship between a logical number (for example, an index number) regarding the above-described SDU or PDU, and an HARQ process ID through which the SDU or PDU corresponding to the number is transmitted. That is, the above-described mapping operation is a preliminary step for applying an embodiment of the disclosure, and the base station may perform mapping operations with respect to all target PDUs or SDUs which are transmitted to an HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0149">In addition, in an embodiment of the disclosure, in order to utilize transmission of a plurality of TBs for the same HARQ ID more fluidly, the base station may additionally map information related to a corresponding time at the time when corresponding mapping information is generated, that is, at the time when a PDU or SDU is inserted into an HARQ process. The base station may map the time information onto the HARQ ID, and then, may store as mapping information. This may be an internal counter or a system frame number (SFN), a subframe number, a slot number, a symbol index for the disclosure, or a combination thereof. In addition, the internal counter in this case may include a form of an indicator indicating whether the corresponding PDU or SDU is substituted in the HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0150">The operation utilizing the mapping information is performed with respect to all target PUDs or SDUs, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In various embodiments, the base station may additionally perform a process of reading out information of first transmission data at a time when second transmission data is substituted for the first transmission data in the HARQ process, thereby performing a mapping operation with respect to some target PDU or SDU. The base station may additionally perform an operation of extracting an index number from the first transmission data. The base station may perform mapping by extracting only some data, instead of performing a mapping operation with respect to all PDUs or SDUs.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0151">According to an embodiment, the above-described index number may be a sequence number (SN) of an RLC layer. The base station may extract and acquire a corresponding sequence number (SN) from the RLC PDU corresponding to the first transmission data, and may correlate the corresponding SN to the HARQ process ID (for example, HARQ process #0) of the first transmission data. That is, when inserting new data (TB) of the HARQ process, the base station may store a mapping relationship between the SN corresponding to existing data and the corresponding HARQ process. In this case, in one of embodiments of the disclosure, time information may also be mapped. The base station may additionally map information regarding a time of extracting or a time of transmitting onto the mapping relationship information between the data number and the HARQ process, and may store the mapping information. In this case, information regarding the time may be an internal counter or a system frame number (SFN), a subframe number, a slot number, a symbol index, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0152">Since the base station stores the mapping relationship between the data information (for example, RLC PDU/MAC SDU or MAC PDU) transmitted in the HARQ process and the HARQ process, information of the pre-transmitted data in the HARQ process may be known even when new data (TB) is transmitted through the HARQ process. Thereafter, feedback of the pre-transmitted data of the HARQ process may be received. The stored mapping relationship may be utilized as a corresponding PDU or SDU is transmitted as first transmission data afterward and ACK/NACK on the transmission data is received. When ACK/NACK information on the corresponding PDU or SDU is received, the HARQ process may deliver the ACK/NACK information to an entity (for example, a base station or DU) which manages the mapping information. In this case, the mapping information management entity which receives the ACK/NACK information may discover a PDU or an SDU which is an entity for receiving ACK/NACK information of a corresponding time, through the HARQ process ID through which ACK/NACK information is transmitted. That is, the entity discovers the PDU or SDU including information of a target which generates ACK/NACK information through the ACK/NACK information and the HARQ process ID through which the ACK/NACK information is delivered. According to an embodiment, when the received ACK/NACK information is ACK, the mapping entity (for example, the base station) may determine that the corresponding PDU or SDU is normally delivered, and may remove the mapping information on the corresponding PDU or SDU. For example, the mapping entity may be implemented by an RLC entity of the base station. In addition, for example, the mapping entity may be implemented by an MAC entity in the base station. In addition, for example, the mapping entity may be implemented in the form of an MAC entity or in the form of an SW block between RLC/MAC layers. When the mapping information is removed, information on the corresponding PDU or SDU which is stored in a buffer may also be removed. On the other hand, when the received ACK/NACK information is NACK, a transmission procedure on the discovered PDU or SDU may newly start. For example, the HARQ process which receives NACK information on first transmission data replaced according to the retransmission procedure of the disclosure may deliver a retransmission indicator to the mapping entity (for example, the base station). The mapping entity (for example, the base station) which receives the NACK information may insert transmission data on the PDU or SDU on which the NACK information is identified, that is, a TB, into the HARQ process, by initiating a transmission procedure from the buffer again.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, feedback <b>631</b> on the first transmission data (a) of HARQ process #0 may be NACK.

The base station may identify HARQ process #0, based on a resource by which feedback information is transmitted, a field of DCI (for example, a HARQ process number) provided at a time when the corresponding resource is assigned. The base station which receives NACK information on the TB (a) which has been transmitted through HARQ process #0 may read out corresponding data from the buffer again, based on mapping information. The base station may generate the read-out data as a new PDU or SDU, based on information acquired from the MAC layer. That is, the base station may identify a PDU or SDU mapping onto HARQ process #0.

This may be a bit used as a means for informing that new data is transmitted from the viewpoint of the terminal, but, when control and scheduling information including the NDI toggle information is not transmitted to the terminal, there may be a mismatch in NDI information between the terminal and the base station. The disclosure will be described with reference to a 3GPP system in which control and scheduling information are transmitted through a PDCCH. However, the control and scheduling information may be another element of the same or similar meaning. In addition, the term &#x201c;PDCCH missing&#x201d; may be used to indicate a case where the above-described control and scheduling information are not transmitted to a terminal with reference to the 3GPP system in an embodiment of the disclosure, but this term may include the same or similar elements.

Due to this characteristic, there is no way of addressing the problem caused by PDCCH missing after the problem arises, and a base station and a terminal may be required to operate to prevent and/or reduce the problem preemptively by reducing a probability that PDCCH missing occurs. This may be achieved by applying solutions called &#x201c;conservatization on PDCCH transmission,&#x201d; but conservatization needs to be applied before the transmission method of the disclosure is applied, not a time when the transmission method is applied, and accordingly, the disclosure considers application of a preemptive PDCCH conservatization solution.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0193">By applying the disclosure, the preemptive PDCCH conservatization solution may operate for stable transmission in case of PDCCH missing of a first transmission frame which is replaced in a HARQ process before ACK/NACK information.

It is illustrated that a base station classifies types of HARQ processes, but other entities than the base station may classify types of corresponding HARQ processes.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0194">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, there may be a procedure of configuring whether an individual HARQ process is a target to which the disclosure is applied with respect to HARQ processes in advance. When all HARQ processes or HARQ process IDs are being used, a HARQ process to be selected to transmit new data may be selected from the HARQ processes configured as a target group to which the disclosure is applied. In the disclosure, the HARQ process which is the target for applying may be referred to as an opportunistic HARQ process (O-HARQ process). In addition, a group including one or more opportunistic HARQ processes may be referred to as an O-HARQ process group. According to an embodiment of the disclosure, when the transmission opportunity-based HARQ process technique (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref>) of the disclosure is applied to all HARQ processes, the base station may assign all available HARQ processes to the O-HARQ process group. According to an embodiment, when the transmission opportunity-based HARQ process technique of the disclosure is not applied, a separate indicator for this may be delivered or an effective HARQ process may not be assigned to the O-HARQ process group, such that the transmission opportunity-based HARQ process technique may not be applied. According to various embodiments, the base station may apply the above-described transmission opportunity-based HARQ process technique to the O-HARQ process group which is the target for applying the disclosure to be able to insert new second transmission data to a corresponding HARQ process before ACK/NACK information on the first transmission data is received, and may perform a procedure of conservatizing the corresponding transmission by applying a lower MCS to PDCCH transmission or by assigning more resources with respect to all data transmitted through the corresponding HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0195">In various embodiments of the disclosure related to a 3GPP system, the base station may implement the above-described conservatization operation by applying a higher aggregation level to a PDCCH utilized for transmission of an O-HARQ process group than to a PDCCH utilized for transmission of a process which is not a target, or by applying greater transmission power. In addition, with respect to the O-HARQ process group, conservatization may be applied not only for PDCCH transmission but also for resource assignment for first transmission and a transmission rate.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0196">In the disclosure, the term &#x201c;conservative&#x201d; or &#x201c;conservatization&#x201d; may refer, for example, to a state in which a signal is stably delivered or processing for stable transmission of a signal. Such a conservatization procedure may be applied independently from the transmission procedure applying a lower MCS (or the same or similar concept) in the retransmission procedure described above. That is, the base station may perform transmission with respect to an O-HARQ process of an O-HARQ process group with higher reliability than when transmitting assigned data to a HARQ process that does not belong to the O-HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0197">In various embodiments, the base station may perform a separate rate control method and a procedure having a lower target error probability (Target BLER) with respect to processes belonging to the O-HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0198">In addition, in various embodiments, the conservatization processing may employ a low modulation scheme or may include signal processing through a low coding rate.

The base station may apply an offset value to an existing MCS to be applied to a process other than the O-HARQ process group, or a Rate, an MPR which is substituted with the MCS, and may apply the MCS rate, the MPR, etc. to which an offset defined for a given MCS, Rate, MPR is applied, to transmission of processes within the O-HARQ process group. In this case, the offset regarding the MPR and the MCS, Rate described above may be a value that is added to or subtracted from a value of a target for applying, and may be a value that is applied in the form of a coefficient which is multiplied with a value of a target, or a multiplier according to an implementation form.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0201">In the operation on the O-HARQ process described above, when the above-described MCS, Rate, MPR or field values that may influence deriving of the MCS, Rate, MPR are less than or equal to a predetermined value, or when an operation indicating a similar environment is detected, a solution for configuring so as not to perform the O-HARQ process operation according to embodiments of the disclosure may also be included in the disclosure. Specifically, when an MCS, Rate, MPR on a target terminal is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold, the base station according to various embodiments of the disclosure may not apply an embodiment of the disclosure where new data is inserted into a HARQ process before data transmission in the HARQ process is completed. According to an embodiment, the operation of inserting new data into the HARQ process may be limited as being performed when transmission is performed as many times as the maximum number of transmissions of the corresponding HARQ process, or after ACK information on a transmission TB is received. The procedure of comparing the MCS, Rate, MPR with the threshold may be substituted with a procedure of comparing a field value with the terminal measured by the base station and a threshold. That is, when a value corresponding to the field value is less than or equal to the threshold, the base station may perform an operation without using the above-described O-HARQ. In addition, when NACK is continuously received, and accordingly, failures to transmit cumulate, the base station may perform an operation without using the above-described O-HARQ if a number exceeding a threshold thereof cumulates.
