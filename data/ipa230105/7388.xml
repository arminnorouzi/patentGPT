The transmissive screen is formed with, for example, a large number of small holes as sound transmission holes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the speaker system using such a transmissive screen, a viewer recognizes the sound output from the speaker device disposed on the rear surface side as if it is output from the display surface. Therefore, the display position of a video displayed on the display surface and the output position of a sound are brought into alignment with each other, whereby a comfortable viewing state without discomfort can be ensured for the viewer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-10193</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2019-179074</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to Be Solved By the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in recent years, videos and images are often displayed on a liquid crystal display, a light emitting diode (LED) display using an LED as a light source, or the like, and such a display is also used as a display device in, for example, a theater such as a movie theater.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the displays described above are difficult to be formed with a sound transmission hole, and therefore, the speaker device is located outside the outer periphery of the displays. Therefore, the display position of a video and the output position of a sound may not be brought into alignment with each other, and there is a possibility that a comfortable viewing state is not ensured for the viewer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of this, an object of the speaker system and the sound output method according to the present technology is to achieve alignment between the display position of a video and the output position of a sound and to ensure a comfortable viewing state for the viewer.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a first aspect, a speaker system according to the present technology includes: a speaker device that is disposed outside a region of a projection surface on which a display surface of a display is projected, the speaker device functioning as a real sound source; and a reflector that has a reflection surface reflecting a sound output from the speaker device, the reflector localizing a sound image of a virtual sound source within the region of the projection surface, in which the reflector has an elliptical reflection surface in at least a part of the reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this configuration, the sound output from the speaker device disposed outside the region of the projection surface is reflected by the reflector, and a sound image of a virtual sound source is localized within the region of the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a second aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the speaker device is disposed at or near one of focal points on the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this configuration, the sound output from the speaker device and reflected by the elliptical reflection surface is easily collected at the other focal point on the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a third aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the reflector is disposed outside the region of the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With this configuration, the speaker device and the reflector are less likely to enter the field of vision of a viewer viewing a video or an image displayed in the display surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a fourth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the sound image of the virtual sound source is localized at a central part of the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, the sound is recognized as if it is output from the central part of the display surface of the display.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As a fifth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the speaker device and the reflector are disposed above the display.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With this configuration, the speaker device and the reflector are disposed at positions where it is easy to ensure a space, so that the speaker device and the reflector are less likely to be restricted in size and shape.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a sixth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that a midpoint between two focal points on the elliptical reflection surface is located outside the region of the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With this configuration, the sound is easily propagated from the virtual sound source in a direction approaching the central part of the display surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As a seventh aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the elliptical reflection surface has a major axis that is inclined with respect to the display surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With this configuration, the output direction of the sound from the virtual sound source can be set to a direction corresponding to the inclination direction of the major axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As an eighth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the virtual sound source is located at a position closer to the display surface with respect to the speaker device in a direction orthogonal to the display surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With this configuration, the distance between the virtual sound source and the display surface becomes smaller than the distance between the speaker device and the surface in the direction orthogonal to the display surface of the display.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a ninth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that a plurality of the reflectors is provided, the focal points of each of the plurality of reflectors coincide with each other, and the sound output from the speaker device is sequentially reflected by the elliptical reflection surfaces of the plurality of reflectors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this configuration, the sound image of the sound sequentially reflected by the elliptical reflection surfaces formed on the plurality of reflectors is localized within the region of the projection surface as a virtual sound source, whereby it is possible to locate the speaker device at a desired position according to the number of reflectors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a tenth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that, in two of the reflectors that sequentially reflect the sound, a major axis of the elliptical reflection surface of one of the two reflectors and a major axis of the elliptical reflection surface of another one of the two reflectors are orthogonal to each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With this configuration, longitudinal directions of the two reflectors are orthogonal to each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As an eleventh aspect, it is desirable that, in the speaker system described above, a plurality of the reflectors is provided, and a plurality of the speaker devices is provided corresponding to the plurality of reflectors, the speaker system further including a delay circuit that synchronizes sounds output from the virtual sound sources respectively corresponding to the plurality of speaker devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With this configuration, the sounds output from the virtual sound sources corresponding to the respective speaker devices are synchronized by the delay circuit and reach the viewer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As a twelfth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that a plurality of the speaker devices and a plurality of the reflectors are disposed around the display.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With this configuration, sound images of sounds output from the plurality of speaker devices disposed around the display are localized within the region of the projection surface as one or a plurality of virtual sound sources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As a thirteenth aspect, it is desirable that the speaker system described above further includes a parabolic reflective plate that has a parabolic reflection surface formed into a paraboloid shape, in which the sound output from the speaker device is reflected by the parabolic reflection surface toward the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With this configuration, the sound is reflected by the parabolic reflection surface and enters the elliptical reflection surface in a parallel or substantially parallel state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a fourteenth aspect, it is desirable that the speaker system described above further includes a shielding wall that shields a sound output from the speaker device and not reflected by the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With this configuration, a sound output from the speaker device and not reflected by the elliptical reflection surface is shielded by the shielding wall and is less likely to reach the viewer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a fifteenth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the speaker device is disposed on a rear side of the display, the reflector is disposed in an area from the rear side of the display to an outside of an outer periphery of the display, and the sound image of the virtual sound source is localized within the region of the projection surface due to the sound output from the speaker device being reflected twice by the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With this configuration, the speaker device is disposed at a position invisible from the viewer, so that the speaker device does not enter the field of vision of the viewer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a sixteenth aspect, in the speaker system described above, it is desirable that the elliptical reflection surface has a curvature that is variable, and the speaker device is changed in position according to displacement of a position of a focal point due to a change in curvature of the elliptical reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With this configuration, the position of the virtual sound source at which the sound image is localized can be changed by changing the position of the speaker device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a seventeenth aspect, a sound output method according to the present technology includes: outputting a sound from a speaker device that is disposed outside a region of a projection surface on which a display surface of a display is projected, the speaker device functioning as a real sound source; and reflecting the sound output from the speaker device by an elliptical reflection surface formed on a reflector so as to localize a sound image of a virtual sound source within the region of the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With this configuration, the sound output from the speaker device disposed outside the region of the projection surface is reflected by the reflector, and a sound image of a virtual sound source is localized within the region of the projection surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description

It is to be noted, however, that the speaker system according to the present technology is not limited to being applied to a speaker system used in a theater such as a movie theater, and can be widely applied to various speaker systems such as a speaker system used in home and a speaker system used in outdoor facility such as a stadium.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, in the following description, the front-rear direction, the vertical direction, and the horizontal direction are indicated using the orientation of a display as a reference in a state where a listener is seated, and the direction in which the display surface of the display faces is defined as the front.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, the front-rear direction, the vertical direction, and the horizontal direction described below are defined only for convenience, and they are not limited to the definitions described below when the present technology is embodied.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A speaker system <b>10</b> includes the speaker device <b>1</b> and a reflector <b>2</b> and is used in a configuration including a display <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The front surface of the display <b>20</b> is entirely formed, for example, as a display surface <b>21</b> on which a video or an image is displayed. However, the display surface <b>21</b> may be formed in a region other than the outer peripheral portion on the front surface of the display <b>20</b>. A region in front of the display surface <b>21</b> is set as a projection surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>on which a video or an image is projected.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A viewer <b>100</b> views the video and the image displayed on the display surface <b>21</b> of the display <b>20</b> and listens to a sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b>. The viewer <b>100</b> is located in front of the display <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The speaker device <b>1</b> functions as a real sound source that outputs a sound, and is disposed, for example, in an orientation so that the sound is output rearward.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The reflector <b>2</b> is disposed above the display <b>20</b>, for example, and is located outside a region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The reflector <b>2</b> is formed as an ellipsoid that is concave in the forward direction, and the entire inner surface is formed as an elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>. Note that the inner surface of the reflector <b>2</b> is formed as a reflection surface, and it is only sufficient that at least a part of the reflection surface is formed as the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>, but a portion where the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> reaches is formed as the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The reflector <b>2</b> is disposed such that the major axis direction (direction connecting a focal point F<b>1</b> and a focal point F<b>2</b>) extends along the vertical direction and the minor axis direction extends along the horizontal direction, and is formed in a shape smaller than a semi-ellipsoid, for example. Specifically, for example, the reflector <b>2</b> is formed into a shape having a size substantially half of a semi-ellipsoid. The lower end of the reflector <b>2</b> is aligned with the front end at the upper end of the display <b>20</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the shape of the ellipsoid continuous with the reflector <b>2</b> is indicated by a dotted line as an elliptical virtual line D, two focal points of the ellipsoid are indicated as F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, and the focal length is indicated as L. The upper focal point F<b>1</b> is outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a, </i>and the lower focal point F<b>2</b> is within the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The lower focal point F<b>2</b> is located, for example, on a position directly in front of a central part M of the display surface <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed at or near the upper focal point F<b>1</b> of the reflector <b>2</b>. Specifically, an output position of a sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> is desirably located at or near the focal point F<b>1</b>. As described above, since the speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed at or near the upper focal point F<b>1</b> of the reflector <b>2</b>, the speaker device <b>1</b> is located outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the speaker system <b>10</b> configured as described above, when a sound is output from the speaker device <b>1</b> functioning as a real sound source, the output sound is reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> of the reflector <b>2</b>, collected at the focal point F<b>2</b>, and propagated toward the viewer <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At this time, since the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> is collected at the focal point F<b>2</b>, the sound image of the sound is localized on the focal point F<b>2</b>, and a virtual sound source is formed at the focal point F<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In particular, since the speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed at or near the focal point F<b>1</b> on the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>, the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> and reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> is easily collected at the focal point F<b>2</b> on the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>. Therefore, the sound image of the virtual sound source can be easily localized at a desired position.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, the viewer <b>100</b> recognizes as if the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> is output from the central part of the display surface <b>21</b> of the display <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As described above, in the speaker system <b>10</b>, the sound image of the virtual sound source is localized directly in front of the central part of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a, </i>and therefore, the sound is recognized as if it is output from the central part of the display surface <b>21</b> of the display <b>20</b>. Thus, the display position of the video displayed on the display surface <b>21</b> of the display <b>20</b> and the output position of the sound are brought into alignment with each other, whereby a comfortable viewing state without discomfort can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, the speaker device <b>1</b> and the reflector <b>2</b> are disposed above the display <b>20</b>, so that the speaker device <b>1</b> and the reflector <b>2</b> are located at positions where it is easy to ensure a space. Thus, the speaker device <b>1</b> and the reflector <b>2</b> are less likely to be restricted in shape and size, and a degree of freedom in design can be improved.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, due to the configuration in which the speaker device <b>1</b> and the reflector <b>2</b> are disposed above the display <b>20</b>, the sound is easily transmitted obliquely downward and forward of the display <b>20</b>, whereby a good sound listening state with a high sound pressure and high directivity for the listener <b>100</b> can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">However, the speaker device <b>1</b> is not limited to being disposed above the display <b>20</b>, and may be disposed at any position as long as the speaker device <b>1</b> is located outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>outside the outer periphery of the display <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Due to the configuration in which the speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>as described above, the speaker device <b>1</b> is less likely to enter the field of vision of the viewer <b>100</b> viewing the video and the image displayed on the display surface <b>21</b>, whereby the visibility for the viewer <b>100</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, the reflector <b>2</b> is also not limited to being disposed above the display <b>20</b>, and may be disposed at any position as long as the reflector <b>2</b> is located outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>outside the outer periphery of the display <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Due to the configuration in which the reflector <b>2</b> as well as the speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>as described above, the speaker device <b>1</b> and the reflector <b>2</b> are less likely to enter the field of vision of the viewer <b>100</b> viewing the video and the image displayed on the display surface <b>21</b>, whereby the visibility for the viewer <b>100</b> can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Note that, although the above description indicates an example in which the focal point F<b>2</b> at which the sound image is localized is positioned directly in front of the central part M of the display surface <b>21</b>, the focal point F<b>2</b> is not limited to being positioned directly in front of the central part M, and may be located at any position within the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The position of the focal point F<b>2</b> can be set by appropriately changing the lengths of the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipsoid constituting the reflector <b>2</b>, the positional relationship between the reflector <b>2</b> and the display <b>20</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, the output angle (coverage angle) of the sound from the speaker device <b>1</b> is set, for example, within a range equal to or less than the nominal coverage angle. Therefore, the reflector <b>2</b> only needs to be formed in such a size that the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> reflects the sound output within a range equal to or less than the nominal coverage angle. Since the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> is formed to have a size for reflecting the sound output within a range equal to or less than the nominal coverage angle, the reflector <b>2</b> can be downsized, and the viewer <b>100</b> can listen to the sound at a high sound pressure.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">It is to be noted, however, that the output angle of the sound from the speaker device <b>1</b> may be set within a range equal to or less than the effective coverage angle. In this case, the reflector <b>2</b> can be further downsized, and the viewer <b>100</b> can listen to the sound at a higher sound pressure.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Note that, when the sound is output rearward from the speaker device <b>1</b>, a part of the output sound does not travel toward the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>, but travels around the speaker device <b>1</b> and is propagated forward or obliquely downward and forward (see an arrow A), and may reach the viewer <b>100</b> earlier than the sound reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In that case, a shielding wall <b>30</b>, for example, may be disposed at a position where the sound traveling around the speaker device <b>1</b> is propagated (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The shielding wall <b>30</b> is disposed, for example, below the speaker device <b>1</b>, and may also be disposed lateral to or in front of the speaker device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Due to the configuration provided with the shielding wall <b>30</b> that shields a sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> and not reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> as described above, the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> and not reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> is shielded by the shielding wall <b>30</b> and is less likely to reach the viewer <b>100</b>. Therefore, the display position of the video displayed on the display <b>20</b> and the output position of the sound are brought into alignment with each other, whereby a comfortable viewing state without discomfort can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although the above description indicates, as an example, the speaker system <b>10</b> including the speaker device <b>1</b> disposed in an orientation so that a sound is output rearward, a speaker system <b>10</b>X (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), for example, may be used that includes the speaker device <b>1</b> disposed in an orientation so that a sound is output rearward and obliquely downward.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Due to the configuration in which a sound is output rearward and obliquely downward from the speaker device <b>1</b>, it is possible to propagate the sound in a necessary direction by effectively utilizing the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b>, even when the sound output from the speaker device <b>1</b> has a small output angle.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Furthermore, due to the configuration in which a sound is output rearward and obliquely downward from the speaker device <b>1</b>, the speaker device <b>1</b> having a small sound output angle can be used, whereby it is possible to enlarge the range of choices of the usable speaker device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">On the other hand, a speaker system <b>10</b>Y may be used instead of the speaker system <b>10</b> so that the sound is propagated more upward from the virtual sound source (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The speaker system <b>10</b>Y includes the speaker device <b>1</b> disposed in an orientation so that a sound is output rearward and a reflector <b>2</b>Y which is larger than the reflector <b>2</b> of the speaker system <b>10</b> in size in the vertical direction. In the reflector <b>2</b>Y, a midpoint T between the focal point F<b>1</b> and the focal point F<b>2</b> is positioned above the display <b>20</b>, for example. Therefore, the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> has a large area in the major axis direction, so that a region where a sound can be reflected is large. Thus, a sound output at a larger angle is also reflected by the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> and collected at the focal point F<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above, in the speaker system <b>10</b>Y, the midpoint T between the focal point F<b>1</b> and the focal point F<b>2</b> on the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> is positioned outside the region of the projection surface <b>21</b><i>a, </i>whereby the sound is easily propagated upward from the virtual sound source as compared with a case where the sound is output rearward from the speaker device <b>1</b>. Thus, the viewer <b>100</b> located on a higher position can listen to the sound with a high sound pressure.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, in order to propagate the sound more upwardly from the virtual sound source as in the speaker system <b>10</b>Y, a speaker system <b>10</b>Z may be used (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the speaker system <b>10</b>Z, the reflector <b>2</b> is inclined so that the front side is raised with respect to the vertical direction, and the major axis is inclined so that the front side is raised with respect to the display <b>20</b>. The speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed in an orientation so that a sound is output rearward and obliquely downward according to the inclination state of the reflector <b>2</b>. Since the reflector <b>2</b> is inclined, a midpoint T between the focal point F<b>1</b> and the focal point F<b>2</b> is positioned, for example, above the display <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the speaker system <b>10</b>Z, the reflector <b>2</b> is inclined so that the front side is raised. Therefore, as in the speaker system <b>10</b>Y, a sound is easily propagated upward from the virtual sound source as compared with the configuration in which a sound is output rearward from the speaker device <b>1</b>, whereby the viewer <b>100</b> located on a higher position can listen to the sound at a high sound pressure.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition, the major axis of the elliptical reflection surface <b>3</b> is inclined with respect to the display surface <b>21</b> of the display <b>20</b>, so that the sound from the virtual sound source can be output in a direction according to the inclination direction of the major axis. Thus, a satisfactory sound listening state can be ensured.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Speaker System According to Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Next, a speaker system <b>10</b>A according to a second embodiment will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Note that, since the speaker system <b>10</b>A according to the second embodiment has the same basic configuration as the speaker system <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment, only differences from the speaker system <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment will be described in detail (the same applies to the following description of speaker systems according to third to tenth embodiments).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The speaker system <b>10</b>A includes a speaker device <b>1</b> and a plurality of reflectors <b>2</b>, for example, two reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The speaker device <b>1</b> is disposed in an orientation so that a sound is output forward.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Both the reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> are disposed above a display <b>20</b> and are located outside the region of a projection surface <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> are vertically displaced from each other.
