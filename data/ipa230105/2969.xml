recent years in some countries increasingly stringent regulations have been introduced which require the almost total absence of non-cellulose materials in recycled paper.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">These restrictions have created considerable difficulties, both for exporters who are unable to have materials that comply with the regulations, and for paper mills which purchase waste paper and cardboard in large volumes from the latter, especially in imports and exports.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In fact, with the new limits, especially in the Chinese market, waste paper import licenses have almost disappeared and the market in some sectors in China is now suffering a major shortage of raw material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">In other words, the market demand of these sectors in China is now geared to contaminant-free paper and cardboard, but also to quality paper pulp.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The aim of the

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0025">With reference to the figures, the machine according to the disclosure, particularly for producing cellulose fiber from waste paper, generally designated with the reference numeral <b>1</b>, comprises at least one conveyor body <b>2</b> which is adapted to receive waste material, such as paper, cardboard and the like, from which to obtain cellulose fiber and at least one drum <b>3</b> which contains inside it grinding means <b>4</b> adapted to grind the waste material for the production of cellulose fiber.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">In more detail, the conveyor body <b>2</b>, which is connected to the drum <b>3</b>, comprises a first, vertical portion <b>5</b> into which the waste material is loaded by gravity and a second, horizontal portion <b>6</b> which is consecutive to the first, vertical portion <b>5</b> along the advancement direction of the waste material and contains inside it a motorized screw feeder <b>7</b> for the controlled and uniform advancement of the waste material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">Conveniently, the second, horizontal portion <b>6</b> ends, along the advancement direction of the waste material, with an open section that lies above the drum <b>3</b> for the falling by gravity of the waste material into the drum <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">With regard to the drum <b>3</b>, this can be made of carbon steel (and therefore can be executed in wear-resistant material) or of stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">Based on the level of humidity of the material fed in, it may be necessary to have smooth or mirrored surfaces in the drum with no sharp corners smaller than 90&#xb0;, but with rounded corners, in order to prevent packing of the material and/or the snagging and buildup thereof in unwanted areas.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">The drum <b>3</b> can also be covered internally with ceramic to minimize the packing effect described above.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">According to the disclosure, the grinding means <b>4</b> comprise a grinding hammer <b>8</b> which is arranged on the bottom of the drum <b>3</b> and can rotate by way of motor means <b>9</b> about a rotation axis <b>10</b> which is oriented substantially parallel to the direction of falling of the waste material from the conveyor body <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">More specifically, the grinding hammer <b>8</b> comprises a conical body <b>11</b> that extends along the rotation axis <b>10</b> and with the vertex directed toward the conveyor body <b>2</b> for the breakup of the falling waste material, and comprises at least two mauls <b>12</b> which are mutually opposite with respect to the rotation axis <b>10</b> and are adapted to strike the waste material with consequent grinding thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">Advantageously, such mauls <b>12</b> are provided with wear-prevention inserts <b>13</b> of the removable type.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">Moreover, the grinding means <b>4</b> comprise a plurality of fixed slats <b>14</b> which are associated with the side walls of the drum <b>3</b> peripherally to the workspace of the grinding hammer <b>8</b> for a further grinding of the waste material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">In more detail, the fixed slats <b>14</b>, which are associated with at least two wear-prevention sectors <b>15</b> which are removably associated with the side walls of the drum <b>3</b>, can be arranged in an inclined manner and at a controlled distance from the grinding hammer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">A larger number of fixed slats <b>14</b> entails a greater friction for the grinding, therefore the individual sector can contain more or fewer of them.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">The sectors in the drum can number from two to six, as many as necessary to cover the drum for 360&#xb0;.

This is due to the number of impacts of the grinding hammer <b>8</b> on the slats at each turn.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">Subsequently the grinding hammer <b>8</b> can decrease the RPM, also to allow the material to sink fully into the lower part of the drum where in the meantime the exit port arranged in the lower part of the drum <b>3</b> is opened and allows the material to exit.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The grinding action produces heat which is dissipated through the chamber <b>18</b> arranged outside the base of the drum <b>3</b> at the slats <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">Any steam that may be created in the drum <b>3</b> is evacuated through venting pipes <b>20</b> located in its upper part.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">As mentioned previously, the grinding hammer <b>8</b> rotates at a distance from the fixed slats <b>14</b> that varies based on the dimensions of the mauls <b>12</b>. That is to say, the length of the grinding hammer is smaller than the diameter that is measured on the innermost end of the fixed slats <b>14</b>, leaving an amount of play which can oscillate from 1 millimeter up to 60 millimeters.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">In order to contain the costs of wear, the grinding hammer <b>8</b> is provided with easily replaceable and removable wear-prevention inserts <b>13</b>; this furthermore makes it possible to reduce machine shutdown times and running costs.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The grinding hammer <b>8</b> with its removable wear-prevention inserts <b>13</b> can also be prepared on a bench for a faster replacement.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">The rotation of the grinding hammer <b>8</b> and the inclination of the fixed slats <b>14</b> ensure that the material is projected upward and falls back down toward the bottom, in the most central zone, creating a rotational vortex.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">Since the material is light, its natural rotation created by the above mentioned vortex tends to make the material stay in the upper part, as a consequence increasing the retention time necessary for full grinding.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">Since the specific weight of the broken-up cardboard is higher than the specific weight of the cellulose fiber produced, it becomes necessary to have a drum <b>3</b> with a volume such that it will be reasonably filled with the lighter material. This is why it is necessary to feed broken-up cardboard for approximately half of the volume that is necessary to contain the same weight of cellulose fiber.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">The material exits by centrifugal force and, by way of a screw feeder or with a conveyor belt, is lifted to be taken away or to be fed to a second drum, then optionally a third drum and even a fourth drum.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">The number of drums determines the processing capacity of the system in that for the same retention time and, as a consequence, for the process, the system makes it possible to require a shorter time to load the same quantity.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">It follows from this that for the same retention time, two drums produce double the amount of one, three drums triple the amount and so on.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">The sequence of multiple drums makes it possible to convert the process from a batch process to a continuous or semi-continuous process.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">The retention time varies from 10 to 180 seconds as a function of the different types of material to be processed, its size range for feeding, and the degree of grinding it is desired to obtain.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">The process is monitored by temperature and pressure sensors <b>25</b> (these are generated by the humidity of the material which is converted to steam) located inside the drum <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">The data are constantly read by a PLC system that monitors the steps of the process. The process can be managed manually or automatically.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">At the end of the process, the material is unloaded from the machine <b>1</b> to be sent to the subsequent processing steps such as for example pressing in order to reduce its volume and optimize its transport.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">The compaction press can be of the horizontal type typically used for paper, cardboard or waste in general, with binding with metallic or plastic filaments and/or covering with film.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">Compaction is also possible with vertical presses in order to form bales which are contained in heat-shrunk bags or covered in film, as occurs in the pressing of peat or of topsoil.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">The size range for feeding can be at most 200 millimeters and the finer the size range, the greater will be the yield of the plant and its production capacity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">The humidity of the waste material must be less than 20%.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">The machine <b>1</b> can accept paper and cardboard, with a maximum 15% of unwanted materials like plastics, inert materials, wood, textiles or glue, which are typical of contamination from broken-up separated waste originating from different sources.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">In fact, the permitted tolerance of contaminant materials is 15%, of which materials that are dangerous to the system (like stones, metals, wood with a maximum size range of 30 millimeters) cannot exceed 2%.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">In practice it has been found that the machine according to the disclosure, particularly for producing cellulose fiber from waste paper, achieves the intended aim and objects in that it makes it possible to obtain cellulose fiber while increasing productive efficiency in the step of pulping in paper mills by 15/25%, in that the time/cycle of the pulper is reduced by these percentages as an effect of having fed in a material that is already in the fibrous state and not in the solid state, like cardboard.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">The consequence of this reduction of time and the less effort required to dissolve the cardboard in water is an energy saving of 10-20%.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">In fact, the ground-down product obtained is dry by virtue of the evaporation of water and the residual humidity close to 0%, and the appearance of the material in output is no longer recognizable as that of the cardboard in input.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">In other words, the machine according to the disclosure makes it possible to obtain cellulose fiber from the mechanical grinding of paper and cardboard in the absence of water. During the process the material changes appearance and characteristics because it is converted to cellulose fiber with properties similar to those of virgin cellulose fiber.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0079">By virtue of the grinding hammer, which is not a shredder that cuts the material, but a grinder, it is possible to separate the fibers of cellulose, leaving them in their original length.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0080">Moreover, the paper fiber obtained from the machine according to the present disclosure can be used with optimal yields in different areas.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">For example, this paper fiber can be used in paper mills for recycling, in which this represents a quality raw material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">This characteristic makes it possible for the paper fiber to be exported to those countries that in recent years have imposed strict limits on the characteristics of paper and cardboard for recycling.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">Moreover, the paper fiber obtained from the machine according to the present disclosure can be used for the production of substrates and topsoil.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">In fact, since the paper fiber is a light material, this is capable of retaining water and it is also sustainable and easily mixed with other components of substrates like peat, wood fiber, rice husks, perlite, compost or sawdust, and it can be used in the blends that make up topsoil and substrates for cultivation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">Paper fiber is not phytotoxic and it can be sold loose or in bags.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">Finally, the paper fiber obtained from the machine according to the present disclosure can also be used as an absorbent material for industrial spills, both of liquids and of sludge.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">The characteristics of lightness and porosity enable the paper fiber to absorb liquid or doughy materials using small amounts of material, which will then need to be disposed of subsequently together with the absorbed contaminant.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0088">In this case too, paper fiber can be sold loose or in bags.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0089">The machine is also capable of grinding other, different materials, taken individually or variously mixed together, such as wood, straw, brushwood, discarded material from pruning, and other organic discarded materials suitably broken down.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0090">The machine, particularly for producing cellulose fiber from waste paper, thus conceived, is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0091">Moreover, all the details may be substituted by other, technically equivalent elements.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0092">For example, the shape of the grinding hammer, and also the volume of the drum, can have different shapes and volumes in order to adapt to the varying of the specific weight of the material and as a consequence of the volume to be processed in the drum and of the grinding action that occurs between the grinding hammer and the slats arranged at the base of the drum.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0093">In practice the materials employed, provided they are compatible with the specific use, and the contingent dimensions and shapes, may be any according to requirements.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
