As shown, the lamination process includes assembling the LC panel component layers into a stack. The various component layers, including a first glass layer, a first interlayer, an LC cell, a second interlayer, and a second glass layer are placed into contact with one another to form the stack. The interlayer is selected from the group of: polymers and ionomers. As a non-limiting example, the interlayer comprises PVB (polyvinyl butyral) at a thickness of 0.76 mm.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the lamination process includes removing any entrapped or entrained air between the various layers of the stack to form a curable stack. Non-limiting examples of air removal include: nip rolling, using an evacuation pouch, vacuuming via at least one vacuum ring, or a laminating via a flatbed laminator.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Laminating is completed on the curable stack in order to bond the first glass layer and the second glass layer to major surfaces of the LC cell (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, generally opposing major surfaces of the LC cell via the corresponding first and second interlayers, which attach (e.g. bond) the first glass layer onto the first surface of the LC cell and the second glass layer on the second side of the LC cell.

After laminating for a duration of time, at a temperature, and under a target pressure, the curable stack is formed into a liquid crystal (LC) panel.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a non-limiting example, the LC panel is made into a liquid crystal window by configuring a seal and a frame around an outer edge of the LC panel, to retain the LC panel within the frame. Additionally, electrical communication is configured from a power supply to the electrodes so that the LC window can be actuated via an electrical field directed across the LC window via the electrodes, conductive layers, and LC material.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a schematic embodiment of an LC cell configured with respect to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to the following figure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> generally depicts some embodiments of methods to configure the LC cell with more rigid and/or stiffer configuration, so as to withstand the stresses imparted on the LC cell by the tempered SLG layer or layers during manufacture, so as to prevent, reduce, and/or eliminate dark spots. Non-limiting examples include: increasing the thickness of the first sheet of glass (thin glass) in the LC cell; increasing the thickness of the second sheet of glass (e.g. thin glass) in the LC cell; varying the density of spacers (e.g. increasing the number per unit area of spacers in one or more region or regions of the LC cell); varying the modulus of the spacers (e.g. increasing the modulus of the spacers to promote rigidity in the LC area; corresponding the CTE of the first glass sheet in the LC cell to the first glass layer (e.g. thick tempered SLG) in the LC panel (e.g. using Gorilla Glass or Iris Glass as the first sheet of glass and/or second sheet of thin glass); increase or decrease LC fill to thereby impart a pressurized LC cell (e.g. sealed control volume includes a positive or negative pressure); and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the thickness of the first glass sheet in the LC cell is not greater than 1 mm thick. In one embodiment, the thickness of the second glass sheet in the LC cell is not greater than 1 mm thick. In one embodiment, the first glass sheet of the LC cell is selected from: Gorilla Glass and Iris Glass when the first glass layer of the LC panel is a tempered SLG. In one embodiment, the second glass sheet of the LC cell is selected from Gorilla Glass and Iris Glass when the second glass layer of the panel is a tempered SLG.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the liquid crystal (LC) material is sandwiched between two pieces of commercially available fusion formed borosilicate glass, such as Corning EAGLE XG to form the liquid crystal cell. However, such glass has thickness &#x3c;1 mm, and so is not rigid enough to withstand exposure to the wind and snow loads commonly experienced by large-dimensioned windows in architectural applications. As such, liquid crystal windows of the present disclosure include an LC cell having thin glass (e.g. less than 1 mm), which are laminated to thick (&#x3e;3 mm) pieces of soda lime glass (SLG) for additional strength and/or support. The SLG is tempered (per ASTM C1048) for additional strength and breakage protection, however, the tempering process is known to induce out-of-plane distortion in the SLG, which can be significant, impacting the LC panel.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">After lamination, if the thin glass(es) from the LC cell is well-adhered to the SLG, the out-of-plane distortion from the SLG can pull on the thin glass, which may drive stresses acting on the LC cell, including locally increasing the LC cell gap and/or producing undesirable local changes in visual appearance. The LC panel or resulting LC window can have spots of non-uniform transmission, or regions having 2% or greater variation in visible light transmission relative to the average visible light transmission across the visible area of the panel (e.g. dark spots or light spots). Without being bound by any particular mechanism or theory, non-uniform transmission areas or regions are believed to be attributed to a thicker cell gap in the LC cell, which is generated during manufacturing of the LC window.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">One or more advantages of using thin glass to fabricate the LC cell include: (a) compatibility with existing LCD fabrication equipment; lower window weight, making it easier to transport and install and lowering overall carbon footprint; higher visible light transmission in the clear state; thinner overall window structures, and/or additional room for gas in an IGU, thereby improving the insulation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards configurations and methods for reducing, preventing, and/or eliminating areas or regions of non-uniform transmission (e.g. dark spots or light spots) in an LC panel. Thus, one or more LC panels of the present disclosure are configured with uniform transmission (e.g. regions at no greater than 2% variation in visible light transmission relative to the average visible light transmission across an adjacent area (visible area) of the window).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, dark spots or light spots (&#x2018;spots&#x2019;) are detectable by visual observation (in a static mode of the liquid crystal window, spots, if any are detectable in at least one of the first contrast state and the second contrast state, where the contrast states are an on position and an off position.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a spot means that transmission of the window in a region is greater than 2% lower transmission in the dark spot region, as compared to the surrounding, non-dark spot region.
