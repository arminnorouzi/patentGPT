The range of frequencies passed by a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; of the filter. The range of frequencies stopped by such a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; of the filter. A typical RF filter has at least one pass-band and at least one stop-band. Specific requirements on a passband or stop-band depend on the specific application. For example, a &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the insertion loss of a filter is better than a defined value such as 1 dB, 2 dB, or 3 dB. A &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the rejection of a filter is greater than a defined value such as 20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB, or greater depending on application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">RF filters are used in communications systems where information is transmitted over wireless links. For example, RF filters may be found in the RF front-ends of cellular base stations, mobile telephone and computing devices, satellite transceivers and ground stations, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, laptop computers and tablets, fixed point radio links, and other communications systems. RF filters are also used in radar and electronic and information warfare systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">RF filters typically require many design trade-offs to achieve, for each specific application, the best compromise between performance parameters such as insertion loss, rejection, isolation, power handling, linearity, size and cost. Specific design and manufacturing methods and enhancements can benefit simultaneously one or several of these requirements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Performance enhancements to the RF filters in a wireless system can have broad impact to system performance. Improvements in RF filters can be leveraged to provide system performance improvements such as larger cell size, longer battery life, higher data rates, greater network capacity, lower cost, enhanced security, higher reliability, etc. These improvements can be realized at many levels of the wireless system both separately and in combination, for example at the RF module, RF transceiver, mobile or fixed sub-system, or network levels.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">High performance RF filters for present communication systems commonly incorporate acoustic wave resonators including surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators, film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBAR), and other types of acoustic resonators. However, these existing technologies are not well-suited for use at the higher frequencies and bandwidths proposed for future communications networks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The desire for wider communication channel bandwidths will inevitably lead to the use of higher frequency communications bands. Radio access technology for mobile telephone networks has been standardized by the 3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project). Radio access technology for 5<sup>th </sup>generation mobile networks is defined in the 5G NR (new radio) standard. The 5G NR standard defines several new communications bands. Two of these new communications bands are n77, which uses the frequency range from 3300 MHz to 4200 MHz, and n79, which uses the frequency range from 4400 MHz to 5000 MHz. Both band n77 and band n79 use time-division duplexing (TDD), such that a communications device operating in band n77 and/or band n79 use the same frequencies for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Bandpass filters for bands n77 and n79 must be capable of handling the transmit power of the communications device. WiFi bands at 5 GHz and 6 GHz also require high frequency and wide bandwidth. The 5G NR standard also defines millimeter wave communication bands with frequencies between 24.25 GHz and 40 GHz.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Transversely-Excited Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (XBAR) is an acoustic resonator structure for use in microwave filters. The XBAR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,491,291, titled TRANSVERSELY EXCITED FILM BULK ACOUSTIC RESONATOR. An XBAR resonator comprises an interdigital transducer (IDT) formed on a thin floating layer, or diaphragm, of a single-crystal piezoelectric material. The IDT includes a first set of parallel fingers, extending from a first busbar and a second set of parallel fingers extending from a second busbar. The first and second sets of parallel fingers are interleaved. A microwave signal applied to the IDT excites a shear primary acoustic wave in the piezoelectric diaphragm. XBAR resonators provide very high electromechanical coupling and high frequency capability. XBAR resonators may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers. XBARs are well suited for use in filters for communications bands with frequencies above 3 GHz.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a schematic plan view and two schematic cross-sectional views of a transversely-excited film bulk acoustic resonator (XBAR).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an expanded schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of the XBAR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an alternative schematic cross-sectional view of an XBAR.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a graphical illustration of the primary acoustic mode of interest in an XBAR.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram and layout for a high frequency band-pass filter using XBARs.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an XBAR with the piezoelectric plate over the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an improved XBAR with the piezoelectric plate removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an improved XBAR with the piezoelectric plate and bonding oxide (BOX) layer removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a table showing a bump thermal resistance analysis of XBAR devices with and without the piezoelectric plate removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> (collectively &#x201c;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>&#x201d;) are a flow chart of a process for fabricating an XBAR with the piezoelectric plate removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> (collectively &#x201c;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>&#x201d;) are a flow chart of a process for fabricating an XBAR with the piezoelectric plate and bonding oxide (BOX) layer removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an improved XBAR with the piezoelectric plate removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads and thermal vias.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Throughout this description, elements appearing in figures are assigned three-digit or four-digit reference designators, where the two least significant digits are specific to the element and the one or two most significant digit is the figure number where the element is first introduced.

An XBAR resonator may be such a diaphragm or membrane with an interdigital transducer (IDT) formed on a diaphragm or membrane. Contact pads can be formed at selected locations over the surface of the substrate to provide electrical connections between the IDT and contact bumps to be attached to or formed on the contact pads.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The primary mechanism for removing heat from the XBAR diaphragm is conduction through the IDT fingers to the substrate and then from the substrate through the contact pads and contact bumps to a package that houses the XBAR. However, the contact pads and other conductors of the conductor pattern are separated from the substrate by the piezoelectric layer and usually a layer of bonding oxide (BOX). The low thermal conductivity of the piezoelectric layer and BOX layer presents a substantial barrier to efficient heat removal from the substrate and through the contact pads and bumps.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following describes improved XBAR resonators, filters and fabrication techniques for XBAR resonators that efficiently conduct heat from the substrate and through the contact pads by having the piezoelectric plate removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device or substrate beneath each of the contact pads to provide lower thermal resistance between the contact bumps and the substrate. Removing the plate may reduce substrate to bump thermal resistance for the XBAR resonator by creating a thermal via under contact pads and to a bonding oxide layer or an electrically isolating layer that is in contact with the substrate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a simplified schematic top view and orthogonal cross-sectional views of a transversely-excited film bulk acoustic resonator (XBAR) <b>100</b>. XBAR resonators such as the resonator <b>100</b> may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers. XBARs are particularly suited for use in filters for communications bands with frequencies above 3 GHz.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The XBAR <b>100</b> is made up of a thin film conductor pattern formed on a surface of a piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> having parallel front and back surfaces <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, respectively. The piezoelectric plate is a thin single-crystal layer of a piezoelectric material such as lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, lanthanum gallium silicate, gallium nitride, or aluminum nitride. The piezoelectric plate is cut such that the orientation of the X, Y, and Z crystalline axes with respect to the front and back surfaces is known and consistent. In the examples presented, the piezoelectric plates may be Z-cut, which is to say the Z axis is normal to the surfaces. However, XBARs may be fabricated on piezoelectric plates with other crystallographic orientations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The back surface <b>114</b> of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> is attached to a substrate <b>120</b> that provides mechanical support to the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. The substrate <b>120</b> may be, for example, silicon, sapphire, quartz, or some other material. The substrate may have layers or predetermined areas of an electrically insulating material, such as of silicon thermal oxide (TOX), SiO2, polycrystalline silicon, and/or another dielectric material. The back surface <b>114</b> of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> or a diaphragm <b>115</b> including the plate may be bonded to the substrate <b>120</b> using a wafer bonding process, or grown on the substrate <b>120</b>, or attached to the substrate in some other manner. The piezoelectric plate is attached directly to the substrate or may be attached to the substrate via a bonding oxide layer <b>122</b>, such as a bonding oxide (BOX) layer of SiO2, or another oxide such as Al2O3.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The conductor pattern of the XBAR <b>100</b> includes an interdigital transducer (IDT) <b>130</b>. The IDT <b>130</b> includes a first plurality of parallel fingers, such as finger <b>136</b>, extending from a first busbar <b>132</b> and a second plurality of fingers extending from a second busbar <b>134</b>. The first and second pluralities of parallel fingers are interleaved. The interleaved fingers <b>136</b> overlap for a distance AP, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;aperture&#x201d; of the IDT. The center-to-center distance L between the outermost fingers of the IDT <b>130</b> is the &#x201c;length&#x201d; of the IDT.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first and second busbars <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> serve as the terminals or electrodes of the XBAR <b>100</b>. A radio frequency or microwave signal applied between the two busbars <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> of the IDT <b>130</b> excites a primary acoustic mode within the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. As will be discussed in further detail, the excited primary acoustic mode is a bulk shear mode where acoustic energy propagates along a direction substantially orthogonal to the surface of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>, which is also normal, or transverse, to the direction of the electric field created by the IDT fingers.

The BOX layer may exist between the plate and substrate around perimeter <b>145</b> and may extend further away from the cavity than just within the perimeter itself. In the absence of a process to remove it (i.e., this invention) the BOX layer is everywhere between the piezoelectric plate and the substrate. The BOX layer is typically removed from the back of the diaphragm <b>115</b> as part of forming the cavity. The IDT <b>130</b> is positioned on the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> such that at least the fingers <b>136</b> of the IDT <b>130</b> are disposed on the diaphragm <b>115</b> of the piezoelectric plate that spans, or is suspended over, the cavity <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For ease of presentation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the geometric pitch and width of the IDT fingers is greatly exaggerated with respect to the length (dimension L) and aperture (dimension AP) of the XBAR.

The piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> is a single-crystal layer of piezoelectrical material having a thickness ts. The ts may be, for example, 100 nm to 1500 nm.

The &#x201c;front side&#x201d; of the XBAR is, by definition, the surface facing away from the substrate. The front-side dielectric layer <b>214</b> has a thickness tfd. The front-side dielectric layer <b>214</b> is formed between the IDT fingers <b>236</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the front side dielectric layer <b>214</b> may also be deposited over the IDT fingers <b>236</b>.

The back-side dielectric layer <b>216</b> has a thickness tbd. The front-side and back-side dielectric layers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> may be a non-piezoelectric dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. The tfd and tbd may be, for example, 0 to 500 nm. tfd and tbd are typically less than the thickness ts of the piezoelectric plate. The tfd and tbd are not necessarily equal, and the front-side and bawrlck-side dielectric layers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> are not necessarily the same material. Either or both of the front-side and back-side dielectric layers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> may be formed of multiple layers of two or more materials.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The front side dielectric layer <b>214</b> may be formed over the IDTs of some (e.g., selected ones) of the XBAR devices in a filter. The front side dielectric <b>214</b> may be formed between and cover the IDT finger of some XBAR devices but not be formed on other XBAR devices. For example, a front side frequency-setting dielectric layer may be formed over the IDTs of shunt resonators to lower the resonance frequencies of the shunt resonators with respect to the resonance frequencies of series resonators, which have thinner or no front side dielectric. Some filters may include two or more different thicknesses of front side dielectric over various resonators. The resonance frequency of the resonators can be set thus &#x201c;tuning&#x201d; the resonator, at least in part, by selecting a thicknesses of the front side dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, a passivation layer may be formed over the entire surface of the XBAR device <b>100</b> except for contact pads where electric connections are made to circuitry external to the XBAR device. The passivation layer is a thin dielectric layer intended to seal and protect the surfaces of the XBAR device while the XBAR device is incorporated into a package.

Thin (relative to the total thickness of the conductors) layers of other metals, such as chromium or titanium, may be formed under and/or over the fingers to improve adhesion between the fingers and the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> and/or to passivate or encapsulate the fingers. The busbars (<b>132</b>, <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the IDT may be made of the same or different materials as the fingers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Dimension p is the center-to-center spacing or &#x201c;pitch&#x201d; of the IDT fingers, which may be referred to as the pitch of the IDT and/or the pitch of the XBAR. Dimension w is the width or &#x201c;mark&#x201d; of the IDT fingers. The IDT of an XBAR differs substantially from the IDTs used in surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators. In a SAW resonator, the pitch of the IDT is one-half of the acoustic wavelength at the resonance frequency. Additionally, the mark-to-pitch ratio of a SAW resonator IDT is typically close to 0.5 (i.e. the mark or finger width is about one-fourth of the acoustic wavelength at resonance). In an XBAR, the pitch p of the IDT is typically 2 to 20 times the width w of the fingers. In addition, the pitch p of the IDT is typically 2 to 20 times the thickness is of the piezoelectric slab <b>212</b>. The width of the IDT fingers in an XBAR is not constrained to one-fourth of the acoustic wavelength at resonance. For example, the width of XBAR IDT fingers may be 500 nm or greater, such that the IDT can be fabricated using optical lithography.

The material stack-up of or at the XBAR contact pads can be a contact bump of gold (Au) having a thickness (e.g., up and down directions on the paper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>) of 0.5 um, contact pad of aluminum (Al) having a thickness 0.3-0.5 um, a piezoelectric plate of lithium niobium (<b>0</b>) having a thickness of 0.2-1.0 um, a bonding oxide layer of silicon oxide (SiO2) having a thickness of 1-2 um (e.g., BOX layer <b>422</b> or <b>572</b>; or isolating layer <b>551</b>), and a base substrate of silicon (Si) having a thickness of 250-500 um. The total thermal resistance is the aggregate of the intrinsic resistance of each material. Alternately, the SiO2 bonding layer might be replaced by a polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) bonding layer having a thickness of 1 um-10 um (e.g., BOX layer <b>422</b> or <b>572</b>).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For XBAR <b>400</b>, the primary mechanism for removing heat from the XBAR diaphragm <b>415</b>, such as heat generated by the IDT and plate over cavity <b>440</b> is conduction through the IDT fingers <b>436</b> to the substrate <b>420</b> and then from the substrate through the contact pads <b>432</b>/<b>434</b> and contact bumps <b>480</b> and <b>481</b> to a package of the XBAR (not shown but attached to the contact bumps and housing the XBAR).

The low thermal conductivity of the piezoelectric layer and BOX layer presents a substantial barrier to efficient heat removal from the substrate and through the contact pads and bumps, to the package.

This removal will create a via hole or opening in the LiNbO3 plate substrate, which then allows direct contact of the Au contact bump and Al contact pad layers to the SiO2 BOX layer to provide lower thermal resistance between the contact bumps and the substrate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For BOX layers exceeding 1-2 um in thickness, this thermal resistance can be further improved by removing or thinning the BOX layer material under the contact pads, as well (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>8</b>A</figref>-C). Removing the BOX layer and plate layer forms a thermal via that extends from the contact pad into an electrically isolating layer or into the substrate to provide lower thermal resistance between the contact bumps and the substrate.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an improved XBAR <b>500</b> with the piezoelectric plate <b>410</b> removed from a least a portion of the surface area of the device beneath the contact pads <b>532</b> and <b>534</b> to provide lower thermal resistance between the contact bumps and the substrate.

One advantage of using vias <b>915</b> is that it is easier to define thermal vias <b>915</b> during the prior described processes of etching the plate, forming the IDT and forming the contact pads; than to do any additional photolithography processing steps such as to flow additional metal to lower thermal resistance between the air and substrate, in addition to the processes describe above.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">CLOSING COMMENTS</heading><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Throughout this description, the embodiments and examples shown should be considered as exemplars, rather than limitations on the apparatus and procedures disclosed or claimed.
