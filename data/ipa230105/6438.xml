In order for a relay to change status, a coil of the relay is activated or deactivated, which typically comes from an external event, such as loss of voltage, over current, ground fault detection, push button activation, or position of an upstream hand switch.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some relay coils are integrated with a freewheeling diode for suppressing spikes cause by an inductive load to avoid damaging MOSFET/transistor or other integrated circuits connected therewith. Furthermore, some relays are pin symmetrical/mirrored. As a result, it is possible to insert relays in the wrong orientation. The diode of the relay may cause a short circuit, which damages the relay coil or printed circuit board (PCB) traces in the case the relay is mounted on a PCB.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need, therefore, for a relay assembly capable of preventing an over current by short circuit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one approach, a relay assembly may include a relay socket receiving a relay, a power source connected to the relay socket, and a positive temperature coefficient thermistor (PTC) connected between the relay socket and the power source.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another approach, a relay protection circuit may include a relay socket for receiving pins of a relay, a power source electrically connected to the relay socket, and a positive temperature coefficient thermistor (PTC) electrically connected between the relay socket and the power source.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another approach, a relay assembly may include a relay socket receiving pins of a relay, a power source electrically connected to the relay socket, and a positive temperature coefficient thermistor (PTC) electrically connected between the relay socket and the power source.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The accompanying drawings illustrate exemplary approaches of the disclosed embodiments so far devised for the practical application of the principles thereof, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a perspective view of a relay assembly according to embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a perspective view of the relay of the relay assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a circuit diagram of a portion of the relay assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a circuit diagram of a portion of the relay assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The drawings are not necessarily to scale.

As shown, the assembly <b>100</b> may include a relay socket <b>102</b> for receiving pins <b>104</b> of a relay <b>105</b>. In exemplary embodiments, the pins <b>104</b> of the relay <b>105</b> are symmetrical or mirrored about an axis extending through the relay <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The assembly <b>100</b> may further include a component grid <b>108</b> disposed within a housing <b>109</b>, the component grid <b>108</b> including a plurality of openings <b>112</b>, which define the relay socket <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the assembly may further include a circuit board, such as a PCB <b>110</b>, positioned beneath the component grid <b>108</b>. The PCB <b>110</b> may include a plurality of electrically conductive traces (not shown) formed by a screen printing and/or a chemical etching process. In some embodiments, the PCB <b>110</b> may be made from epoxy or polyimide resins. The resin may be reinforced with a woven glass cloth or other matrix such as chopped fibers. PCBs formed of such materials are typically called FR-4 or G-10 type circuit boards. The PCB may alternately be constructed of ceramic or rigid polymers. This listing of acceptable PCB materials is not exhaustive and other materials may also be used successfully. The materials and manufacturing techniques used to form printed circuit boards are well known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pins <b>104</b> of the relay <b>105</b> may be are electrically coupled to the electrically conductive traces, for example, through pin openings <b>113</b> in the PCB <b>110</b>. In various embodiments, the relay <b>105</b> may be a circuit board mountable electrically controlled mechanical (electromechanical) relay, or a solid-state relay device including a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). The relay <b>105</b> may be any different relay type, e.g. normally open, normally closed, etc., based on the electrical application of the assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a relay protection circuit (hereinafter &#x201c;circuit&#x201d;) <b>150</b> of the assembly <b>100</b> will be described. As shown, the circuit <b>150</b> may include a power source <b>152</b> electrically connected to the relay socket <b>102</b>, and a positive temperature coefficient thermistor (PTC) <b>155</b> electrically connected between the relay socket <b>102</b> and the power source <b>152</b> (e.g., a battery). In some embodiments, the PTC <b>155</b> is resettable to prevent an over current from a short circuit. In some embodiments, the PTC is a polymeric PTC. As shown, the PTC <b>155</b> may be connected to a positive side of the power source <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although non-limiting, the PTC material of the PTC <b>155</b> may be made of a positive temperature coefficient conductive composition comprising a polymer and a conductive filler. The polymer of the PTC material may be a crystalline polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyoctylene, polyvinylidene chloride and a mixture thereof. The conductive filler may be dispersed in the polymer and is selected from the group consisting of carbon black, metal powder, conductive ceramic powder and a mixture thereof.

Because the relay <b>105</b> includes a diode <b>160</b> (e.g., an integrated, freewheeling diode), placement of the pins <b>104</b> within the relay socket <b>102</b> would be critical if not for the presence of the PTC <b>155</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> demonstrates an improper orientation of the relay <b>105</b>. As shown, terminal/pins <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> have been reversed (i.e., rotated by)<b>180</b>&#xb0; , along with the direction of the diode <b>160</b>.
