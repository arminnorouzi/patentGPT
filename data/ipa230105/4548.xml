For example, as used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the terms first, second, third, etc., may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms.

In the depicted implementation, the system <b>100</b> may include a data cloud server <b>105</b> communicatively coupled to a plurality of secure computing environments <b>125</b> external sources <b>112</b> via the network <b>110</b>. The secure computing environments <b>125</b> may in turn be communicatively coupled to a local repository <b>130</b>. While a single data cloud server <b>105</b> is illustrated, the disclosed principles and techniques could be expanded to include multiple data cloud servers <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data cloud server <b>105</b>, according to some embodiments, is configured to store a plurality of structured data in a secure environment requiring authentication before access is granted to the structured data. According to one implementation, the structured data includes hierarchical data having varying and connected categories/levels that describe a plurality of aspects of the structured data. In some cases, the structured data in the data cloud server <b>105</b> is sourced or obtained from third-party scientific sources, and/or from third-party regulatory agencies, and/or from academic sources, and/or from industrial sources, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may be configured to manage or otherwise maintain the integrity and/or version updates of the structured data so that a user (e.g., a user of the secure computing environment) does not have to deal with such data maintenance processes as the structured data changes and/or grows. In one embodiment, the data cloud server <b>105</b> provides the most current version of the structured data to a user of the system. In other embodiments, the data cloud server <b>105</b> can also provide historical versions of the structured data when necessary or needed. Furthermore, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may include mechanisms that execute operations of data decompression operations, data decryption operations, and data decoding operations associated with the structured data so that the user is effectively isolated from such operations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, the data cloud server <b>105</b> allows for easy associating, tagging, or coding of information for retrieval purposes. In some cases, the tagging or coding is automatically executed by the data cloud server <b>105</b>. In addition, the data cloud server <b>105</b> allows a user (e.g., user of the secure computing environment <b>125</b>) to transition from accessing structured data from the local repository <b>130</b> to the data cloud server <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The data cloud server <b>105</b> may be implemented within a computing device such as a mainframe server, a content server, a communication server, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a handheld computing device, a virtual machine, a cloud-based computing solution and/or service, and/or the like. The data cloud server <b>105</b> may include a plurality of computing devices configured to communicate with one another and/or implement the techniques described herein. In some instances, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may include various elements of a computing environment as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and/or <b>2</b>B</figref>. For example, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may include a processing system <b>202</b>, a memory <b>204</b>, an input/output (I/O) system <b>206</b>, and a communication system <b>208</b>. A user (e.g., database administrator) may operate/maintain the data cloud server <b>105</b> either locally or remotely as the case may require.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The data cloud server <b>105</b> may be configured to have storage logic that is executable to store structured data that is shared across multiple secure computing environments <b>125</b>. According to one implementation, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may include a plurality of non-volatile/non-transitory storage media such as solid state storage media, hard disk storage media, virtual storage media, cloud-based storage drives, storage servers, and/or the like. The plurality of storage media may be configured to store data from a plurality of sources. For example, the data cloud server <b>105</b> may include storage logic that is executable to store structured data derived from, for example, medical data, research data, education data, government data, etc. According to some implementations, the storage logic of the data cloud server <b>105</b> may be configured to automatically monitor and/or update relevant structured data obtained from a third-party source. For example, the storage logic of the data cloud server <b>105</b> may periodically monitor updates associated with structured data (e.g., dictionary of medical terms for research and regulatory purposes) from third-party organizations/sources and automatically update different versions of the structured data within one or more storage media of the data cloud server <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, the storage logic of the data cloud server <b>105</b> manipulates or otherwise formats the structured data such that user interfaces generated by a secure computing environment <b>125</b> can seamlessly access/retrieve and present the structured data to a user. In addition, structured data from the data cloud server <b>105</b> may be accessed on a regulated basis via credential access, for example. This regulated basis may be determined, in part, by licenses, privileges, and other levels of authorization dictated by a user's credentials.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The external source <b>112</b> may operate similarly like the data cloud server <b>105</b> including having all the technical features of the data cloud server <b>105</b> described herein. The difference between the external source <b>112</b> and the data cloud server <b>105</b> is the external source <b>112</b> operates in providing information to the data cloud server <b>105</b> when requested. While a single external source <b>112</b> is illustrated, the disclosed principles and techniques could be expanded to include multiple external sources <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The local repository <b>130</b> may include storage logic for storing a local copy of structured data from the data cloud server <b>105</b>. The local repository <b>130</b> may also be configured to store data other than the structured data. For example, the local repository <b>130</b> may store data from third-party sources and other data generated by the secure computing environment <b>125</b>. The local repository may include a plurality of non-volatile/non-transitory storage media such as solid state storage media, hard disk storage media, virtual storage media, cloud-based storage drives, storage servers, and/or the like. According to some embodiments, the local repository <b>130</b> may include logic that updates structured data stored within its storage devices based on updates to structured data stored within the data cloud server <b>105</b>. In some cases, snapshots of structured data may be accessed using the secure computing environment <b>125</b> so that updates associated with the snapshots may be effected on the local repository <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As previously discussed, the network <b>110</b> facilitates communication between the data cloud server <b>105</b>, the external source <b>112</b>, and the secure computing environment <b>125</b>. The network <b>110</b> may also allow different secure computing environments <b>125</b> to communicate with each other. According to one embodiment, the network <b>110</b> may include a plurality of networks. For instance, the network <b>110</b> may include any wired/wireless communication network that facilitates communication between the components of the network system <b>100</b>.
