One of the operations frequently employed is the deposition of a dielectric film into a gap between features patterned over or into silicon substrates.

As device dimensions become smaller in the context of DRAM, flash memory and logic, for example, it has become increasingly difficult to achieve this type of fill.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The background description provided herein is for the purposes of generally presenting the context of the disclosure.

While the disclosed embodiments will be described in conjunction with the specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Provided herein are methods and apparatus for filling gaps with dielectric material. The methods involve deposition using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to fill a gap followed by deposition of a cap layer on the filled gap by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The ALD deposition may be a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) or thermal ALD (tALD) deposition. The CVD deposition may be plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) or thermal CVD (tCVD) deposition. In some embodiments, the CVD deposition is performed in the same chamber as the ALD deposition without intervening process operations. This in-situ deposition of the cap layer results in a high throughput process with high uniformity. After the process, the wafer is ready for chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows operations of a method <b>100</b> according to various embodiments. First, in an operation <b>101</b>, a gap on a substrate is filled with dielectric material using an ALD process. The gap may be characterized by having a high aspect ratio or a narrow opening. Gap geometries depend on the application, with example applications including 3D NAND slit fill, DRAM pen gapfill, and SSL separation mask oxide fill. For 3D NAND slit gapfill, example gap geometries may be depths of 2-10 &#x3bc;m with openings of 200-500 nm. For DRAM applications, example gap geometries may be depths of 75-300 nm and openings of 5-50 nm. Aspect ratios may be 4:1-30:1, for example. It will be appreciated, however, that the methods described herein may be used for fill of gaps of any geometry. Additional applications include, 3D NAND pillar or hole fill, DRAM STI, logic STI, PCRAM STI, MRAM, and logic PMD. As indicated above, the ALD method may be a PEALD or a tALD process. Examples of ALD processes are described further below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The ALD process may be allowed to continue until the gap is completely filled with the dielectric material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a filled gap after operation <b>101</b>. The gap is defined at least in part by sidewalls <b>208</b> that extend from a bottom surface <b>206</b> to a top surface <b>204</b>. The bottom surface <b>206</b> may be a curved or point surface or generally planar surface as depicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The top surface <b>204</b> is typically, though not necessarily, a generally planar surface. A dielectric film <b>202</b> completely fills the gap. The dielectric film is characterized by a divot or gouge <b>201</b>. This gouge <b>201</b> is a result of the conformality ALD process, and in particular, that film at least partially grows from the sidewalls <b>208</b> to the center of the feature. The depth of the gouge <b>201</b> may depend on the ALD process, the gap geometry, and the thickness of the film above the gap. In some embodiments, it is greater than 60 nm, or greater than 100 nm. Operation <b>101</b> is performed at least until the gouge vertex is above the top surface <b>206</b>, and may at least 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, or 500 nm above the top surface. This ensures that during subsequent planarization, the gap remains filled. Left alone, however, the gouge can cause problems in subsequent processing, including in subsequent CMP, etch, or photolithography operations. During etch and CMP steps, the gouge can cause an uneven amount of material to be removed from the top the structure, resulting in too much material being removed from the filled feature, generating defects which affect device performance. In photolithography, a flat surface produces optimal performance. The gouge resulting from the ALD fill can creates a topography on the top surface of the device that diminishes the accuracy of the subsequent lithography operations, which can also generate defects affecting device performance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a CVD cap layer is then deposited on the dielectric fill material in the same chamber in an operation <b>103</b>. As indicated above, the cap layer may be deposited by PECVD or tCVD. Examples of CVD processes are described further below. Depositing by CVD allows for a thick film to be quickly deposited, which preferentially fills in the gouge resulting in a flatter film, reducing the frequency of the generation of defects in subsequent processing. And, by depositing it in the same chamber as the ALD gap fill, the number of transfer operations and processing tools is greatly reduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of the filled gap after operation <b>103</b>. A cap film <b>210</b> is on dielectric film <b>202</b>. Notably, the gouge <b>211</b> in the cap film <b>210</b> is significantly reduced as compared to gouge <b>201</b>. The gouge may be reduced for example, by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90%. Example thicknesses of the cap layer range from 1-3 k&#x212b;. In some embodiments, thinner layers, e.g., 100-1000 &#x212b;, may be deposited. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of subsequent processing, in this case CMP, which may be performed directly after cap layer deposition. The CMP process may removes a top layer of dielectric and may leave the filled in gouge. In some embodiments, the CMP process may remove only the CVD deposited film. In some embodiments, the CMP process may remove ALD deposited film, leaving the filled in gouge.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the ALD and CVD depositions are performed in the same chamber. This allows a quick process with minimal transition time. However, in some other embodiments, the ALD and CVD depositions can be performed in different chambers.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">ALD Gapfill</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, the ALD process fills the gap with a dielectric material, typically, a silicon-containing dielectric material. The ALD process may be ALD-only, or in some embodiments, may have one or more etch or inhibition operations. For example, the gap may be filled with a deposition-etch-deposition process or a deposition-inhibition-deposition operation, or some combination of these. In such embodiments, the etch or inhibition operations preferentially can etch or inhibit at the top of the feature.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a PEALD process is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> presents a flowchart for a method of performing a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition process <b>500</b>. The process <b>500</b> begins at operation <b>501</b>, where a dose of a first reactant is provided to a reaction chamber containing a substrate. The substrate will have gaps therein that are to be filled through the PEALD process. In various cases, the first reactant may be a silicon-containing reactant. Next, at operation <b>503</b> the reaction chamber is purged, for example with an inert gas or a nitrogen carrier gas. This helps remove any remaining first reactant from the reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At operation <b>505</b>, the second reactant is provided to the reaction chamber. In certain cases, the second reactant is an oxidizing reactant. In one example, it is oxygen. The second reactant may also be a mix of reactants. In a particular embodiment, the second reactant is a flow of oxygen and nitrous oxide. The second reactant is provided in operation <b>505</b>, which may include pre-flowing the reactant before flowing the reactant coincident with plasma activation in operation <b>507</b>. When the plasma is activated, it drives a reaction between the first and second reactants on the surface of the substrate. Next, the plasma is extinguished, and then the reaction chamber is purged, for example with inert gas or a nitrogen carrier gas. This operation <b>509</b> is referred to as the post-RF purge. The method <b>500</b> is repeated a number of times to fill the gap. A tALD method may also be performed, with operation <b>507</b> omitted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At least one of the reactants will generally contain an element that is solid at room temperature, the element being incorporated into the film formed by the ALD method. This reactant may be referred to as a principal reactant. The principal reactant may be silicon-containing or contain another semiconductor (e.g., germanium, etc.). The other reactant is sometimes referred to as an auxiliary reactant or a co-reactant. Non-limiting examples of co-reactants include oxygen, ozone, hydrogen, hydrazine, water, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, ammonia, alkyl amines, and the like. The co-reactant may also be a mix of reactants, as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The PEALD process may be used to fill gaps with a wide variety of film types. While much of the discussion herein focuses on the formation of undoped silicon oxides, other film types such as nitrides, carbides, oxynitrides, carbon-doped oxides, nitrogen-doped oxides, borides, etc. may also be formed. Oxides include a wide range of materials including undoped silicate glass (USG), fluorosilicate glass (FSG), and other doped silicate glass. Examples of doped glasses included boron doped silicate glass (BSG), phosphorus doped silicate glass (PSG), and boron phosphorus doped silicate glass (BPSG). Still further, the PEALD/PECVD process may be used for metal deposition and feature fill.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the disclosed embodiments are not limited to particular reactants, an example list of reactants is provided below.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In certain embodiments, the deposited film is a silicon-containing film. In these cases, the silicon-containing reactant may be for example, a silane, a halosilane or an aminosilane. A silane contains hydrogen and/or carbon groups, but does not contain a halogen. Examples of silanes are silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), disilane (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), and organo silanes such as methylsilane, ethylsilane, isopropylsilane, t-butylsilane, dimethylsilane, diethylsilane, di-t-butylsilane, allylsilane, sec-butylsilane, thexylsilane, isoamylsilane, t-butyldisilane, di-t-butyldisilane, tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (also known as tetra-ethoxy-silane or TEOS) and the like. A halosilane contains at least one halogen group and may or may not contain hydrogens and/or carbon groups. Examples of halosilanes are iodosilanes, bromosilanes, chlorosilanes and fluorosilanes. Although halosilanes, particularly fluorosilanes, may form reactive halide species that can etch silicon materials, in certain embodiments described herein, the silicon-containing reactant is not present when a plasma is struck. Specific chlorosilanes are tetrachlorosilane (SiCl<sub>4</sub>), trichlorosilane (HSiCl<sub>3</sub>), dichlorosilane (H<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>), monochlorosilane (ClSiH<sub>3</sub>), chloroallylsilane, chloromethylsilane, dichloromethylsilane, chlorodimethylsilane, chloroethylsilane, t-butylchlorosilane, di-t-butylchlorosilane, chloroisopropylsilane, chloro-sec-butylsilane, t-butyldimethylchlorosilane, thexyldimethylchlorosilane, and the like. An aminosilane includes at least one nitrogen atom bonded to a silicon atom, but may also contain hydrogens, oxygens, halogens and carbons. Examples of aminosilanes are mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-aminosilane (H<sub>3</sub>Si(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>Si(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, HSi(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and Si(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, respectively), as well as substituted mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-aminosilanes, for example, t-butylaminosilane, methylaminosilane, tert-butylsilanamine, bis(tertiarybutylamino)silane (SiH<sub>2</sub>(NHC(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(BTBAS), tert-butyl silylcarbamate, SiH(CH<sub>3</sub>)&#x2014;(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, SiHCl&#x2014;(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, (Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH)<sub>3 </sub>and the like.

The method <b>550</b> may be performed after the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. The PECVD method generally begins by flowing one or more reactants into the reaction chamber at operation <b>551</b>. The reactant delivery may continue as plasma is generated in operation <b>553</b>. The substrate surface is exposed to plasma, which causes deposition to occur on the ALD-deposited dielectric fill layer in operation <b>555</b>. This process continues until a desired film thickness is reached. At operation <b>557</b>, the plasma is extinguished and the reactant flow is terminated. Next, the reaction chamber is purged at operation <b>559</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, there is no downtime between a PEALD process and a PECVD process. For example, the PEALD process may end by extinguishing the plasma, performing the post-RF purge (with or without a pump down), and then immediately flowing the PECVD reactant(s).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A transition phase may be employed between the PEALD and PECVD phases. The conditions employed during such transition phase can be different from those employed in either the PEALD or the PECVD phases. In some embodiments, the conditions permit simultaneous ALD surface reactions and CVD type gas phase reactions. The transition phase may involve exposure to a plasma, which may be pulsed for example. Further, the transition phase may involve delivery of one or more reactants a low flow rate, i.e., a rate that is significantly lower than that employed in the corresponding ALD phase of the process.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The PECVD reaction may be performed with either the same reactants as the ALD reaction, or with different reactants. For example, the PECVD reaction is performed with TEOS and/or silane. The TEOS and silane reactants have been found to be especially useful in practicing the PECVD reaction. Generally, the reactants listed above in the PEALD Reactants section may be used in the PECVD reaction. However, in some embodiments, the reactants are different with TEOS or silane used for PECVD and an aminosilane used for PEALD.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In transitioning from PEALD to PECVD, in some embodiments, the RF power may be decreased. For example, for PEALD, RF power may be 1250-6000 W and for PECVD, RF power may be 1000-6000 W. However, in some embodiments, for PEALD, RF power may be at least 3 kW, or 4 kW, or 5 kW. For PECVD, in some embodiments, RF power may be between 1 kW and 2 kW, e.g., 1250 W. Example RF times for each PEALD cycle are 0.15 s-0.6 s. Example RF times for the PECVD deposition are 1-200 s. A tCVD method may also be performed without the plasma.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the ALD and CVD processes may be performed in a multi-station chamber. According to various embodiments, each of the ALD and CVD stations may be independently performed in static mode (process completely in one station) or in damascene mode (indexing between stations). Damascene mode may be used to impart better uniformity. Thus, in a multi-station chamber any one of the following processes may be performed:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">1) ALD and CVD in static mode (process completely on one station), or<br/>2) ALD in static mode+CVD process in damascene mode with indexing between stations to impart better uniformity, or<br/>3) ALD in damascene mode and CVD in static mode, or<br/>4) ALD in damascene mode, CVD in damascene mode.<br/>In embodiments with ALD and CVD both in static mode, the processes may or may not be performed in the same station.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In some embodiments, transitioning between ALD and CVD includes indexing the substrate from an ALD station to a CVD station. Using different stations to perform ALD and CVD can facilitate the use of different compounds and process conditions for ALD and CVD processes.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Apparatus</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0040">A suitable apparatus for performing the disclosed methods typically includes hardware for accomplishing the process operations and a system controller having instructions for controlling process operations in accordance with the present invention. For example, in some embodiments, the hardware may include one or more PEALD, PECVD or joint PEALD/PECVD process stations included in a process tool.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> schematically shows an embodiment of a process station <b>600</b> that may be used to deposit material using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and/or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), either of which may be plasma enhanced. For simplicity, the process station <b>600</b> is depicted as a standalone process station having a process chamber body <b>602</b> for maintaining a low-pressure environment. However, it will be appreciated that a plurality of process stations <b>600</b> may be included in a common process tool environment. Further, it will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, one or more hardware parameters of process station <b>600</b>, including those discussed in detail below, may be adjusted programmatically by one or more computer controllers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Process station <b>600</b> fluidly communicates with reactant delivery system <b>601</b> for delivering process gases to a distribution showerhead <b>606</b>. Reactant delivery system <b>601</b> includes a mixing vessel <b>604</b> for blending and/or conditioning process gases for delivery to showerhead <b>606</b>. One or more mixing vessel inlet valves <b>620</b> may control introduction of process gases to mixing vessel <b>604</b>. Similarly, a showerhead inlet valve <b>605</b> may control introduction of process gasses to the showerhead <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Some reactants, like BTBAS, may be stored in liquid form prior to vaporization at and subsequent delivery to the process station. For example, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes a vaporization point <b>603</b> for vaporizing liquid reactant to be supplied to mixing vessel <b>604</b>. In some embodiments, vaporization point <b>603</b> may be a heated vaporizer. The reactant vapor produced from such vaporizers may condense in downstream delivery piping. Exposure of incompatible gases to the condensed reactant may create small particles. These small particles may clog piping, impede valve operation, contaminate substrates, etc. Some approaches to addressing these issues involve sweeping and/or evacuating the delivery piping to remove residual reactant. However, sweeping the delivery piping may increase process station cycle time, degrading process station throughput. Thus, in some embodiments, delivery piping downstream of vaporization point <b>603</b> may be heat traced. In some examples, mixing vessel <b>604</b> may also be heat traced. In one non-limiting example, piping downstream of vaporization point <b>603</b> has an increasing temperature profile extending from approximately 100&#xb0; C. to approximately 150&#xb0; C. at mixing vessel <b>604</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In some embodiments, reactant liquid may be vaporized at a liquid injector. For example, a liquid injector may inject pulses of a liquid reactant into a carrier gas stream upstream of the mixing vessel. In one scenario, a liquid injector may vaporize reactant by flashing the liquid from a higher pressure to a lower pressure. In another scenario, a liquid injector may atomize the liquid into dispersed microdroplets that are subsequently vaporized in a heated delivery pipe. It will be appreciated that smaller droplets may vaporize faster than larger droplets, reducing a delay between liquid injection and complete vaporization. Faster vaporization may reduce a length of piping downstream from vaporization point <b>603</b>. In one scenario, a liquid injector may be mounted directly to mixing vessel <b>604</b>. In another scenario, a liquid injector may be mounted directly to showerhead <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In some embodiments, a liquid flow controller upstream of vaporization point <b>603</b> may be provided for controlling a mass flow of liquid for vaporization and delivery to process station <b>600</b>. For example, the liquid flow controller (LFC) may include a thermal mass flow meter (MFM) located downstream of the LFC. A plunger valve of the LFC may then be adjusted responsive to feedback control signals provided by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller in electrical communication with the MFM. However, it may take one second or more to stabilize liquid flow using feedback control. This may extend a time for dosing a liquid reactant. Thus, in some embodiments, the LFC may be dynamically switched between a feedback control mode and a direct control mode. In some embodiments, the LFC may be dynamically switched from a feedback control mode to a direct control mode by disabling a sense tube of the LFC and the PID controller.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Showerhead <b>606</b> distributes process gases toward substrate <b>612</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, substrate <b>612</b> is located beneath showerhead <b>606</b>, and is shown resting on a pedestal <b>608</b>. It will be appreciated that showerhead <b>606</b> may have any suitable shape, and may have any suitable number and arrangement of ports for distributing processes gases to substrate <b>612</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In some embodiments, a microvolume <b>607</b> is located beneath showerhead <b>606</b>. Performing an ALD and/or CVD process in a microvolume rather than in the entire volume of a process station may reduce reactant exposure and sweep times, may reduce times for altering process conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.), may limit an exposure of process station robotics to process gases, etc. Example microvolume sizes include, but are not limited to, volumes between 0.1 liter and 2 liters. This microvolume also impacts productivity throughput. While deposition rate per cycle drops, the cycle time also simultaneously reduces. In certain cases, the effect of the latter is dramatic enough to improve overall throughput of the module for a given target thickness of film.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In some embodiments, pedestal <b>608</b> may be raised or lowered to expose substrate <b>612</b> to microvolume <b>607</b> and/or to vary a volume of microvolume <b>607</b>. For example, in a substrate transfer phase, pedestal <b>608</b> may be lowered to allow substrate <b>612</b> to be loaded onto pedestal <b>608</b>. During a deposition process phase, pedestal <b>608</b> may be raised to position substrate <b>612</b> within microvolume <b>607</b>. In some embodiments, microvolume <b>607</b> may completely enclose substrate <b>612</b> as well as a portion of pedestal <b>608</b> to create a region of high flow impedance during a deposition process.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Optionally, pedestal <b>608</b> may be lowered and/or raised during portions the deposition process to modulate process pressure, reactant concentration, etc., within microvolume <b>607</b>. In one scenario where process chamber body <b>602</b> remains at a base pressure during the deposition process, lowering pedestal <b>608</b> may allow microvolume <b>607</b> to be evacuated. Example ratios of microvolume to process chamber volume include, but are not limited to, volume ratios between 1:600 and 1:10. It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, pedestal height may be adjusted programmatically by a suitable computer controller.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In another scenario, adjusting a height of pedestal <b>608</b> may allow a plasma density to be varied during plasma activation and/or treatment cycles included in the deposition process.

Further, it will be appreciated that a vertical position of pedestal <b>608</b> and/or showerhead <b>606</b> may be varied by any suitable mechanism within the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, pedestal <b>608</b> may include a rotational axis for rotating an orientation of substrate <b>612</b>.

In some embodiments, the plasma energy may be controlled by controlling one or more of a process station pressure, a gas concentration, an RF source power, an RF source frequency, and a plasma power pulse timing. For example, RF power supply <b>614</b> and matching network <b>616</b> may be operated at any suitable power to form a plasma having a desired composition of radical species. Examples of suitable powers are included above. Likewise, RF power supply <b>614</b> may provide RF power of any suitable frequency. In some embodiments, RF power supply <b>614</b> may be configured to control high- and low-frequency RF power sources independently of one another. Example low-frequency RF frequencies may include, but are not limited to, frequencies between 50 kHz and 600 kHz. Example high-frequency RF frequencies may include, but are not limited to, frequencies between 1.8 MHz and 2.45 GHz. It will be appreciated that any suitable parameters may be modulated discretely or continuously to provide plasma energy for the surface reactions. In one non-limiting example, the plasma power may be intermittently pulsed to reduce ion bombardment with the substrate surface relative to continuously powered plasmas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In some embodiments, the plasma may be monitored in-situ by one or more plasma monitors. In one scenario, plasma power may be monitored by one or more voltage, current sensors (e.g., VI probes). In another scenario, plasma density and/or process gas concentration may be measured by one or more optical emission spectroscopy sensors (OES). In some embodiments, one or more plasma parameters may be programmatically adjusted based on measurements from such in-situ plasma monitors. For example, an OES sensor may be used in a feedback loop for providing programmatic control of plasma power. It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, other monitors may be used to monitor the plasma and other process characteristics. Such monitors may include, but are not limited to, infrared (IR) monitors, acoustic monitors, and pressure transducers.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In some embodiments, the plasma may be controlled via input/output control (IOC) sequencing instructions. In one example, the instructions for setting plasma conditions for a plasma process phase may be included in a corresponding plasma activation recipe phase of a deposition process recipe. In some cases, process recipe phases may be sequentially arranged, so that all instructions for a deposition process phase are executed concurrently with that process phase. In some embodiments, instructions for setting one or more plasma parameters may be included in a recipe phase preceding a plasma process phase. For example, a first recipe phase may include instructions for setting a flow rate of an inert and/or a reactant gas, instructions for setting a plasma generator to a power set point, and time delay instructions for the first recipe phase. A second, subsequent recipe phase may include instructions for enabling the plasma generator and time delay instructions for the second recipe phase. A third recipe phase may include instructions for disabling the plasma generator and time delay instructions for the third recipe phase. It will be appreciated that these recipe phases may be further subdivided and/or iterated in any suitable way within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In some deposition processes, plasma strikes last on the order of a few seconds or more in duration. In certain implementations, much shorter plasma strikes may be used. These may be on the order of 10 ms to 1 second, typically, about 20 to 80 ms, with 50 ms being a specific example. Such very short RF plasma strikes require extremely quick stabilization of the plasma. To accomplish this, the plasma generator may be configured such that the impedance match is set preset to a particular voltage, while the frequency is allowed to float. Conventionally, high-frequency plasmas are generated at an RF frequency at about 13.56 MHz. In various embodiments disclosed herein, the frequency is allowed to float to a value that is different from this standard value. By permitting the frequency to float while fixing the impedance match to a predetermined voltage, the plasma can stabilize much more quickly, a result which may be important when using the very short plasma strikes associated with some types of deposition cycles.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In some embodiments, pedestal <b>608</b> may be temperature controlled via heater <b>610</b>.
