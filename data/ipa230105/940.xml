<i>Plectranthus aromaticus </i>Benth., and <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(Lour.) Spreng.), is a perennial medicinal herb of the Lamiaceae (also known as Labiatae) family native to Southern and Eastern Africa. <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>is also known as patchouli, Cuban oregano, Indian borage, Indian mint, Mexican mint, Mexican oregano, country borage, and Spanish thyme.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>has various health benefits, for example, antimicrobial activity, antifungal activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antidiabetic activity, anxiolytic activity, antineoplastic, analgesic, antimalarial, antibiofilm efficacy, diuretic, wound healing activity, skincare, respiratory disorders, and antiplatelet aggregation activity. <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>is reported to contain several classes of phytochemicals, including monoterepenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids and esters. Different preparation processes result in <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>extracts having different combinations of phytochemicals at different concentrations, thereby possessing different health benefits.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the development of preparation processes for producing <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) extracts having desired active components, e.g., effective in promoting wound healing. Such preparation processes substantially shorten the whole preparation process with high yields.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method for preparing a <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) extract, the method comprising: (i) mixing an above-ground part of <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>with an extracting solution to produce a first PA extract, wherein the extracting solution comprises a solvent having a polarity index of about 2.9 to 6.6; (ii) filtrating and optionally concentrating the first PA extract to produce a second PA extract, which optionally is a concentrated PA extract; (iii) contacting the second PA extract (e.g., the concentrated PA extract) onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin, and (iv) eluting the column with a eluent solution to product the PA extract, wherein the eluent solution comprises a solvent having a polarity index of about 2.1-5.4.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the solvent in the extracting solution in step (i) can be acetone, butyl methyl ether, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, or a mixture thereof.

In some instances, step (i) can be performed at a temperature of about 25-80&#xb0; C. (e.g., about 40-80&#xb0; C. or about 50-80&#xb0; C.) for about 1-9 hours (e.g., 1-3 hours). Alternatively, step (i) is performed at a temperature of about 20-30&#xb0; C. for about 12-48 hours (e.g., 12-24 hours or 24-48 hours). In some examples, the weight-to-volume ratio between the above-ground part of <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>and the extracting solution in step (i) may be about 1:10 to about 1:20 (kg/liter).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, in step (ii), the first PA extract can be concentrated to reduce the volume to about 30%-70% (e.g., about 30-50%) of the original volume to produce the concentrated PA extract. In other embodiments, the first PA extract can be concentrated to reduce the volume to about 2.5% to about 4% of the original volume to produce the concentrated PA extract.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other embodiments, step (ii) does not involve concentrating the first PA extract.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin used in step (iii) can be a non-polar copolymer styrene-divynilbenzene adsorbent resin, a polystyrene polymer cross linked with divinylbenzene, or a polystyrene divinyl-benzene copolymer resin. In some instances, step (iii) can be performed by loading the concentrated PA extract onto a column comprising the hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin. Alternatively, step (iii) can be performed by mixing the concentrated PA extract with the hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the eluent solution in step (iv) may comprise a mixture of at least two solvents selected from the group consisting of acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, and hexane. In some instances, the eluent solution may comprise two of the solvents at a 50:50 ratio by volume. In one example, the elution solution contains a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate.

In some instances, the solvent can be a single solvent (i.e., containing a homogenous population of solvent compounds, e.g., ethanol). In other instances, the solvent can be a co-solvent (i.e., containing a mixture of multiple solvent compounds, e.g., a mixture of ethanol and acetone).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">The suitable solvent for use in the extraction step may be any of the solvent in Table 1 having a polarity index of 2.9 to 6.6, or a mixture thereof. In some examples, the solvent can be ethanol. In other examples, the solvent can be acetone. In yet other examples, the solvent can be a mixture of ethanol and acetone (e.g., 1:1 ratio by volume). Other suitable solvents include t-butyl methyl ether, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">In some instances, the above-ground part of a <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>plant may be mixed with any of the suitable solvent disclosed herein at a ratio of about 1:10 to 1:20 (kg/Liter). For example, 1 kg of the above-ground part of a <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>plant can be placed in 10-20 liter of the solvent. The mixture can be stirred for a suitable period (e.g., 1 hour to 24 hours) at a suitable temperature (e.g., room temperature to 80&#xb0; C.). In some examples, the extraction step may be carried out at an elevated temperature, for example at 60&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. In this case, the extraction period may be shortened, for example, to about 1 hour to 2 hours (e.g., about 90 minutes). Alternatively, the extraction step may be carried out at room temperature, for example, at about 20-25&#xb0; C. In that case, the extraction period may take about 12 hours to 24 hours. In other examples, the extraction step may be carried out at about 30-40&#xb0; C. for about 3-8 hours (e.g., 4 hours).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">Any of the extraction steps disclosed herein may be repeated multiple times, for example, 2 times.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">(b) Filtration and Optional Concentration Step</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">In some instances, the crude extract obtained from an extraction step as disclosed herein may be filtered to remove solid components.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">In some embodiments, either the crude extract or the resultant filtrate may be concentrated by a conventional method, e.g., vacuum concentration. In some examples, the volume of the concentrated extract can be reduced to about 1%-70% of the original volume (of the crude extract or the filtrate). In some examples, the crude extract or the filtrate can be concentrated at a low level, for example, the volume of the concentrated extract may be about 30%-70% (e.g., about 30-50%) of the volume before concentration (original volume). In other examples, the crude extract or filtrate may be concentrated at a high level, for example, about 2%-10% volume reduction. In some examples, the volume of the concentrated extract may be about 2-4% of the volume before concentration (original volume).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">Alternatively, the crude extract or the resultant filtrate may not be substantially concentrated (volume reduction is less than 20%, e.g., less than 15%, 10%, or 5%) or no concentration at all.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">(c) Separation Steps</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The concentrated crude extract obtained from the filtration and concentration step can then be subject to separation via hydrophobic interaction chromatography, which separates components in the concentrated crude extract according to their differences in surface hydrophobicity. This step can be performed by contacting the concentrated solution with a hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin, which can be any non-ionic and hydrophobic resin. Examples include, but are not limited to, non-polar copolymer styrene-divynilbenzene adsorbent resin (e.g., DIAION&#xae; HP20, DIAION&#xae; HP20SS, AMBERLITE&#xae; XAD-2 or AMBERLITE&#xae; XAD-4), a nonionic and cross-linked polymeric adsorbent resin (SEPLITE&#xae; LX20), or a polystyrene divinyl-benzene copolymer resin (e.g., Amberlite&#x2122; XAD1180N). Other examples include methacrylate-based resin, silica gel, nonionic polystyrene-divinylbenzene polymer resin (e.g., SEPABEAD&#xae; SP27).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">In some examples, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin may be packed in a column, which may be washed for equilibration before loading of the materials for separation. The concentrated solution can then be loaded onto and pass through the column. In some examples (e.g., high level concentrated crude extract), the column can be washed sequentially by one or more solutions after loading. The solutions for sequential wash may comprise a solvent having high to low polarity index. For example, the column may be first washed by water, followed by 50% ethanol (in water), and then by ethanol. Alternatively, the resin may be washed by a solvent having low polarity index, for example, hexane. In other examples, the wash step may not be necessary, for example, for low level concentrated crude extract.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">In other examples, a concentrated solution may be mixed with a hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin. After being stirred for a suitable period, the mixture can be filtrated to remove the supernatant. In some instances (e.g., high level concentrated crude extract), the resin can then be washed sequentially by one or more solutions after loading via mixing and stirring the resins in the solution. The solutions for sequential wash may comprise a solvent having high to low polarity indexes. For example, the resins may be first washed by water, followed by 50% ethanol (in water), and then by ethanol. Alternatively, the resin may be washed by a solvent having low polarity index, for example, hexane. In other examples, the wash step may not be necessary, for example, for low level concentrated crude extract.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">(d) Elution Step</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">The resins, either packed in a column or in mixture with the concentrated crude extract, can then be eluted using a suitable eluent solution to provide the <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) extract of interest. The eluent solution may contain a solvent having a suitable polarity index, for example, about 2.1 to about 5.4. In some examples, a solvent having a polarity index of 4.3-5.4 can be used. In some examples, the solvent can be a single solvent. In other instances, the solvent can be a co-solvent. Examples of the solvent for use in the eluent solution include, but are not limited to, a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate (e.g., at a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 by volume), a mixture of acetone and ethyl acetate (e.g., at a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 by volume), a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (e.g., at a ratio of 1:1). Other solvents having similar polarity index as these examples can also be used in the elution solution.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">(e) Exemplary Extraction Procedures</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">Table 2 below provides exemplary solvents and conditions for each step of the extraction procedures disclosed herein.

Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) Extracts</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">The <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) extract prepared by any of the methods disclosed herein can be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (excipient) to form a pharmaceutical composition for the therapeutic uses disclosed herein. &#x201c;Acceptable&#x201d; means that the carrier must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (and preferably, capable of stabilizing the active ingredient) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients (carriers) including buffers, which are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. (2000) Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Ed. K. E. Hoover.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">The pharmaceutical compositions to be used in the present methods can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. (Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. (2000) Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Ed. K. E. Hoover). Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations used, and may comprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN&#x2122;, PLURONICS&#x2122; or polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">The pharmaceutical compositions to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by, for example, filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Therapeutic compositions are generally placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, solutions or suspensions, or suppositories, for oral, parenteral or rectal administration, or for topical administration.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042">For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient can be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g., conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g., water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0043">Suitable surface-active agents include, in particular, non-ionic agents, such as polyoxyethylenesorbitans (e.g., Tween&#x2122; 20, 40, 60, 80 or 85) and other sorbitans (e.g., Span&#x2122; 20, 40, 60, 80 or 85). Compositions with a surface-active agent will conveniently comprise between 0.05 and 5% surface-active agent, and can be between 0.1 and 2.5%.

Therapeutic Applications of Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising <i>Plectranthus amboinicus </i>(PA) Extracts</p><p id="p-0060" num="0054">Any of the pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., topical formulations) comprising an effective amount of the PA extracts prepared by a method disclosed herein can be used for treating a target disease or conditions, for example, promoting wound healing, in a subject in need of the treatment via a suitable route, such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerebrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, inhalation or topical routes.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0055">As used herein, &#x201c;an effective amount&#x201d; refers to the amount of each active agent required to confer therapeutic effect on the subject, either alone or in combination with one or more other active agents. Determination of whether an amount of the PA extract achieved the therapeutic effect would be evident to one of skill in the art. Effective amounts vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the individual patient parameters including age, physical condition, size, gender and weight, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose of the individual components or combinations thereof be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0056">Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the determination of the dosage. For example, antibodies that are compatible with the human immune system, such as humanized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to prolong half-life of the PA extract or the active components therein. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or delay of a target disease/disorder.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0057">In some embodiments, a topical formulation as disclosed herein may be applied to a wound site following a suitable dosage and treatment regimen. The dosage and administration regimen for the described method will depend on the nature and condition of the wound being treated, the age and condition of the patient, and any prior or concurrent therapy. In some instances, the topical formulation can be applied once every week, once every other day, once daily, twice daily, three times daily, or four time daily for a suitable period of time. The treatment may be terminated when the wound is recovered. When necessary, the treatment may resume, for example, if a wound recurs.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0058">The term &#x201c;wound&#x201d; refers to an injury to living tissue caused by a cut, blow, or other impact (e.g., caused by a medical condition such as a skin disorder), typically one in which the skin is cut or broken. Wound may be associated with a medical condition, for example, a skin disorder. The term &#x201c;wound healing&#x201d; denotes the dynamic and complex process of replacing devitalized or missing cellular structures and/or tissue layers. The term &#x201c;promotion of wound healing&#x201d; or &#x201c;promoting wound healing&#x201d; denotes the inducement of an increased level or rate of replacement for devitalized or missing cellular structures and/or tissue layers. As an example, promotion of wound healing may be indicated by partial or complete ulcer closure or an increase in the healing rate of an ulcer (including but not limited to more rapid changes in ulcer size, area, or severity, a more rapid closure of the ulcer, and/or an increase in the percentage change from baseline in ulcer size, area, or severity when compared to a control ulcer treated with a placebo).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0059">The subject to be treated by the topical formulation can be a human or a non-human mammal. In some embodiments, the subject is a human patient having an open wound, which refers to an injury or damage to living tissues (e.g., skin) that cause a disruption in the normal continuity of biological structures. An open wound may include, but is not limited to, an abrasion, incision, laceration, puncture, avulsion, cut, or other similar injuries.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0060">In other embodiments, the subject is a human patient having a chronic wound, which can be injuries or damage to living tissues (e.g., skin) that cause a disruption in the normal continuity of biological structures and do not heal in an orderly set of stages and/or in a predictable amount of time. A chronic wound may include, but is not limited to: a surgical wound, a traumatic wound, a pressure ulcer, a venous ulcer, or a diabetic ulcer. In other examples, a chronic wound may be associated with a disease or disorder, for example, a carcinoma, burn, bedsore, a skin disorder such as atopic dermatitis.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0061">In one example, the subject is a human patient having foot ulcer associated with diabetes (e.g., type I or type II). Diabetes mellitus (also known as diabetes) is a group of metabolic diseases which result in high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Diabetes may result from the pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. The three main types of diabetes mellitus are Type I (also known as &#x201c;insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus&#x201d; (IDDM) or &#x201c;juvenile diabetes&#x201d;; results from the failure of the pancreas to produce enough insulin), Type 2 (also known as &#x201c;non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus&#x201d; (NIDDM) or &#x201c;adult-onset diabetes&#x201d;; results from the failure of cells to respond to insulin properly), and gestational diabetes (seen during pregnancy when high blood sugar levels are observed in the absence of a previous history of diabetes). Many serious complications are observed in diabetic patients including, but not limited to, chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers (also known as diabetic ulcers).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0062">In some embodiments, the subject to be treated by the methods described herein suffers from a severe wound, for example, having an ulcer with an area greater than 2 cm<sup>2 </sup>(e.g., 3 cm<sup>2</sup>, 4 cm<sup>2 </sup>or 5 cm<sup>2</sup>).

In addition, a reduced level of concentration after extraction (e.g., reduction of volume to about 30-70% of the original volume) can substantially reduce the chromatographic separation time relative to a high level of concentration (e.g., reduction of volume to about 2.5-4% of the original volume), thereby substantially reduce the total time for preparing the extract. For example, Process E has a substantially reduced total preparation time prior to the chromatographic separation step (about 6 hours, including 3 hours extraction, 3 hours concentration) relative to Process F (about 57 hours, including 48 hours extraction and 9 hours concentration). Process E also has a shortened chromatographic separate step relative to Process F (6 hours v. 16 hours).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081">Further, performing the chromatographic separation process via mixing with the resin and filtration led to production of extracts having higher concentrations of active components as compared with column format (compare Process A with Process B or Process C with Process D).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Characterization of <i>Plectranthus Amboinicus</i> Extracts</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="161pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Content, %</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry><sup>*</sup>Yield </entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Rosmarinic </entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Process</entry><entry>%</entry><entry>Salvigenin</entry><entry>Cirsimaritin</entry><entry>acid</entry><entry>Carvacrol</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>A</entry><entry>1.0%</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.02</entry><entry>0.01</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry>B</entry><entry>1.0%</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.03</entry><entry>0.5</entry></row><row><entry>C</entry><entry>1.1%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.01</entry><entry>0.01</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.04</entry></row><row><entry>D</entry><entry>1.1%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.02</entry><entry>0.4</entry></row><row><entry>E</entry><entry>1.2%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.1-0.4</entry><entry>0.8-1.2</entry></row><row><entry>F</entry><entry>0.4%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.01</entry><entry>N.D.</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.05</entry></row><row><entry>G</entry><entry>1.4%</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>N.D.</entry><entry>6.7</entry></row><row><entry>H</entry><entry>1.0%</entry><entry>0.4</entry><entry>0.9</entry><entry>1.1&#x2002;</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry>I</entry><entry>1.2%</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.1&#x2002;</entry><entry>1.6</entry></row><row><entry>J</entry><entry>1.1%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.1&#x2002;</entry><entry>1.5</entry></row><row><entry>K</entry><entry>1.0%</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.2&#x2002;</entry><entry>1.4-1.6</entry></row><row><entry>L</entry><entry>1.3%</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>0.04</entry><entry>1.1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00001"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msup>    <mo>*</mo>   </msup>   <mi>Yield</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mi>W</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>PA</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>extract</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>W</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Plectranthus</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>amboinicus</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#xd7;</mo>   <mn>1</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mn>0</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mn>0</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>%</mi>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 14.
