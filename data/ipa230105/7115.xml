smartphone has evolved and now can be equipped with a variety of functions. The electronic device may be coupled to various mounting devices to allow a user's easy access while charging.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electronic device is being transfigured into various shapes beyond a traditional bar shape. Recently, various types of experiences can be provided, such as a form with a flexible display, a form with a foldable display, and a form with two or more displays by combining with a mounting device. The electronic device having such a display may provide, in a bent or folded state for charging in combination with a mounting device or the like, an environment allowing the user to utilize the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to simultaneously perform mounting and charging of the electronic device, a typical mounting device requires the electronic device to be placed on a predetermined position of the mounting device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electronic device having a foldable display or two or more displays operates in a manner of folding a housing structure, so it can be mounted on the mounting device in a folded state. When the electronic device of in-folding type is mounted on the mounting device in a folded state, there is a problem in that a narrow space must be used to utilize the folded display of the electronic device in a mounting state.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to various example embodiments, a mounting device may include a mounting part on which a part of an external electronic device is mounted, a film part connected (directly or indirectly) to the mounting part, a short-range wireless communication module (including communication circuitry), and a processor. The processor (including processing circuitry) may be configured to detect a mounting state of the external electronic device, to identify whether the mounted external electronic device is a device supporting a hologram mode, and to, based on the identified result, control to transmit a transmission (e.g., control) signal to the external electronic device by using the short-range wireless communication module so that the external electronic device outputs a hologram content by using at least a portion of a display of the external electronic device. The hologram content outputted by the external electronic device may be projected on the film part.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to various example embodiments, the external electronic device may include at least one display, and at least one housing provided with the display. A first portion of the housing may be placed on the part of the mounting device, and a second portion of the housing may be coupled to the film part of the mounting device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to various example embodiments, an electronic device may include a display, a wireless communication module comprising communication circuitry and/or at least one antenna, a sensor module comprising at least one sensor, a processor, and a memory operatively connected to the processor. The processor may be configured to identify a result of detecting through the sensor module that the electronic device is folded at a predetermined angle and mounted on a mounting device, or identify a result of detecting through the sensor module that a part of the electronic device is attached to a magnet included in the mounting device, to transmit support information to the mounting device through the wireless communication module upon receiving a signal for identifying whether the electronic device supports the hologram mode, from the mounting device through the wireless communication module, and to display a hologram content on first and second regions of the display to be projected onto a film part of the mounting device upon receiving a hologram content transmission signal from the mounting device through the wireless communication module.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to various example embodiments, the mounting device allows a foldable electronic device or an electronic device having two or more displays and mountable in a folded form to be used in a mounting state, thereby providing a user with a variety of experiences.</p><p id="p-0012"

A module may be a single integral component, or a minimum unit or part thereof, adapted to perform one or more functions. For example, according to an embodiment, the module may be implemented in a form of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Various embodiments as set forth herein may be implemented as software (e.g., the program <b>140</b>) including one or more instructions that are stored in a storage medium (e.g., the internal memory <b>136</b> and/or the external memory <b>138</b>) that is readable by a machine (e.g., the electronic device <b>101</b>). For example, a processor (e.g., the processor <b>120</b>) of the machine (e.g., the electronic device <b>101</b>) may invoke at least one of the one or more instructions stored in the storage medium, and execute it, with or without using one or more other components under the control of the processor. This allows the machine to be operated to perform at least one function according to the at least one instruction invoked. The one or more instructions may include a code generated by a compiler or a code executable by an interpreter. The machine-readable storage medium may be provided in the form of a non-transitory storage medium. Wherein, the term &#x201c;non-transitory&#x201d; simply means that the storage medium is a tangible device, and does not include a signal (e.g., an electromagnetic wave), but this term does not differentiate between where data is semi-permanently stored in the storage medium and where the data is temporarily stored in the storage medium.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">According to an embodiment, a method according to various embodiments of the disclosure may be included and provided in a computer program product.
