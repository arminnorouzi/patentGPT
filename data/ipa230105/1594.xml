Among these secondary batteries, lithium secondary batteries having characteristics of high energy density, operating potential, long life cycle, and low self-discharge rate have been commercialized and widely used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The lithium secondary batteries can be divided into a prismatic lithium secondary battery and a pouch lithium secondary battery according to the shape. Among these lithium secondary batteries, the lithium secondary battery is manufactured by inserting an electrode assembly having a porous separator disposed between a positive electrode and a negative electrode thereof into a pouch case having predetermined size and shape, and then performing impregnation by injecting an electrolyte containing lithium salt.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At this time, a process of cutting the pouch into which the electrode assembly is inserted by a cutter is required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional pouch cutter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a bottom knife is formed at 90&#xb0;, a top knife is formed at an acute angle, and a shear angle is arbitrarily applied to the top knife. A blade of the bottom knife is formed at 90&#xb0; and a blade of the top knife is formed at an acute angle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional pouch cutter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has no particular problem in cutting quality, but requires frequent replacement due to short lifespan thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view showing a pouch cutter currently in use, and a top knife is formed at 90&#xb0;, a bottom knife is also formed at 90&#xb0;, and a shear angle is mounting the top knife inclined at a predetermined angle. A blade of the top knife is formed at 90&#xb0; and a blade of the bottom knife is also formed at 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The pouch cutter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can utilize all four corners thereof, so that there is an effect of increasing the lifespan thereof by 4 times.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since both the blade angle of the top knife and the blade angle of the bottom knife are 90&#xb0;, there are problems in that the shear load is large during pouch cutting, and the quality of the pouch cutting is deteriorated even if a little wear of the blade occurs. In a severe case, when two overlapped pouches are cut, there is a problem in that pouch cut edges adhere to each other and are not separated from each other. When the two overlapped pouches are cut, the shear load significantly acts and thus the two pouches are attached to each other, so that there is a problem in that the two pouches are not properly separated from each other due to a portion where the two pouches are attached to each other.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is intended to provide a pouch cutter for a secondary battery and an assembly method therefor, wherein the pouch cutter having a new structure is configured to have extended lifespan, to prevent the degradation in pouch cutting quality, and to prevent, even when two pouches are cut while being overlapped with each other, the two pouches from being attached to each other and being inseparable.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve the above objective, according to the present disclosure, there is provided to a pouch cutter for a secondary battery, wherein the pouch cutter may include: a bottom knife having a blade;

Specifically, when two overlapped pouches are cut, it is possible to prevent cut edges of the pouches from adhering to each other and from being inseparable. When the two overlapped pouches are cut, the two pouches are not attached to each other by heat because the shear load does not significantly act, and the two pouches are prevented from being separated properly due to a portion where the two pouches are attached to each other.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Furthermore, the present disclosure is configured to use the four corners of the top knife <b>30</b> or the bottom knife <b>20</b>, which are formed at acute angles and used while rotating and being mounted without a problem in the pouch cutting quality, so that the present disclosure has an effect of prevent is prevented from requiring frequent replacement due to longer lifespan.
