To enable a surface of a material to have antibacterial and antifungal capabilities, most of conventional technologies are implemented by using a coating method or a spraying method. Although the use of these methods can enable the surface of the material to have antibacterial and antifungal capabilities, the antibacterial and antifungal effect on the surface of these materials cannot be maintained for a desired period of time. Furthermore, the types of bacteria correspondingly affected by the antibacterial and antifungal effect on the surface of these materials are limited.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the conventional technologies also use a sheet material (i.e., ABS, PC, PP and other sheets) that has a film material having antibacterial and antifungal capabilities attached thereon. However, the use of attaching methods such as adhesion will result in a high material cost, and since the laminated structure is not composed of a single material, inconveniences when recycling materials of the laminated structure can be caused.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In response to the above-referenced technical inadequacies, the present disclosure provides an antibacterial and antifungal polyester laminated structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an antibacterial and antifungal polyester laminated structure, including: a main structure support layer and two antibacterial and antifungal functional layers.

It should be noted that the term &#x201c;substrate material&#x201d; or &#x201c;matrix material&#x201d; as used herein refers to a material whose content occupies at least half of a composition.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> again, in order to enable the impact-resistant polyester material 100 to have a high impact resistance, the toughening agent 102 (also known as impact-resistant modifier) is added into the impact-resistant polyester material 100, and the toughening agent 102 is dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material 101. In terms of material types, the toughening agent is polyolefin elastomer (POE), which is also known as polyolefin thermoplastic elastomer. The toughening agent 102 dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material 101 can be used to improve the impact-resistant strength of the impact-resistant polyester material 100.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In terms of content, based on the total weight of the impact-resistant polyester material 100, a content of the toughening agent 102 is preferably between 5 wt % and 15 wt %, and more preferably between 7 wt % and 10 wt %.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the above-mentioned configuration, the impact-resistant polyester material 100 can have high impact resistance through the addition of the toughening agent 102. If the content of the toughening agent 102 is less than the lower limit of the above-mentioned content, the impact-resistant polyester material 100 will not have sufficient impact-resistant strength and cannot be applied to the products that require high impact resistance. Conversely, if the content of the toughening agent 102 is greater than the upper limit of the above-mentioned content, the toughening agent 102 will not be uniformly dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material 101, such that aggregation or precipitation of the toughening agent 102 occurs in the polyester resin matrix material 101, thereby affecting a formation of a final product, and affecting a performance of the impact-resistant strength.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">From another perspective, one of the objectives of the present disclosure is to improve the impact-resistant strength of polyester materials, so that the polyester materials can have high impact-resistant strength, high rigidity, and low material cost at the same time. In order to achieve the foregoing objective, the impact-resistant polyester material 100 of the present embodiment uses polyolefin elastomer (POE) as a toughening agent (also known as impact-resistant modifier).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Compared with acrylic elastomer or polyester elastomer, the polyolefin elastomer (POE) has a better intrinsic toughness and a lower material price.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Therefore, adopting the polyolefin elastomer to improve the impact-resistant strength of the polyester materials has considerable advantages. However, the compatibility between the polyolefin elastomer and the polyester material is poor. When only the polyolefin elastomer is directly mixed with the polyester material by an additive modification method, the polyolefin elastomer is easy to agglomerate, and the impact-resistant strength of the polyester material cannot be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, one of the features of the present disclosure is to adjust a dispersed particle size of the polyolefin elastomer in the polyester material to be between 0.5 &#x3bc;m and 1.5 &#x3bc;m, and preferably between 0.5 &#x3bc;m and 1.2 &#x3bc;m by virtue of the compatibility modification, viscosity matching, and kneading dispersion technology between the polyolefin elastomer and the polyester material. Within the dispersed particle size, the impact-resistant polyester material 100 of the present embodiment can achieve high impact resistance characteristics.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, the compatibilizing agent (not shown in the drawings) is dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material 101. The compatibilizing agent is configured to assist in improving a compatibility between the toughening agent 102 and the polyester resin matrix material 101.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In terms of material types, the compatibilizing agent is a polyolefin elastomer compatibilizing agent. In particular, the compatibilizing agent is at least one of a polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA) and a polyolefin elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (POE-g-MAH). Preferably, the compatibilizing agent is the polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, the compatibilizing agent is configured to assist the toughening agent 102 to be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material 101 with a particle size between 0.5 &#x3bc;m and 1.5 &#x3bc;m, so that the impact-resistant polyester material 100 has an impact-resistant strength of not less than 20 kg-cm/cm. In other words, the compatibilizing agent can effectively improve the compatibility and dispersibility of the toughening agent 102 in the polyester resin matrix material 101, so that the toughening agent 102 can be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material 101 with a smaller particle size, and is less likely to agglomerate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the toughening agent 102 is dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material 101 with a particle size of between 0.5 &#x3bc;m and 1.2 &#x3bc;m, and the impact-resistant polyester material 100 has the impact-resistant strength between 28 kg-cm/cm and 50 kg-cm/cm, and more preferably between 30 kg-cm/cm and 45 kg-cm/cm.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In terms of content, based on the total weight of the impact-resistant polyester material 100, a content of the compatibilizing agent is preferably between 2 wt % and 15 wt %, and more preferably between 2 wt % and 5 wt %.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the above configuration, the compatibilizing agent can effectively assist the toughening agent 102 to be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material 101 with a smaller particle size. If the content of the compatibilizing agent is lower than the lower limit of the above-mentioned content, the compatibilizing agent cannot properly assist the toughening agent 102 to be dispersed to the polyester resin matrix material 101 with a smaller particle size. Therefore, the auxiliary effect provided by the compatibilizing agent is poor. Conversely, if the content of the compatibilizing agent is higher than the upper limit of the above-mentioned content, the compatibilizing agent may affect the formability of the polyester material.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the content of the toughening agent 102 and the content of the compatibilizing agent have a matching relationship there-between. Specifically, the content of the toughening agent 102 is not less than the content of the compatibilizing agent. Furthermore, a weight ratio range between the toughening agent 102 and the compatibilizing agent is preferably between 1:1 and 4:1, and more preferably between 1:1 and 2:1.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a molecular structure of the toughening agent is entirely polyolefin elastomer (POE). A molecular structure of the compatibilizing agent has a main chain and a side chain, and the main chain is a polyolefin elastomer (POE). Therefore, the compatibilizing agent can have excellent compatibility with the toughening agent 102 through the main chain thereof having the same molecular structure as that of the toughening agent.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the compatibilizing agent is further defined as a polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA). A molecular structure of the compatibilizing agent has a main chain and a side chain melt-grafted with the main chain, the main chain is the polyolefin elastomer (POE), and the side chain is the glycidyl methacrylate (GMA).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The glycidyl methacrylate can produce a ring-opening reaction during a mixing process, and an epoxy group in the glycidyl methacrylate can chemically react with an ester group in a molecular structure of the polyester resin matrix material after the ring-opening reaction, so that the toughening agent 102 is more uniformly dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material 101.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to improve the dispersibility of the toughening agent 102 (POE) in the polyester resin matrix material 101, the impact-resistant polyester material 100 may be formed into polyester masterbatches by extrusion granulation, so that the toughening agent 102 is dispersed in the polyester material for a first time. The polyester masterbatches are then molded into a molded product such as an injection part or an extruded part by injection molding or extrusion molding, so that the toughening agent 102 is dispersed in the polyester material for a second time.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to improve the dispersibility and compatibility of the toughening agent 102 (POE) in the polyester resin matrix material 101, a melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material 101 and a melt flow index of the toughening agent 102 have a matching relationship there-between.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, the polyester resin matrix material 101 (PET) has a first melt flow index, and the toughening agent 102 (POE) has a second melt flow index.

For example, the first melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material 101 is substantially 60 g/10 mins, and the second melt flow index of the toughening agent 102 (POE) is substantially 50 g/10 mins.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;melt flow index (MI)&#x201d; referred to herein can also be referred to as a melt flow rate (MFR). The melt flow index refers to a weight of the polymer melt that passes through the standard die (2.095 mm) every ten minutes at a certain temperature and a certain load.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the polyester resin matrix material 101 is a continuous phase, and the toughening agent 102 is a dispersed phase dispersed in the continuous phase. The dispersed phase and the continuous phase interact with each other, so that an island structure is formed on a material surface of the impact-resistant polyester material.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is worth mentioning that the above-mentioned &#x201c;island structure&#x201d; refers to a poor compatibility between two high molecular weight polymers (i.e., the polyester resin matrix material 101 and the toughening agent 102). After the two high molecular weight polymers are blended with each other, a heterogeneous system is formed. The dispersed phase is dispersed in the continuous phase, similar to the way that a group of small islands are dispersed in the ocean. By using a mechanism of a two-phase interaction of the sea-island structure, a performance of a polymer can be improved.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Antibacterial and Antifungal Polyester Material</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in each of the antibacterial and antifungal functional layers A, the antibacterial and antifungal polyester material 200 has good antibacterial and antifungal capabilities.
