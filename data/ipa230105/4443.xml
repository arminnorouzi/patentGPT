There are many different types of memory, including volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory can require power to maintain its data (e.g., host data, error data, etc.). Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), and thyristor random access memory (TRAM), among other types. Non-volatile memory can provide persistent data by retaining stored data when not powered. Non-volatile memory can include NAND flash memory, NOR flash memory, and resistance variable memory, such as phase change random access memory (PCRAM) and resistive random access memory (RRAM), ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), and magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), such as spin torque transfer random access memory (STT RAM), among other types.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic systems often include a number of processing resources (e.g., one or more processors), which may retrieve instructions from a suitable location and execute the instructions and/or store results of the executed instructions to a suitable location (e.g., the memory resources). A processor can include a number of functional units such as arithmetic logic unit (ALU) circuitry, floating point unit (FPU) circuitry, and a combinatorial logic block, for example, which can be used to execute instructions by performing logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR, and invert (e.g., NOT) logical operations on data (e.g., one or more operands). For example, functional unit circuitry may be used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on operands via a number of operations.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a wirelessly utilizable resource that may be utilized for formation of a memory pool between selected memory resources in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of examples of a system including wirelessly utilizable resources in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of examples of a network for wirelessly coupling selected wirelessly utilizable resources for formation of a memory pool in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of environments that correspond to a range of densities of wirelessly utilizable resources couplable for formation of a memory pool in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a route for vehicles upon which the resources may be implemented for formation of a memory pool in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of wirelessly utilizable resources selectably coupled to circuitry to enable formation of a memory pool in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of authorization criteria that may be utilized in authorization of formation of a memory pool in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example of formation of a memory pool between selected wirelessly utilizable resources implemented on a corresponding number of vehicles in accordance with a number of embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure includes systems, apparatuses and methods associated with memory pooling between selected memory resources. In a number of embodiments, an apparatus includes a memory resource, a processing resource coupled to the memory resource, and a transceiver resource coupled to the processing resource. The memory resource, the processing resource, and the transceiver resource are configured to enable formation of a memory pool between the memory resource and another memory resource at another apparatus responsive to a request to access the other memory resource transmitted from the processing resource via the transceiver.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A processing resource (e.g., one or more processors, microprocessors, or some other type of controlling circuitry), in combination with a memory resource as described herein, may be operated at a high speed (e.g., at a bandwidth of greater than 10 gigabits per second (GB/s)) for performance of some operations. To contribute to such performance, faster processing resources and/or more memory resources may be combined on a particular computing device. However, the higher the used bandwidth of and/or the more such resources are operating on the computing device, the higher the failure rate (e.g., failures in time (FIT)) and/or the lower the mean time between failures (MTBF) may become. Combining a processing resource with a lower bandwidth and/or a memory resource having less memory capacity (e.g., fewer memory devices, banks, arrays, etc.) on such computing devices may comparatively reduce the failure rate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, performance of particular functions (e.g., functionalities that are programmed and/or programmable to yield an intended outcome and/or a number of operations that are performed as sub-portions of the functionality) may rely on an ability of a processing resource, in combination with a memory resource, to operate at a bandwidth high enough to possibly result in a high FIT and/or a low MTBF. Such functions may include autonomous functions, which may, for example, use machine learning and/or artificial intelligence to perceive an environment and adjust operations accordingly to improve probability of yielding an intended outcome of a particular functionality (e.g., without human interaction and/or supervision).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Proper performance of the operations contributing to such automated functionalities may be critical for prevention of damage to a product including such automated functionalities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, such as automobiles, trucks, trains, airplanes, rockets, space stations, etc., among many other possibilities) and/or safety of transport of an object (e.g., a human passenger or any other object) being transited via an autonomous vehicle. Hence, automated functionalities utilized in such implementations may benefit from having lower error rates in execution of instructions for performance and/or selection of the operations contributing to the automated functionalities (e.g., relative to higher error rates considered acceptable for other utilities, such as cellular telephones, smart phones, personal computers, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Two ways to affect bandwidth are to adjust a bit width (e.g., a number of channels) on a bus for input and output (I/O) of data and to adjust a speed for I/O of data by a processor. For example, an implementation of a processor (e.g., a processing resource) having a 256 bit interface running at 14 GB/s and coupled to 8 DRAM devices, including one or more banks, (e.g., a memory resource) may have a high bandwidth of 448 GB/s, which may be correlated with a high cost, a high power consumption, a high operating temperature, and/or a short battery life, along with a high FIT rate. An implementation of a processor having a 32 bit interface running at 6 GB/s and coupled to 1 DRAM device may have a lower bandwidth of 25 GB/s, which may be correlated with a lower cost, a lower power consumption, a lower operating temperature, and/or a longer battery life, along with a lower FIT rate. However, reduction of the bandwidth of the processing resources and/or the number of memory resources combined on a particular computing device may be in conflict with meeting intended performance levels of an automated functionality and/or an implementation including the functionality.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In contrast, consistent with a number of embodiments described herein, there may be a plurality (e.g., a network) of memory resources and processing resources (e.g., formed and/or positioned on a corresponding plurality of vehicles) wirelessly connected (e.g., coupled) by a transceiver resource (e.g., a number of radio frequency (RF) transmitter/receivers, abbreviated as transceivers) to share data by formation of a memory pool. Such a vehicle to vehicle memory pool may, for example, include 100 vehicles, where each vehicle may include a 32 bit interface running at 6 GB/s and coupled to 1 DRAM device. The memory pool formed as such may effectively have a 3,200 bit wide bus with a total available bandwidth of around 2600 GB/s. To enable such a bus width and/or bandwidth between separate vehicles, the wireless coupling may be performed using fifth generation (5G) wireless technology, although embodiments are not limited to using 5G technology. The actual size of the memory pool, along with the corresponding bit width and/or bandwidth, may be scalable dependent upon the number of vehicles included in the memory pool, among other considerations described herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hence, formation of a memory pool as such may increase a cumulative computation power (e.g., capacity) and/or reliability of the combination of memory resources and processing resources on the plurality of vehicles (e.g., relative to a processing resource operating at a higher bandwidth and coupled to a higher number of memory banks on each of the vehicles). The reduced complexity and/or bandwidth of such a processing resource and memory resource implementation may be associated with lower cost, power consumption, operating temperature, and/or a longer battery life. The reliability may be increased by a reduced FIT rate for each processing resource and/or memory resource on each individual vehicle, by a failed processing resource and/or memory resource not being included in the memory pool in the first place, and/or by a failed processing resource and/or memory resource being replaced by another processing resource and/or memory resource on another vehicle or vehicles.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The figures herein follow a numbering convention in which the first digit or digits of a reference number correspond to the figure number and the remaining digits identify an element or component in the figure.

A communication link between devices (e.g. user equipments (UEs)) in such schemes may be referred to as sidelink, while a communication link from a base station to a device may be referred to as a downlink and a communication from a device to a base station may be referred to as an uplink.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In other schemes, device-to-device communication may occur on resources of unlicensed frequency spectrum, and devices may contend for access the communication channel or medium. Such schemes may include WiFi or MulteFire. Hybrid schemes, including licensed-assisted access (LAA) may also be employed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, an EHF band refers to a band of radio frequencies in an electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 30 to 300 gigahertz (GHz) as designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and as described further herein. Ranges of radio frequencies as designated by the ITU can include extremely low frequency (ELF) band ranging from 3 to 30 Hz, super low frequency (SLF) band ranging from 30 Hz to 300 Hz, ultra low frequency (ULF) band ranging from 300 Hz to 3 kilohertz (kHz), very low frequency (VLF) band ranging from 3 to 30 kHz, low frequency (LF) band ranging from 30 kHz to 300 kHz, medium frequency (MF) band ranging from 300 kHz to 3 megahertz (MHz), high frequency (HF) band ranging from 3 MHz to 30 MHz, very high frequency (VHF) band ranging from 30 MHz to 300 MHz, ultra high frequency (UHF) band ranging from 300 MHz to 3 GHz, super high frequency (SHF) band ranging from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, extremely high frequency (EHF) band ranging from 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and tremendously high frequency (THF) band ranging from 0.3 to 3 terahertz (THz).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A number of embodiments of the present disclosure can provide various benefits by utilizing a network communication that is operable in a number of frequency bands including a higher frequency portion (e.g., EHF) of the wireless spectrum, as compared to those network communication technologies that utilizes a lower frequency portion of the wireless spectrum only. As an example, the EHF bands of 5G technology may enable data to be transferred more rapidly than technologies (e.g., including technologies of previous generations) using lower frequency bands only. For example, a 5G network is estimated to have transfer speeds up to hundreds of times faster than a 4G network, which may enable data transfer rates in a range of tens of megabits per second (MB/s) to tens of GB/s for tens of thousands of users at a time (e.g., in a memory pool, as described herein) by providing a high bandwidth. For example, a 5G network provides faster transfer rates than the 802.11-based network such as WiFi that operate on unlicensed 2.4 GHz radio frequency band (e.g., Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band). Accordingly, a number of embodiments can enable the wirelessly utilizable resource <b>100</b> to be used at a high transfer speed as if the wirelessly utilizable resource <b>100</b> were wired to the wirelessly utilizable resource (e.g., wirelessly utilizable resources <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>200</b>-<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to the EHF band, the communication technology of the communication can also be operable in other frequency bands such as the UHF band and the SHF band. As an example, the communication technology can operate in a frequency band below 2 GHz (e.g., low 5G frequencies) and/or in a frequency band between 2 GHz and 6 GHz (e.g., medium 5G frequencies) in addition to a frequency band above 6 GHz (e.g., high 5G frequencies). Further details of a number of frequency bands (e.g., below 6 GHz) in which the 5G technology can operate are defined in Release 15 of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as New Radio (NR) Frequency Range 1 (FR1), as shown in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>5G operating bands for FR1</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>NR</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Operating</entry><entry/><entry>Duplex</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Band</entry><entry>Frequency Band (MHz)</entry><entry>Mode</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>n1</entry><entry>1920-1980;

FDD and TDD are each a particular type of a duplex communication system. As used herein, a duplex communication system refers to a point-to point system having two connected parties and/or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. TDD refers to duplex communication links where uplink is separated from downlink by the allocation of different time slots in the same frequency band. FDD refers to a duplex communication system, in which a transmitter and receiver operate at different frequency bands. SUL/SDL refer to a point-to-point communication system having two connected parties and/or devices that can communicate with one another in a unilateral direction (e.g., either via an uplink or a downlink, but not both).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The 5G technology may be selectively operable in one or more of low, medium, and/or high 5G frequency bands based on characteristics of, for example, the communication. As an example, the low 5G frequency may be utilized in some use cases (e.g., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), massive machine-type communications (mMTC)), in which extremely wide area needs to be covered by the 5G technology. As an example, the medium 5G frequency may be utilized in some use cases (e.g., eMBB, URLLC, mMTC), in which higher data rate than that of the low 5G frequencies is desired for the communication technology. As an example, the high 5G frequency may be utilized in some use cases (e.g., eMBB), in which extremely high data rate is desired for the 5G technology.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">As used herein, eMBB, URLLC, mMTC each refers to one of three categories of which the ITU has defined as services that the 5G technology can provide. As defined by the ITU, eMBB aims to meet the people's demand for an increasingly digital lifestyle and focuses on services that have high requirements for bandwidth, such as high definition (HD) videos, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). As defined by the ITU, URLLC aims to meet expectations for the demanding digital industry and focuses on latency-sensitive services, such as assisted and automated driving, and remote management. As defined by the ITU, mMTC aims to meet demands for a further developed digital society and focuses on services that include high requirements for connection density, such as smart city and smart agriculture.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">As used herein, a channel bandwidth refers to a frequency range occupied by data and/or instructions when being transmitted (e.g., by an individual carrier) over a particular frequency band. As an example, a channel bandwidth of 100 MHz may indicate a frequency range from 3700 MHZ to 3800 MHZ, which can be occupied by data and/or instructions when being transmitted over n77 frequency band, as shown in Table 1. As indicated in Release 15 of the 3GPP, a number of different channel bandwidth such as a channel bandwidth equal to or greater than 50 MHz (e.g., 50 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz, and/or 400 Mhz) may be utilized for the 5G technology.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Embodiments are not limited to a particular communication technology; however, various types of communication technologies may be employed for the communication.

The term may be used in the context of mobile telephony, wireless computer networking and other wireless communications, and/or in land surveying. A base station <b>325</b> may include a GPS receiver at a known position, while in wireless communications it may include a transceiver connecting a number of other devices to one another and/or to a wider area.
