powered. With the exterior door handle assembly mounted at a door handle region of a vehicle door and when the illumination source is electrically powered to emit light, light emitted by the illumination source illuminates the door handle region of the vehicle door. The illumination module is located and oriented at the vehicular exterior door handle assembly such that, when the illumination source is electrically powered to emit light, a hand grasping the handle portion to open the vehicle door does not block light emitted by the illumination source so that illumination is maintained at the door handle region of the vehicle door.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="126.66mm" wi="157.99mm" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="105.07mm" wi="83.06mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="228.01mm" wi="103.80mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="224.11mm" wi="119.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="154.94mm" wi="128.44mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="222.84mm" wi="100.92mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="252.65mm" wi="111.25mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="148.17mm" wi="110.07mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="191.35mm" wi="108.88mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="199.47mm" wi="156.72mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="160.02mm" wi="133.86mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="111.93mm" wi="108.71mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="215.90mm" wi="153.08mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="222.33mm" wi="146.81mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="168.99mm" wi="160.02mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="208.28mm" wi="154.52mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="197.87mm" wi="140.97mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="214.04mm" wi="116.59mm" file="US20230001849A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

It is known to provide illumination or light sources at the side of the vehicle, such as to provide security lighting or convenience lighting at the side of the vehicle. For example, such lighting devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,349,450; 6,550,103; 5,371,659; 5,669,699; 5,823,654 and 5,497,305, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Typically, such lighting devices provide illumination along the side of the vehicle and down to the ground at the side of the vehicle. Such illumination thus may have glare or bright spots at the side of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an illumination module or device for a vehicle, such as for an exterior door handle assembly, for providing light at the door handle pocket and at the ground at the side of the vehicle. Optionally, an interior door handle assembly may include an illumination module or device for providing light at the interior door handle pocket and/or at the interior of the vehicle in accordance with the present invention. Optionally, the illumination module may include a back lit icon or mask such that illumination emitted or projected by the illumination module toward a targeted area or surface may be in the form of the icon or mask as defined by lighter and darker regions of the projected or emitted or directed illumination at the targeted area or surface. Such an illumination module may be packaged in or incorporated into a door handle assembly or an exterior rearview mirror assembly or an interior rearview mirror assembly or the like, depending on the particular application and targeted area for illumination.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present invention, a door handle assembly for a door of a vehicle includes a base portion mountable to the vehicle door and a handle portion that is movably or pivotally mountable to the vehicle door. The door may define a pocket or recessed portion at its exterior side and generally at the door handle to provide clearance for a person to grasp the handle portion at the vehicle door for opening the door of the vehicle. The door handle assembly includes an illumination module that is operable (such as in response to actuation of a remote keyless entry device or a passive entry device or other activating event, such as a user inserting a key into a keyhole at the door or door handle or the like) to provide illumination generally downward and toward and to the ground at the side of the vehicle and generally at the door handle area and to provide illumination at the pocket at the vehicle door, so as to provide enhanced illumination at the vehicle door and door handle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optionally, the door handle assembly may include a light bar or strip disposed along an outer surface or region of the door handle portion to provide illumination along the door handle, if desired. Optionally, aspects of the present invention may be suitable for use with an interior door handle assembly disposed at an interior portion of a vehicle door, such as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the present invention, an illumination module includes an illumination source that backlights an iconistic element or optic, whereby a shadow or image of the icon or indicia of the iconistic element is projected or shown at a targeted region, such as at the ground adjacent to or proximate to the side of the vehicle. In one form, the illumination module may be disposed at a door handle of a side door of the vehicle. In another form, the illumination module may be disposed at an exterior rearview mirror at a side of the vehicle. In another form, the illumination module may be disposed at an interior rearview mirror of the vehicle, with the targeted region being at the windshield or dashboard of the vehicle or other interior location within the cabin of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, the present invention provides an illumination module for a door handle that is packaged at the small, substantially restricted area of the door handle of a vehicle. The illumination module includes optics and/or apertures and/or light blockers or guides that spread or diffuse and/or direct the emitted light to provide substantially even or uniform lighting so as to limit hot spots or bright spots or glare at the vehicle door or at the ground. The location of the illumination module is preferably selected so that a person's hand does not cover the illumination module when the person is grasping the door handle to open the door, such that illumination is maintained even when a person's hand is in the pocket region of the door and handle assembly. The location of the illumination module is also preferably selected so that the ground illumination port or portion of the module is substantially close to the vehicle door sheet metal so as to limit or substantially avoid hot spots or bright spots or glare at the vehicle door, while substantially uniform or even ground illumination and pocket illumination may be provided or enhanced via an optical elements, apertures, light guides or lenses or the like of the illumination module.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other objects, advantages, purposes and features of the present invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a vehicle with a door handle assembly in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a door handle assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the door handle assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of an illumination module of the door handle assembly in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of another door handle assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view of the door handle assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of another illumination module of the door handle assembly in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of another door handle assembly in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of an interior door handle assembly in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of another exterior door handle assembly having an illumination module in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view of the illumination module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the illumination module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a bottom plan view of an exterior rearview mirror assembly having an illumination module in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the mirror assembly and illumination module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a rear plan view of the mirror assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, with the reflective element removed to show additional details;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a perspective view of the illumination module of the mirror assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the illumination module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a top plan view of a vehicle having a cornering light at an exterior rearview mirror assembly in accordance with the present invention;

The optic elements may comprise any suitable material, such as a clear polycarbonate, a polystyrene, an acrylic or the like, for environmental robustness. The physical size and shape and position of the apertures for the light output may be selected to provide the desired light output, such as a desired intensity, diffuseness and/or direction of illumination emanating from the illumination module when the illumination sources are activated. A texture or frosting of the lens or lenses or optical elements may also be provided to spread or diffuse the light output of the illumination module. The illumination module may also include a capacitor or capacitors to limit damage from electro-static discharge.

For example, cornering light module <b>618</b> may include one or more illumination sources <b>619</b> at a circuit element <b>621</b> (such as a printed circuit board or the like), which is disposed at a back plate <b>623</b> and encased within a housing having a lens or optic <b>625</b>. The side lighting functions to improve the vision of the driver of the vehicle when turning the around a corner or curve in the road. The cornering light module may operate in conjunction with the respective turn signal so as to be activated when the turn signal at that side of the vehicle is activated. The light module may provide a constant illumination at the side of the vehicle while the turn signal flashes. The cornering light module may comprise any suitable illumination source or sources, such as, for example, one or more LEDs, one or more light bulbs, a light pipe and/or the like. Although shown and described as being disposed at the exterior mirror assembly, it is envisioned that the cornering light module may be mounted at any suitable location at the vehicle, such as at or within the door handle assembly.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, the cornering light module may provide substantially constant illumination that is projected outward, such as in response to activation of the turn signal by the driver of the vehicle. Optionally, the cornering light module may provide a sideward illumination in response to the high beams of the vehicle being activated, in order to provide additional lighting of the road or shoulder sidewardly of the vehicle and rearward of the area encompassed by the front headlights when in their high beam state. In such an application, the sideward lighting function may be deactivated when the headlights are in their low beam state.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Optionally, the illumination module may provide an active cornering light for curved or winding roads, such as by using a cluster of lights and/or an alignment of lights that are tied to the steering controls of the vehicle. Thus, the lights (such as a row of lights with some of the lights illuminating further sidewardly than some of the other lights) may illuminate in a progressively outward direction depending on the position or steering angle of the steering wheel or front wheels/tires of the vehicle, and then the lights may progressively deactivate in the opposite direction as the steering wheel and/or wheels/tires are turned back to a center or straight orientation. Thus, the lights may illuminate a greater sideward area in response to a detection of the vehicle undergoing a sharper turn so as to enhance the viewing by the driver of the area to the side of the vehicle and toward where the vehicle is being steered, while limiting sideward illumination when the vehicle is being driven in a generally straight or slightly curved path.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Optionally, the illumination module may also comprise a ground illumination light or puddle lamp, which provides downwardly directed illumination (and which may provide a back lit icon or indicia or logo or the like), such as described above. Optionally, the illumination module may comprise a cornering light and a puddle lamp and turn signal light, and may have a wrap-around style turn signal at the exterior mirror that may be fitted with a prism lens or the like to project light in the appropriate direction and/or toward the targeted location. The illumination module thus may include one or more illumination sources and one or more lenses or optics or light pipes or the like to distribute or direct illumination toward the appropriate targeted areas.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, the present invention provides an illumination module at a vehicle door handle or exterior rearview mirror assembly for illuminating the door handle region or cup region of the vehicle door and/or the ground area at or adjacent to or proximate the side of the vehicle and generally below the vehicle door handle assembly or mirror assembly. The illumination source may thus be temporarily activated as a person approaches or contacts the handle to ease grasping of the handle and thus opening of the door in nighttime conditions. The illumination sources may illuminate the handle region or cup region of the door, and may provide ground illumination of the area by the vehicle, similar to safety illumination sources such as the types described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,371,659, 5,669,699, 5,823,654 and 5,497,305, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. When activated, the illumination source preferably draws a low or minimal amount of energy from a power source, such as a vehicle battery (not shown) or the like, such that the battery or power source is not overly drained during the period of time that the illumination source is activated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Optionally, the door handle assembly or mirror assembly or illumination module may include or may be associated with an antenna for receiving signals from or communicating with a remote device. For example, the antenna (such as, for example, an antenna of the types described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,619, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) may communicate a signal to the door locking system via a wire connection or the like, or wirelessly, such as via a radio frequency signal or via an infrared signal or via other wireless signaling means.
