id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical field of binders that can replace traditionally used bitumen compositions, particularly in the field of road construction. More specifically, the invention relates to novel bituminous compositions, methods for their preparation and their use in road and industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Petroleum refining involves different processes and transformations. Petroleum undergoes a first distillation, called distillation under atmospheric pressure i.e. 1013.25 hPa). This first distillation step makes it possible to recover different hydrocarbon fractions (gas: butane and propane, light petroleum, heavy naphtha, kerosene, gasoil, domestic fuel, . . . ) separated according to their boiling point. Atmospheric distillation is carried out in a plate column. At the end of this distillation under atmospheric pressure, there remains a heavy residual fraction, which is called the atmospheric residue or the atmospheric distillation residue. This atmospheric residue contains long-chain hydrocarbons which, due to this, are fragile and therefore likely to be cleaved into smaller chains, if heating is carried out under atmospheric pressure. This residue therefore undergoes a second distillation under reduced pressure (commonly called vacuum distillation). The reduced pressure used for this second distillation is, in general, in the range from 10 to 150 hPa. Such reduced pressure reduces the temperature at which components evaporate, and thus allows heating to be reduced. Distillation under reduced pressure is also carried out in a plate column or packed column, or a dual system combining these two types of columns. At the end of this vacuum distillation step, there remains a heavy residual fraction, which is called the vacuum distillation residue, or the reduced pressure distillation residue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is always commercially interesting to transform heavy residues into light cuts which have more commercial value. This visbreaking process is applied to the vacuum distillation residues to partially transform the heavy products into light products, which also leads to reducing the viscosity of the residue obtained at the end of this visbreaking process. Visbreaking, in particular, makes it possible to recover noble molecules and to extract fuel and gasoil. Such a visbreaking process corresponds to &#xab;heat cracking&#xbb; carried out, in general, in the liquid phase in the temperature range from 420&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., preferably a temperature from 450 to 460&#xb0; C., and under pressure in the range from 5 000 to 20000 hPa. Visbreaking is carried out without provision of hydrogen. The residue obtained is called a visbroken residue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a visbroken residue can, in particular, have an intrinsic stability S of less than 2.5 and/or a peptisation level Sa of less than 0.6, said values S and Sa being defined and measured according to standard ASTM D 7157-12. The visbroken residues can be added to other bitumen bases to reduce the cost in particular, due to their lower price than bitumen. On the other hand, they cannot be used alone or in large amounts as in that case it is not possible to obtain a binder that complies with the requirements of standards EN 12591 and EN 13294-1, and in particular standard EN12591, to fulfil the specific requirements of road applications (road-grade bitumen). In particular, in application WO 2015/071370, the use of an amount representing at the most 50% by weight of the bituminous composition is recommended.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of visbroken vacuum distillation residue is also known to be responsible for the appearance of crevices, ruptures, cracks, fissures, cracks and/or breaks in particular, which appear at a low temperature, when they are used in large amounts, in road coatings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Within the scope of the invention, the applicant proposes novel bituminous compositions which make it possible to upgrade bitumen bases which are known not to be satisfactory, such as visbroken residues. The compositions according to the invention, in spite of such bitumen bases, have adapted resistance to ageing to act as binders, particularly in the field of road construction, and, in particular, which can be used to manufacture mixes or asphalts. An objective is also to propose such bituminous compositions which help reduces the appearance of fissures at low temperature.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The bituminous compositions according to the invention could therefore constitute a substitute for traditional bitumen compositions, which would be particularly advantageous in the case of shortages in road-grade bitumen. In addition, within the context of the decision by the World Maritime Organisation to reduce in 2020 the maximum sulphur limit in maritime fuels to 0.5% by weight, it is probable that there will be less bitumen available corresponding to available specific requirements of road construction. Indeed, bitumen would have to undergo processing which would give diesel and coke. In this context, the invention proposes substitutes for standard road bitumen and hard bitumen, which there could be a lack of over the coming years. In particular, the invention proposes substitutes for standard road bitumen which there could be a lack of over the coming years.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this context, the invention relates to bituminous compositions comprising a mixture of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0009">a bitumen base, which represents at least 50% by weight, and preferably at least 80% by weight, and preferentially at least 90% by weight, of the total weight of the composition, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0010">a hydroxide XOH with X=Na or K, which represents from 0.001 to 1% by weight, preferably from 0.002 to 0.5% by weight, and preferentially from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight of the total weight of the composition.<br/>said bitumen base having an intrinsic stability S from 1 to 2.5 and/or a peptisation level Sa from 0 to 0.6, said values S and Sa being measured according to standard ASTM D 7157-12.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">Within the scope of the invention, the inventors have developed new bituminous compositions which, although comprising a substantial amount of a base bitumen having an intrinsic stability S from 1 to 2.5 and/or a peptisation level Sa of 0 to 0.6, show satisfactory resistance to ageing properties.

This stability S depends on the aromatic nature of asphaltenes, indexed by the value Sa and the aromatic nature of the medium, This method thus makes it possible to characterise the petroleum cuts resulting from the petroleum distillation process. This method, in particular, makes it possible to distinguish between the petroleum distillation residues according to their intrinsic stability S and the aromatic nature of the asphaltenes quantified by the peptisation level of the asphaltenes Sa.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047">The minimum value of S is 1. This value 1 indicates strong instability, with a strong tendency of asphaltenes to precipitate. The higher the S value, the more stable the bitumen base with low tendency of asphaltenes to precipitate.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048">The value Sa is linked to the length and number of aromatic chains in the asphaltenes. The higher the Sa value, the more the asphaltenes in the bitumen base are peptisable in a colloidal system.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0049">Within the scope of the invention, the bitumen base used in the compositions of the invention is, preferably, a mixture of products resulting from visbreaking of the residues of distillation under reduced pressure said residues of distillation under reduced pressure originating from the under reduced pressure distillation of atmospheric residues, themselves originating from direct atmospheric distillation of petroleum.

Visbreaking is generally carried out under pressure in the range from 5000 to 20000 hPa. These products resulting from visbreaking of vacuum distillation residues comprise asphaltenes that are unstable in the colloidal state, relative to traditional bitumen resulting from direct distillation of petroleum (atmospheric and/or under vacuum). The instability of asphaltenes generally results in a degradation of cold performance.

Most often, in the powder as well as in the hydrocarbonated composition IC, the hydroxide particles are not spherical and have irregular shapes. When it concerns the size of particles within the scope of the invention, what is meant is the maximum size which corresponds to the largest dimension which can be measured, especially with a microscope.

In particular, the compositions according to the invention can be used as a binder to replace conventional bitumen. As a binder, a composition according to the invention can be used to prepare an association with aggregates, especially for road construction. As these are road applications, the invention concerns in particular coated aggregates as materials for the construction and the maintenance of road foundations and their surfacing, and for all road works.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0149">By mix is meant a mixture of a binder with aggregates and possibly mineral and/or synthetic fillers. The mix comprises a composition such as described within the scope of the invention, as a binder and possibly mineral and/or synthetic fillers, preferably chosen from among fines, sand, stone chips and recycled milled products. The aggregates are mineral and/or synthetic aggregates, in particular recycled milled products, of a size greater than 2 mm, preferably between 2 mm and 20 mm.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0150">Additionally, an object of the invention is a method for the preparation of mixes comprising hot mixing of a composition according to the invention, with aggregates, and possibly mineral and/or synthetic fillers.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0151">A composition according to the invention, can, advantageously be used to prepare a surface coat, a hot mix, cold-poured mix or grave-emulsion. As this concerns road applications, the invention also covers asphalts as materials to make and cover pavements.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0152">By asphalt is meant a mixture of a binder with mineral and/or synthetic fillers. An asphalt comprises a composition such as that described within the scope of the invention and mineral fillers such as fines, sand, stone chips and recycled milled products. The mineral fillers consist of fines (particles with dimensions less than 0.063 mm), sand (particles with dimensions between 0.063 mm and 2 mm) and optionally of stone chips (particles with dimensions greater than 2 mm, preferably between 2 mm and 4 mm). The asphalts show 100% compactness and are mainly used to construct and cover pavements, whereas the mixes have a compactness of less than 100% and are used to construct roads. Unlike the mixes, asphalts are not compacted with a roller when being put in place.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0153">Thus, another objective of the invention is also a method for the preparation of an asphalt comprising the hot mixing of a composition according to the invention, with mineral and/or synthetic fillers.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0154">Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a composition according to the invention in various industrial applications, in particular for preparing waterproof coating, a membrane or seal layer.
