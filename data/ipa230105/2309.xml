The choice of the catalyst depends on various criteria, notably on the nature of the alkyl (meth)acrylate (II) or of the alcohol (III) used, but also on the nature of the process, such as a batch process or a continuous process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0005">For example, the alkoxy titanates described in FR 2777561 and FR 2876375 or the tin oxide derivatives described in JP 2001172234 and JP 2001187763 enable very selective catalysis of the formation of acrylic esters by transesterification. In all cases, a preliminary step of purification for removal of the catalyst by tailing is necessary, since said catalyst is a poison for the purification of heavy alkyl acrylates by distillation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0006">In order to reduce the costs of using the catalyst and to facilitate its recycling into the reaction, supported heterogeneous catalysts were developed for the synthesis of heavy alkyl acrylates by transesterification reaction. Catalysts on metallic polymer supports, of titanium (FR 2913612) or of zirconium (EP 0557131) are used in one or more transesterification reactors in series. However, these catalysts have relatively short service lives, due to the high temperatures associated with the transesterification reaction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0007">The use of inorganic salts that are insoluble in the reaction medium as transesterification catalyst for the production of aminoalkyl (meth)acrylates was described in US 2013/178 592. The addition of water to the reaction (300-3000 ppm) makes it possible notably to improve the selectivity of these heterogeneous catalysts. However, K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, which is the catalyst preferentially chosen, is very sparingly selective (&#x3c;25%) in the synthesis of acrylic esters.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0008">FR 2175104 describes a process for the synthesis of aminoalkyl acrylates in the presence of a zinc compound, the molar content of which is between 0.01% and 30% relative to the alkylamino alcohol. Among the numerous catalysts consisting of zinc compounds listed in said document is basic zinc carbonate, described in example 28. More particularly, said example describes the synthesis of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate by means of a transesterification process performed in batch mode, starting with ethyl acrylate and dimethylaminoethanol, in the presence of phenothiazine and basic zinc carbonate, the content of said carbonate being 1.045 mol % relative to the dimethylaminoethanol. It reports a yield of 84.5% of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate. However, the corresponding catalytic activity, determined relative to the TOF (turnover frequency) value, calculated according to the formula indicated below, is very low (only 9.5 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0009">Consequently, there is at the present time a need for a transesterification process that is suitable for the continuous manufacture of heavy alkyl acrylates, which overcomes the drawbacks listed above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0010">To this end, the invention provides a process for the continuous synthesis of heavy alkyl acrylates by transesterification reaction using hydrozincite (of formula Zn<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6 </sub>or [ZnCO<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>.[Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>3 </sub>or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>Zn<sub>5</sub>) as heterogeneous catalyst. This catalyst makes it possible to obtain very high production yields when it is employed in very low contents (molar content of less than 1% relative to the heavy alcohol), while at the same time maintaining high catalytic activity.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0011">Furthermore, since the catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, purification of the desired alkyl acrylate takes place in only two steps (topping and then tailing), by means of two distillation columns, instead of three steps, as reported in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0012">The invention relates to a process for the continuous synthesis of (meth)acrylic esters of formula (I):</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002310A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">in which R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R<sub>1 </sub>is a linear or branched alkyl radical, or a cycloaliphatic, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl radical, including from 4 to 40 carbon atoms, or a linear or branched alkyl radical containing at least one heteroatom and from 3 to 40 carbon atoms, by reaction of an alkyl (meth)acrylate of formula (II):</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002310A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0023" num="0000">in which R has the abovementioned meaning and R<sub>2 </sub>is a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,<br/>with an alcohol of formula (III):</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;OH&#x2003;&#x2003;(III)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0025" num="0000">in which R<sub>1 </sub>has the abovementioned meaning, in the presence of hydrozincite as heterogeneous catalyst.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0013">Characteristically, the process uses a catalyst content ranging from 0.01 mol % to 0.5 mol % relative to the alcohol.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0014">Advantageously, the purification of the alkyl acrylate takes place in two steps: topping and then tailing, by means of two distillation columns</p><p id="p-0028" num="0015">The present invention makes it possible to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art.

A portion of the tail from this distillation containing the metal residue is sent for destruction (outside recycling), markedly increasing the costs of using the catalyst and the associated ecological impact.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0019">Moreover, the head from this distillation contains the desired heavy alkyl acrylate, and also the light alkyl acrylate and the unreacted heavy alcohol. An additional distillation (heading) is required in order to separate the heavy alkyl acrylate from the lighter starting materials. The tail from this second distillation then contains the desired heavy alkyl acrylate and the excess polymerization inhibitor(s). A final distillation step (purification) is then required in order to obtain the desired heavy alkyl acrylate in the desired specifications.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0020">Removal of the catalyst directly in the reaction would thus enable this purification process to be performed in only two steps (heading and then tailing) instead of three, lowering the construction cost of a production plant, and also the costs associated with the energy required for the production.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0021">The present invention relates to a process for the continuous synthesis of heavy alkyl acrylates by transesterification reaction using hydrozincite as heterogeneous catalyst, the purification of the final product being performed in two steps.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0022">The invention relates to a process for the continuous synthesis of (meth)acrylic esters of formula (I):</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002310A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0037" num="0000">in which R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R<sub>1 </sub>is a linear or branched alkyl radical, or a cycloaliphatic, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl radical, including from 4 to 40 carbon atoms, or a linear or branched alkyl radical containing at least one heteroatom and from 3 to 40 carbon atoms, by reaction of an alkyl (meth)acrylate of formula (II):</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-C00006" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002310A1-20230105-C00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">in which R has the abovementioned meaning and R<sub>2 </sub>is a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, with an alcohol of formula (III):</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;OH&#x2003;&#x2003;(III)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0000">in the presence of at least one polymerization inhibitor and of hydrozincite as heterogeneous catalyst, characterized in that the catalyst content is between 0.01 mol % and 0.5 mol % relative to the alcohol.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0023">According to various embodiments, said process comprises the following features, combined where appropriate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0024">According to one embodiment, the transesterification reaction takes place in a reactor stirred at a temperature of 80-150&#xb0; C., preferably between 90 and 130&#xb0; C., the reaction mixture exiting the reactor comprising the heavy alkyl acrylate with, as light products, the heavy alcohol, the light alcohol and the unreacted light acrylate, and, as heavy products, the polymerization inhibitor(s) and also heavy reaction products.

This is notably observed relative to the formation of Michael adducts in the presence of high concentrations of basic zinc carbonate catalyst.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0046">For example, in the case of the production of DMAEA by transesterification between a light acrylate, such as methyl acrylate (MA) or ethyl acrylate (EA), and N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), the as yet unreacted alcohol or the light alcohols generated during the reaction (methanol or ethanol) are added at the double bond of the already formed DMAEA or of the unreacted light acrylate (MA or EA), to form heavy Michael addition by-products [DMAE+DMAEA].</p><p id="p-0060" num="0047">These heavy by-products are generally concentrated in a &#x201c;heavy fraction&#x201d; separated out during the process for the purification of the crude DMAEA. The removal of this heavy fraction generally poses a problem since it must be incinerated, and leads to significant losses of starting materials (notably DMAE) and of finished product (DMAEA) which are present in this fraction in free form or in the form of Michael adducts.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0048">Now, the measures for the concentration as adducts of this type in the tail stream from the first distillation column (C1) of the process according to the invention show that their mass content does not exceed 5%, this value being significantly lower than those measured in the heavy fractions obtained via the process described in FR 2175104, and when the catalyst content is greater than 0.5 mol % relative to the alcohol.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0049">The content of Michael adducts is measured by gas chromatography. Moreover, it has been found that the process according to the invention using hydrozincite as heterogeneous catalyst in very low contents (molar content ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%, limits inclusive, relative to the heavy alcohol), makes it possible to obtain very high production yields, this being accompanied by high catalytic activity. More precisely, the catalytic activity is determined by the TOF (turnover frequency) value, calculated according to the formula below. The residence time is determined as a function of the extraction flow rate at the bottom of the transesterification reactor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>T</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>O</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>F</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>N</mi>    <mrow>     <mi>D</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>M</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>A</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>E</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>A</mi>    </mrow>   </msub>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>N</mi>     <mi>Catalyst</mi>    </msub>    <mo>&#xd7;</mo>    <mi>T</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>d</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>S</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0064" num="0000">The process according to the invention is characterized by TOF values of greater than 50 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0050">The examples that follow illustrate the invention without limiting it.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">General Protocol for Examples 1 to 3</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0051">In the examples that follow, the following abbreviations were used:</p><p id="p-0067" num="0000">EA: Ethyl acrylate</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">DMAE: Dimethylaminoethanol</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0052">DMAEA: Dimethylaminoethyl acrylate</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">PTZ: Phenothiazine</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="2">4-HT: 4-OH-TEMPO</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0053">Zn<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>: Hydrozincite<br/>Ti(OEt)<sub>4</sub>: Tetraethyl titanate<br/>TOF: Turnover frequency (catalytic efficiency or activity)</p><p id="p-0070" num="0054">The EA, the heavy alcohol (DMAE), and a transesterification catalyst (Ti(OEt)<sub>4</sub>) or Zn<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>) are introduced continuously into a stirred 0.5 L reactor, heated by circulation of oil thermostatically maintained at 135&#xb0; C. in a jacket, and on which reactor is mounted a distillation column with Multiknit packing, with a condenser containing water-glycol mixture at the column head, a reflux head, a vacuum separator, receivers and traps.
