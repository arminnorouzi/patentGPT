invention relates to devices for holding a gear train in a turbomachine.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, a gear train comprises planet gears meshing with an outer crown or with an outer planetary gear and a centre gear or inner planetary gear. The planet gears are carried by a satellite carrier and mounted freely rotatably on pivots. Such a gear train can be used, for example, to transmit power from a drive shaft, such as the shaft of a low-pressure compressor, to a fan wheel via a centre gear carried by the shaft. In a possible operating configuration, the satellite carrier is fixed in rotation and the centre gear and outer crown are driving and driven, respectively. This assembly is commonly known as planetary reduction gear. With such an arrangement it is possible, for example, in a turbomachine to drive the fan wheel connected to the ring gear via the shaft of the low-pressure compressor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the integration of a reduction gear into a turbomachine poses several difficulties. Firstly, the connection of the reduction gear, i.e. the satellite carrier, to the casing must be made with a certain degree of flexibility in order to limit parasitic mechanical stresses within the reduction gear, i.e. to limit premature deterioration of the teeth, and also to filter out any vibrations propagating in the transmission chain for example. Secondly, it must be possible for a high torque to be taken up by the casing under normal conditions, but also under extreme operating conditions. The two above-mentioned points are thus clearly contradictory and are therefore generally a compromise in the reduction-gear mounting architecture. However, these two functions make it possible to ensure both optimum behaviour of the reduction gear and satisfactory mechanical strength of the connection between the reduction gear and the casing. Thirdly, it is necessary that the architecture selected allows good accessibility for mounting and maintenance of the reduction gear in its environment. It should be noted that the difficulties outlined above are the same when the outer crown is fixed and the satellite carrier is rotating (planetary gear).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention set out below offers a solution that solves the above-mentioned problems while being simple and economical to implement.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present document relates to an assembly for retaining a gear train in a turbomachine, the assembly comprising an annular casing in which is engaged an annular part rotatably locked in the casing by annular means of cogging comprising first annular means of coupling formed on the annular part and co-operating with second annular means of coupling formed on the annular casing, wherein a film of oil is formed in an annular space bounded between the first means of coupling and the second means of coupling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By incorporating an oil film directly into the means of cogging, the annular part of the casing, the movements of the annular part relative to the casing are dampened. Thus, when the annular part is integral with a satellite carrier or an outer planetary gear of a gear train, it is possible to limit the transmission of vibrations to the casing and the rest of the turbomachine. More specifically, the integration of an oil film between the first means of coupling and the second means of coupling allows to achieve:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">translational damping along a radial direction of the annular part relative to the casing,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">torsional damping about the longitudinal axis, i.e. the axis of the assembly and of the turbomachine,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">tilting damping about an axis perpendicular to a radial direction and to the longitudinal axis.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">The annular part may include an annular area of flexibility to give the part greater flexibility in a given area than the rest of the annular part. This annular area of flexibility allows for greater orbiting of the annular part in the casing and thus increases the damping efficiency of the oil film.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">The integration of an oil film should not influence the nominal torque transmitted by the annular part to the crankcase, but helps to reduce the oscillations, i.e. the variations of the said torque, which can be of the order of 10 to 15% of the nominal torque.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The first means of coupling and the second means of coupling are for example arranged axially between a first annular seal and a second annular seal each clamped between the annular part and the casing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">To provide an oil supply to said annular space, one of the annular part and the casing can comprise an oil-inlet channel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The first means of coupling can comprise first teeth circumferentially interposed between second teeth of the second means of coupling.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Each first tooth may comprise radial circumferential end faces and circumferentially facing radial circumferential end faces of each second tooth.

The cylindrical surface can allow the centring of the annular part in the housing when the annular part is mounted in the housing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Also, the second annular seal can be radially interposed between the radially inner end of the second annular wall and a radially facing cylindrical surface of the annular part.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The cylindrical surface of the casing can have a radius which is greater than the radius of the cylindrical surface of the annular part.

Each second tooth can extend radially inwards from the cylindrical surface of the casing and have a radially inner end face arranged to radially face the cylindrical surface of the annular part.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">In this arrangement, the first ring seal is placed at a greater radial distance than the second seal.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The oil can be lodged circumferentially and continuously between the first and second teeth.

Classically, the low-pressure turbine <b>26</b> rotates the rotor <b>30</b> of the low-pressure compressor, which is connected to the fan wheel <b>12</b>. However, in order to limit the rotational speed of the fan wheel <b>12</b> relative to the rotational speed of the rotor <b>30</b> of the low-pressure compressor <b>18</b>, it is known to mount a reduction gear <b>32</b> radially inside the low-pressure compressor <b>18</b> to reduce the output speed.

Each planet gear <b>34</b> is mounted freely rotatable around a pivot <b>40</b> and the pivots <b>40</b> are integral with a satellite carrier <b>42</b>.
