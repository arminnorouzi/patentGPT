Conventionally, when content is generated it remains unknown whether, and to what extent, the content will become viral upon being uploaded to the Internet. Additionally, if a content item fails to become viral after it has been uploaded to the Internet, options for enhancing the virality of the content item are limited and require user involvement.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the foregoing, the present disclosure provides systems and related methods that are able, even before a content item is uploaded to a communication network, to predict whether, and to what extent, the content item is likely to become viral. The systems and methods described herein are also able to automatically measure the virality of the content item after it has been uploaded and selectively apply one or more virality enhancement techniques to the content item to enhance its virality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, the present disclosure provides a system for enhancing virality for a content item. The system comprises a communication port, a virality enhancement database, and control circuitry. The communication port is coupled to a communication network, such as the Internet. The virality enhancement database is configured to store one or more virality enhancement techniques, such as applying to the content item a filter effect, a genre combination, a speed variation, background music, or a surprise element. The control circuitry is configured to upload a content item, such as a video clip, an audio clip, an image, a tweet, or any other type of content, to a content sharing platform, such as a social media website, via the communication port and the communication network. The control circuitry receives feedback on the content item from the content sharing platform via the communication network and the communication port. Example types of feedback include values for virality feedback metrics, such as numbers of likes, dislikes, shares, comments, or views indicated for the content item by the content sharing platform. Based on the feedback, the control circuitry determines a virality score for the content item and determines whether the virality score meets a virality criterion. Example types of virality criteria include a cumulative number of virality feedback metrics for the content item. In response to determining that the virality score does not meet the virality criterion, the control circuitry selects a virality enhancement technique from the virality enhancement database, modifies the content item by applying the virality enhancement technique to the content item, and uploads the modified content item to the content sharing platform via the communication port and the communication network.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example, the control circuitry is configured to determine the virality score for the content item by computing, as the virality score, a cumulative number of likes, dislikes, shares, comments, and views for the content item indicated by the content sharing platform. In another aspect, the control circuitry is configured to determine the virality score for the content item by retrieving respective weights for the plurality of feedback metrics and computing, as the virality score, a weighted combination of the plurality of feedback metrics based on the respective weights.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The control circuitry is configured to select the virality enhancement technique in a variety of ways, in various aspects. For instance, in one example, the control circuitry selects a first virality enhancement technique from the virality enhancement database, predicts a virality score for the content item if the content item were modified based on the first virality enhancement technique, determines whether the predicted virality score meets the virality criterion, and, based on a result of the determination, selects the virality enhancement technique to be used for modifying the content item. For example, in response to determining that the predicted virality score meets the virality criterion, the control circuitry selects the first virality enhancement technique as the virality enhancement technique to be used for the modifying of the content item. In response to determining that the predicted virality score does not meet the virality criterion, the control circuitry selects a second virality enhancement technique from the virality enhancement database as the virality enhancement technique to be used for the modifying of the content item. In some aspects, the control circuitry is configured to predict the virality score for the content item by determining respective numbers of virality factors included in the content item, retrieving respective weights for the virality factors, and computing, as the predicted virality score, a weighted combination of the plurality of virality factors based on the respective weights.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further aspect, after the control circuitry has modified the content item, the control circuitry is configured to receive updated feedback on the modified content item from the content sharing platform via the communication network and the communication port. Based on the updated feedback, the control circuitry determines an updated virality score for the modified content item and determines whether the updated virality score meets the virality criterion. In response to determining that the updated virality score does not meet the virality criterion, the control circuitry selects, from the virality enhancement database, an additional virality enhancement technique and applies the additional virality enhancement technique to the modified content item, thereby generating a further modified content item. The control circuitry uploads the further modified content item to the content sharing platform via the communication port and the communication network, and, in some cases, automatically repeats the process until the content item yields a virality score that meets the virality criterion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative block diagram of a system for enhancing virality for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustrative block diagram showing additional details of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for predicting a virality score for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an example data structure for virality enhancement database entries, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for enhancing virality for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for determining a virality score for a content item based on feedback, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative block diagram of a system for enhancing virality for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

In another example of a client/server-based application, control circuitry <b>220</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server (e.g., server <b>202</b>). For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>212</b>) and/or generate displays. Computing device <b>210</b> may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally via display <b>228</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely (e.g., by server <b>202</b>) while the resulting displays, such as the display windows described elsewhere herein, are provided locally on computing device <b>210</b>.

In various embodiments, individual steps of process <b>300</b>, or any process described herein, may be implemented by one or more components of system <b>100</b> and/or system <b>200</b>. Although the present disclosure may describe certain steps of process <b>300</b> (and of other processes described herein) as being implemented by certain components of system <b>100</b> and/or system <b>200</b>, this is for purposes of illustration only, and it should be understood that other components of system <b>100</b> and/or system <b>200</b> may implement those steps instead.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>302</b>, control circuitry <b>220</b> detects and/or receives information about a number of virality factors present in a particular content item, which may have been generated by way of content generator <b>234</b>. At <b>304</b>, control circuitry <b>220</b> retrieves, for example, from virality enhancement database <b>238</b>, respective weights for the virality factors determined at <b>302</b> to be present in the content item. At <b>306</b>, control circuitry <b>220</b> determines a predicted virality score for the content item based on the respective numbers of virality factors determined at <b>302</b> and corresponding weights retrieved at <b>304</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an example data structure <b>400</b> for a virality enhancement database entry for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Each virality enhancement database entry <b>400</b> corresponds to a content item and includes a virality factor or virality enhancement technique <b>402</b>, a number of instances of the virality factor included in the content item <b>404</b>, a weight for the virality factor <b>406</b>, and a weighted virality factor <b>408</b>, which is determined by multiplying the number of instances of the virality factor in the content item <b>404</b> by the weight for the virality factor <b>406</b>. The virality score <b>410</b> is then computed as a weighted combination of the weighted virality factors <b>408</b> computed for the content item.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Example types of virality enhancement techniques include introducing a surprise element or an element of unexpectedness; introducing a filter, such as a SNAPCHAT filter; introducing a genre combination; introducing speed variations (e.g., in frames per second); and/or embedding apt/contextual background music. For example, a formal company video-conferencing live meeting may be modified to show an infant suddenly crawling into the video frame as an element of surprise to render the audience awestruck. As another example, a photo of someone's birthday party may be modified to show the presence of a famous and popular celebrity. As yet another example, a filter, such as a beauty filter, a filter that changes looks into funny faces, or the like, may be applied to the content item to introduce a surprise factor that further mesmerizes the audience and improves virality. Alternatively, or in addition, a combination of genres may be incorporated into the content item to entice the audience and improve virality, retaining the suspense and thrill quotient. For instance, a comedy content item may be modified by introducing into the item portions of content from other genres, such as having a sequence of portions of the content item proceed from a comedy genre to a romance genre to an action genre to a comedy genre to a thriller genre to a comedy genre. As still another example, speed variation may be introduced into the content item, such as by combining slow and normal or fast motion (e.g., in frames per second) based on whether a situation in the displayed content is expected to impact the audience's fondness of the content. For instance, a scene in an old movie in which two lovers meet after ten years may be modified to have a mix of slow and normal motion to increase the surprise and suspense element and use that to captivate the audience.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>308</b>, control circuitry <b>220</b> determines whether the predicted virality score determined at <b>306</b> meets a virality score criterion, which may be user-configured or system-configured and may be stored in and retrieved from storage <b>230</b>.

Then, at <b>312</b>, control circuitry <b>220</b> modifies the content item based on the virality enhancement technique selected at <b>310</b>. Control then passes back to <b>302</b> to detect and/or receive information about the number of virality factors present in the content item as modified at <b>312</b>. Processes <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>308</b> (and <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>, as the case may be) are then repeated for the modified content item until the virality score of the content item meets the virality criterion.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of process <b>500</b> for enhancing virality for a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
