Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the molding and filling of plastic containers while using the liquid end product as molding medium. More specifically, the invention relates to sealing the liquid end product in the container prior to ejection of the container from the forming station of the hydraulic blow molding machine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Technology</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Plastic containers for liquid products are manufactured by various different methods. In some methods, a plastic preform is injection molded in a preform molding machine and subsequently cooled to ambient temperatures. A second machine, which may be in a remote location relative to the first machine, re-heats the preform to a suitable temperature for molding, places the thermally conditioned preform within a mold and then expands the preform, both axially and radially, to form a container. Such a process is known as a two-step molding process, and a corresponding system is known as a two-step system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another process, the injection molding of the preform and the subsequent forming of the container all occur, in the same machine or in different machines, without allowing the preform to significantly cool and require reheating. Such processes, machines and systems are correspondingly known as one-step technologies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In either of the above, air has traditionally been used as the blow medium to axially and radially expand the preform and form the container. Instead of using air as the blow medium, a more recent process use the liquid end product, the product intended to be retained and distributed in the container, as the blow medium. The processes, apparatuses and systems that form and fill a container using the liquid end product as the blow medium are generally known as liquid or hydraulic blow molding technologies. Hydraulic blow molding can also be practiced via either a two-step or one-step molding scheme.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As used herein, the term &#x201c;liquid&#x201d; is intended to encompass non-gas, flowable mediums. The liquid may therefore have a low viscosity (like water or alcohol), a medium viscosity (like edible oil or soup) or a viscosity (like catsup or yogurt). Also the liquid may be homogeneous or nonhomogeneous and is not intended to be limited to foodstuff. Non-limiting illustrative examples of liquids that may be utilized with the present invention include cleansing products (for body, house or automotive care), medical fluids, industrial fluids, automotive fluids, and agricultural fluids.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a typical hydraulic blow molding machine, at the container forming station, a forming head is provided with an injection nozzle, a seal pin and a stretch rod. The injection nozzle is axially movable along the central axis, by an actuator, between engaged and disengaged positions where the injection nozzle seals with either the preform, surfaces of the mold securing the preform or surfaces of a neck ring that secures the preform to the mold.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Defined through the interior of the injection nozzle is a central passageway. This central passageway is in communication with a source of the liquid blow medium. When provided to the central passageway, the liquid blow medium is pressurized, preferably by one of the well-known devices used for providing pressurized fluids during the molding and filling of containers. These devices include several motors, pressure pumps, pistons and other appropriate devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Located within the central passageway is a seal pin that is axially movable between extended and retracted positions along the central axis. This movement is effectuated by an actuator, which may be of any well-known variety of actuator utilized in connection with the hydraulic blow molding of plastic containers. Such actuators are often pneumatically driven, but may be driven by other means, including without limitation, electric motors, servomotors, magnetic or other means. The distal end of the seal pin typically includes a head having surfaces defining a sealing ring that engages a sealing seat provided on a sealing bell, the latter of which may be considered as part of the injection nozzle and which is located adjacent to and/or defines the exit orifice of the injection nozzle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Extending through a longitudinal bore in the seal pin is a stretch rod or member. The stretch rod is extendable by an actuator (similar to the previously mentioned actuators) out of the seal pin, through the exit orifice and into the body of the preform. When fully extended, the stretch rod engages a closed end of the preform and axially stretches the preform to assist in forming the container.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Typically, once a mold has closed about the body of the preform, with the body of the preform being located within a mold cavity defining the shape of the desired container, the forming head and/or injection nozzle is lowered by the actuator to create the sealed engagement with the preform. At this time, the seal pin is in an extended position and is sealingly engaged with the injection nozzle. Next, the stretch rod is extended to engage the closed-end of the preform and the seal pin is retracted to open the exit orifice and allow the liquid blow medium to be injected into the preform. Simultaneously with or in advance of the opening of the exit orifice, the stretch rod may be further and fully extended to impinge the closed-end of the preform between the distal end of the stretch rod and the bottom of the mold cavity. The continued injection of liquid blow medium causes the axially stretched preform to radially expand into conformity with the surfaces of the mold cavity, thereby simultaneously forming and filling the container. Once the container is formed and filled, the stretch rod is retracted and the seal pin extended, the latter closing the injection nozzle and thereby stopping the introduction of the liquid into the container. After the forming head and injection nozzle are retracted, the mold may be opened and the formed and filled container removed from the forming station.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As seen from the above, when being removed from the forming station, the filled container is not capped and sealed. This can therefore lead to some of the liquid product contained therein being spilled as the container is ejected from the forming station and transferred to a capping station.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect the present invention provides a method of hydraulically blow molding a container from a preform using a liquid end product as a liquid blow medium,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of hydraulically blow molding a container from a preform using a liquid end product as a liquid blow medium, wherein, in a forming station, a container is hydraulically blow molded resulting in a formed and filled container.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention is applicable to containers formed and filled in a hydraulic blow molding process of either a one-step or two-step variety. As noted above, a hydraulic blow molding process is one by which a plastic container is simultaneously formed and filled utilizing the liquid end product as the blow medium. As a result of the liquid blow medium, the hydraulic blow molding process has many issues and challenges that are not appreciated by traditional blow molding technologies utilizing air as the blow medium.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One such issue and challenge involves the removal of the formed and filled container from the mold assembly. Since the container is already filled with the liquid end product, forces created when removing the filled container at high speed can result in some liquid end product being spilled from the container. This spillage has the potential to contaminate various surfaces and components of the machine, which in turn may lead to subsequently produce containers being inadequately formed. To prevent such spillage, the present invention provides a system and method by which a liner seal is engaged with the finish of the formed and filled container prior to removal from the mold assembly of the hydraulic blow molding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;liquid&#x201d; is intended to encompass non-gas, flowable mediums. The liquid may therefore have a low viscosity (like water or alcohol), a medium viscosity (like edible oil or soup) or a viscosity (like catsup or yogurt). Also the liquid may be homogeneous or nonhomogeneous and is not intended to be limited to foodstuff. Non-limiting illustrative examples of liquids that may be utilized with the present invention include cleansing products (for body, house or automotive care), medical fluids, industrial fluids, automotive fluids, and agricultural fluids.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Two embodiments incorporating the principles of the present invention are presented herein. These embodiments depend on the manner in which the preform is initially formed and the resultant structure of the preform. The first embodiment is presented in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> and the second embodiment is presented in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At an injection molding station <b>10</b>, thread splits <b>12</b> are engaged between a preform core <b>14</b> and a preform cavity mold <b>16</b> prior to the injection molding of the preform <b>18</b>, which is seen <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and cooperate to define a molding cavity <b>19</b> in the desired shape of the preform <b>18</b>. Molten plastic resin, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is injected into the molding cavity <b>19</b> by an injection device <b>20</b> through a gate <b>21</b> formed in the preform cavity mold <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the thread splits <b>12</b> engage with the preform core <b>14</b> such that a parting line <b>22</b> between the thread splits <b>12</b> and the preform core <b>14</b> is located approximately midway in that portion of the mold cavity <b>19</b> that will form a top sealing surface (TSS) <b>24</b> of the finish <b>26</b> of a resultant container <b>28</b>. The TSS <b>24</b> is the end surface of the preform <b>18</b> and generally extends around the opening or mouth <b>30</b> of the preform <b>18</b>. The existence of the parting line <b>22</b> between the preform core <b>14</b> and the thread splits <b>12</b> results in an artifact, sometimes referred to as flash or also as a parting line (and herein designated as parting line <b>22</b>&#x2032;), being formed on the preform <b>18</b> and the container <b>28</b>. The above features are readily seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. If the parting line <b>22</b>&#x2032; is on the TSS <b>24</b>, it may impact the sealing of the container <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a one-step process, after molding the preform <b>18</b> in the injection molding station <b>10</b>, the preform <b>18</b> is transferred to a container forming station <b>32</b>, which is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A two-step process would similarly transfer the preform <b>18</b> to a container forming station, but would not use the thread splits <b>12</b> to achieve this transfer. The forming and filling steps discussed herein, however, would generally be the same.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the forming station <b>32</b>, mold halves <b>34</b> are closed about the thread splits <b>12</b> and the body <b>36</b> of the preform <b>18</b>. The mold halves include interior surfaces <b>38</b> that cooperate to define a cavity <b>40</b> in the desired shape of the resultant container <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the preform <b>18</b> secured within the thread splits <b>12</b> and the mold halves <b>34</b>, a forming head <b>42</b> is lowered by an actuator <b>43</b> such that a nozzle bell <b>44</b> engages portions of the thread splits <b>12</b> and sealingly engages the preform <b>18</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the nozzle bell <b>44</b> includes a collar <b>46</b> that engages with an inward half of the TSS <b>24</b> and extends into the mouth <b>30</b> of the prefom <b>18</b> and along interior surfaces <b>48</b> of the finish <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The forming head <b>42</b> has a central passageway <b>50</b> defined within a nozzle body <b>52</b> and through which is defined a central axis Z. Coupled to the forming head <b>42</b>, a source <b>54</b> of the liquid blow medium is in communication with the central passageway <b>50</b> and provided thereto at a pressure sufficient to cause the preform <b>18</b> to expand and form the container <b>28</b>, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also located within the central passageway <b>50</b> is a seal pin <b>56</b>. The seal pin <b>56</b> is axially movable, by a corresponding actuator <b>58</b> along a central axis Z through the central passageway <b>50</b>. The seal pin <b>56</b> is movable between an extended position and a retracted position. In the extended position, a sealing surface <b>60</b> formed on a sealing boss <b>62</b> sealingly engages a correspondingly shaped sealing seat <b>64</b> formed on an interior surface of the nozzle bell <b>44</b>. This sealing engagement closes off the exit orifice <b>66</b> and prevents liquid blow medium from being discharged from the forming head <b>42</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the sealing surface <b>60</b> and the sealing seat <b>64</b> or correspondingly shaped as conical, tapered surfaces.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the retracted position of the sealing pin <b>56</b>, the sealing boss <b>62</b> is retracted into the central passageway <b>50</b> and the sealing surface <b>60</b> spaced apart from the sealing seat <b>64</b> of the nozzle bell <b>44</b>. As a result, the exit orifice <b>66</b> is open and the liquid blow medium is injected from the central passageway <b>50</b> into the interior of the preform <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Prior to the injecting of the liquid blow medium into the preform <b>18</b>, a stretch rod <b>68</b> is extended by a corresponding actuator <b>70</b> until the distal end <b>72</b> of the stretch rod <b>68</b> engages a closed-end <b>74</b> of the preform <b>18</b>. Either prior to or simultaneous with the injecting of the liquid blow medium, the stretch rod <b>68</b> is further advanced so as to axially stretch the preform <b>18</b>. During axial stretching, the stretch rod <b>68</b> may impinge the closed-end <b>74</b> of the preform <b>18</b> against surfaces of the mold halves <b>34</b> defined the bottom of the container <b>28</b>. As a result of the injection of the liquid blow medium, the body <b>36</b> of the preform <b>18</b> is also radially expanded until it contacts the interior surfaces <b>38</b> of the mold halves <b>34</b> thereby simultaneously forming and filling the container <b>28</b>, which is shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a seal <b>76</b>, which is preferably an inner liner/seal, is engaged with the finish <b>26</b> to seal the mouth <b>30</b> of the filled container <b>28</b> prior to the removal of the container <b>28</b> from the forming station <b>32</b>. Since the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is provided on the filled container <b>28</b> prior to its removal, no spillage of the liquid product from within the container <b>28</b> will occur.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the first embodiment, and as particularly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> has a radial flange <b>78</b> that defines an outer diameter D<sub>s </sub>of the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> that is less than the outer diameter D<sub>f </sub>of the finish <b>26</b> or TSS <b>24</b> of the container <b>28</b>. More specifically, the diameter D<sub>s </sub>is dimensioned so that the radial flange <b>78</b> terminates adjacent to or before, and does not extend over, the parting line <b>22</b>&#x2032; on the TSS <b>24</b>. The inner liner/seal <b>76</b> can, therefore, also be seen as having a diameter D<sub>s </sub>that is less than the diameter D<sub>p </sub>defined by the parting line <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to radial flange <b>78</b>, the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> includes a central disc <b>80</b>, which is connected to the radial flanged <b>78</b> by an axially extending ring <b>82</b>. The ring <b>82</b> extends axially from the innermost end of the radial flange <b>78</b> so that, when the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is engaged with the container <b>28</b>, the ring <b>82</b> extends along and is in surface-to-surface sealing contact, a press-fit or frictional engagement, with the inner surface <b>48</b> of the finish <b>26</b> defining the mouth <b>30</b> of the container <b>28</b>. The disc <b>80</b> extends across the ring <b>82</b> and closes off the inward region of the inner liner/seal <b>76</b>. The disc <b>80</b> is thus located on the ring <b>82</b> opposite from the radial flange <b>78</b>. The sealing engagement defined by the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is therefore defined by both the engagement of the radial flanged <b>78</b> with a portion of the TTS <b>24</b> and the engagement of the ring <b>82</b> with a portion of the inner surface <b>48</b> of the finish <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to engage the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> with the finish <b>26</b> of the filled and formed container <b>28</b>, the eject rod fixing plate <b>86</b> of the forming station <b>32</b> may be modified to include a sealing mechanism <b>84</b> and carry a plug <b>88</b> whose end is correspondingly stepped or otherwise shaped to receive and hold the inner liner/seal <b>76</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the plug <b>88</b> is fixedly mounted to a hollow shaft <b>90</b> which extends through an opening of the fixing plate <b>86</b>. Between the fixing plate <b>86</b> and the plug <b>88</b>, generally along the exterior of the shaft <b>90</b>, is a compression spring <b>92</b>. The compression spring <b>92</b> biases the plug <b>88</b> in a direction away from the fixing plate <b>86</b>. The placement of the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> on the plug <b>88</b> may be effectuated by a mechanical device or a robot (not shown) and retention in position on the end of the plug <b>88</b> by either an interference fit or by a vacuum <b>94</b> applied to the plug <b>88</b> either through an air channel <b>96</b> in the shaft <b>90</b> or other means.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">After forming and filling of the container <b>28</b>, but before removal from the forming station <b>32</b>, the fixing plate <b>86</b>, with the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> mounted thereon, is moved downwardly to engage the container <b>28</b>. As a result, the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is inserted into the finish <b>26</b>, stopping when the radial flanged <b>78</b> contacts the TSS <b>24</b> and is impinged between the plug <b>88</b> and the TTS <b>24</b>. The spring <b>92</b> located between the plug <b>88</b> and the fixing plate <b>86</b> ensures that the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is not over compressed by the downward movement of the fixing plate <b>86</b> and plug <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> is engaged with the finish <b>26</b>, the vacuum <b>94</b> is released and the greater frictional engagement between ring <b>82</b> of the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> and the inner surfaces <b>48</b> of the finish <b>26</b> disengages the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> from the plug <b>88</b>. Alternatively, application of a slight positive pressure through the air channel <b>96</b> can be provided to ensure that the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> disengages from the plug <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> in place on the finish <b>26</b>, the filled container <b>28</b> can be removed from the forming station <b>32</b> without worry that liquid product in the container will be spilled during the removal step.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">From the forming station the container <b>28</b>, with the inner liner/seal <b>76</b> in place, can be transferred to a capping station where cap (not shown) is attached and engaged with the exterior threads <b>98</b> of the finish <b>26</b>. In this regard, it is noted that the seal <b>76</b> utilized herein is distinguishable from a cap, since the seal <b>76</b>, as that term is used herein, is not in threaded engagement with the finish <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, a second embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is illustrated therein. The second embodiment includes numerous elements that are the same as elements discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Accordingly, like elements are identified with the same reference numerals and discussion of their function and operation is omitted in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>12</b></figref> in the interest of brevity. In that regard, reference should be made to the prior discussion of the same elements in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. The discussion which follows, therefore, focuses on the differences between the second embodiment and the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in one respect, the second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that the thread splits <b>12</b> and the preform core <b>14</b> engage with one another so as to define a parting line <b>122</b> that is not located in the area the preform cavity <b>19</b> that defines the TTS <b>24</b>. Rather, the thread splits <b>12</b> and the preform core <b>14</b> engage one another so that the parting line <b>122</b> is located in an area that defines a radial exterior surface of the preform <b>18</b>. Thus, a portion of the preform core <b>14</b> completely defines the TSS <b>24</b> and the open end of the preform <b>18</b>. The parting line <b>122</b> is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> as being located between the portions defining the top sealing surface <b>24</b> and the uppermost portion of the threads <b>98</b> of the preform <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The container forming station <b>32</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is likewise similar to the container forming station <b>32</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The distinction between the structures of forming station <b>32</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is that the lower end of the nozzle bell <b>44</b> is shaped to mate with the thread splits <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> on the exterior side of the finish <b>26</b>. The lower end of the nozzle bell <b>44</b> thus extends over the TSS <b>24</b> of the preform <b>18</b>. Otherwise, the container forming station <b>32</b> operates and functions in the same fashion as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which is herein referred to.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In accordance with the principles of the second embodiment invention, an inner liner/seal <b>176</b> is also engaged with the finish <b>26</b> to seal the mouth <b>30</b> of the filled container <b>28</b> prior to the removal of the container <b>28</b> from the forming station <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, however, the inner liner/seal <b>176</b> has a radial flange <b>178</b> that defines an outer diameter D<sub>s2 </sub>is of the same or about the same as the outer diameter D<sub>f </sub>of the finish <b>26</b> or TSS <b>24</b> of the container <b>28</b>. More specifically, the diameter D<sub>s2 </sub>is dimensioned so that the radial flange <b>78</b> terminates at or adjacent to the outer circumference or perimeter of the TSS <b>24</b>. In this configuration, the radio flanged <b>178</b> is sealingly engaged across the entire TSS <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The remainder of the inner liner/seal <b>176</b> of the second embodiment is constructed in the same manner as the prior embodiment.
