In addition, with the use of an optical fiber amplifier, high-power multi-wavelength optical signals are coupled into one optical fiber, so that the multi-wavelength optical signals are gathered on a very small interface. In this case, the optical fiber starts to show a nonlinear feature, and becomes a key factor limiting transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a WDM system, due to a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effect, energy transfer may occur between different wavelengths, causing a decrease in an optical power. To avoid this case, a dummy light technology is provided. However, a dummy light technology requires that all wavelengths are enabled at an initial stage. It indicates that a large quantity of optical transponder units (OTU) are configured at the initial stage. Consequently, high costs are caused.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide an apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, to reduce costs of generating a dummy optical signal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. A structure of the apparatus includes a multi-longitudinal mode laser and a comb optical bandpass filter. The multi-longitudinal mode laser is connected to the comb optical bandpass filter. The multi-longitudinal mode laser is configured to: provide a light source signal, and output the light source signal to the comb optical bandpass filter. The comb optical bandpass filter filters the light source signal, and outputs a dummy optical signal. The dummy optical signal is an optical signal that does not include service information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this embodiment, the apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal may also be referred to as a dummy light apparatus. To implement channel equalization, the dummy light apparatus generates a dummy optical signal consistent with a service signal. The multi-longitudinal mode laser may be a Fabry Perot (FP) laser, or may be another laser.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this application, the multi-longitudinal mode laser and the comb optical bandpass filter have relatively low costs, so that costs of generating the dummy optical signal are reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the dummy optical signal includes multi-wavelength signals with preset wavelength spacing. It may be understood that the dummy optical signal may include equally spaced multi-wavelength signals.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the comb optical bandpass filter may be an etalon or a gain flattening filter. The etalon may be selected according to an actual requirement. For example, a 50 GHz/100 GHz spaced etalon is used, or an etalon with 25 GHz spacing or other spacing is used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, to implement flatness of the dummy optical signal, the apparatus further includes a circulator. The multi-longitudinal mode laser, the circulator, and the comb optical bandpass filter are connected in sequence. An optical path in the apparatus is as follows: The light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is input through a first port of the circulator, and then is output to the comb optical bandpass filter through a second port of the circulator. The light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is output to a third port of the circulator through a first output port of the comb optical bandpass filter, and is further output to the comb optical bandpass filter through the second port of the circulator. When the dummy optical signal output by the comb optical bandpass filter meets a first preset condition, the dummy optical signal is output through a second output port of the comb optical bandpass filter. In other words, the light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is input through the first port of the circulator and is output from the second port, returns to the third port of the circulator through the comb optical bandpass filter, and is output from the first port to enter the multi-longitudinal mode laser, to form a resonant cavity. Longitudinal mode positions of the multi-longitudinal mode laser are controlled by using a thermoelectric cooler (TEC), to implement gain equalization between longitudinal modes, thereby effectively improving flatness between longitudinal modes in output.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the apparatus may further include a coupler. A structure is that the multi-longitudinal mode laser, the circulator, the comb optical bandpass filter, and the coupler are connected in sequence. A light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is input through the first port of the circulator, and then is output to the comb optical bandpass filter through the second port of the circulator. The light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is output to the coupler through the comb optical bandpass filter, is output to the third port of the circulator through a first output port of the coupler, is further output to the comb optical bandpass filter through the second port of the circulator, and then is output to the coupler through the comb optical bandpass filter. When a dummy optical signal output by the coupler meets a second preset condition, the dummy optical signal is output through a second output port of the coupler. In other words, the light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser is input through the first port of the circulator and is output from the second port, returns to the third port of the circulator through the comb optical bandpass filter and the coupler, and is output from the first port to enter the multi-longitudinal mode laser, to form a resonant cavity. Longitudinal mode positions of the multi-longitudinal mode laser are controlled by using a TEC, to implement gain equalization between longitudinal modes, thereby effectively improving flatness between longitudinal modes in output. In the foregoing two apparatuses, the first preset condition may be the same as or different from the second preset condition, provided that the dummy optical signal is amplified to meet an output condition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the apparatus may further include a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter is configured to: receive the dummy optical signal, and obtain a dummy optical signal on a specific band from the dummy optical signal. A peak power of the dummy optical signal on the specific band is greater than or equal to a preset threshold. Alternatively, flatness of the dummy optical signal on the specific band is less than or equal to a preset threshold. To implement this function, the bandpass filter may be located behind the comb optical bandpass filter. Alternatively, the bandpass filter may be located behind the coupler.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the apparatus for generating dummy optical signal generates a fixed relative intensity noise (RIN) in an actual application process. To reduce the RIN, a structure of the multi-longitudinal mode laser may be optimized. When other conditions remain unchanged, a reflectivity of an out-light end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser may be improved to effectively reduce the RIN. It may be understood that the out-light end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser is an emergent end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser, and the reflectivity of the out-light end face affects an output feature of the laser.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a cascading system for generating a dummy optical signal. The cascading system includes a plurality of apparatuses for generating dummy optical signals and at least one multiplexing apparatus. The apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a multi-longitudinal mode laser and a comb optical bandpass filter. The multi-longitudinal mode laser is connected to the comb optical bandpass filter. The multi-longitudinal mode laser is configured to provide a light source signal. A light source signal provided by the multi-longitudinal mode laser outputs a dummy optical signal through the comb optical bandpass filter. The dummy optical signal is an optical signal that does not include service information. The at least one multiplexing apparatus multiplexes dummy optical signals generated by the plurality of apparatuses for generating dummy optical signals.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the technical solution provided in this embodiment, the cascading system multiplexes the dummy optical signals generated by the plurality of independent dummy light apparatuses, to form different wavelength ranges. In addition, units in a dummy light structure are independent of each other, to implement relatively high reliability, good scalability, and high integrity. The plurality of dummy light apparatuses with different wavelength spacing are superposed. A quantity of longitudinal modes in each optical signal channel is increased. A channel power remains unchanged. This is equivalent to reduction of power spectrum density. In this way, a RIN in each optical signal channel can be effectively reduced, thereby effectively reducing nonlinear costs of signal transmission on each channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal may further include a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter is configured to: receive the dummy optical signal, and obtain a dummy optical signal on a specific band from the dummy optical signal. A peak power corresponding to the dummy optical signal on the specific band is greater than or equal to a preset threshold. Alternatively, flatness of the dummy optical signal on the specific band is less than or equal to a preset threshold. To implement this function, the bandpass filter may be located behind the comb optical bandpass filter. Alternatively, the bandpass filter may be located behind a coupler.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Based on the foregoing solution, that the cascading system multiplexes the dummy optical signals generated by the plurality of apparatuses for generating dummy optical signals may be as follows:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a possible implementation, the plurality of apparatuses for generating dummy optical signals perform only one level of multiplexing. The cascading system includes a first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal and a second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a first bandpass filter. The second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a second bandpass filter. An that the cascading system multiplexes the dummy optical signals is as follows: The first bandpass filter obtains a first specific dummy optical signal in the first dummy optical signal output by the first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The second bandpass filter obtains a second specific dummy optical signal in the second dummy optical signal output by the second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The multiplexing apparatus multiplexes a first band and a second band by using a wavelength division multiplexing device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another possible implementation, the plurality of apparatuses for generating dummy optical signals perform a plurality of levels of multiplexing. The cascading system includes a first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a third apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a fourth apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a first multiplexing apparatus, a second multiplexing apparatus, and a third multiplexing apparatus. The first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a first bandpass filter. The second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a second bandpass filter. The third apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a third bandpass filter. The fourth apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a fourth bandpass filter. An operation that the cascading system multiplexes the dummy optical signals is as follows: The first bandpass filter obtains a first specific dummy optical signal in a first dummy optical signal output by the first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The second bandpass filter obtains a second specific dummy optical signal in a second dummy optical signal output by the second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The first multiplexing apparatus multiplexes the first specific dummy optical signal and the second specific dummy optical signal to obtain a first multiplexing wave. The third bandpass filter obtains a third specific dummy optical signal in a third dummy optical signal output by the third apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The fourth bandpass filter obtains a fourth specific dummy optical signal in a fourth dummy optical signal output by the fourth apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal. The second multiplexing apparatus multiplexes the third specific dummy optical signal and the fourth specific dummy optical signal to obtain a second multiplexing wave. The third multiplexing apparatus multiplexes the first multiplexing wave and the second multiplexing wave to obtain a third multiplexing wave.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Based on the foregoing solution, the multiplexing apparatus may be a wavelength division multiplexing device. In addition, the multiplexing apparatus includes but is not limited to a coupler or a polarization beam splitter. It may be understood that, when the coupler or the polarization beam splitter performs wavelength division multiplexing, the dummy optical signals on different bands may be multiplexed. If the bandpass filter is disposed before the multiplexing apparatus, the multiplexing apparatus may multiplex dummy optical signals selected by the bandpass filter on various bands. The band range of the dummy optical signals after the multiplexing includes a sum of the bands of the various dummy optical signals before the multiplexing.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Optionally, the comb optical bandpass filter may be an etalon or a gain flattening filter. The etalon may be selected according to an actual requirement.

In an example solution, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a dummy light (DL in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) apparatus (also referred to as an apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal in embodiments of this application) is applied to an optical communications system. The optical communications system includes an optical switch device (a reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this case, the dummy optical signal provided by the dummy light apparatus may be input to the optical switch device, and then the optical switch device multiplexes and outputs the dummy optical signal and another optical signal. However, the dummy light technology requires that all wavelengths are enabled at an initial stage. It indicates that a large quantity of OTUs are configured at the initial stage, thereby causing relatively high costs.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To resolve this problem, an embodiment of this application provides an apparatus <b>200</b> for generating a dummy optical signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>200</b> for generating a dummy optical signal includes a multi-longitudinal mode laser <b>201</b> and a comb optical bandpass filter <b>202</b>.

The dummy optical signal is an optical signal that does not include service information.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a wavelength division multiplexing scenario, the dummy optical signal may be an equally spaced multi-wavelength dummy optical signal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the comb optical bandpass filter may be an etalon or a gain flattening filter. The etalon may be selected according to an actual requirement. For example, an etalon with 50 GHz/100 GHz frequency spacing is used, or an etalon with 25 GHz spacing or other spacing is used. The multi-longitudinal mode laser may be an FP laser or another laser, provided that the multi-longitudinal mode laser can output a multi-longitudinal mode light source signal.

The cascading system includes a first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a third apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a fourth apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal, a first multiplexing apparatus, a second multiplexing apparatus, and a third multiplexing apparatus. The first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a first bandpass filter. The second apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a second bandpass filter. The third apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a third bandpass filter. The fourth apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal includes a fourth bandpass filter. An operation that the cascading system multiplexes the dummy optical signals is as follows: The first bandpass filter obtains a first specific dummy optical signal in a first dummy optical signal output by the first apparatus for generating a dummy optical signal.

Finally, the wavelength division multiplexing device <b>3</b> further multiplexes the two multiplexing waves.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Based on the foregoing solution, the wavelength division multiplexing device includes but is not limited to a coupler or a polarization beam splitter. It may be understood that the coupler or the polarization beam splitter may perform wavelength division multiplexing on dummy optical signals on various bands selected by the plurality of bandpass filters. In an example, the bandpass filter may select a band based on the peak power corresponding to the dummy optical signal, and may select a band whose peak power is greater than or equal to a preset threshold. For example, the band whose peak power is greater than or equal to 50 dB is selected. Under this standard, the band <b>1</b> is selected for the dummy optical signal output by the first dummy light apparatus, the band <b>2</b> is selected for the dummy optical signal output by the second dummy light apparatus, and the wavelength division multiplexing device multiplexes the dummy optical signals on the band <b>1</b> and the band <b>2</b>. In another example, the bandpass filter may select a band for the dummy optical signal based on a preset band. For example, a band A is selected for the dummy optical signal output by the first dummy light apparatus, a band B is selected for the dummy optical signal output by the second dummy light apparatus, and the wavelength division multiplexing device performs wavelength division multiplexing on the dummy optical signals on the band A and the band B. In an example solution, a power spectrum of the dummy optical signal generated by the wavelength division multiplexing device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The band A and the band B are selected for the two dummy optical signals. Then, the dummy optical signals on the band A and the band B are multiplexed. In this case, the dummy optical signal output as a whole has better flatness than the dummy optical signal for which the band is not selected. The band range of the dummy optical signals after the multiplexing includes a sum of bands of the various dummy optical signals before the multiplexing, for example, the band A and the band B. The band range of the dummy optical signals after the multiplexing can meet a band requirement of a WDM system for the dummy optical signals.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Nonlinear costs of the WDM system are caused by a cross phase modulation (XPM) effect introduced due to intensity fluctuation of a compensation wave. This effect is directly related to a RIN indicator of the dummy light apparatus. A smaller RIN indicates lower nonlinear costs. The relative intensity noise (RIN) is a ratio between an average output power of the laser and a noise at a specific frequency.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, there are two manners for optimizing the RIN:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a possible implementation, the plurality of dummy light apparatuses may be cascaded to form a cascading system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another possible implementation, the laser may be optimized. In other words, reflectivity of an out-light end face of the laser may be designed based on a threshold of the RIN. When other conditions remain unchanged, the reflectivity of the out-light end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser may be improved to effectively reduce the RIN. It may be understood that the out-light end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser is an emergent end face of the multi-longitudinal mode laser, and the reflectivity of the out-light end face affects an output feature of the laser. A relationship between the reflectivity of the out-light end face and the RIN may be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. A horizontal coordinate is used to indicate one end face of the laser. Herein, R is used to indicate the other end face of the laser. A vertical coordinate is used to indicate a RIN value. It may be learned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> that, when other conditions remain unchanged, higher reflectivity of the out-light end face indicates a smaller RIN value.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It may be clearly understood by a person skilled in the art that, for the purpose of convenient and brief description, for a detailed working process of the foregoing system, apparatus, and unit, refer to a corresponding process in the foregoing method embodiments.
