These player applications may include pre-installed applications and/or third-party applications installed on a streaming device (such as the digital media player or the smart television). Each of the player applications may control streaming and playback of the content (such as a television show, a movie, or audio content) in high-definition quality from a respective streaming media service (such as Google Play&#xae;, Netflix&#xae;, Amazon Prime Video&#xae;, or HBO Max&#xae;, Sony&#xae;, Disney+&#xae;, etc.). In some scenarios, the streaming device may allow third-party applications (such as a player application) to be downloaded from unknown sources to provide flexibility to a device user. In other instances, the third-party applications may sideloaded or downloaded indirectly, although such applications may be banned from legitimate sources (such as Google Play&#xae; Store). However, some of these third-party applications may include pirate applications that may acquire content from rogue websites to stream pirated content onto the streaming device. In such scenarios, the pirate applications may provide premium content to the streaming device without authorization, and may subvert the services of legitimate content providers (such as Google Play&#xae;, Netflix&#xae;, Amazon Prime Video&#xae;, or HBO Max&#xae;, Sony&#xae;, Disney+&#xae;, etc.). The unauthorized access to premium content may violate the rights of copyright holders and content creators who rely on legitimate subscription-based access to their content for revenue.</p><p

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The following described implementations may be found in the disclosed electronic device (such as a smart television or a digital media player) and method for anti-piracy control of a third-party application based on a blacklisting function that is part of an operating system of the electronic device. The third-party application may be a player application configured to stream content (such as video content or audio content). Exemplary aspects of the disclosure provide the electronic device that may execute a monitor application. The monitor application may be a part of the operating system (OS) of the electronic device. The electronic device may identify, by the monitor application, one or more requests to access a network resource (such as a media server or a network location) from the third-party application installed on the electronic device. The monitor application may have privileged access permission to read a runtime code and/or decrypted executable memory space of the third-party application. The monitor application may identify the one or more requests from the runtime code of the third-party application. In another embodiment, the monitor application may intercept the one or more requests at a network interface of the electronic device. The electronic device may extract, by the monitor application, one or more first network resource identifiers (such as uniform resource locators (URLs)) associated with the network resource from the one or more requests. The electronic device may compare, by the monitor application, the one or more first network resource identifiers with a blacklist associated with the monitor application. The blacklist may comprise at least one of a list of malicious internet protocol (IP) addresses or a list of malicious domain names. The electronic device may further control, by the monitor application, an execution of the third-party application based on the comparison of the one or more first network resource identifiers with the blacklist.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the electronic device may determine that the network resource, accessed by the third-party application, is a malicious resource based on the comparison between the one or more first network resource identifiers and the blacklist. The electronic device may determine that the content associated with the network resource is pirated content based on the comparison. The electronic device may further terminate or suspend the execution of the third-party application (such as a pirate application) based on the determination that the network resource is the malicious resource. The electronic device may thereby prevent the third-party application (such as a pirate application) from streaming premium content to the electronic device without authorization or legitimate subscription, and may protect the rights of copyright holders and content creators who rely on legitimate subscription-based access to their content for revenue.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, the electronic device may control a bandwidth available to the third-party application to stream content from the network resource based on the comparison of the one or more first network resource identifiers with the blacklist. For example, the electronic device may control the bandwidth available to the third-party application in case the one or more first network resource identifiers are present in the blacklist. The electronic device may control the bandwidth available to the third-party application to reduce a quality of the content streamed by the third-party application or to increase a buffering time of the content. The electronic device may further control a performance (such as irregular pausing of playback of the content by the third-party application) of the third-party application or interrupt playback of the content based on the comparison. The electronic device may thereby degrade the usability of the third-party application in case the third-party application streams pirated content from the malicious network resource, and may thereby discourage users from using the third-party application. The electronic device may degrade the usability of the third-party application in such a way that the users may be led to believe that the third-party application and its service are inferior, and may not realize that the monitor application has caused the degradation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the electronic device may analyze a specific program code (such as a source code) of the third-party application and may determine a type of the third-party application based on the analysis of the specific program code of the third-party application. The electronic device may determine that the type of the third-party application is a player application that streams the content from the network resource to the electronic device. The electronic device may compare the one or more first network resource identifiers with the blacklist based on the determination that the type of the third-party application is the player application. The electronic device may control the execution of the third-party application based on the comparison of the one or more first network resource identifiers with the blacklist. The electronic device may thereby effectively monitor the third-party application for malicious behavior based on the type of the third-party application.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment, the electronic device may extract one or more second network resource identifiers (such as URLs) from the one or more requests during the stream of the content. The electronic device may extract the one or more second network resource identifiers after a specific period of time from the extraction of the one or more first network resource identifiers. The electronic device may compare the one or more second network resource identifiers with the blacklist. The electronic device may control (terminate or suspend or degrade) the execution of the third-party application based on the comparison of the one or more second network resource identifiers with the blacklist. The electronic device may thereby periodically and effectively monitor the third-party application for malicious behavior after every specific period of time during the execution of the third-party application.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary network environment for control of execution of a third-party application for anti-piracy control based on a blacklisting function, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
