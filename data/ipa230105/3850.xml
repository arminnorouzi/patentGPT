Then, a bias voltage of the light receiving element is varied, while a signal output from the light receiving element having received the reference light is being monitored. Thus, the bias voltage is searched for that corresponds to a multiplication factor of a target value.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">[PTL 1] JP-54468 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0012">However, as a result of detailed studies, the inventors have found a problem with the technique disclosed in PTL 1 in that the technique may require a complicated configuration for adjustment of the multiplication factor. Specifically, as the reference light used to adjust the multiplication factor, pulsed light is assumed to be used as is the case with measurement of the distance to an object. In such a case, a signal from the light receiving element needs to be monitored during an ON period of the pulsed light. However, the ON period of the pulsed light, which is short, may complicate a configuration required to synchronize a monitoring timing for the signal from the light receiving element with the ON period of the pulsed light.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">An aspect of the present disclosure provides a measurement apparatus that can more simply adjust the light receiving element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">A measurement apparatus of a mode of the present disclosure is mounted to a vehicle and includes a light emitting unit, at least one light receiving element, a measurement unit, a monitor circuit, and an adjustment unit. The light emitting unit radiates pulsed light. The at least one light receiving element is an element that outputs a light reception signal corresponding to an amount of light received at a preset sensitivity, and is configured to receive reflected light of the pulsed light radiated by the light emitting unit. The measurement unit is configured to measure an object based on the light reception signal output from the at least one light receiving element having received the reflected light. The monitor circuit is configured to generate a monitor signal indicating the amount of light received by the at least one light receiving element based on the light reception signal output from the at least one light receiving element.

Thus, a timing when the light receiving element is irradiated with the reference light can be easily synchronized with a timing when the monitor signal is monitored. Consequently, the light receiving element can be more simply adjusted.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">1.

Then, the control unit <b>10</b> determines any of the light receiving elements to have a large amount of DC light received, and discards the measurement result for the reflection point obtained from the determined light receiving element. Thus, the distance to the object is measured without using any light reception signal containing a large number of noise components.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">5. Adjustment of Light Receiving Elements</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0040">A manufacturing process for the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> includes an adjustment process for setting the multiplication factor of each of the light receiving elements D<b>0</b> to D<b>10</b> to a target value (hereinafter denoted as T).

The reference light <b>150</b> is light with an intensity fixed to a preset level. The reference light <b>150</b> corresponds to the above-described DC light and has an intensity maintained at the same level at least while the multiplication factor is set.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">In the present embodiment, by way of example, the adjustment process is executed in a stage prior to assembly of the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> is complete.

The adjustment apparatus <b>200</b> includes a reference light source <b>210</b> and a driving circuit <b>220</b> that drives the reference light source <b>210</b>. The control unit <b>10</b> causes the reference light source <b>210</b> via the driving circuit <b>220</b> to start radiating the reference light <b>150</b> (S<b>300</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">Subsequently, an inspection board <b>250</b> is connected to a control board in the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> equipped with the control unit <b>10</b> and the like (S<b>305</b>). Additionally, the components included in the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> being assembled are arranged such that the reference light <b>150</b> can reach each of the light receiving elements D<b>0</b> to D<b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">Note that the inspection board <b>250</b> is used in voltage search processing described below. That is, in the present embodiment, the range of the value of the bias voltage that can be set via the bias control circuit <b>45</b> is limited. In other words, a part of the range (hereinafter referred to as the limited range) of the bias voltage that can be set for each of the light receiving elements D<b>0</b> to D<b>10</b> fails to be set via the bias control circuit <b>45</b>. Specifically, in the present embodiment, the range including the value of the bias voltage corresponding to a multiplication factor of 1 is the limited range. However, in the voltage search processing described below, the bias voltage needs to be set to a value within the limited range. In such a case, the bias voltage is set via the inspection board <b>250</b>. In other words, in a case where the bias voltage is set to a value within the limited range, the inspection board <b>250</b> directly inputs the bias voltage to each of the light receiving elements D<b>0</b> to D<b>10</b>, according to instructions from the control unit <b>10</b>.

Alternatively, the control unit <b>10</b> may use, for example, the average of the target voltage values of the light receiving elements D<b>0</b> to D<b>10</b> as a setting value for the bias voltage. Subsequently, the irradiation with the reference light <b>150</b> is stopped (S<b>320</b>), and the control board in the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> and the inspection board <b>250</b> are disconnected from each other (S<b>325</b>), ending the adjustment process.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0047">Subsequently, when the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> starts measurement, the control unit <b>10</b> of the measurement apparatus <b>1</b> reads the setting value of the bias voltage from the memory <b>12</b>.

Note that a is a coefficient set depending on T. While monitoring the voltage value of the monitor signal (hereinafter denoted as V), the control unit <b>10</b> searches for the value of the bias voltage corresponding to V=Vt by gradually increasing the value of the bias voltage from the reference value via the bias control circuit <b>45</b> or the inspection board <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0054">In other words, in S<b>430</b>, the control unit <b>10</b> increases the bias voltage by a predetermined value, and then measures the V (S<b>435</b>).
