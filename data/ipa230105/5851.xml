However, semiconductor devices based on alternative materials are receiving increasing attention for advantages over silicon-based semiconductor devices. For example, semiconductor devices based on group III-V semiconductor materials have been receiving increased attention due to high electron mobility and wide band gaps compared to silicon-based semiconductor devices. Such high electron mobility and wide band gaps allow improved performance and high temperature applications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some situations, an integrated circuit (IC) comprises a bulk silicon substrate and a gallium nitride (GaN) layer covering the bulk silicon substrate. A plurality of GaN semiconductor devices are in a top of the GaN layer, and an interconnect structure covers the GaN semiconductor devices and the GaN layer. The interconnect structure comprises an interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer and a passivation layer covering the ILD layer. Further, the interconnect structure comprises a plurality of conductive features. The conductive features comprise a plurality of wires, a plurality of vias, and a plurality of pads. The pads are on the ILD layer, between the ILD layer and the passivation layer. The wires and the vias are alternatingly stacked in the ILD layer and define conductive paths electrically coupling the pads to the GaN semiconductor devices. Pad openings are defined by the passivation layer, and respectively overlie and expose the pads. A through GaN trench is defined by the passivation layer, the ILD layer, and the GaN layer. The through GaN trench extends vertically through the passivation layer, the ILD layer, and the GaN layer to the bulk silicon substrate, and further extends laterally in a closed path to completely enclose the GaN semiconductor devices and the pads. The through GaN trench serves as a seal ring to prevent moisture and/or vapor from entering the IC from an ambient environment of the IC. Moisture and/or vapor that enter the IC can cause corrosion to the conductive features and/or to the GaN semiconductor devices. Further, the seal ring prevents cracks caused by a die saw from propagating though the IC during singulation of a wafer upon which the IC is manufactured in bulk.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A challenge with the IC is that the IC fails temperature, humidity, bias (THB) coupon testing. THB coupon testing is a process in which a bare IC die is mounted to a bare printed circuit board (PCB) and undergoes THB testing. The bare IC die and the bare PCB define a coupon (e.g., a simplified/open package devoid of molding compound). Because the IC die is &#x201c;bare&#x201d;, the THB testing is performed under some of the worst conditions possible. During the THB coupon testing, moisture or vapor (e.g., water vapor) enters the IC through weak points along sidewalls of the through GaN trench and sidewalls of the pad openings. For example, the ILD layer and the first passivation layer may be or comprise silicon dioxide, which has a high permeability for moisture and/or vapor and is hence a weak point in the sidewalls of the through GaN trench and the sidewalls of the pad openings. Moisture or vapor that enters the IC through the weak points may cause the THB coupon testing to fail by, for example, damaging the GaN semiconductor devices or the conductive features, and/or by, for example, causing delamination of the passivation layer. As to the latter, the moisture or vapor may lead to cracks at oxide interfaces along the sidewalls of the through GaN trench and the sidewalls of the pad openings. For example, a crack may form on a sidewall of the through GaN trench at an oxide-to-oxide interface between the ILD layer and the passivation layer. As another example, a crack may form on a sidewall of a pad opening at an oxide-to-metal interface between the passivation layer and a pad corresponding to the pad opening. The cracks, in turn, may allow more moisture and/or vapor to enter the IC, and may further cause delamination of the passivation layer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In view of the foregoing, various embodiments of the present application are directed towards an IC comprising an enhanced passivation scheme for pad openings and trenches. In some embodiments, the IC comprises a substrate, an ILD layer, a conductive pad, a first passivation layer, and a second passivation layer. The ILD layer covers the substrate and at least partially defines a trench. The trench extends through the ILD layer from a top of the ILD layer to the substrate. The conductive pad overlies the ILD layer. The first passivation layer overlies the ILD layer and the conductive pad, and defines a pad opening overlying the conductive pad. The second passivation layer overlies the ILD layer, the conductive pad, and the first passivation layer, and further lines first sidewalls of the first passivation layer in the pad opening and second sidewalls of the first passivation layer in the trench. Further, the second passivation layer lines sidewalls of the ILD layer in the trench. In some embodiments, the second passivation layer directly lines the sidewalls of the ILD layer in the trench. In other embodiments, the first passivation layer directly lines the sidewalls of the ILD layer and the second passivation layer lines the sidewalls of the ILD layer over the first passivation layer. The second passivation layer has a low permeability for moisture and/or vapor relative to the ILD layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By lining the sidewalls of the first passivation layer and the ILD layer in the trench, the second passivation layer may cover weak points in the trench and the pad opening through which moisture and other gases may enter the IC. For example, the ILD layer and the first passivation layer may be or comprise silicon dioxide, which has a high permeability for moisture and/or vapor and is hence a weak point in the trench and the pad opening. Further, because the second passivation layer has a low permeability for moisture and/or vapor, the second passivation layer may prevent moisture and/or vapor from entering the IC through the weak points. Therefore, the second passivation layer may allow the IC to pass THB coupon testing. Further, the second passivation layer may prevent delamination of the first passivation layer, damage to semiconductor devices in the substrate, damage to conductive features (e.g., wires, vias, etc.) in the ILD layer and the first passivation layer, or any combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cross-sectional view <b>100</b> of some embodiments of an IC comprising an enhanced passivation scheme for pad openings and trenches is provided.
