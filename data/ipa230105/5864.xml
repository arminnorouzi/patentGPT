Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures, or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductors and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or vertical interconnect access (via) contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With the development of 3D memory devices, such as 3D NAND Flash memory devices, the more stacked layers (e.g., more word lines and the resulting more memory cells) require more peripheral circuits (and the components, e.g., transistors, forming the peripheral circuits) for operating the 3D memory devices. For example, the number and/or size of page buffers needs to increase to match the increased number of memory cells. In another example, the number of string drivers in the word line driver is proportional to the number of word lines in the 3D NAND Flash memory. Thus, the continuous increase of the word lines also increases the area occupied by the word line driver, as well as the complexity of metal routings, sometimes even the number of metal layers. Moreover, in some 3D memory devices in which the memory cell array and peripheral circuits are fabricated on different substrates and bonded together, the continuous increase of peripheral circuits' areas makes it the bottleneck for reducing the total chip size since the memory cell array can be scaled up vertically by increasing the number of levels instead of increasing the planar size.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, it is desirable to reduce the planar areas occupied by the peripheral circuits of the 3D memory devices with the increased numbers of peripheral circuits and the transistors thereof. However, scaling down the transistor size of the peripheral circuits following the advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology node trend used for the logic devices would cause a significant cost increase and higher leakage current, which are undesirable for memory devices. Moreover, because the 3D NAND Flash memory devices require a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V) in certain memory operations, such as program and erase, unlike logic devices, which can reduce its working voltage as the CMOS technology node advances, the voltage provided to the memory peripheral circuits cannot be reduced. As a result, scaling down the memory peripheral circuit sizes by following the trend for advancing the CMOS technology nodes, like the normal logic devices, becomes infeasible.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces various solutions in which the peripheral circuits of a memory device are disposed in different planes (levels, tiers) in the vertical direction, i.e., formed over one another, to reduce the planar chip size of the peripheral circuits, as well as the total chip size of the memory device. In some implementations, the memory cell array (e.g., NAND memory strings), the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V), and the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 1.3 V) are disposed in different planes in the vertical direction, i.e., formed over one another, to further reduce the chip size. In addition, in some implementations, the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V), and the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 1.3 V) are disposed on opposite sides of the same substrate to further reduce the chip size. The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure can be easily scaled up vertically to stack more peripheral circuits in different planes to further reduce the chip size.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The peripheral circuits can be separated into different planes in the vertical direction based on different performance requirements, for example, the voltages applied to the transistors thereof, which affect the dimensions of the transistors (e.g., gate dielectric thickness), dimensions of the substrates in which the transistors are formed (e.g., substrate thickness), and thermal budgets (e.g., the interconnect material). Thus, peripheral circuits with different dimension requirements (e.g., gate dielectric thickness and substrate thickness) and thermal budgets can be fabricated in different processes to reduce the design and process constraints from each other, thereby improving the device performance and fabrication complexity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to some aspects of the present disclosure, a first layer of memory peripheral circuits may be formed on a first side of a substrate, and the memory cell array may be formed on the memory peripheral circuits on the same side of the substrate. Then the substrate may be flipped over and thinned, and a second layer of memory peripheral circuits may be formed on a second side of the substrate opposite to the first side. As a result, the fabrication size of the memory peripheral circuits may be doubled on one substrate to reduce the chip size and the manufacturing cost. Further, the second layer of memory peripheral circuits may be the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 1.3 V), and may be formed after the fabrication of the memory cell array. Hence, the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits will not be affected by the high temperature during the manufacturing of the memory cell array. In addition, the channel length of the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits can be reduced, and the input/output (I/O) speed of the memory devices can be improved as well. In some implementations, the minimality of the channel length of the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits can be further achieved.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure also have the flexibility to allow various device pad-out schemes to meet different needs and different designs of the memory cell array. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed from the side of the semiconductor structure that has the peripheral circuits to shorten the interconnect distance between the pad-out interconnect layer and the transistors of the peripheral circuits to reduce the parasitic capacitance from the interconnects and improve the electric performance. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed on the side of the semiconductor structure that has the memory cell array to enable interlayer vias (LLVs, e.g., submicron-level) for pad-out interconnects with high I/O throughput and low fabrication complicity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of a 3D memory device <b>100</b>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> represents an example of a periphery under cell (PUC) structure.

Substrate <b>102</b> of 3D memory device <b>100</b> includes two lateral surfaces (e.g., a top surface and a bottom surface) extending laterally in the x-direction (the lateral direction or width direction). As used herein, whether one component (e.g., a layer or a device) is &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; or &#x201c;below&#x201d; another component (e.g., a layer or a device) of a semiconductor device is determined relative to substrate <b>102</b> of 3D memory device <b>100</b> in the y-direction (the vertical direction or thickness direction). The same notion for describing the spatial relationships is applied throughout the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations, memory cell array <b>106</b> includes an array of NAND Flash memory cells. For ease of description, a NAND Flash memory cell array may be used as an example for describing memory cell array <b>106</b> in the present disclosure.

NAND memory cells can be organized into pages or fingers, which are then organized into blocks in which each NAND memory cell is coupled to a separate line called a bit line (BL). All cells with the same vertical position in the NAND memory cell can be coupled through the control gates by a word line (WL). In some implementations, a memory plane contains a certain number of blocks that are coupled through the same bit line. Memory cell array <b>106</b> may include one or more memory planes, and the peripheral circuits that are needed to perform all the read/program (write)/erase operations can be included in peripheral circuit <b>104</b> and peripheral circuit <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 2D NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor. The array of 2D NAND memory cells includes a plurality of 2D NAND memory strings, each of which includes a plurality of memory cells connected in series (resembling a NAND gate) and two select transistors, according to some implementations. Each 2D NAND memory string is arranged in the same plane (i.e., referring to herein a flat, two-dimensional (2D) surface, different from the term &#x201c;memory plane&#x201d; in the present discourse) on the substrate, according to some implementations. In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 3D NAND memory strings, each of which extends vertically above the substrate (in 3D) through a stack structure, e.g., a memory stack. Depending on the 3D NAND technology (e.g., the number of layers/tiers in the memory stack), a 3D NAND memory string typically includes a certain number of NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor or a charge-trap transistor.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> may also include peripheral circuit <b>104</b> and peripheral circuit <b>108</b>, each including some of the peripheral circuits of memory cell array <b>106</b>. That is, the peripheral circuits of memory cell array <b>106</b> may be separated into at least two other semiconductor structures (e.g., peripheral circuit <b>104</b> and peripheral circuit <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The peripheral circuits (a.k.a. control and sensing circuits) can include any suitable digital, analog, and/or mixed-signal circuits used for facilitating the operations of memory cell array <b>106</b>.

Each memory cell <b>206</b> can be either a floating gate type of memory cell including a floating-gate transistor or a charge trap type of memory cell including a charge-trap transistor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, each memory cell <b>206</b> is a single-level cell (SLC) that has two possible memory states and thus, can store one bit of data. For example, the first memory state &#x201c;0&#x201d; can correspond to a first range of voltages, and the second memory state &#x201c;1&#x201d; can correspond to a second range of voltages. In some implementations, each memory cell <b>206</b> is a multi-level cell (MLC) that is capable of storing more than a single bit of data in more than four memory states. For example, the MLC can store two bits per cell, three bits per cell (also known as triple-level cell (TLC)), or four bits per cell (also known as a quad-level cell (QLC)). Each MLC can be programmed to assume a range of possible nominal storage values. In one example, if each MLC stores two bits of data, then the MLC can be programmed to assume one of three possible programming levels from an erased state by writing one of three possible nominal storage values to the cell. A fourth nominal storage value can be used for the erased state.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each NAND memory string <b>208</b> can include a source select gate (SSG) transistor <b>210</b> at its source end and a drain select gate (DSG) transistor <b>212</b> at its drain end.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, one or more contacts <b>1016</b> each extending vertically through substrate <b>102</b> are formed. Contacts <b>1016</b> may couple the interconnects in interconnect layer <b>1012</b> and the interconnects in interconnect layer <b>1014</b>. Contact <b>1016</b> may be formed by first patterning contact holes through substrate <b>102</b> using patterning process (e.g., photolithography and dry/wet etch of dielectric materials in the dielectric layer). The contact holes can be filled with a conductor (e.g., W or Cu). In some implementations, filling the contact holes includes depositing a spacer (e.g., a silicon oxide layer) before depositing the conductor.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, 3D memory device <b>1001</b> is flipped over, and carrier substrate <b>1002</b> is removed. Pad-out interconnect layer <b>904</b> is then exposed for external connection.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">By forming 3D memory device <b>1001</b> with the above operations, a first layer of memory peripheral circuits may be formed on the first side of the substrate, and the memory cell array may be formed on the memory peripheral circuits on the same side of the substrate. Then the substrate may be flipped over and thinned, and a second layer of memory peripheral circuits may be formed on the second side of the substrate opposite to the first side. As a result, the fabrication size of the memory peripheral circuits may be doubled on one substrate to reduce the chip size and the manufacturing cost. Further, the second layer of memory peripheral circuits may be the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 1.3 V), and may be formed after the fabrication of the memory cell array. Hence, the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits will not be affected by the high temperature during the manufacturing of the memory cell array. In addition, the channel length of the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits can be reduced, and the input/output (I/O) speed of the memory devices can be improved as well. In some implementations, the minimality of the channel length of the low-voltage memory peripheral circuits can be further achieved.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a system <b>1800</b> having a memory device, according to some aspects of the present disclosure.
