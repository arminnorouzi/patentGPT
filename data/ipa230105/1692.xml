The threshold value in this case is appropriately set in accordance with the precision of the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b>, the operating environment of the printing apparatus <b>1</b>A, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">If the barometric pressure value P is not in the range of the reference barometric pressure value P<b>0</b>&#xb1;the threshold value (Step S<b>33</b>; NO), it means that the body <b>100</b>A is far (separate) from the stand <b>20</b>, and the controller <b>71</b> determines that the user is holding the body <b>100</b>A in his/her hand and the body <b>100</b>A is performing the imaging operation or the like, and returns to Step S<b>26</b> to repeat Step S<b>26</b> and the following steps.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">If the barometric pressure value P sensed by the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> is in the range of the reference barometric pressure value P<b>0</b>&#xb1;the threshold value (Step S<b>33</b>; YES), the controller <b>71</b> causes the X-direction movement motor <b>46</b> of the head movement mechanism <b>45</b> to operate to move the print head <b>41</b> from the second position to the first position (Step S<b>34</b>). Then, the printing apparatus <b>1</b> is powered down (Power Source OFF) (Step S<b>35</b>), which ends the process.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Like this embodiment, in the case where the proximity/remoteness state of the body <b>100</b>A and the stand <b>200</b> is sensed on the basis of the barometric pressure value P sensed by the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b>, when the user once starts to place the body <b>100</b>A on the stand <b>200</b>, but changes his/her mind and lifts it up again, wanting to continue imaging or printing, this user's motion (movement of the body <b>100</b>A) is reflected in the barometric pressure value P, which the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> senses. This enables processing fit for the user's intention.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">That is, for example, when the user wants to finish printing and places the body <b>100</b>A on the stand <b>200</b>, the protector <b>201</b> of the stand <b>200</b> covers the discharger <b>411</b> of the print head <b>41</b>, thereby performing capping. As another example, when the user once starts to place the body <b>100</b>A on the stand <b>200</b>, but lifts it up again, the print head <b>41</b> is moved back to the second position to maintain the imaging performable state or the like.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">As in the first embodiment, the body <b>100</b>A of this embodiment includes the attitude sensor <b>13</b>. Referring to the sensing result by the attitude sensor <b>13</b> together with change in the barometric pressure value P, which the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> senses, enables processing that closely matches the actual user's motion.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">As mentioned above, the sensing result by the attitude sensor <b>13</b> may be referred to together with the sensing result by the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">If movement of the body <b>100</b>A has little change in altitude, and accordingly the change is not reflected in the barometric pressure value P, namely, for example, if the user horizontally moves the body <b>100</b>A from the position of the stand <b>200</b>, it is difficult, with the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b>, to determine the proximity/remoteness state of the body <b>100</b>A and the stand <b>200</b>. Even in such a case, by referring to the sensing result by the attitude sensor <b>13</b>, the printing apparatus <b>1</b> can grasp the proximity/remoteness state of the body <b>100</b>A and the stand <b>200</b> precisely, and perform more proper capping control.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">More specifically, for example, a configuration may be employed to determine the attitude of the body <b>100</b>A with the attitude sensor <b>13</b>, and when the body <b>100</b>A is horizontal or almost horizontal and the barometric pressure value P is in the range of P<b>0</b>&#xb1;the threshold value, move the print head from the second position to the first position, for example. Thus, the attitude sensor <b>13</b> makes it possible to grasp the proximity of the body <b>100</b>A to the stand <b>200</b> more precisely, and also makes it possible to grasp the remoteness of the body <b>100</b>A from the stand <b>200</b> more precisely.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The other points of the second embodiment are the same as those of the first embodiment, and hence their descriptions will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">As described above, this embodiment has the same effects as the first embodiment and also has the following effects.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The sensor of this embodiment is the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> included in the body <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> included in the body <b>100</b>A makes it easy to sense the proximity/remoteness state of the body <b>100</b>A and the stand <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Even if the user attempts to place the body <b>100</b>A on the stand <b>200</b> with the print head <b>41</b> at the second position not corresponding to the opening <b>21</b>, the print head <b>41</b> is automatically moved to the capping position (i.e., first position) corresponding to the protector <b>201</b> by just sensing the proximity of the body <b>100</b>A to the stand <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Thus, although the printing apparatus <b>1</b>A is configured such that the print head <b>41</b> moves in the body <b>100</b>A, the printing apparatus <b>1</b>A can avoid poor capping without the user being aware where the print head <b>41</b> is positioned.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">In the above, some embodiments of the present disclosure have been described. It goes without saying, however, that the present disclosure is not limited to these embodiments, but can be modified in various respects in a range of not departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">For example, in the above embodiments, the sensor that senses the proximity/remoteness state of the body and the stand <b>200</b> having the protector is the light receiver <b>12</b> (first embodiment) or the barometric pressure sensor <b>14</b> (second embodiment), but not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">For example, the imaging device <b>51</b> of the imager <b>5</b>, which is provided for imaging the skin surface S, may be configured to also function as the sensor that senses the proximity/remoteness state of the body and the protector.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">More specifically, to the stand <b>200</b>, an identification mark, such as a bar code or a QR Code&#xae;, is attached and set in such a way as to be brought into focus when the imaging device <b>51</b> gets to a predetermined distance with respect to the identification mark and images it. The imaging device <b>51</b> images the identification mark attached to the stand <b>200</b>, thereby sensing whether the body and the stand are close to one another. As another example, the stand <b>200</b> itself or part thereof is shaped to be easily identified, and the controller <b>71</b> determines that the body and the stand are close to one another when the imaging device <b>51</b> recognizes the shape.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In these cases, the proximity/remoteness state of the body and the stand can be sensed by a simpler configuration, without providing the printing apparatus with a sensor therefor. That is, the imaging device <b>51</b> functions as the sensor too. Thus, the printing apparatus can automatically position the print head <b>41</b> at the position suitable for capping, no matter where the print head <b>41</b> stops moving.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Further, in the first embodiment, one of the body <b>100</b> and the stand <b>200</b> includes the irradiator, and the other one includes the light receiver (to be specific, in the first embodiment, the stand <b>200</b> includes the irradiator, and the body <b>100</b> includes the light receiver as the sensor), but either the body <b>100</b> or the stand <b>200</b> may include both the irradiator and the light receiver as the sensor.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">In this case, for example, the light (electromagnetic waves) emitted from the irradiator included in one of the body <b>100</b> and the stand <b>200</b> is reflected on the other one of these, and the reflected light (electromagnetic waves) is sensed by the light receiver as the sensor included in the one of these. When the intensity of the sensed light (electromagnetic waves) is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value, the controller <b>71</b> determines that the body <b>100</b> and the stand <b>200</b> are close to one another, and causes the print head <b>41</b> to move to the first position, for example.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In order to maintain the intensity of the reflected light, the part where the light (electromagnetic waves) emitted from the irradiator is reflected may be configured to be a mirror plane, or may be provided with a reflective plate or the like to ensure the reflection of the light (electromagnetic waves).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Further, in the first embodiment, in the state in which the print head <b>41</b> is positioned at the first position, the opening <b>21</b> is closed by the print head <b>41</b> almost entirely. However, the size, arrangement or the like of the print head <b>41</b> is not limited to the above.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the width of a print head <b>41</b>B in the X direction, the print head <b>41</b>B being arranged in a body <b>100</b>B of a printing apparatus <b>100</b>B is narrowed from that of the print head <b>41</b>. Hence, even in the state in which the print head <b>41</b>B is positioned at the first position, an opening <b>21</b>B is not closed by the print head <b>41</b>B entirely, and accordingly the light (electromagnetic waves) emitted from the irradiator <b>75</b> can be sensed by the light receiver <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Alternatively (or additionally), the width of the print head <b>41</b> in the direction perpendicular to the X direction and the Z direction may be narrowed.

Hence, even in the state in which the print head <b>41</b> is positioned at the first position, the opening <b>21</b> is not closed by the print head <b>41</b> entirely, and the irradiator <b>75</b> and the light receiver <b>12</b> may be arranged in such a way as to face (correspond to) the part of the opening <b>21</b> not closed by the print head <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">With any of the above configurations, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, even after the print head <b>41</b>B completes the movement to the first position in response to the light receiver <b>12</b> sensing the light (electromagnetic waves) emitted from the irradiator <b>75</b> and thereby sensing the proximity of the body <b>100</b>B to the stand <b>200</b>, when the light receiver <b>12</b> does not sense the light (electromagnetic waves), the controller <b>71</b> can determine that the body <b>100</b>B is far (separate) from the stand <b>200</b> again, and perform control to move the print head <b>41</b>B back to the second position to return to the imaging performable state or the like.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Further, in the above embodiments, a not-shown guide(s) may be arranged on the upper surface or the like of the stand <b>200</b>, and a hole(s) or the like corresponding to the guide(s) may be formed in the lower surface or the like of the body <b>100</b>. Examples of the guide include a shaft and a projection that almost vertically stand along the Z axis (direction).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">This makes it possible to determine the position of the body <b>100</b> to be placed on the stand <b>200</b>, and place the body <b>100</b> on the stand <b>200</b> almost vertically with no tilt.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">It is preferable that the guide be a component that extends upward from the upper surface or the like of the stand <b>200</b> by a few to several centimeters.
