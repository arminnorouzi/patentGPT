The system functionally integrates a multilevel warehouse racking system, one or more materials handling vehicles, one or more mobile storage carts, and one or more transporters. For the purposes of defining and describing the concepts and scope of the present disclosure, it is noted that a &#x201c;warehouse&#x201d; encompasses any indoor or outdoor industrial facility in which materials handling vehicles transport goods including, but not limited to, indoor or outdoor industrial facilities that are intended primarily for the storage of goods, such as those where multi-level racks are arranged in aisles, and manufacturing facilities where goods are transported about the facility by materials handling vehicles for use in one or more manufacturing processes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the subject matter of the present disclosure, goods-to-man warehousing systems are provided to increase the adaptability, utility, and efficiency of partially and fully autonomous materials handling vehicles and transporters in the warehouse environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, a goods storage and retrieval system is provided. The goods storage and retrieval system comprises a multilevel warehouse racking system comprising a tote transfer zone, a materials handling vehicle comprising a mast assembly and a picking attachment, a target tote, and a transporter comprising transporter-based engagement hardware. The transporter-based engagement hardware enables the transporter to engage, transport, and disengage the target tote at the tote transfer zone independent of movement of the materials handling vehicle within the goods storage and retrieval system. The picking attachment is coupled to the mast assembly for movement along a lifting dimension of the mast assembly to (i) engage and disengage the target tote at the tote transfer zone and at multiple levels of the multilevel warehouse racking system independent of movement of the transporter within the goods storage and retrieval system and (ii) transport the target tote to multiple levels of the multilevel warehouse racking system independent of movement of the transporter within the goods storage and retrieval system. The mast assembly and the picking attachment are configured to access multiple levels of the multilevel warehouse racking system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of operating a goods storage and retrieval system is provided. The method comprises providing the goods storage and retrieval system comprising a multilevel warehouse racking system, a materials handling vehicle disposed on an inventory transit surface, a tote transfer zone, a target tote, and a transporter comprising transporter-based engagement hardware. The materials handling vehicle comprises a traction control unit, a braking system, and a steering assembly, each operatively coupled to one or more of the vehicle wheels. The materials handling vehicle further comprises a mast assembly, a fork carriage assembly movably coupled to the mast assembly, a mast assembly control unit, a carriage control unit, a picking attachment comprising an X-Y-Z-&#x3a8; positioner secured to the fork carriage assembly, a navigation subsystem, and one or more vehicular controllers in communication with the traction control unit, the braking system, the steering assembly, the mast assembly control unit, the carriage control unit, the picking attachment, and the navigation subsystem. The method comprises navigating the materials handling vehicle along the inventory transit surface to the target tote through use of the navigation subsystem and the one or more vehicular controllers independent of movement of the transporter within the goods storage and retrieval system. The method comprises engaging or disengaging the target tote with the picking attachment secured to the fork carriage assembly through use of the X-Y-Z-&#x3a8; positioner at the tote transfer zone and at multiple levels of the multilevel warehouse racking system independent of movement of the transporter within the goods storage and retrieval system. The method further comprises placing with the picking attachment the target tote on the tote transfer zone or on a level of the multilevel warehouse racking system and engaging the target tote with the transporter through use of the transporter-based engagement hardware comprising a transporter lifting surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
