In some embodiments, the &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>Z or &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>Z&#x2032; equivalent weight of the copolymer refers to the weight of the copolymer containing one mole of sulfonate groups (i.e., &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;) or carboxylate groups (i.e., &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;). Decreasing the &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>Z or &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>Z&#x2032; equivalent weight of the copolymertends to increase proton conductivity in the copolymer but tends to decrease its crystallinity, which may compromise the mechanical properties of the copolymer (e.g., tensile strength). Thus, the &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>Z or &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>Z&#x2032; equivalent weight of the copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure typically and advantageously provides a balance of the requirements for the electrical and mechanical properties of the copolymer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">The fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure can have up to 30 mole percent of divalent units represented by formula</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="62.99mm" wi="57.15mm" file="US20230002297A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0032" num="0000">based on the total amount of the divalent units.

The bisolefins can introduce long chain branches as described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2010/0311906 (Lavallde et al.). The bisolefins, described above in any of their embodiments, may be present in the components to be polymerized in any useful amount, in some embodiments, in an amount of up to 2, 1, or 0.5 mole percent and in an amount of at least 0.1 mole percent, based on the total amount of polymerizable components to make the fluorinated copolymer.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0031">Fluorinated copolymers useful for the process of the present disclosure can also include units derived from non-fluorinated monomers. Examples of suitable non-fluorinated monomers include ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, ethyl vinyl ether, vinyl benzoate, ethyl allyl ether, cyclohexyl allyl ether, norbornadiene, crotonic acid, an alkyl crotonate, acrylic acid, an alkyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, an alkyl methacrylate, and hydroxybutyl vinyl ether. Any combination of these non-fluorinated monomers may be useful. In some embodiments, the components to be polymerized further include acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and the copolymer of the present disclosure includes units derived from acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0032">Fluorinated copolymers useful in the process of the present disclosure are typically prepared by free-radical polymerization (e.g., radical aqueous emulsion polymerization suspension polymerization) using known methods.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0033">Fluorinated olefins that are produced by the process of the present disclosure include olefins corresponding to the general formula:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CF&#x2014;R<sup>d</sup><sub>f </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0052" num="0000">wherein R<sup>d</sup><sub>f </sub>represents F or a perfluoroalkyl group having 1 to 10 (in some embodiment, 1 to 5) carbon atoms.

In some embodiments, both TFE and HFP are produced.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0034">In the process of the present disclosure, the thermal decomposition of the fluorinated copolymer comprising at least one of sulfonic acid groups, carboxylic acid groups, or salts thereof into fluorinated olefins can be carried out in any suitable reactor capable of generating the temperature required for the decomposition reaction. For example, the thermal decomposition may be carried out in rotary kilns reactors. Rotary kiln reactors are described, for example in European Pat. Appl. EP 1 481 957 (Ichida et al.). The decomposition may also be carried out in extruder type reaction devices, for example devices as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,212,091 (Van der Walt et al.) and agitated reactors. These devices can be operated with or without gas streams, such as carrier gases or gaseous reaction medium. In some embodiments, the decomposition is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor (see, for example, J. R. Howard, &#x201c;Fluidized Bed Technology, Principles and Applications&#x201d;, Adam Hingler, New York, 1989). Typically, a gas or a gas mixture is used as fluidizing medium. The carrier gas or gaseous fluidizing or reaction medium typically comprises non-reactive gases (i.e. gases that do not react under the decomposition conditions in the reactor), such as steam, nitrogen, noble gases (e.g., Xe, Ar, Ne, and He), and mixtures thereof. However, in some embodiments, the carrier gas and/or medium may also contain reactive gases, i.e. fluorine-containing gases which may also decompose under the conditions in the reactor and be converted into TFE and/or HFP. The process of the present disclosure may be run as batch process or a continuous process.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0035">Carrier gas and/or reaction or fluidizing medium can be introduced in the reactor as separate gas streams. The optimum flow rates of the carrier gas or medium depends on the configuration of the reactor, the reaction and/or process conditions. Typical flow rates lie in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1,000 reactor volumes/min, in some embodiments, from about 0.1 to about 100 reactor volumes/min. The processes may be run at a pressure of from about 0.01 bar to about 5 bar or at atmospheric pressure (1 bar). The zone of the reactor where conditions are achieved under which decomposition takes place is referred to herein as &#x201c;decomposition zone&#x201d; of the reactor. In some embodiments, the gas stream (e.g., carrier gas stream or fluidising gas stream) is pre-heated before introduction into the decomposition zone of the reactor. Pre-heating can be carried out to a temperature equal to the decomposition temperature or a temperature 50&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. below the decomposition temperature.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0036">The process of the present disclosure includes heating the fluorinated copolymer at a first temperature not more than 450&#xb0; C. to decompose the at least one of sulfonic acid groups, carboxylic acid groups, or salts thereof to form a partially pyrolyzed intermediate. In some embodiments, the first temperature is not more than 440&#xb0; C., 430&#xb0; C., 425&#xb0; C., 420&#xb0; C., 410&#xb0; C., or 400&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the first temperature is in a range from 300&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C., 350&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C., 350&#xb0; C. to 425&#xb0; C., or 375&#xb0; C. to 425&#xb0; C. The process of the present disclosure further comprises subsequently heating the partially pyrolyzed intermediate at a second temperature of at least 550&#xb0; C. to produce the fluorinated olefin. In some embodiments, the second temperature is in a range from 550&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C., in some embodiments, from 600&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C., 600&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C., or 600&#xb0; C. to 700&#xb0; C. The first and second temperatures can be adjusted, for example, based on the composition of the fluorinated copolymer, the pressure under which the reactor is operated, the flow rate by which the fluorinated copolymer is fed through the reactor, and the time which the fluorinated copolymer remains in the decomposition zone.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0037">The fluorinated copolymer may be heated at the first temperature for any suitable period of time to decompose the sulfonic acid groups, carboxylic acid groups, salts thereof, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the fluorinated copolymer is heated at the first temperature for up to two hours, 90 minutes, or one hour. The partially pyrolyzed intermediate can be heated at a second temperature for any suitable period of time to produce the fluorinated olefin. In some embodiments, the partially pyrolyzed intermediate is heated at the second temperature for up to one hour or 45, 30, 20, 10, or 5 minutes. It is possible that the yield of the fluorinated olefin may be increased if the partially pyrolyzed intermediate in is heated at the second temperature for very short time, which can be achieved, for example, in fluidized bed reactors or in reactors using gas streams to carry the fluorinated material through the decomposition zone in short time. Short retention times at the second temperature can be achieved by high flow rates of the respective gas streams. In some embodiments, the partially pyrolyzed intermediate is heated at the second temperature for at least 5 seconds and up to one minute.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0038">In some embodiments, the fluorinated copolymer to be heated at the first temperature comprises at least one of the sulfonic acid groups (&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H) or carboxylic acid groups (&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>H). Salts of the fluorinated copolymers (e.g. from the NaCl-electrolyzers), can be converted to the acid form by a treatment with acids such as at least one of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or HF. This will typically enhance the decomposition of the functional groups during the heating at the first temperature.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0039">Heating at the first temperature and subsequently heating at the second temperature can be carried out in the same reactor or different reactors</p><p id="p-0059" num="0040">In some embodiments, at least one of heating at the first temperature or subsequently heating at the second temperature is carried out at least partially with microwave irradiation. The decomposition temperatures may be generated entirely by microwave irradiation or by a combination of microwave heating and conventional heating (e.g., heat exchange, combustion, or resistance heating). Therefore, in some embodiments, the reactor comprises one or more microwave generators for generating microwave radiation. Microwave-generated reactors are known in the art. The microwaves may be generated by devices such diodes, magnetrons, gyrotrons, travelling wave tubes, klystrons, ubitrons, and amplitrons, for example. Typically, the microwave generators are situated in the inside of the reactor. The inside of the reactor may be made of a material or coated with a material that increases the heating effect of the microwaves. Microwave irradiation as referred to herein means irradiation with electromagnetic waves having a wave length of about 30 cm to about 3 mm and/or a frequency band of from about 300 MHz to about 300 GHz, in some embodiments from about 915 MHz to about 2.45 GHz.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0041">In some embodiments, at least one of the fluorinated copolymer or the partially pyrolyzed intermediate is contacted by microwave active particles, for example, while being heated at least partially with microwave radiation. The fluorinated ionomer or the partially pyrolyzed intermediate can also be contacted by microwave active particles immediately before being thermally decomposed. Typically, the particles are present in the reaction medium, for example, by feeding the particles into the decomposition zone by a carrier gas stream or in the fluidised bed of a fluidised bed reactor. Microwave active particles heat up upon irradiation by microwaves, for example, through absorption of microwaves. Typically, microwave active materials heat up by at least 10&#xb0; C., at least 20&#xb0; C., or at least 30&#xb0; C. when submitting 1 g of the microwave active material at ambient conditions to microwave irradiation of 0.7 kW for 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0042">In some embodiments, useful microwave active particles are solid at the first temperature and/or second temperature. In some embodiments, the microwave active particles have a melting point or decomposition point of at least 800&#xb0; C., at least 1,000&#xb0; C., or at least 1,500&#xb0; C. Examples of suitable microwave active particles include carbon, graphite, carbides, silicides, borides, nitrides, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal halides (e.g., metal chlorides and metal fluorides), silicium carbide, boron carbides, titanium carbides, zirconium carbides, molebdenium silicides, titanium borides, sodium chloride, magnesium chlorides, potassium chloride, cobalt fluorides, potassium fluoride, calcium fluorides, and combinations thereof. Further examples of suitable microwave active particles include metals such as Ni, Pt, Co; Pt; metal alloys such as Pt/Cu, Pt/Re alloys; chromates; titanates; and combinations thereof. Combinations or blends of different microwave active particles may be useful in the process of the present disclosure. The microwave active particles can be selected such that they do not react with the reaction mixture and lose their microwave activity.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0043">The optimum size and amounts of the particles may be adapted to the specific composition of the fluorinated copolymer, the configuration of the reactor, and the process conditions. Typically, the particles have an average particle size (number average) from about 100 &#x3bc;m to about 5 mm, or from about 250 &#x3bc;m to about 2 mm. The particles may be spherical or non-spherical. In case of spherical or substantially spherical particles, the average size is determined by measuring the average diameter. In case of non-spherical, such as, for example, needle-like particles, the longest dimension (here the length) is used for determining the particle size.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0044">The ratio of microwave active particles to fluorinated copolymer to be decomposed depends on the reactor type, dimension, and configuration. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of microwave active particles to fluorinated copolymer is from about 1:1,000 to about 1:0.1 or from about 1:10 to about 1:1.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0045">The microwave active particles may be present, for example, in the carrier gas, reaction medium, or fluidised bed. This means the microwave active particles are in a mobile phase during the first heating and/or second heating. They may be introduced into the reactor through auxiliary gas streams simultaneously or non-simultaneously with the fluorinated copolymer, or they may be present in the reactor before the fluorinated copolymer is introduced into reactor. The microwave active particles may also be added to the fluorinated copolymer before, during, or after the fluorinated copolymer is fed into the reactor, or more specifically, into the decomposition zone. Alternatively, the microwave active particles may also be present in an immobile phase during the first and/or second heating, for example, in the same or similar way as catalytic beds. Some of the microwave particles may be removed from the reactor, for example, by the carrier gas, and may be replaced during at least one of the first heating or second heating. This can be done by continuous or discontinuous feeding.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0046">The presence of microwave active particles in the decomposition zone of the reactor generates hot spots in the reaction mixture facilitating heat transfer from the reactor to the reaction mixture. This can lead to a faster heat transfer into the reaction mixture and/or a more homogeneous distribution of heat within the reaction mixture compared to reactors that are not heated by microwave irradiation, such as reactors heated through heat exchange, combustion, or electrical resistance. The presence of microwave active particles may also allow the process to be run more energy efficiently. It also allows for clearing more easily blocked reactors, for example, caused by unreacted or polymerized material through overfeeding, by the collapse of fluidised bed, and/or as a consequence of interrupting or terminating the decomposition reaction and/or shutting down the reactor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0047">The fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure may be included in a catalyst ink or polymer electrolyte membrane in a fuel cell or other electrolytic cell. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the central element of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, such as a hydrogen fuel cell. Fuel cells are electrochemical cells which produce usable electricity by the catalyzed combination of a fuel such as hydrogen and an oxidant such as oxygen. Typical MEA's comprise a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) (also known as an ion conductive membrane (ICM)), which functions as a solid electrolyte. One face of the PEM is in contact with an anode electrode layer and the opposite face is in contact with a cathode electrode layer. Each electrode layer includes electrochemical catalysts, typically including platinum metal. Gas diffusion layers (GDL's) facilitate gas transport to and from the anode and cathode electrode materials and conduct electrical current. The GDL may also be called a fluid transport layer (FTL) or a diffuser/current collector (DCC). The anode and cathode electrode layers may be applied to GDL's in the form of a catalyst ink, and the resulting coated GDL's sandwiched with a PEM to form a five-layer MEA. Alternately, the anode and cathode electrode layers may be applied to opposite sides of the PEM in the form of a catalyst ink, and the resulting catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) sandwiched with two GDL's to form a five-layer MEA. Details concerning the preparation of catalyst inks and their use in membrane assemblies can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2004/0107869 (Velamakanni et al.). In a typical PEM fuel cell, protons are formed at the anode via hydrogen oxidation and transported across the PEM to the cathode to react with oxygen, causing electrical current to flow in an external circuit connecting the electrodes. The PEM forms a durable, non-porous, electrically non-conductive mechanical barrier between the reactant gases, yet it also passes H<sup>+</sup> ions readily.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0048">A catalyst ink composition can include a fluorinated copolymer as described above in any of its embodiments combined with catalyst particles (e.g., metal particles or carbon-supported metal particles). A variety of catalysts may be useful. Typically, carbon-supported catalyst particles are used. Typical carbon-supported catalyst particles are 50% to 90% carbon and 10% to 50% catalyst metal by weight, the catalyst metal typically comprising platinum for the cathode and platinum and ruthenium in a weight ratio of 2:1 for the anode. However, other metals may be useful, for example, gold, silver, palladium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, tungsten, manganese, vanadium, and alloys thereof. To make an MEA or CCM, catalyst may be applied to the PEM by any suitable means, including both hand and machine methods, including hand brushing, notch bar coating, fluid bearing die coating, wire-wound rod coating, fluid bearing coating, slot-fed knife coating, three-roll coating, or decal transfer. Coating may be achieved in one application or in multiple applications. The catalyst ink may be applied to a PEM or a GDL directly, or the catalyst ink may be applied to a transfer substrate, dried, and thereafter applied to the PEM or to the FTL as a decal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0049">In some embodiments, the catalyst ink includes the fluorinated copolymer described above at a concentration of at least 10, 15, or 20 percent by weight and up to 30 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst ink. In some embodiment, the catalyst ink includes the catalyst particles in an amount of at least 10, 15, or 20 percent by weight and up to 50, 40, or 30 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst ink. The catalyst particles may be added to a fluoropolymer dispersion to make a catalyst ink. The resulting catalyst ink may be mixed, for example, with heating. The percent solid in the catalyst ink may be selected, for example, to obtain desirable rheological properties. Examples of suitable organic solvents useful for including in the catalyst ink include, lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol), polyols (e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), diglyme, polyglycol ethers, ether acetates, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N dimethyacetamide (DMA), ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylimidazolidinone, butyrolactone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPT), isobutyl methyl ketone, sulfolane, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the catalyst ink contains 0% to 50% by weight of a lower alcohol and 0% to 20% by weight of a polyol. In addition, the ink may contain 0% to 2% of a suitable dispersant.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0050">In some embodiments, the fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure is included in a polymer electrolyte membrane. The copolymer may be formed into a polymer electrolyte membrane by any suitable method, including casting, molding, and extrusion. Typically, the membrane is cast from a fluoropolymer dispersion and then dried, annealed, or both. The copolymer may be cast from a suspension. Any suitable casting method may be used, including bar coating, spray coating, slit coating, and brush coating. After forming, the membrane may be annealed, typically at a temperature of 120&#xb0; C. or higher, more typically 130&#xb0; C. or higher, most typically 150&#xb0; C. or higher. A polymer electrolyte membrane can be prepared by obtaining the copolymer in a fluoropolymer dispersion, optionally purifying the dispersion by ion-exchange purification, and concentrating the dispersion to make a membrane. Typically, if the fluoropolymer dispersion is to be used to form a membrane, the concentration of copolymer is advantageously high (e.g., at least 20, 30, or 40 percent by weight). Often a water-miscible organic solvent is added to facilitate film formation. Examples of water-miscible solvents include, lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol), polyols (e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), ether acetates, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N dimethyacetamide (DMA), ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylimidazolidinone, butyrolactone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPT), isobutyl methyl ketone, sulfolane, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0051">Polymer electrolyte membranes can include a salt of at least one of cerium, manganese or ruthenium or one or more cerium oxide or zirconium oxide compounds is added to the acid form of the copolymer before membrane formation. Typically, the salt of cerium, manganese, or ruthenium and/or the cerium or zirconium oxide compound is mixed well with or dissolved within the copolymer to achieve substantially uniform distribution. The salt of cerium, manganese, or ruthenium may comprise any suitable anion, including chloride, bromide, hydroxide, nitrate, sulfonate, acetate, phosphate, and carbonate. More than one anion may be present. Other salts may be present, including salts that include other metal cations or ammonium cations. Once cation exchange occurs between the transition metal salt and the acid form of the ionomer, it may be desirable for the acid formed by combination of the liberated proton and the original salt anion to be removed. Thus, it may be useful to use anions that generate volatile or soluble acids, for example chloride or nitrate. Manganese cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>3+</sup>, and Mn<sup>4+</sup>, but are most typically Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Ruthenium cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Ru<sup>3+</sup> and Ru<sup>4+</sup>, but are most typically Ru<sup>3+</sup>. Cerium cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations persist in the polymer electrolyte because they are exchanged with H<sup>+</sup> ions from the anion groups of the polymer electrolyte and become associated with those anion groups. Furthermore, it is believed that polyvalent cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations may form crosslinks between anion groups of the polymer electrolyte, further adding to the stability of the polymer. In some embodiments, the salt may be present in solid form. The cations may be present in a combination of two or more forms including solvated cation, cation associated with bound anion groups of the polymer electrolyte membrane, and cation bound in a salt precipitate. The amount of salt added is typically between 0.001 and 0.5 charge equivalents based on the molar amount of acid functional groups present in the polymer electrolyte, more typically between 0.005 and 0.2, more typically between 0.01 and 0.1, and more typically between 0.02 and 0.05. Further details for combining an anionic copolymer with cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,575,534 and 8,628,871, each to Frey et al.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0052">Polymer electrolyte membranes can also include cerium oxide compounds. The cerium oxide compound may contain cerium in the (IV) oxidation state, the (III) oxidation state, or both and may be crystalline or amorphous. The cerium oxide may be, for example, CeO<sub>2 </sub>or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The cerium oxide may be substantially free of metallic cerium or may contain metallic cerium. The cerium oxide may be, for example, a thin oxidation reaction product on a metallic cerium particle. The cerium oxide compound may or may not contain other metal elements. Examples of mixed metal oxide compounds comprising cerium oxide include solid solutions such as zirconia-ceria and multicomponent oxide compounds such as barium cerate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cerium oxide may strengthen the polymer by chelating and forming crosslinks between bound anionic groups. The amount of cerium oxide compound added is typically between 0.01 and 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the copolymer, more typically between 0.1 and 2 weight percent, and more typically between 0.2 and 0.3 weight percent. The cerium oxide compound is typically present in an amount of less than 1% by volume relative to the total volume of the polymer electrolyte membrane, more typically less than 0.8% by volume, and more typically less than 0.5% by volume. Cerium oxide may be in particles of any suitable size, in some embodiments, between 1 nm and 5000 nm, 200 nm to 5000 nm, or 500 nm to 1000 nm. Further details regarding polymer electrolyte membranes including cerium oxide compounds can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,367,267 (Frey et al.).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0053">The polymer electrolyte membrane, in some embodiments, may have a thickness of up to 90 microns, up to 60 microns, or up to 30 microns. A thinner membrane may provide less resistance to the passage of ions. In fuel cell use, this results in cooler operation and greater output of usable energy. Thinner membranes must be made of materials that maintain their structural integrity in use.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0054">In some embodiments, a fluorinated copolymer may be imbibed into a porous supporting matrix, typically in the form of a thin membrane having a thickness of up to 90 microns, up to 60 microns, or up to 30 microns. Any suitable method of imbibing the copolymer into the pores of the supporting matrix may be used, including overpressure, vacuum, wicking, and immersion. In some embodiments, the copolymer is embedded in the matrix upon crosslinking. Any suitable supporting matrix may be used. Typically the supporting matrix is electrically non-conductive. Typically, the supporting matrix is composed of a fluoropolymer, which is more typically perfluorinated. Typical matrices include porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), such as biaxially stretched PTFE webs. In another embodiment fillers (e.g. fibers) might be added to the polymer to reinforce the membrane.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0055">To make an MEA, GDL's may be applied to either side of a CCM by any suitable means. Any suitable GDL may be used in the practice of the present disclosure. Typically, the GDL is comprised of sheet material comprising carbon fibers. Typically, the GDL is a carbon fiber construction selected from woven and non-woven carbon fiber constructions. Carbon fiber constructions which may be useful in the practice of the present disclosure may include Torayr&#x2122; Carbon Paper, SpectraCarb&#x2122; Carbon Paper, AFN&#x2122; non-woven carbon cloth, and Zoltek&#x2122; Carbon Cloth. The GDL may be coated or impregnated with various materials, including carbon particle coatings, hydrophilizing treatments, and hydrophobizing treatments such as coating with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0056">In use, the MEA is typically sandwiched between two rigid plates, known as distribution plates, also known as bipolar plates (BPP's) or monopolar plates. Like the GDL, the distribution plate is typically electrically conductive. The distribution plate is typically made of a carbon composite, metal, or plated metal material. The distribution plate distributes reactant or product fluids to and from the MEA electrode surfaces, typically through one or more fluid-conducting channels engraved, milled, molded or stamped in the surface(s) facing the MEA(s). These channels are sometimes designated a flow field. The distribution plate may distribute fluids to and from two consecutive MEA's in a stack, with one face directing fuel to the anode of the first MEA while the other face directs oxidant to the cathode of the next MEA (and removes product water), hence the term &#x201c;bipolar plate.&#x201d; Alternately, the distribution plate may have channels on one side only, to distribute fluids to or from an MEA on only that side, which may be termed a &#x201c;monopolar plate.&#x201d; A typical fuel cell stack comprises a number of MEA's stacked alternately with bipolar plates.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0057">In some embodiments, the fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure is a component of a device comprising at least one of a catalyst ink, a polymer electrolyte membrane, a catalyst layer, a gas diffusion layer, or a bipolar plate as described above in any of their embodiments. Thus, the process of the present disclosure can be carried out on any of these devices.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0058">Another type of electrochemical device is an electrolysis cell, which uses electricity to produce chemical changes or chemical energy. An example of an electrolysis cell is a chlor-alkali membrane cell where aqueous sodium chloride is electrolyzed by an electric current between an anode and a cathode. The electrolyte is separated into an anolyte portion and a catholyte portion by a membrane subject to harsh conditions. In chlor-alkali membrane cells, caustic sodium hydroxide collects in the catholyte portion, hydrogen gas is evolved at the cathode portion, and chlorine gas is evolved from the sodium chloride-rich anolyte portion at the anode. The fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present can be a component, for example, of a catalyst ink or electrolyte membranes for use in chlor-alkali membrane cells or other electrolytic cells.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0059">The fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure may also be a component of a binder for an electrode in other electrochemical cells (for example, lithium ion batteries). To make electrodes, powdered active ingredients can be dispersed in a solvent with the copolymer and coated onto a metal foil substrate, or current collector. The resulting composite electrode contains the powdered active ingredient in the polymer binder adhered to the metal substrate. Useful active materials for making negative electrodes include alloys of main group elements and conductive powders such as graphite. Examples of useful active materials for making a negative electrode include oxides (tin oxide), carbon compounds (e.g., artificial graphite, natural graphite, soil black lead, expanded graphite, and scaly graphite), silicon carbide compounds, silicon-oxide compounds, titanium sulfides, and boron carbide compounds. Useful active materials for making positive electrodes include lithium compounds, such as Li<sub>4/3</sub>Ti<sub>5/3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, LiV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, LiCo<sub>0.2</sub>Ni<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, LiMnPO<sub>4</sub>, LiCoPO<sub>4</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. The electrodes can also include electrically conductive diluents and adhesion promoters.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0060">Electrochemical cells can be made by placing at least one each of a positive electrode and a negative electrode in an electrolyte. Typically, a microporous separator can be used to prevent the contact of the negative electrode directly with the positive electrode. Once the electrodes are connected externally, lithiation and delithiation can take place at the electrodes, generating a current. A variety of electrolytes can be employed in a lithium-ion cell. Representative electrolytes contain one or more lithium salts and a charge-carrying medium in the form of a solid, liquid, or gel. Examples of lithium salts include LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiClO<sub>4</sub>, lithium bis(oxalato)borate, LiN(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LiN(C<sub>2</sub>FsSO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, LiC(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and combinations thereof. Examples of solid charge carrying media include polymeric media such as polyethylene oxide, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, fluorine-containing copolymers, polyacrylonitrile, combinations thereof, and other solid media that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Examples of liquid charge carrying media include ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, butylene carbonate, vinylene carbonate, fluoroethylene carbonate, fluoropropylene carbonate, gamma-butyrolactone, methyl difluoroacetate, ethyl difluoroacetate, dimethoxyethane, diglyme (bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether), tetrahydrofuran, dioxolane, combinations thereof and other media that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Examples of charge carrying media gels include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,570 (Nakamura et al.) and 6,780,544 (Noh). The electrolyte can include other additives (e.g., a cosolvent or a redox chemical shuttle).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0061">The electrochemical cells can be useful as rechargeable batteries and can be used in a variety of devices, including portable computers, tablet displays, personal digital assistants, mobile telephones, motorized devices (e.g., personal or household appliances and vehicles), instruments, illumination devices (e.g., flashlights) and heating devices. One or more of the electrochemical cells can be combined to provide battery pack.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0062">In some embodiments, the fluorinated copolymer useful in the process of the present disclosure is a component of a device comprising at least one of a binder, electrolysis cell, or a battery as described above in any of their embodiments. Thus, the process of the present disclosure can be carried out on any of these devices.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0063">When the fluorinated copolymer is a component of a device comprising at least one of a catalyst ink, a polymer electrolyte membrane, a catalyst layer, a gas diffusion layer, a bipolar plate, an electrolysis cell, or a redox flow battery, the process of the present disclosure can further comprise at least one crushing (e.g., milling or grinding) or shredding the device. The device (e.g., in particulate or shredded form) can also be heated while simultaneously heating the fluorinated copolymer.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0064">Fluorinated copolymer as components of a device comprising at least one of a catalyst ink, a polymer electrolyte membrane, a catalyst layer, a gas diffusion layer, a bipolar plate, an electrolysis cell, or a redox flow battery can be in salt form. That is, the sulfonate and/or carboxylate groups may be in salt form. In some embodiments, it is useful for the fluorinated copolymer to include sulfonic acid groups or carboxylic acid groups instead of the salts. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure further comprises treating the fluorinated copolymer (e.g., in the presence or absence of any of the devices described above) with an inorganic acid (e.g., HF, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid) to convert the fluorinated copolymer to its acid form, that is, including sulfonic acid groups or carboxylic acid groups.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0065">The reactor useful for carrying out the process of the present disclosure may contain or may be connected to a plasma zone, where a plasma is generated. The plasma zone is typically located at or after the decomposition zone. The plasma may accelerate the decomposition reaction. When used after the decomposition zone, the plasma may prevent or reduce precipitation of fluorocarbon particles and repolymerization. A plasma involves the ionisation of a gas. Inside the plasma negatively and positively charged compounds are present in substantially equal amounts. A plasma may be generated, for example through, microwave irradiation, for example by increasing the energy of the microwave irradiation until a plasma state is reached and stabilized. A plasma may also be generated, for example, by electric arcs, such as described, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,252,744 (Van der Walt et al.), or by corona treatment. The energy level of the plasma zone is typically optimized to stabilize the plasma but to prevent or reduce the deposition of fluorocarbon particles by minimizing the decomposition of fluorinated olefins. The energy level required to generate and stabilize the plasma may depend on the composition and amounts of the product gas and if present carrier gas or gaseous reaction media.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0066">The reactor useful for carrying out the process of the present disclosure may also contain or may be connected to a quenching zone. The quenching zone is located after the decomposition zone, and if a plasma zone is located after the decomposition zone, the quenching zone is typically located after the plasma zone. Hot product gas, generated by the first heating and second heating of the fluorinated copolymer and containing the fluorinated olefin can rapidly cooled (i.e., quenched) to stabilize the newly formed fluorinated olefins and preventing or reducing repolymerization. Typically quenching involves cooling the gas from a temperature of at least 550&#xb0; C., in some embodiments, from about 600&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., to a temperature below 250&#xb0; C. in less than 5 seconds or less than 1 second. Any suitable quenching system may be used, for example, expansion of the product gas, gas quenching by means of another gas which is cold, quench probes, (e.g., those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,252,744 (Van der Walt et al.)), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0067">A range of fluorinated olefins and other fluorinated and non-fluorinated products may form from the process of the present disclosure and may be present in the product gas. The desired fluorinated olefins (e.g., at least one of TFE or HFP) may be separated by conventional gas separation systems, for example, condensation, expansion, and distillation. Therefore, in some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure further comprises separating TFE and/or HFP from the product gas.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0068">Solid materials will typically stay in the bottom of the reactor or can be found/recovered from the quenching systems. Solid materials that are desirable to recover include metals (e.g., precious metals) from catalyst inks or catalyst layers graphite from bipolar plates, for example. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure further comprises recovering a metal after producing the fluorinated olefin. The metal can be a precious metal (e.g., gold, silver, platinum, or palladium).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0069">As shown in the Examples, below, the process of the present disclosure carried out on an ionomer having an equivalent weight of 1100 provided 82% yield of TFE and HPF.
