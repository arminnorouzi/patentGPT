Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of orthopedic joint replacement surgeries and more particularly to using photogrammetry and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques to aid surgeons and technicians in planning and executing orthopedic surgeries.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An emerging objective of joint replacement surgeries is to restore the natural alignment and rotational axis or axes of the pre-diseased joint. However, this objective can be difficult to achieve in practice because joints comprise not only the articulating bones but also ancillary supporting bones and a variety of soft tissue, including cartilage, ligaments, muscle, and tendons. In the past, surgeons avoided restoring natural alignment altogether, or estimated alignment angles and other dimensions based on averages derived from a sample of the population. However, these averages often failed to account for natural variation in the anatomy of a specific patient, particularly when the patient suffered from chronic bone deforming diseases like osteoarthritis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an attempt to address this, some care providers started using computed tomography (&#x201c;CT&#x201d;) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (&#x201c;MR&#x201d;) techniques to survey patient's internal anatomy to help plan orthopedic surgeries. Data from these CT scans and MRIs have even been used to create three-dimensional (&#x201c;3D&#x201d;) models in digital form. These models can be sent to professionals to design and produce patient-specific implants and instruments for said surgery. Additive manufacturing techniques (e.g., 3D printing) and other conventional production techniques can be used to construct physical implants or instruments that fit the patient's specific anatomy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, obtaining CT scans and MRIs can be complex, time consuming, and expensive. CT scans also tend to expose patients to higher levels of radiation per session than the patient might otherwise undergo using other non-invasive imaging techniques such as traditional radiography or ultrasounds. Moreover, scheduling considerations sometimes place the surveying CT scans or MRIs a month or more before the actual surgery. This delay can be exacerbated by the trend of gradually moving orthopedic surgical procedures to outpatient ambulatory surgical centers (&#x201c;ASCs&#x201d;). ASCs tend to be smaller facilities that often lack expensive on-site CT scanners and MRI machines. This often compels patients to schedule surveying appointments at hospitals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Increased time between the surveying appointment and the surgery increases the risk that the patient's boney and soft tissue anatomy will further deteriorate or change under normal use or by the progression of a disease. Further deterioration may not only cause the patient additional discomfort, but it can also negatively affect the surveying data's usefulness to the surgical team. This can be especially problematic for patient-specific implants created from outdated data and for surgical techniques that seek to restore range of motion based on the natural alignment of pre-diseased joints. Furthermore, increased time between the pre-operative surveying appointment and the surgery increases the likelihood that extrinsic events will negatively affect the data. For example, an accident that dislocates or breaks a bone in the planned surgical area usually undermines the usefulness of the prior surveying data. Such risks may be higher in especially active or in especially frail individuals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, not all patients have access to CT scans or MRIs for creating patient-specific implants or instruments. This can be due in part to the amount of time needed to acquire the data, send the data to a medical device design specialist, produce a 3D model of the desired anatomy, create a patient-specific instrument or implant design based upon the data or model, produce the patient-specific instrument or implant, track and ship said patient-specific instrument or implant to the surgical center, and sterilize said instrument or implant prior to the procedure. Lack of availability can also be a function of the patient's medical insurance and type of disease.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Knowing the precise amount of a patient's cartilage and bone loss can be useful in surgeries that seek to restore the natural range of motion of pre-diseased joints. Examples include primary knee replacement surgeries (typically called a &#x201c;total knee arthroplasty&#x201d; or &#x201c;TKA&#x201d;), total hip arthroplasties &#x201c;THAs,&#x201d; and procedures that seek to alleviate the causes of femoroacetabular impingements (&#x201c;FAI&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To use a knee joint and a TKA procedure as an example; a normal knee joint generally has a joint line (more specifically, a &#x201c;flexion-extension (&#x201c;FE&#x201d;) axis of rotation&#x201d;) that is generally about 2 degrees (&#x201c;&#xb0;&#x201d;) to 3&#xb0; varus relative to the mechanical medial-lateral (&#x201c;ML&#x201d;) line of the tibia. In an anatomic alignment TKA procedure, surgeons generally resect a portion of the patient's distal femoral condyles at about 3&#xb0; valgus relative to the femur's ML line and then resect the tibia perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tibia, which results in a resection that is about 2&#xb0; to 3&#xb0; varus of the tibial ML line. The surgeon then places and tests components of the artificial joints over the resected area, evaluates the patient's range of motion, and then adjusts as needed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, every patient's physiology is slightly different. For this reason, and because of the extrinsic variabilities surrounding surveying data, many TKA surgeons opt for a more patient-specific kinematic alignment approach and use tools and procedures intended to locate the patient's pre-diseased joint line intraoperatively. These tools tend to measure the thickness of the hyaline articular cartilage of a non-worn, or lesser worn femoral condyle. Such tools tend to have a thickness gauge associated with the measurement end of the tool. The measurement end of the tool is usually inserted into the thickest area of cartilage on the lesser worn condyle until the tip of the measurement end reaches the underlying bone. The surgeon then uses the thickness gauge to measure and record the amount of remaining cartilage. The surgeon then uses this measurement as an approximation of the amount of cartilage wear on the worn condyle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, this technique has several limitations. Firstly, the lesser-worn condyle may have insufficient remaining cartilage from which to make an accurate measurement. Secondly, even in cases where there is enough articular cartilage in the lesser-worn condyle, this cartilage measurement technique does not account for bone loss that occurs on the worn condyle. This problem can be compounded when there is little to no remaining cartilage on the adjacent condyle. As a result, existing intraoperative techniques cannot be used to reliably gauge the precise loss of both cartilage and bone in all kinematic alignment TKAs and therefore, these techniques, coupled with the problems and availability of accurate pre-operative data, can jeopardize the accurate alignment of the artificial joint line with the natural pre-diseased joint line. Repeated studies have shown that artificial joints that change the natural rotational axes of pre-diseased joints tend to contribute to poor function, pre-mature implant wear, and patient dissatisfaction.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, there is a long felt but unresolved need to augment preoperative and intraoperative imaging technologies to accurately model bone aberrations and other physiology when planning and executing orthopedic surgeries.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The problems of limited access to conventional preoperative CT and MRI imaging techniques, data accuracy due to bone and cartilage deterioration between the time of preoperative imaging and surgical procedure, and the limitations of determining the natural joint lines of pre-diseased bones or joints that arise from using currently available intraoperative tools and techniques is mitigated by systems and/or methods for calculating the extent of a bone aberration comprising: using a deep learning network to identify an area of a bone aberration from an input of at least two separate two-dimensional (&#x201c;2D&#x201d;) input images of a subject orthopedic element, wherein a first image of the at least two separate 2D input images is captured from a first transverse position, and wherein a second image of the at least two separate 2D input images is captures from a second transverse position offset from the first transverse position by an offset angle, and calculating a corrective area, wherein the corrective area removes the area of bone aberration.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is contemplated that in certain exemplary embodiments, the first and second input images can be radiographic input images.

Where a specific range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth or less of the unit of the lower limit between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range of sub range thereof, is included herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. All subranges are also included. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges are also included therein, subject to any specifically and expressly excluded limit in the stated range.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that some of the terms used herein are relative terms. For example, the terms, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and, &#x201c;lower&#x201d; are relative to each other in location, i.e., an upper component is located at a higher elevation than a lower component in each orientation, but these terms can change if the orientation is flipped. The terms, &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; and &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; are relative to the fluid flowing through them with respect to a given structure, e.g., a fluid flows through the inlet into the structure and then flows through the outlet out of the structure. The terms, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; are relative to the direction in which a fluid flows through various components prior to flowing through the downstream component.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The terms, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; are used to indicate direction relative to an absolute reference, i.e., ground level. However, these terms should not be construed to require structure to be absolutely parallel or absolutely perpendicular to each other. For example, a first vertical structure and a second vertical structure are not necessarily parallel to each other. The terms, &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; or &#x201c;base&#x201d; are used to refer to locations or surfaces where the top is always higher than the bottom or base relative to an absolute reference, i.e., the surface of the Earth. The terms, &#x201c;upwards&#x201d; and &#x201c;downwards&#x201d; are also relative to an absolute reference; an upwards flow is always against the gravity of the Earth.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Throughout this disclosure, various positional terms, such as &#x201c;distal,&#x201d; &#x201c;proximal,&#x201d; &#x201c;medial,&#x201d; &#x201c;lateral,&#x201d; &#x201c;anterior,&#x201d; and &#x201c;posterior,&#x201d; will be used in the customary manner when referring to the human anatomy. More specifically, &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to the area away from the point of attachment to the body, while &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to the area near the point of attachment to the body. For example, the distal femur refers to the portion of the femur near the tibia, whereas the proximal femur refers to the portion of the femur near the hip. The terms, &#x201c;medial&#x201d; and &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; are also essentially opposites. &#x201c;Medial&#x201d; refers to something that is disposed closer to the middle of the body. &#x201c;Lateral&#x201d; means that something is disposed closer to the right side or the left side of the body than to the middle of the body. Regarding, &#x201c;anterior&#x201d; and &#x201c;posterior,&#x201d; &#x201c;anterior&#x201d; refers to something disposed closer to the front of the body, whereas &#x201c;posterior&#x201d; refers to something disposed closer to the rear of the body.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">&#x201c;Varus&#x201d; and &#x201c;valgus&#x201d; are broad terms and include without limitation, rotational movement in a medial and/or lateral direction relative to the knee joint.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that the term &#x201c;bone aberration&#x201d; as used herein can refer to an area of external or internal bone loss, an area of abnormal excess bone (such as in an osteophyte (i.e., &#x201c;bone spur&#x201d;), or any other area of bone that is discontiguous with the natural area of the surrounding bone.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">All methods for identifying an area of bone aberration for the purpose of calculating a corrective area, wherein the corrective area removes the area of bone aberration relative to a surrounding bone area are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. By way of example, the below section describes exemplary embodiments of systems and methods used to restore the natural joint line and rotational axes of a pre-diseased knee joint in a total knee arthroplasty (&#x201c;TKA&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">To describe a primary TKA generally: the surgeon typically initiates the surgical procedure by making a generally vertical medial parapatellar incision on the anterior or anteromedial side of the operative knee. The surgeon continues to incise the fatty tissue to expose the joint capsule. The surgeon may then perform a medial parapatellar arthrotomy to pierce the joint capsule. A retractor may then be used to move the patella generally laterally to expose the distal condyles of the femur (see <b>103</b> and <b>107</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and the cartilaginous meniscus resting on the proximal tibial plateau (see generally <b>112</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The surgeon then removes the meniscus and uses instrumentation to measure and resect the distal femur <b>105</b> and proximal tibia <b>110</b> to accommodate trial implants. Trial implants are test endoprostheses that generally have the same functional dimensions of the actual endoprostheses, but trial implants are designed to be temporarily installed and removed for the purposes of evaluating the fit of the actual endoprostheses and for the purposes of evaluating the knee joint's kinematics. The trial implants and the actual endoprosthetic implants are generally disposed adjacent to these resections once installed. Therefore, the position and orientation of these femoral and tibial resections largely dictates the orientation of the trial and actual endoprosthetic implants and thereby the position and orientation of the reconstructed joint line.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">This tibial resection is then preformed. Once resected, the resected area of the tibia can be known as the &#x201c;tibial plateau.&#x201d; Next, the surgeon may place a trial tibial component on the resected proximal tibial plateau. The surgeon generally uses different instrumentation to measure and resect the distal femoral condyles for the purpose of installing a trial femoral component. If the trial components are not seated appropriately, the surgeon my use further instrumentation to measure and resect the femoral condyles and/or the tibial plateau until the desired seating is achieved.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The surgeon then generally inserts a trial meniscal insert between the trial tibial tray and the trial femoral component to test the knee's flexion and extension, general stability, and patellar tracking on the trial implants. Once satisfied with the trial and movement characteristics, the surgeon can use bone cement to permanently affix the actual tibial and femoral components of the endoprosthetic implant or use a press-fit implant and avoid use of bone cement if desired.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The newest alignment school of thought is the kinematic alignment philosophy. The kinematic alignment philosophy recognizes that every patient's physiology is slightly different and seeks to restore the patient's natural pre-diseased joint line by taking actual measurements of the operative physiology to ascertain the position of the native joint line. Once these measurements are known, tooling, such as pivoting femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) or resection guides <b>424</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) are then placed onto the exposed bones. Resection guides <b>424</b> may be custom made to complement the exposed bone or the resection guides <b>424</b> can selectively lock into a femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b>. These femoral resection guide locators <b>400</b> can have adjustable positioning mechanisms (see <b>440</b>) with which the surgeon can adjust the orientation of the resection guide <b>424</b> relative to the exposed bone based on the patient's specific measurements. Once the resection guide <b>424</b> is set at the desired orientation, the resection guide <b>424</b> is then temporarily affixed to the bone. The surgeon then inserts a surgical saw through a resection slot <b>455</b> of the oriented resection guide <b>424</b> to resect the undying bone in the desired resection plane. Because the position and orientation of the femoral and tibial resections largely dictate the orientation of the trial and actual endoprosthetic implants, the position and the orientation of the resection guide <b>424</b> largely determines position and orientation of the reconstructed joint axes of rotation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although it is contemplated that the methods and systems described herein may be especially useful for kinematic alignment, nothing in this disclosure limits the use of the systems and methods described herein to kinematic alignment. By way of example, the systems and methods described herein may be used with anatomic alignment, mechanical alignment, or any other alignment method provided that a present bone aberration would affect the positioning of the alignment instruments (see the resection guide locator <b>400</b> and the alignment guide <b>600</b>). Furthermore, nothing in this disclosure limits the exemplary systems and methods described herein to use on the knee joint. Any orthopedic procedure in which would be desirable for the surgeon to have pre- or intraoperative knowledge of a bone or soft tissue aberration are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. Examples of such orthopedic procedures include but are not limited to hip arthroplasties, and procedures that seek to alleviate the causes of femoroacetabular impingements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an anterior view of a simplified left knee joint (i.e., an example collection of subject orthopedic elements <b>100</b> in an example operative area <b>170</b>).

One example method of using this example cartilage thickness gauge <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and resection guides to perform a kinematic alignment technique is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/258,340. The entirety of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/258,340 is incorporated herein by reference. The method disclosed in this application uses a cartilage thickness gauge <b>40</b> to measure the thickness T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the hyaline articular cartilage <b>123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that is adjacent to a non-worn, or lesser worn femoral condyle (i.e., either <b>107</b> or <b>103</b>). The measurement end <b>41</b> of the cartilage thickness gauge <b>40</b> is inserted into the thickest area of cartilage <b>123</b> adjacent the lesser worn condyle until the tips <b>86</b> of the measurement end <b>41</b> reaches the underlying bone <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this manner, pressing the tips <b>86</b> of the measurement end <b>41</b> into the thickest area of remaining proximal cartilage <b>123</b> causes the piston <b>80</b> to compress the spring <b>79</b>. At the same time, the markers on the piston <b>80</b> move relative to the reference line and are visible through the viewing portal to thereby indicate the thickness of the cartilage <b>123</b> disposed under the measurement end <b>41</b>. The surgeon then records the amount of remaining cartilage (i.e., the cartilage thickness T) and uses this measurement as an approximation of the amount of cartilage wear on the worn condyle. This process is desirably repeated for each distal femoral condyle <b>103</b>, <b>107</b> and each posterior femoral condyle (<b>107</b><i>a</i>, <b>103</b><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">By way of a different example for evaluating the thickness of the cartilage <b>123</b>, a surgeon or technician may use an intra-operative probe to map the location and physical properties of the soft tissue, such as the soft tissue's elasticity and density. A system can use this data to calculate an amount of cartilage wear over the condyles.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at any time after the exposure of the distal femur <b>105</b>, the surgeon may drill an intramedullary canal down roughly the center of the distal femur <b>105</b>, and then place an intramedullary rod <b>420</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) into the evacuated intramedullary canal to provide a foundation for selectively disposing referencing instrumentation relative to the distal femur <b>105</b>. Once the intramedullary rod <b>420</b> is securely seated, a stable portion <b>451</b> of the pivoting femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> can be slid onto the intramedullary rod <b>420</b> such that adjustment pads <b>440</b>A, <b>440</b>B are disposed adjacent to the medial distal femoral condyle <b>107</b> and lateral distal femoral condyle <b>103</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The stable portion <b>451</b> can be an intramedullary rod holder member, or other device configured to be secured to a fixed position relative to a pivoting body portion <b>412</b>. The body portion <b>412</b> is configured to pivot relative to the stable portion <b>451</b>. A pin <b>411</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) may be closely fitted to and disposed in aligned annular holes in the stable portion <b>451</b> and the body portion <b>412</b> respectively and in this manner, the body portion <b>412</b> of the pivoting femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> can be said to &#x201c;configured to pivot&#x201d; relative to the stable portion <b>451</b>, or be said to be in a &#x201c;pivoting relationship&#x201d; with the stable portion <b>451</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The adjustment pads <b>440</b>A, <b>440</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) are then extended from the distal reference surface <b>485</b> of the resection guide locator <b>400</b> to touch the femoral condyles <b>103</b>, <b>107</b>. The length l of each adjustment pad <b>440</b> relative to the reference surface <b>485</b> is desirably the same length l as the measurement of the thickness T of the associated adjacent hyaline articular cartilage <b>123</b> for each condyle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, if there is 2 mm of cartilage wear on the medial side M and 0 mm on the lateral side L, the surgeon will extend the medial adjustment pad <b>440</b>A 2 mm. The surgeon then places each adjustment pad <b>440</b> on the appropriate condyle. In this example, the lateral adjustment pad <b>440</b>B would remain nearly flush with the distal reference surface <b>485</b>. The position of the distal reference surface <b>485</b> relative to the intramedullary rod <b>420</b> thereby sets the resection angle. The resection guide <b>424</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is then pinned to the femur <b>105</b> at the desired cutting angle, the femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> is removed, and the surgeon resects the distal femoral condyles <b>103</b>, <b>107</b> through the resection slot <b>455</b> at the desired resection angle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">However, these adjustments only account for cartilage wear present. The adjustments do not account for areas of bone aberrations <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b </i>such as bone loss that can occur on the worn condyle (e.g., the lateral condyle <b>103</b>, or the medial condyle <b>107</b>). The adjustment pads <b>440</b>A, <b>440</b>B are typically set based on the measurement of the cartilage thickness gauge <b>40</b>. If a patient suffers from significant bone loss, of if significant osteophytes (commonly referred to as &#x201c;bone spurs&#x201d;) are present, the position of distal reference surface <b>485</b> of the femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> will not be disposed at the precise location of the pre-diseased articular surface. Moreover, if the surgeon extends the adjustment pad <b>440</b> to the remaining area of bone (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), it is not possible to know with precision where the pre-diseased bone ended and where the articular cartilage <b>123</b> began. As such, even if the amount of cartilage wear can be reasonably approximated by measuring the thickest area of adjacent, unworn cartilage <b>123</b>, it is not possible to precisely know the depth of the missing bone. As such, any adjustment of the adjustment pad <b>440</b> to touch a condyle having areas of significant bone loss (and by extension, any adjustment of the position of the distal reference surface <b>485</b> and resection guide <b>424</b>) is at best an approximation of the pre-diseased articular surface. Lacking precision in this area risks miscalculating the orientation of the natural pre-diseased rotational axis of the joint. As such, any estimation error can negatively affect patient comfort and the useful life of the implant.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a result, using the pivoting femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/258,340 and existing intraoperative techniques cannot be used to reliably gauge the precise loss of both cartilage and bone in all TKAs and therefore, these techniques, coupled with the problems and availability of accurate pre-operative data, can undermine accurate reconstruction of an artificial joint line with the natural pre-diseased joint line.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">To illustrate this, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side view of a femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> having an adjustment pad <b>440</b>B extending through a negative area of bone aberration <b>115</b><i>b </i>to be disposed on an exposed surface of worn bone <b>116</b> on the lateral condyle <b>103</b>. The extended length l of the pad adjuster <b>440</b> relative to the distal reference surface <b>485</b> is initially set by the measurement of the cartilage thickness (see <b>123</b>), which may be obtained using the cartilage thickness gauge <b>40</b> as described above, or by other cartilage thickness measurement methods. However, with femoral condyles <b>103</b>, <b>107</b> that suffer from bone loss, it was not previously possible to ascertain the amount of bone aberration (e.g., bone loss in this instance) with certainty using a femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> with pad adjusters <b>440</b>A, <b>440</b>B.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the precise depth of the negative bone aberration (i.e., bone loss) on the lateral condyle <b>103</b> is not easily ascertainable using conventional methods. Improperly accounting for the depth of the negative bone aberration risks misalignment of the pivoting femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> because extending the pad adjuster <b>440</b>B to the value of the measured cartilage thickness and placing the end of the pad adjuster <b>440</b>B on the exposed surface of the worn bone <b>116</b> is now no longer indicative of the pre-diseased articular surface. That is, if the surgeon initially sets the extended length l of the depicted pad adjuster <b>440</b>B to 2 mm from the distal reference surface <b>485</b> (per the cartilage gauge measurement), and then disposes the pad adjuster <b>440</b> such that the pad adjuster <b>440</b> contacts the exposed surface of the worn bone <b>116</b>, the pad adjuster would extend into the area of bone loss <b>115</b><i>b </i>by the unknown depth of the negative bone aberration <b>115</b><i>b</i>, thereby changing the angle of the distal reference surface <b>485</b> (and by extension, the cutting surface) relative to the intramedullary rod <b>420</b>. This new cutting angle is not reflective of the pre-diseased articular surface and therefore would not be useful to align the knee kinematically.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The surgeon may attempt to compensate by adding length (see <b>1</b>) to the pad adjuster <b>440</b> to try to estimate the depth of bone loss, but the precise amount of loss is unknown to the surgeon. Therefore, the surgeon may over or under-estimate the amount of loss, thereby also risking misalignment of the femoral resection guide locator <b>400</b> relative to the actual articular surface of the pre-diseased joint. Kinematic alignment is a femoral articular surface referencing technique. Therefore, mistakes made when referencing the articular surface will be transferred to the proximal tibia if not corrected, thereby potentially further exacerbating the initial error. Further, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates, the area of bone aberration <b>115</b><i>b</i>, and the exposed surface of the worn bone <b>116</b> may not be uniform in depth. This can undermine the initial stability of the resection guide locator's angled position relative to the intramedullary rod <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In recent years, it has become possible to use multiple 2D images, such as X-ray radiographs from an imaging system, to create 3D models of an operative area <b>170</b>. These models can be used pre-operatively to plan surgeries much closer to the date of the actual surgery. Moreover, these 3D models can be generated intraoperatively to check against the pre-operative model and plan, or these 3D models can function as the native model from which areas of bone aberration can be calculated. However, X-ray radiographs have typically not been used as inputs for 3D models previously because of concerns about image resolution and accuracy. X-ray radiographs are 2D representations of 3D space. As such, a 2D X-ray radiograph necessarily distorts the image subject relative to the actual object that exists in three dimensions. Furthermore, the object through which the X-ray passes can deflects the path of the X-ray as it travels from the X-ray source (typically the anode of the X-ray machine) to the X-ray detector (which may include by non-limiting example, X-ray image intensifiers, phosphorus materials, flat panel detectors &#x201c;FPD&#x201d; (including indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs), or any number of digital or analog X-ray sensors or X-ray film). Defects in the X-ray machine itself or in its calibration can also undermine the usefulness of X-ray photogrammetry and 3D model reconstruction. Additionally, emitted X-ray photons have different energies. As the X-rays interact with the matter placed between the X-ray source and the detector, noise and artifacts can be produced in part because of Compton and Rayleigh scattering, the photoelectric effect, extrinsic variables in the environment or intrinsic variables in the X-ray generation unit, X-ray detector, and/or processing units or displays.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Moreover, in a single 2D image, the 3D data of the actual subject is lost. As such, there is no data that a computer can use from a single 2D image to reconstruct a 3D model of the actual 3D object. For this reason, CT scans, MRIs, and other imaging technologies that preserve third dimensional data were often preferred inputs for reconstructing models of one or more subject orthopedic elements (i.e., reconstructing a 3D model from actual 3D data generally resulted in more accurate, higher resolution models). However, certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure that are discussed below overcome these issues by using deep learning networks to improve the accuracy of reconstructed 3D models generated from X-ray photogrammetry and to identify areas of bone aberration on or in the reconstrued 3D model. In certain exemplary embodiments, the areas of bone aberration can be corrected or eliminated using curve fitting algorithms (i.e., an example surface adjustment algorithm).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">An exemplary method for calculating the extent of a bone aberration can comprise: generating a 3D model of an operative area <b>170</b> from at least two 2D images, wherein a first image is captured at a first transverse position, wherein a second image is captured at a second transverse position, and wherein the first transverse position is different than the second transverse position, identifying an area of a bone aberration on the 3D model, and calculating a corrective area, wherein the corrective area removes the area of bone aberration from the 3D model (i.e., relative to a surrounding bone area).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An exemplary system for calculating the extent of a bone aberration can comprise: a radiographic imaging machine <b>1800</b> comprising an emitter <b>21</b> and a detector <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>), wherein the detector <b>33</b> of the radiographic imaging machine <b>1800</b> captures a first image <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>) in a first transversion position <b>30</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>) and a second image <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>) in a second transverse position <b>50</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>), wherein the first transverse position <b>30</b><i>a </i>is offset from the second transverse position <b>50</b><i>a </i>by an offset angle &#x3b8; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), a transmitter <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>), and a computational machine <b>1600</b> wherein the transmitter <b>29</b> transmits the first image <b>30</b> and the second image <b>50</b> from the detector <b>33</b> to the computational machine <b>1600</b>, and wherein the computational machine <b>1600</b> is configured to identify an area of a bone aberration <b>115</b> on the 3D model of the subject orthopedic element <b>1100</b>, and calculate a corrective area, wherein the corrective area removes the area of bone aberration from the 3D model of the subject orthopedic element <b>1100</b> (i.e., relative to a surrounding bone area).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In certain exemplary embodiments, an exemplary system may further comprise a display <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In certain exemplary embodiments, an exemplary system may further comprise a manufacturing machine <b>18</b>.

The volume data <b>75</b> of the multiple back projected input images <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> is a multidimensional array that can be known as an &#x201c;input tensor.&#x201d; This input tensor comprises the input data (which is the volume data <b>75</b> in this example) for the first convolution.

The patch of pixels extracted from the data is known as the receptive field. The multiplication of the kernel <b>69</b> and the receptive field comprises an element-wise multiplication between each pixel of the receptive field and the kernel <b>69</b>.

For example, applying a convolution or a cross-correlation operation between the input tensor and the kernel <b>69</b>, wherein the kernel <b>69</b> comprises a low level edge filter in the convolution stage <b>67</b> produces a convolution output tensor. Then, applying a non-linear activation function with a bias to the convolution output tensor will return a feature map output tensor. The bias is sequentially added to each cell of the convolution output tensor. For a given cell, if the sum is greater than or equal to 0 (assuming ReLU is used in this example), then the sum will be returned in the corresponding cell of the feature map output tensor. Likewise, if the sum is less than 0 for a given cell, then the corresponding cell of the feature map output tensor will be set to 0. Therefore, applying non-linear activations functions to the convolution output behaves like a threshold for determining whether and how closely the convolution output matches the filter of the kernel <b>69</b>. In this manner, the non-linear activation function detects the presence of the desired features from the input data (e.g., the volume data <b>75</b> in this example).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">All non-linear activation functions are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. Other examples include the Sigmoid, TanH, Leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, Softmax, and Switch activation functions.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">However, a shortcoming of this approach is that the feature map output of this first convolutional layer <b>72</b><i>a </i>records the precise position of the desired feature (in the above example, an edge). As such, small movements of the feature in the input data will result in a different feature map. To address this problem and to reduce computational power, down sampling is used to lower the resolution of the input data while still preserving the significant structural elements. Down sampling can be achieved by changing the stride of the convolution along the input tensor. Down sampling is also achieved by using a pooling layer <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Valid padding may be applied to reduce the dimensions of the convolved tensor (see <b>72</b><i>b</i>) compared to the input tensor (see <b>72</b><i>a</i>). A pooling layer <b>58</b> is desirably applied to reduce the spatial size of the convolved data, which decreases the computational power required to process the data.

By way of comparison, CT scans typically produce a series of images of the desired volume. Each CT image that comprises a typical CT scan can be imagined as a segment of the imaged volume. From these segments, a 3D model can be created relatively easily by adding the area of the desired element as the element is depicted in each successive CT image. The modeled element can then be compared with the data in the CT scan to ensure accuracy.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">By contrast, radiographic imaging systems typically do not generate sequential images that capture different segments of the imaged volume; rather, all of the information of the image is flattened on the 2D plane. Additionally, because a single radiographic image <b>30</b> inherently lacks 3D data, it is difficult to check the model generated by the epipolar geometry reconstruction technique described above with the actual geometry of the target orthopedic element <b>100</b>. To address this issue, the CNN can be trained with CT images, such as digitally reconstructed radiograph (&#x201c;DRRs&#x201d;) images. By training the neural network in this way, the neural network can develop its own weights (e.g., filters) for the kernels <b>69</b> to identify a desired orthopedic element <b>100</b> or a bone aberration <b>115</b><i>b</i>. Because X-ray radiographs have a different appearance than DRRs, image-to-image translation can be performed to render the input X-ray images to have a DRR-style appearance. An example image-to-image translation method is the Cycle-GAN image translation technique. In embodiments in which image-to-image style transfer methods are used, the style transfer method is desirably used prior to imputing the data into a deep learning network for feature detection.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">The above examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are in no way intended to limit the scope of this disclosure.

To delineate the boundary of the volume that comprises the 3D models of the bone aberrations <b>115</b><i>m</i><b>1</b>, <b>115</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>, the deep learning network can be trained to detect the edges of the actual negative bone aberrations <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>c </i>and the curvature of the surface of the adjacent orthopedic element <b>100</b> in which the negative bone aberration <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>c </i>resides.

The material of the physical 3D model of the bone aberration <b>115</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> should be sterilizable and can desirably have properties suitable for an autoclave.
