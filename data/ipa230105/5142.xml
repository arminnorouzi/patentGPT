id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods are provided for automatically imaging and analyzing cell samples in an incubator. An actuated microscope operates to generate images of samples within wells of a sample container across days, weeks, or months. A plurality of images is generated for each scan of a particular well, and the images within such a scan are used to image and analysis metabolically active cells in the well. Tins analysis includes generating a &#x201c;range image&#x201d; by subtracting the minimum intensity value, across the scan, for each pixel from the maximum intensity value. This range image thus emphasizes cells or portions of cells that exhibit changes in activity over a scan period (e.g., neurons, myocytes, cardiomyocytes) while de-emphasizing regions that exhibit consistently high intensities when images (e.g., regions exhibiting a great deal of autofluorescence unrelated to cell activity).</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

The response of the cells to the applied conditions can be measured in order to assess the efficacy of a drug or treatment, to assess the toxicity of a substance (e.g., of an experimental drug or treatment), to investigate the effect of a genetic modification of the cells, to investigate the metabolomics, structure, or other properties of the cells and/or tissue formed therefrom, or to determine some other information. This assessment can include removing the sample from the incubator and imaging it (for example, using a fluorescence microscope or sonic other imaging apparatus). This imaging can include the addition of contrast agents or chemical reagents the may result in destruction of the sample.

Further, the exemplary embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is desirable in a variety of applications to measure and analyze the behavior of tissue and/or cell samples over time (e.g., hours, days, weeks, or months or any other suitable periods of time). Such detection and analysis can facilitate the assessment of a variety of therapeutic treatments, environmental conditions, genetic modifications, communicable diseases, or other specified conditions over time in order to assess the efficacy of a treatment, to determine the toxicity of a substance, or to determine some other information of interest. This detection and analysis can include imaging the cell and/or tissue samples. Such imaging can include generating, for a plurality of different periods of time (for example, hourly, daily, weekly, twice-daily, or other suitable sets of periods of time) movies or other sequences of images depicting the structure and/or activity of the samples across each period of time. A &#x201c;movie&#x201d; can include all of the images taken of a sample during a particular period of time, or may include a subset of such images.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Such image sequences could provide information about the pattern or structure of the activity of the cells in a sample. A degree of connectivity between a pair of cells, portions of cells, or other &#x201c;active objects&#x201d; in a sample can be determined as a correlation or coherence between time-varying activity levels determined for the pair of active objects, the presence, magnitude, width, or some other measure of a peak or other feature of a measured probability function that describes a relationship between the activity of pairs of cells, or some other metric of the degree of similarity and/or causality between the measured activity levels, over time, of pairs of active objects in a sample. A degree of connectivity of a population of active objects in a sample could be determined as a mean or other summary metric of such pairwise measures. A pattern of connectivity between active objects in a sample could be determined as a graph or other indication of the strength, direction, or other measure of connectivity between the active objects in the sample, based on pairwise metrics determined for the active objects in the sample.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Such measures of connectivity could be determined between neurons, myocytes, or cells that can electrically signal to each other or that are otherwise functionally connected such that changes in activity of a first cell can result, on a time scale of seconds to minutes, in a measureable change in activity in a second cell that is connected to the first cell.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">To facilitate such imaging, over periods of time, the samples could be disposed within or proximate to an automated imaging system. Such an automated imaging system could include an imaging device (for example, a microscope, a fluorescence imager, one or more light sources, and/or other elements configured to facilitate imaging samples) and a gantry or other actuator configured to move the imaging device relative to a sample container that contains the samples (e.g., relative to a sample container that has a plurality of wells, each well containing a respective sample of cultured cells, explanted tissue, or some other biological material of interest). The actuator could act, in an automated fashion, to move the imaging device at specified points in time (e.g., according to a scan schedule) to image each of the samples. Accordingly, one or more images could be generated automatically for each of the samples during each of a plurality of scan periods. The samples, within their sample container(s), and the automated imaging system could both be disposed within an incubator, avoiding the necessity of removing the samples from an incubator in order to image them. In such an embodiment, the samples could develop more &#x2018;naturally,&#x2019; avoiding the perturbations that transferring the samples from the incubator to an imaging system may cause.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Operating such a system in such a fashion may produce a plurality of images for a particular sample over time. It can be beneficial to automate certain aspects of the analysis. For example, automated systems (e.g., a server or other controller implementing one or more of the methods described herein) could operate to identify and locate &#x201c;active objects&#x201d; within a sample, based on images of the sample. Such active objects may include cells, or portions of cells (e.g., nuclei, mitochondria, or other organelles, cell cytoplasm and/or compartments thereof, dendritic segments or other compartments of a neuron), that vary over time with respect to activity (e.g., with respect to calcium concentration, transmembrane voltage, phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination state, transcriptional or translational activity, or some other image-able proxy for an activity of interest). Such cells may include neurons, smooth muscle cells, striated muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, secretory epithelial cells, or some other variety of cell that can exhibit image-able increases and decreases in an activity level of interest.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It can be difficult to identify and locate (or &#x201c;segment&#x201d;) such objects within an image, particularly to identify changes over time. In order to identify and locate such objects, a sequence of images from a scan of a sample can be used to generate a &#x201c;range image&#x201d; for the sampled during the scan period. Such a range image is determined by determining the difference, for each location within the image frame of sequence of images, between the maximum and minimum intensity values across all of the images of the sequence. Thus, a &#x2018;bright&#x2019; pixel of the range image corresponds to a location (for example, a location of a cell, or a location of a portion of a cell) that changed, with respect to the imaged activity level (e.g., with respect to a fluorescently-detected intracellular calcium concentration), across the sequence of images. The location, extent, or other information about &#x201c;active objects&#x201d; (e.g., cells, portions of cells) within the sample can then be determined from the range image (e.g., via thresholding, template matching, etc.). Such a method has the advantages of discarding regions that are &#x2018;always active&#x2019; (for example, regions that exhibit consistently high but non-varying artifactual levels of autofluorescence) while emphasizing regions that vary with respect to activity, but that are rarely and/or weakly active (for example, a neuron whose activity only bursts once during a scan).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The location, extent, or other information about the identified active objects can then be used to determine information about the active objects. For example, a time-varying activity trace across the scan could be determined for each of the active objects. This time-varying activity trace can be used to determine information about the active object (e.g., a burst rate, an average burst duration or intensity, an overall average intensity, an amount of time spent bursting/exhibiting elevated activity), about a population of active objects (e.g., an overall mean burst duration, a mean burst rate), and/or about relationships between active objects (e.g., a correlation between time-varying activity traces, a degree or pattern of correlation between time-varying activity traces of a set of active objects). Additionally or alternatively, such time-varying activity traces could be used to filter out objects that have been erroneously identified as active objects (e.g., identified using the range image method described above) by rejecting from further analysis identified objects that do not exhibit at least one burst).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">II. EXAMPLE IMAGE PROCESSING</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A plurality of images can be generated, using the systems and methods described herein and/or using some other apparatus or methods, of a sample contained within a sample container. The images can be organized, according to the times at which they are generated, into discrete &#x201c;scans.&#x201d; Each scan is separated in time from the other scans by a specified amount of time (e.g., hours, days, weeks, months), and each scan may include one or more images. For example, each scan could include three minutes' worth of images (or some other suitable duration) of a sample, taken at a rate of three images per second (or at some other suitable rate). The images corresponding to a particular scan can be analyzed in order to determine some information about a sample during the time period of the scan. This can include determining that cells and/or portions thereof within the sample have exhibited some activity during the scan (that they are &#x201c;active objects&#x201d;), locating and/or determining the spatial extent of such cells and/or active portions thereof, or determining sonic other information about the sample. For example, time-varying activity traces could be determined, for each such identified and/or located object, that describe the activity level of the objects over the scan. Such activity levels (or &#x201c;traces&#x201d;) could be used to determine information about the cells, about populations of cells, about the interrelations between the cells, or some other information about the sample. Such information could be determined for each scan of a number of different scans taken over time, and used to determine some information about the behavior of the sample over time (e.g., over hours, days, weeks, or months).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A variety of image processing techniques may be applied to visible and/or invisible-light images of a sample, taken during a single scan, in order to identify, locate, and/or determine the extent within an image of cells or other objects of interest within the sample. The images taken during a single scan are used to generate a &#x201c;range image&#x201d; that emphasizes objects (e.g., cells, portions of cells) that exhibit, during the scan, variations in intensity that correspond to variations in activity level. For example, the images could be fluorescence images taken to detect a fluorescent substance within the sample that corresponds to the activity of interest. Such a fluorescent substance could include a calcium-sensitive fluorophore e.g., where the concentration of intracellular calcium are chosen as a proxy for activity), a voltage sensitive fluorophore (e.g., where variations in trans-membrane voltage are chosen as a proxy for activity), or some other substance that has a fluorescent property (e.g., a fluorescence intensity, an excitation wavelength, an emission wavelength) that is correlated with some activity metric of interest (e.g., phosphorylation/ubiquitination state, transcriptional/translational activity, intracellular calcium concentration, transmembrane voltage). Additionally or alternatively, dyes, chromophores, chemiluminescent substances, or other substances having an optical property (e.g., a color, an opacity, an intensity) that is correlated with some activity metric of interest may be used to facilitate imaging activity during a scan.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Such a range image can be generated for a scan by, for a given pixel of the range image, determining the range of a set of pixel values, across the images in the scan, that correspond to the location of the given pixel of the range image within the image frame of the images of the scan. This can include comparing only those pixels, across the images of the scan, that correspond exactly to the location of the range image pixel. Alternatively, a set of nearby pixels of each of the images may be used to generate the range (e.g., to provide a smoothing or filtering function when determining the range image). Determining the range of such a set of pixel values can include determining the difference between a maximum of the pixel values and a minimum of the pixel values, or may include other methods (e.g., determining a difference between the fifth percentile of pixel values and the ninety-fifth percentile of pixel values, in order to discard outlier pixel values). A range image generated using the methods described herein can emphasize objects, represented within the set of scan images, that vary with respect to intensity across the scan period even when those objects may have been active rarely and/or for very short period(s) of time within the scan period. Further, such a range image can reject and/or de-emphasize objects and/or regions that exhibited consistent high intensity (e.g., due to the presence of confounding autofluorescent substances, or substances that erroneously active a fluorophore or other activity-sensitive contrast agent in the sample) across the scan period, but that did not vary and thus are unlikely to represent active cells, portions of cells, or other active objects of interest.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the contents <b>100</b> of an example sample container (e.g., contents of a well of a sample container that contains an array of such wells).

For example, background subtraction, noise filtering, or some other preprocessing methods could be applied to the range image before identifying the location of active objects (e.g., cells, portions of cells) within the range image. Thresholding, template matching, or other methods could then be applied to the range image and/or a pre-processed version thereof in order to locate active objects within the image frame of the range image.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Determining the location of an active object (e.g., the location of a cell, or of a portion of a cell, that exhibits changes, over a scan period, in intracellular calcium concentration or in some other image-able metric of a biological activity of interest) can include determining a single location (e.g., a centroid, an arbitrary point within a boundary of the active object), an effective radius, a region (e.g., a regions defined by a determined perimeters of the active object), a set of pixels or other discrete sub-regions within an image frame, or determining some other location information for each of the active objects. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a variety of locations, within the image frame <b>400</b> of the images <b>200</b> <i>a</i>-<i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-D</figref>, determined for the active objects <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, <b>120</b> <i>b</i>, <b>120</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Determining a location can include determining the location of a single point (e.g., <b>410</b> <i>a</i>, <b>410</b> <i>b</i>, <b>410</b> <i>c</i>) for each active object (e.g., a centroid of discrete or otherwise distinguishable high-intensity regions in the corresponding range image). Additionally or alternatively, determining a location can include determining an extent (e.g., <b>420</b> <i>a</i>, <b>420</b> <i>b</i>, <b>420</b> <i>c</i>), within the image frame that each active object occupies. This could include determining sets of pixels and/or pixel locations of the range image across which each active object extends.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The determined locations of the active objects can then be used to determine information about each of the active objects. For example, time-varying activity levels can be determined, based on the determined locations, for each of the active objects. The time-varying activity level for a particular active objects represents the level of activity, as represented by intensity in the images taken of the sample containing the active object (e.g., intracellular calcium concentration), of the active object across a scan. Thus, the time-varying activity level can be used to assess the overall level, pattern, and timing (e.g., relative to other active objects) of activity (e.g., firing of action potentials of a neuron or portion thereof) of the active object. For example, a burst rate or frequency, a burst duration, a burst intensity, an average activity level, a variability of activity level, or some other information and or distribution thereof about the activity of an active object may be determined from the time-varying activity level determined for the active object. Such information may also be used to determine overall metrics for a sample, e.g., a mean overall activity of active objects in a sample could be determined from the time-varying activity levels for the active objects in the sample.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The determined time-varying activity levels may also be used to determine information about the functional connectivity between active objects (e.g., neurons) within the sample. For example, pairwise correlations may be determined for each pair of active objects in a sample. Such correlations may then be reported and/or used to determine a pattern or an overall degree of coordination between the activities of active objects within a sample.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A time-varying activity level can be generated, for a particular active object, in a variety of ways. In examples wherein determining the location of the active object included determining a set of pixels or some other information about the extent, within an image frame, of the active object, determining the time-varying activity level for the active object could include determining a sum, an average, or some other measure of the overall intensity of the pixels, for each fluorescence intensity image across a scan, that correspond to the extent of the active object (e.g., the determined set of pixels that correspond to the active object). In another example, a weighted average of pixels within a specified distance of a determined point location of an active object may be used to determine the time-varying activity level of the active object across a scan.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Fluorescent imaging of a sample can result in photobleaching of the sample. Such photobleaching can manifest, in fluorescent images taken of the sample, as a gradual decrease in the detected fluorescence intensity of the sample and/or active objects therein over time. This photobleaching can be detected and/or quantified and its effects (e.g., on time-varying activity traces generated from such fluorescence images) reduced or removed in a variety of ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a time-varying activity trace <b>500</b> determined for an active object that exhibited photobleaching. The downward trend in the time-varying activity trace <b>500</b> caused by the photobleaching is indicated by the dotted line <b>510</b>. The level of this photobleaching effect can be determined from the time-varying activity trace <b>500</b>, e.g., by applying a low-pass filter, by applying a moving-window minimum, by identifying and removing discrete bursts, or by employing some other method. The determined level of photobleaching can then be applied to compensate for the effects of photobleaching, generating a more accurate time-varying activity level for an active object (shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> as the corrected time-varying activity level <b>520</b>). Additionally or alternatively, the level of photobleaching over time may be determined in some other method (e.g., by determining, for each fluorescence activity image of a scan, a respective level of photobleaching) and applied to correct one or more time-varying activity levels (shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> as the photobleaching level <b>530</b>).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The range image method described above can be used to identify and/or locate active objects within a sample. Additionally or alternatively, such objects may be identified based on their exhibiting one or more distinct bursts across a scan. For example, the location of a putative active object may be determined (e.g., using the range method described above and/or using some other segmentation method) and this determined location used to determine, for the putative active object, a time-varying activity level. This time-varying activity level can then be analyzed to determine whether the time-varying activity level contains at least one burst. If so, the putative active object can be confirmed and used for additional analysis (e.g., mean burst rates, overall population burst rates, determining the degree and/or pattern of connectivity between confirmed active objects within a sample). If no bursts are detected, the putative active object can be rejected and its time-varying activity trace discarded from additional analysis. A subset of active objects can thus be selected, from a population of putative active objects, that exhibit bursts and are therefore more likely to represent actual active cells and/or portions thereof. Such a selection process can have benefits where, e.g., one or more putative active objects are detected, in a range image, that do not exhibit bursts but instead exhibit artifactual high levels of photobleaching over a scan and thus may appear as high-intensity regions within the range image.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Bursts include any fast change in the detected activity of a cell, portion of a cell, or other active object during a scan period. For example, a burst can result in a fast change in the detected fluorescence intensity of an active object in a recorded video sequence. Such a burst results in a peak in the time-varying intensity level trace determined for the active object. Bursts can be identified, within a given time-varying activity level, using a variety of different methods. In some examples, a burst can be identified within a time-varying activity level wherever the time: varying activity level exceeds a threshold and/or wherever the time-varying activity level increases from a baseline level (e.g., determined from the time-varying activity level trace using a moving-window minimum) by more than a threshold level and/or increases by greater than a threshold rate. Additionally or alternatively, template matching, highpass filtering, or other methods could be used to identify bursts within a time-varying activity level determined as described herein. The strength and duration properties of such burst peaks can be calculated from the active object's time-varying activity level trace. The mean burst properties can be calculated per active object and then aggregated for the all the active objects in a sample during a scan.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">III. EXAMPLE SYSTEMS</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0089">An automated imaging system may be employed to generate, in an automated fashion, images (e.g., fluorescence activity images) of a plurality of biological samples, in respective wells of a sample container, during a plurality of different scan periods over time. A set of images could be taken, by the automated imaging system, of each sample during each of the scan periods, e.g., a set of images taken at a rate of three images per second over a three minute scan period.

Further, such an automated imaging system can be configured to operate within an incubator, removing the need to remove the samples from an incubator for imaging. Accordingly, the growth environment for the samples can be maintained more consistently. Additionally, where the automated imaging system acts to move a microscope or other imaging apparatus relative to the sample containers (instead of, e.g., moving the sample container to be imaged by a static imaging apparatus), movement-related perturbation of the samples can be reduced.

The scans could be specified such that at least two, at least three, or some greater number of scans occurs within a twenty-four hour period. In some examples, data from one or more scans could be analyzed (e.g., according to the methods described herein) and used to determine the timing of additional scans (e.g., to increase a rate, duration, image capture rate, or some other property of the scans in order to detect the occurrence of a discrete event that is predicted. to occur within a sample).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The use of such an automated imaging system can facilitate imaging of the same biological sample at multiple points in time over long time periods.

However, mammalian neuronal systems are complex and there is a continuing need for tools, including reagents, hardware, software and guided protocols, to characterize cultured neurons, analyze their function, analyze neuronal networks formed by neurons in culture, provide quality controls for cultured neurons and improve induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cell models.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">For example, improved tools for neuronal analysis provided by this disclosure produce better functional cell models to determine parameters such as, but not limited to, whether the cultured neurons are functionally active, when the neurons became functionally active in the cultures and how the functional activity changes over time in culture and under various experimental conditions, what the physical characteristics of the neurons are and how the physical characteristics change over time in culture and under various experimental conditions. Methods and systems provided according to the present disclosure allow a user to make multiple relevant measurements of neuronal cultures which are statistically robust since measurements from thousands of cells are both possible and practical. Methods and systems provided according to the present disclosure allow a user to analyze changes in long-term cultures with higher throughput than previous systems.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Scientific and technical terms used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.

The gantry houses the microscope, camera, and consumable trays that enable automated image acquisition of live-cell cultures and is installed inside a standard tissue culture incubator. In spontaneous neuronal activity application the microscope system contains a filter module that is tailored to collecting fluorescent images in the orange spectrum (ex: 540 nm; Passband: [513, 568 nm; em: 609 nm; Passband: [577, 684] nm) and in the near-infrared spectrum (ex: 661 nm; Passband: [648, 674]; em: 727 nm; Passband: [641, 771] nm. The controller contains processors, memory and data storage drives that enable image storage, data handling, database storage, file systems, automated image processing, graphing and over-the-network interaction from the client computer through a graphical user interface (GUI). The software on the controller serves 2 purposes: 1) server interaction, and 2) instrument control.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The gantry is installed in an incubator and houses the microscope and camera.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The controller controls the microscope system and functions as a server.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The controller plugs into a communications port, such as, but not limited to, an Ethernet port.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">A graphical user interface (GUI) is loaded on to a computer and interacts with the controller (i.e. server) to control the microscope system and interact with the data. All automated image processing is completed on the controller according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Automated Movie Capture</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The Incucyte S3 microscope moves to user defined locations of cell culture vessels, such as, but not limited to, 96-well plates, turns on the appropriate LED and captures movies at a desired speed using a desired microscope objective, such as, 3 frames per second (fps) using the 4&#xd7; objective.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to particular aspects of the present disclosure, the acquired data is stored in a compressed format, and from that movie a static &#x201c;Range&#x201d; image is generated. The range image is composed of pixels representing the minimum fluorescence intensity subtracted from the maximum fluorescence intensity at each pixel location over the complete scan period. Image segmentation is completed on the range image by optimizing multiple parameters, including: background subtraction (top-hat), defining the minimum cell width, fluorescence thresholding. Once objects are defined, an additional user-defined minimum burst intensity filter is used to further define a burst. Each object is typically a neuron, but neuronal parts can also be defined as objects, e.g. dendrites, axons and/or synapses, for example.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">From these segmented objects, the following data are derived from the 3 minute scan: 1) correlation&#x2014;a pairwise correlation analysis of all object traces over the scan period, 2) average object mean intensities&#x2014;the average of the mean intensities of all objects over the scan period, 3) burst duration&#x2014;the mean of all objects mean burst duration over the scan period, 5) burst rate&#x2014;the mean of all objects burst rate over the scan period, 6) burst strength&#x2014;the strength of each burst is calculated by dividing the area under the intensity curve divided by the duration of the burst. The overall burst strength metric is then the mean of all objects' mean burst strength over the scan period. Lastly the number of active objects is defined by the total number of active objects, i.e. segmented objects within the scan period. Optionally, all seven of these metrics, or a subset thereof, or one or more additional metrics alone or in combination, are calculated for each object, each well, or each set of wells, stored in a database, and displayed to the user shortly following data acquisition in the client computer through the graphical user interface.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Typically wells are scanned every 24 hours, although more or less frequent scanning is an option. Following each scan, metrics are calculated and stored, for instance in the database, at those time points. For example. over the course of a 30 day experiment, 30 time points are collected for each metric, are concatenated into a time series and can be graphed over the course of the full experimental time frame, i.e. hours, days, weeks, months.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">As described herein systems and methods of the present disclosure allow users to monitor the changes in neuronal network activity over long periods of time in an automated, moderate throughput way. By contrast, previous methods are: 1) end point methods (can only get one read of the various measured parameters), 2) extremely disruptive methods (calcium dyes versus using genetically encoded calcium indicators, 3) require a user to move cells out of the incubator for analysis/visualization, 4) not statistically relevant (due to making measurements from very few cells), 5) very manual (not automated), or 6) low throughput (one well at a time, manual).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to aspects of the present disclosure, neurons or neuron-like cells are genetically engineered to express a fluorescent protein, particularly, but not limited to, a calcium indicator protein GCaMP or a variant thereof, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jRCaMP1b and variants thereof, which emits Ca(2+)-dependent fluorescence in the red spectral band.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Embodiments of inventive compositions and methods are illustrated in the following examples.
