Vehicle <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of wheels <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Vehicle <b>1</b> comprises a drive system <b>24</b> for driving wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. As will be described in further detail herein, drive system <b>24</b> comprises a first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, a second electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, a third electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> and a differential <b>20</b>. Vehicle <b>1</b> also comprises vehicle control system <b>12</b>, motor control system <b>14</b> and an energy storage system <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Vehicle control system <b>12</b> may receive control inputs. For example, control inputs may include user inputs, such as throttle pedal inputs, brake pedal inputs, vehicle setting selections (such as the selection of a sport or economy mode, a launch control mode, or a level of traction control), or any other user inputs. Control inputs may also include other inputs, such as conditions sensed by the vehicle (e.g. external temperature, road condition, tyre condition, or current vehicle weight), or the level of available energy remaining in energy storage system <b>16</b>. Vehicle control unit may forward said control inputs onto motor control system <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Vehicle control system <b>12</b> may comprise a processor and a non-volatile memory. Vehicle control system <b>12</b> may comprise more than one processor and more than one memory. The memory stores a set of program instructions that are executable by the processor, and reference data such as look-up tables that can be referenced by the processor in response to those instructions. The processor may be configured to operate in accordance with a computer program stored in non-transitory form on a machine readable storage medium. The computer program may store instructions for causing the processor to perform the operations of vehicle control system <b>12</b> in the manner described herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Motor control system <b>14</b> may control each of the first, second and/or third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b>. Motor control system <b>14</b> may comprise one or more motor control units (MCUs). For example, motor control system may comprise a separate motor control unit (MCU) for controlling each of first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, second electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and third electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>3</b>. Each motor control unit (MCU) may receive control inputs for processing in order to determine appropriate control outputs for the respective electric drive motor that it controls. For example, a motor control unit may receive a torque demand from vehicle control system <b>12</b> (e.g. the torque demand being based on a measured throttle pedal position), calculate a control output for the electric drive motor it controls in dependence on the torque demand, and send the calculated control output to that electric drive motor so as to respond to the torque demand.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Motor control system <b>14</b> may comprise a processor and a non-volatile memory. Motor control system <b>14</b> may comprise more than one processor and more than one memory. The memory stores a set of program instructions that are executable by the processor, and reference data such as look-up tables that can be referenced by the processor in response to those instructions. The processor may be configured to operate in accordance with a computer program stored in non-transitory form on a machine readable storage medium. The computer program may store instructions for causing the processor to perform the operations of motor control system <b>14</b> in the manner described herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Energy storage system <b>16</b> may be configured to store electrical energy. For example, energy storage system <b>16</b> may comprise one or more batteries, supercapacitors and/or fuel cells. The motor control system <b>14</b> is connected to the energy storage system <b>16</b> to draw electrical energy from the energy storage system <b>16</b> to power each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b>. Each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> are configured to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Typically, electric motors operate through the interaction between a magnetic field and an electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of rotation of a shaft.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be multi-phase (e.g. two-phase, three-phase or higher) electric drive motors. The first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) electric drive motors. The first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> need not be identical, and so one or more of those drive motors may be alternating current (AC) electric drive motors whilst the other(s) are direct current (DC) electric drive motors. The energy storage system <b>16</b> may output electrical energy in the form of direct current (DC) electricity. Therefore, in the case where one or more of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> are alternating current (AC) electric drive motors, the motor control system <b>14</b> may convert the electrical energy output from the energy storage system <b>16</b> to a form that can be used to power those electric drive motor. The motor control system <b>14</b> may comprise one or more DC/AC converters. The motor control system <b>14</b> may convert DC to three-phase AC.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is to be understood that electrical energy may also be returned to the energy storage system <b>16</b> when the first, second and/or third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> are acting as generators.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an example, wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>are front wheels, and wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are rear wheels. In this example, vehicle <b>1</b> may be referred to as a rear-wheel drive vehicle. In another example, wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>are rear wheels, and wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are front wheels. In this example, vehicle <b>1</b> may be referred to as a front-wheel drive vehicle. In both examples, wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to a non-driven axle. A non-driven axle may passively rotate when motion of the vehicle on a drive surface causes a wheel coupled to that non-driven axle to rotate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is to be understood that the principles described herein need not be applied to a rear-wheel drive vehicle or a front-wheel drive vehicle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the principles described herein can be applied to all-wheel drive vehicles having two driven axles. In an example, wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>may also be driven by a drive system having the same architecture as drive system <b>24</b>. In another example, wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>may be driven by a drive system having a different architecture&#x2014;such as a drive system comprising a single electric drive motor configured to drive both wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, or a drive system comprising first and second electric drive motors configured to drive wheels <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is to be understood that the principles described herein need not be applied to a vehicle comprising four wheels as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some examples, the vehicle may comprise fewer than four wheels. For example, the vehicle may be a motorcycle comprising three wheels. In some examples, the vehicle may comprise more than four wheels and/or more than two axles. For example, the vehicle may be a lorry.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is to be understood that the principles described herein need not be applied to an electric vehicle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

A first axle half-shaft (e.g. axle half-shaft <b>28</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be configured to transfer drive along the first drive path <b>32</b><i>a </i>from the differential <b>20</b> to wheel <b>4</b><i>a</i>.

It is to be understood that a skilled person would have no difficulty implementing, on instruction, a differential having the functionality described herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Arranging the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> of drive system <b>24</b> in this way is advantageous because it enables large amounts of torque to be delivered to wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, whilst also enabling motor control system <b>14</b> to exert fine control over the torque applied to each of wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. For example, drive system <b>24</b> enables motor control system <b>14</b> to perform torque vectoring by using second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> to apply different torques to each of wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>respectively. This can significantly improve the handling of vehicle <b>1</b>. Another advantage of this arrangement is that, in the event of a fault or failure of any one of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and/or <b>26</b>-<b>3</b>, both of wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>can be driven by the remaining two motors.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may have the same properties. That is, each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be capable of delivering the same torque. Alternatively, the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may not have the same properties. For example, the first electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be capable of delivering greater torques so as to provide the majority of the drive to wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>&#x2014;whilst the second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be capable of delivering lesser torques, and may be primarily used for applying torque adjustments to each of wheels <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, respectively (e.g. during torque vectoring, as described herein).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, vehicle <b>1</b> has a maximum speed. For example, the maximum speed of vehicle <b>1</b> may be electronically limited to a predefined maximum speed. This may be a speed below a threshold speed at which vehicle <b>1</b> becomes unstable. Each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> are configured to provide drive up to the maximum speed of vehicle <b>1</b>. That is, each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> are configured to provide drive across the full speed range of vehicle <b>1</b> (i.e. from stationary to the maximum speed of vehicle <b>1</b>, in both the forward and reverse directions).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As such, drive system <b>24</b> may not comprise a disengagement mechanism for disengaging the first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> from input drive shaft <b>27</b>. An example of a typical disengagement mechanism is a clutch (e.g. a mechanical clutch). That is, in normal use, first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may remain continually mechanically engaged with input drive shaft <b>27</b>. Put another way, the first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be directly coupled to input drive shaft <b>27</b>, or may be connected to a gearing between the input drive shaft <b>27</b> and first electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, the gearing having an appropriate fixed (e.g. single speed) gear ratio.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Drive system <b>24</b> may not comprise a disengagement mechanism for disengaging the second electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> from first axle half-shaft <b>28</b><i>a</i>.

In other words, no disengagement mechanism may be present along the first drive path <b>32</b><i>a </i>between the second electric drive motor <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and wheel <b>4</b><i>a</i>.

This increases the efficiency of drive system <b>24</b>&#x2014;e.g. relative to a drive system having a plurality of electric drive motors but where each electric drive motor is only capable of providing drive within a sub-range of the vehicle's full speed range, and thus must be disengaged from the driven axle outside that sub-range (e.g. using a clutch). In addition, the absence of a disengagement mechanism (e.g. a clutch) associated with each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b>&#x2014;made possible by configuring each of the electric drive motors to provide drive across the full speed range of vehicle <b>1</b>&#x2014;reduces the weight of drive system <b>24</b>. Desirable vehicle performance benefits (e.g. greater acceleration, greater top speed, and greater range) can be achieved by reducing the weight of drive system <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be understood that the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be disconnected from their shafts during maintenance of the vehicle by detaching the mechanical connection between each electric drive motor and its respective shaft. However, when the vehicle is capable of being used for normal use each of the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> cannot be disengaged from driving its respective shaft.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> may be packaged together with differential <b>20</b>. That is, the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> and differential <b>20</b> may be included within the same physical container. This can advantageously reduce the weight of the drive system <b>24</b> for a vehicle, relative to a drive system in which the electric drive motors and the differential are individually (e.g. separately) packaged in multiple physical containers. First, less packaging material (e.g. magnesium or aluminium) can be used and therefore weight can be saved by virtue of having a single physical container, rather than multiple physical containers. Second, weight can be saved by using the same cooling circuit (e.g. radiators, cooling fluids, common sections of piping etc.) for the first, second and third electric drive motors <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>3</b> and differential <b>20</b>&#x2014;rather than requiring each component to have its own cooling circuit.
