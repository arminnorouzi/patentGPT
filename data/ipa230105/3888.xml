More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a system for generating three-dimensional imagery in underwater environments at video rates.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The ability to detect objects underwater is exceedingly difficult due to the varied environmental conditions encountered. Despite the difficulty, there are numerous applications where underwater imagery is beneficial in both commercial and military applications. Some examples include locating sunken vessels, monitoring underwater pipes and cables, inspecting the hull or propeller of a vessel, or analyzing underwater structures such as oil rigs or maritime wind turbines.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of further illustration, many active and former military installations have ranges and training areas that include adjacent water environments such as ponds, lakes, rivers, estuaries, and coastal ocean areas. Most munitions operate properly, but historical records indicate that up to 10% of all munitions fail to detonate as designed. Due to the technical challenges created by the water medium, unexploded ordinance (UXO) detection technologies and, therefore, the cleanup of these sites have lagged technologies and cleanup on land, especially with respect to ordnance buried beneath the seabed. Although difficult, cleanup of underwater sites is among DoD priorities for environmental programs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ordnance can take many forms but is often artillery shells that are buried to varying depths beneath the seabed. Underwater UXO sites may consist of various water salinity/depths and bottom compositions, littered with buried and unburied unexploded ordnance as well as debris fields arrayed according to patterns that developed by the long term use of the training sites (target areas, extent of flight, etc.). In deeper water, most UXO will be found on the bottom or buried just below the seabed, where the bottom is composed of deep layers of mud or fine silt, gravitational burial may be expected. Where the seafloor has little sediment, the UXOs are often bio-fouled with corals and algae, making them appear similar in color to the bottom.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typical ordnance at underwater sites can take many shapes and sizes, and reside in a variety of environmental conditions. Ordnance landing in shallow water may bury on impact to varying depths, depending on angle of impact; soil type; speed of aircraft and impact; height of release and shape. In deeper water most UXO will be found on the bottom or buried just below the seabed due to scouring effects caused by hydraulic forces. Where the bottom is composed of deep layers of mud or fine silt, gravitational burial may be expected. In many cases, burial can be modeled and predicted with some accuracy using tools such as the &#x201c;adapted&#x201d; VORTEX model and that knowledge exploited. Underwater sites, therefore, may consist of various water salinity, depths and bottom compositions, littered with buried and unburied unexploded ordnance as well as debris fields arrayed according to patterns that developed by the long term use of the training sites (target areas, extent of flight, etc.).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to identifying and manipulating UXO, there are other missions for which 3D underwater imaging is beneficial. These include, but are not limited to: undersea pipeline and cable assessment and repair, ship-hull inspection, underwater structure inspection, underwater archaeology, and identification of navigational hazards.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is a fast, efficient means for detecting and inspecting underwater structures and objects of interest amongst other objects or targets that need to be detected. In one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide technology to accomplish precise three dimensional (3D) imaging both in air and underwater, day and night. The system can provide millimeter-scale range resolution across a wide field with high spatial resolution, and is able to accomplish the same in the perpetual darkness of the deep ocean. The present disclosure overcomes some of the previous challenges and drawbacks associated with other methods: point-cloud lidar systems that are too slow, stereo imaging methods that are too computationally onerous (due to solving the image correspondence problem for scatter-blurred images), and other LIDAR offerings that are too immature. Lidar refers to laser imaging, detection, and ranging. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a Large-field, In-water Video for Enhanced Situational-awareness with Imagery Generated in High-resolution, Three-dimensional (LIVESIGHT) system uses laser light at water-penetrating wavelengths and a single imaging aperture to eliminate the correspondence problem. The present system can provide a 3-dimensional imaging capability to support robotic manipulation of threat objects, UXO, or other items of interest from a (potentially moving/drifting) unmanned underwater system (UUS). In one example the present system can provide imaging in a 720p or denser video format over a field of view of 50 degrees&#xd7;80 degrees, with millimeter-scale range resolution, over a 0.5-1 meter depth of field, at depths of up to 1000 feet. The 3D images are rendered at a rate of 10 Hz or faster at full pixel density, with latency&#x3c;0.1 seconds.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to undersea applications, the method of this disclosure can be applied to through-air or through-vacuum 3D imaging where more-conventional methods may not be available or precise enough.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the present system can: 1. Use a single camera, so the system is not susceptible to the video-correspondence problem of parallax-based stereo imaging, where the correspondence problem is especially problematic in the ocean scattering medium, where edges appear blurred. 2. Use laser illumination, so the system can operate in the 24/7 darkness of the deep ocean; 3. Capture the entire image with just two laser shots acquired over microseconds, and render 3D imagery very quickly. This makes it far superior to point-cloud LIDARs that require many laser shots to build up a 3D image, impractical for low-latency mega-pixel imaging at 10 Hz or faster. 4. Acquire images quickly to make 3D imaging robust versus system pitch, roll, yaw, and drift. This is important, due to limitations of underwater station keeping from a compact UUS. 5. Conventional timed Lidars would need picosecond time resolution to achieve mm-scale range resolution, requiring acquiring many frames with picosecond timing. The system of the present disclosure can provide mm-scale range resolution with nanosecond timing, a thousand times slower (and easier/cheaper).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present disclosure the imaging system and method offers the potential for observing the shape of objects or other targets on the bottom (or in another location in the water column), indicators of the objects such as scour pits, and bottom features. Because the present system is implemented with a range-gated ICMOS (Intensified CMOS) camera, the large array size (e.g.: 1024&#xd7;773) provides detailed information on the 3D shape of objects. However, other range-gated technologies, such as ICCD (Intensified CCD cameras) would also work as imaging sensors. The imaging resolution capability and range maps are insensitive to non-uniform target reflectance and inhomogeneity of the illumination source, though very dark objects yield noisy range images. In one example, objects are clearly defined in the imagery that would not be distinguishable in a conventional Lidar approach. This is because for a conventional imaging Lidar to achieve similar range resolution would require digitization at a sampling rate exceeding 10 GHz, beyond the capabilities of current technology.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect of an embodiment, the present system employs a range-gated Lidar, which registers all pixels simultaneously, thereby reducing image distortion, minimizing software complexity, and improving energy efficiency, enabling deeper penetration. The present technique collects fine-resolution imagery in all three spatial dimensions without requiring high-speed temporal sampling (GHz or faster). The distances are computed from pairs of range-gated Lidar returns collected with gates much wider than the size of the object being imaged. Despite the thickness of the range gates, the present system achieves precise range resolution by exploiting the temporal shape of the gated-imager response&#x2014;the way the gates ramp up and down as the camera is turned on and off in synchrony with the laser pulse, using the nonlinear shape r(t) of the response curve. The gating response curve is due to the combined effects of the laser temporal pulse shape and the Lidar receiver on/off switching and time constants. A pair of images collected to place the target at different places on the response curve is processed to separate reflectance from range and render an image of ranges to target across the entire image.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide an underwater imaging system comprising: a submersible platform; a first laser source to generate a first laser beam pulse, and a second laser beam pulse generated by one of (i) the first laser source and (ii) a second laser source; wherein the laser source is carried by the submersible platform and the first and second laser beams are generated when the submersible platform is underwater; a gating module in operative communication with the laser source to create a first gate and a second gate, wherein the first gate overlaps the second gate to define an overlap region; an image sensor in operative communication with the gating module to capture a first image at the first gate and a second image at the second gate; a processor to determine whether an object illuminated by one or both of the first laser beam pulse and the second laser beam pulse is within the overlap region and generate a three dimensional (3D) representation of the object in the overlap region.

This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may provide an image intensifier coupled to the image sensor, wherein the image intensifier is in electrical communication with the gating module to control exposure time of the image sensor, wherein operation of the image intensifier to control exposure time of the sensor is independent from a different exposure control within the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may provide relay optics that define couplings to couple the image intensifier with a focal plane array of the image sensor.

The relay optics provide a coupling to match the image intensifier output size to the focal plane array dimensions. The coupling may be 1:1, or it may be &#x3e;1:1 if the image intensifier output is larger than the focal plane, or it may be &#x3c;1:1 if the image intensifier is smaller than the focal plane.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This exemplary embodiment or another exemplary embodiment may provide a beam former carried by the submersible platform, wherein the first laser beam and the second laser beam sequentially exit the submersible platform through the beam former.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide an underwater imaging system which is carried by a submersible platform to capture images that are processed into three-dimensional images stitched together to create a 3D dimensional video at video rate speeds that are transmitted to a control unit above the surface of the water.

In one particular embodiment, platform <b>12</b> is an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) that has an autonomous reacquisition manipulator system (ARMS). The ARMS on the platform <b>12</b> can include a variety of extending members or implements that are dexterous to manipulate items in the water column or below the water surface <b>14</b> or on the seabed <b>16</b>. The platform <b>12</b> may include an electric tether <b>18</b> that extends out of the water above the water surface <b>14</b> to a control module <b>20</b> that may be positioned remote from the platform <b>12</b>.

The object <b>21</b> is 3D imaged by imaging system <b>10</b> in accordance with the methods described herein to achieve the various advantages within the parameters provided herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a schematic view of the imaging system <b>10</b> on platform <b>12</b> that in one example is an underwater remotely operated vehicle. Imaging system <b>10</b> is housed within a sensor containment unit <b>22</b>. Sensor containment unit <b>22</b> may be a relatively rigid structure defined by a plurality of walls configured to be mounted or supported by the platform <b>12</b>. Containment unit <b>22</b> may include a first end <b>24</b> opposite a second end <b>26</b>. The first end <b>24</b> is oriented in a manner such that it faces outwardly and away from the platform <b>12</b>. In one particular embodiment, the first end <b>24</b> of containment unit <b>22</b> defines a first opening <b>28</b> and a second opening <b>30</b>. The first opening <b>28</b> defines a laser beam exit port and the second opening <b>30</b> defines an imaging window or aperture through which the camera views the laser pulses exiting from the first opening <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Within the sensor containment unit <b>22</b>, there is a laser beam generator or source that is configured to produce two sequential laser beams to be transmitted out of the first opening <b>28</b>. In one particular embodiment, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is a first laser beam source or generator <b>32</b> and a second laser beam source or generator <b>34</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the first and second laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are configured to rapidly transmit sequential laser beams or pulses to be transmitted out of the first opening <b>28</b> in a short time-spaced sequential manner. Although two laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are depicted herein, it is entirely possible, if a single laser source can be recharged quickly enough, to fire two laser beams in rapid succession using only a single source. Thus, while two laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are depicted, a single source is entirely possible so long as two laser beams are transmitted out of the first opening <b>28</b>. When two laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are utilized, it is envisioned that in one embodiment they will be vertically stacked in order to save space within the containment unit <b>22</b>. Thus, while the first laser source <b>32</b> and the second laser source <b>34</b> are shown as arranged side by side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, other configurations are possible that would enable space-saving constraints. As will be shown in greater detail below, the first laser source <b>32</b> and the second laser source <b>34</b> are optically connected to a beam shaper and combiner <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) such that the laser beams generated from each respective source originate from the same location upon exiting the first opening <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> (or a single laser source as the case may be) in this example meets the ranging requirements of 0.01 m over a 0.5-m depth of field at 1.25 meter range, the signal-noise-ration (SNR) is greater than 30/pixel/image for each of 2 images. This results in greater than 900 photo-electrons. The Minimum Laser energy per image is 7 mJ (for each of 2 lasers). For a 10 Hz 3D update rate, there needs to be at least 0.07 Watts per pulse. The 0.07 Watts divided by the Repetition rate equals the required pulse energy. For 20 Hz update rate, the required pulse energy is 0.035 mJ/pulse. One exemplary laser that meets these requirements is the Quantel Viron that has dimensions of 195 mm&#xd7;89 mm&#xd7;59 mm and a 25 mJ/pulse at 20 Hz. Other lasers are possible as laser/imaging technology advances that could be used in lieu of a Quantel Viron laser that are able to exceed these specifications.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, adjacent the laser source or laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, is a single camera <b>38</b>.

Aspects of the camera will be described in greater detail herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the camera <b>38</b> are electrically coupled to a sensor controller <b>40</b> via transmission lines. Namely, a signal transmission line <b>42</b>A electrically couples the first laser source <b>32</b> with the sensor controller <b>40</b>. A second line <b>42</b>B electrically couples the second laser source <b>34</b> to the sensor controller <b>40</b>. A third line <b>42</b>C electrically couples the camera <b>38</b> to the sensor controller <b>40</b>. Transmission lines <b>42</b>A-<b>42</b>C may be any mechanism or device capable of electrically transmitting signals between respective devices. Thus, the lines <b>42</b>A-<b>42</b>C may be any wired or wireless connection capable of transmitting electrical signals between the respective elements.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Sensor controller <b>40</b> is electrically coupled with a timing generator <b>44</b> via transmission line <b>42</b>D. Collectively, the sensor controller <b>40</b> and the timing generator <b>44</b> define a gating module that is adapted to adjust the exposure time on the camera and synchronize the sequential generation of the first laser beam from the first laser source <b>32</b> and the second laser beam from the second laser source <b>34</b>. The sensor controller <b>40</b> is additionally connected with the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) platform system controller <b>46</b> via line <b>42</b>E.

The platform processor <b>50</b> is located externally from the containment unit <b>22</b> but is otherwise still carried by and disposed on the platform <b>12</b>. The containment unit <b>22</b> may further house a power distribution assembly (PDA) <b>52</b> that is electrically connected via line <b>42</b>H with the platform PDA <b>54</b> that is located externally from containment unit <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As is common on underwater platforms, platform <b>12</b> may include additional electronics such as the robotic manipulator <b>56</b>, which is electrically connected with the ARMS, other electronics <b>58</b> and the platform data storage unit (DSU) <b>60</b>. Collectively, the processed images from the image processor <b>48</b> being sent to the ROV processor <b>50</b> may be transmitted along with other signals from the underwater platform through the tether cable <b>18</b> up to above the water surface <b>14</b> to the central control <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically depicts a portion of the imaging system <b>10</b> to further identify the elements of the laser and camera systems.

The first laser source <b>32</b> and the second laser source <b>34</b> are each optically coupled with a beam shaper or beam combiner <b>36</b>. A laser relay <b>62</b> electrically couples each of the laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to the beam shaper and combiner <b>36</b>. The beam shaper and combiner <b>36</b> ensures that the laser beams generated from the respective sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are output from first opening <b>28</b> from the same location sequentially one after another. The beam shaper and combiner <b>36</b> may be coupled via laser relay <b>64</b> to a laser beam diverger <b>66</b>. The diverger <b>66</b> directs the first and second laser beams out through the opening <b>28</b> through a hemispherical dome <b>68</b> to generate a laser broadcast pattern <b>70</b>.

One exemplary camera <b>38</b> or sensor that is able to meet or exceed these specifications is a PIV camera, however other cameras or sensors are possible as imaging technology advances that could be used in lieu of a PIV camera that and be able to exceed these specifications. The camera, regardless of whether it is a PIV camera <b>38</b> or another future camera, should be greater than 12 bits, have a large focal plane (14 mm&#xd7;16 mm or greater), and be greater than 10 Hz double-frame rate (i.e., 2 frames capture within 1 ms separation).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The image intensifier <b>76</b> should meet or exceed the following specifications. One exemplary image intensifier <b>76</b> or image logic that is able to meet or exceed these specifications is commercially available for sale by Hamamatsu, Model No. C9647-01 having a 25 mm InGaAsP photocathode, however image intensifiers or image logic are possible as imaging technology advances that could be used in lieu of a Hamamatsu, Model No. C9647-01 having a 25 mm InGaAsP photocathode that will be able to exceed these specifications. The image intensifier or image logic, regardless of whether it is a Hamamatsu, Model No. C9647-01 having a 25 mm InGaAsP photocathode or another future image intensifier, should be able to be coupled with the focal plane array of the camera or sensor, typically in a 1:1 coupling (described in greater detail herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), however other couplings are possible.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one particular embodiment, the image intensifier is where the gating occurs. The image intensifier <b>76</b> is where the exposure is turned on and turned off. The camera <b>38</b> has independent exposure that may be turned on and off but typically not at the rate at which is needed for this system. This system <b>10</b> needs exposure times on the nanosecond level. Typically, the independent camera can only turn on and turn off exposure on the microsecond level.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The focal plane array (FPA) <b>72</b> should meet or exceed the following specifications.

The lens in one example should meet or exceed the following specifications of an f-number of f/2.3. In one instantiation, the focal length of the lens is 12 mm and the clear diameter is 5.2 mm. Other lens are possible as lens technology advances that could be used in lieu of the lens described herein, however it is envisioned that these specifications should at least be a minimal threshold.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pixel size in one example should be at least 6.5 microns, 2560&#xd7;2160.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are stacked on top of each other and the beam combiner <b>36</b> is positioned closely adjacent the first end <b>24</b> of containment unit <b>22</b>. The diverger <b>66</b> is closely adjacent first opening <b>28</b> that is covered by hemispherical dome <b>68</b> that collectively define a beam projector. When viewed from above, the camera <b>38</b> is offset to the right of the lasers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a first end elevation view of the containment unit <b>22</b>. When viewed from the first end, it is seen that the first aperture <b>28</b> covered by dome <b>68</b> is offset slightly vertically above the opening <b>30</b> covered by dome <b>80</b>. Although the first opening <b>28</b> is offset slightly above second opening <b>30</b>, other locations are entirely possible. Ideally, the distance between transmitter and receiver outputs would be made as small as practical while minimizing the total volume the system. The offset in this example is an artifact of the polarization-based beam combiner optics. The beam combiner requires the combined output to be in front of either first laser <b>32</b> or second laser <b>34</b>. With the two lasers stacked, and then packaged with the receiver assembly as compactly as possible, an offset between transmitter and receiver output windows was inevitable. In a different example, with a single double-pulsed laser doing the work of the two single-pulsed lasers, the windows would not need to be offset.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> schematically depicts the orientation and size alignment of the relay optics <b>74</b> relative to the focal plane array <b>72</b>. Focal plane array <b>72</b> in one example has an area that is approximately 16 millimeters by 14 millimeters with a 21.8 millimeter diagonal. The relay optics <b>74</b> are generally circular in cross section and in one example having a 25 millimeter diameter. The first circular dash line <b>84</b> in this example represents a 21.8 millimeter diameter circle within which intensified images or signals from the image intensifier <b>76</b> move through the relay optics onto the focal plane array <b>72</b>. The second dashed circular line <b>86</b> in this example represents a 19.8 millimeter diameter that the relay optics may be shrunken or narrowed to better focus the intensified image signals onto the focal plane array <b>72</b>. This process is known as binning. If the binning process occurs, the focal plane area may be reduced to a smaller subset for image processing on the focal plane array <b>72</b> as identified by box <b>88</b>, which in this example has a width of 16.6 millimeters by a height of 9.4 millimeters to result in a 19.8 millimeter diagonal such that all the intensified images are captured by the focal plane array <b>72</b> within box <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The larger circular dash line <b>84</b> represents the image intensifier's optical area. The larger circle circumscribes the image intensifier's focal plane array as a whole. In this example this is 21.8 millimeters diagonal. In order to use the full focal plane, no tapering is necessary because there is complexity without gaining much sensitivity. A coupling or coupler takes the area down to whatever is needed on the focal plane array.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a one-to-one coupling or coupler may be any coupler that couples the two optical objects together. In one particular embodiment, the optical coupling may be a lens and another embodiment the optical coupling may be a fiber- optic cable. A lens relay will be more optically efficient but would occupy more space. Inasmuch as this coupler device needs to be relatively small, a fiber-optic cable may be more beneficial is some situations where space constraints are a priority. Thus, an optical lens may be used when there is enough volume and when there is not, a fiber-optic relay will be used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term one-to-one coupling refers to a one-to-one ratio of transferring data or optical images. The image intensifier takes the light and converts it to electrons. The electrons are multiplied and then converted back to light again. The light exiting the image intensifier needs to be taken to the focal plane. As said previously, it can be taken by a coupler. In some instances, the focal plane may not be the same size as the exit port of the image intensifier. Thus one-to-one refers when the image output is not modified or shrunken or expanded relative to the image that is provided to the focal plane array. However, other embodiments would be entirely possible with a tapered fiber bundle that would narrow or reduce the optical image output from the image intensifier to the focal plane array. For example, a scenario is possible where the output of the image intensifier is approximately 25 millimeters and the focal plane array is 5 millimeters. In this scenario, the output of the image intensifier will need to be reduced to focus the light onto the focal plane array.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> schematically depicts the operation of system <b>10</b>. The schematics of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> only show the first laser source <b>32</b>, the second laser source <b>34</b>, and the camera <b>38</b>; however, it is to be understood that the other features described herein work in conjunction with these elements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> represents that two pulsed sources of laser beams exit the beam combiner within the laser broadcast pattern <b>70</b> sequentially one after another in very close in time. The gating module defined by the sensor controller <b>40</b> and the timing generator <b>44</b> work in conjunction with the camera <b>38</b> to establish a first gate <b>90</b> and a second gate <b>92</b> to thereby define an overlap region <b>94</b>. Typically, the first gate <b>90</b> is equivalent to a distance from about 1 meter to about 3 meters from the camera <b>38</b>. The second gate <b>92</b> is generally equal to a distance from about 2 meters to about 4 meters from the camera <b>38</b>. Thus, the overlap region <b>94</b> is a distance from about 2 meters to about 3 meters away from the camera <b>38</b>. When the object <b>21</b> is within the overlap region, it is captured by both images. Namely, a first image is captured of the first laser beam within the first gate <b>90</b> and a second sequential image is captured with the second laser beam at the second gate <b>92</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, when an object appears in the overlap region <b>94</b>, it will reveal itself in both images. These images are then processed using 3D formation techniques to reveal the three-dimensional shape of object <b>21</b> within the overlap region <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To accomplish 3D imaging in the ocean, generally the following imaging parameters are used according to one example. The range resolution (FHWM) in one example should be less than 0.1 m for a target at a range of 3 m and the FHWM should be less than 0.01 m for a target at a range of 1.25 m. The depth of field threshold in one example is in a range from 0.75 m to 1.25 m with an objective being 0.5 m to 1.25 m. In one embodiment, it may be useful to have an adjustable depth of field from 0.5 m to 3 m from the sensor (i.e., camera <b>38</b>). The 2D sample distance (GSD) threshold in one example should be less than 2.9 mm in depth of field (for 720p resolution) and the objective being less than 1.9 mm in depth of field (for 1080p resolution). The Horizontal sample distance threshold should have a goal of being 30% contrast within GSD. The instantaneous field of view in one example should be greater than 3 m&#xd7;5 m at a range of 3 m to the target and should be 1 m&#xd7;1.67 m at a range of 1 m to the target. The angular instantaneous field of view in one example should be greater than 80&#xb0; wide&#xd7;50&#xb0; height (1.4 radians&#xd7;0.9 radians). The update rate threshold in one example should be greater than 10 Hz with the objective update rate being 24 Hz. The target reflectance (Lambertian) threshold should be 30% with the objective being 10%. The Latency threshold in one example should be 0.1 second from time of light received to time video frame sent to the system processor.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The following presents exemplary processing requirements for the 3D-shape formulation. The present disclosure alternates gate delays between odd and even shots. The shot separations are only a few microseconds but may be up to one millisecond. Then, the system sets the difference in gate delay times to be optimum for required DoF (&#x2dc;0.5 m). The delay time difference is on the order of nanoseconds. The gate width is on the order of 2&#xd7; delay-time difference.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The system <b>10</b> or operator of the system advances the first and second gates so that the object <b>21</b> of interest is bright in both gates, preferably in the overlap region <b>94</b>. Then, the system selects flattening files for the range of interest. Also, the system selects a 3D look-up table for the range of interest. The look-up table size in one example is about 921,600&#xd7;(3 m&#x2212;0.5 m)/0.01 m*2 bytes, which is about 461 Megabytes.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For each PIV-mode shot there is captured 2 images. In this example the Bin each on chip is 2&#xd7;2, and then ROI to 720&#xd7;1280 is 921,600 pixels. The system subtract dark pixels and divides by flat pixels. This results in about 3.7 Million floating operations (3.7 GFLOPS). Then, the system divides Even Images by Odd images, with error correction. This results in about 4.6 Million floating operations (4.6 GFLOPS). The system then applies ratio-to-range look-up table at 64 operations per pixel for about 59 Million floating operations (59 GFLOPS). This high number of floating operations are maximums based on upper bound requirements. However, the system may implement framing to reduce the number of GFLOPS. Framing at 10 Hz results in about 1.35 GFLOPS and framing at 20 Hz results in 2.7 GFLOPS.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Regarding timing of the laser pulse, one exemplary embodiment utilizes a Gaussian pulse with FWHM of about 12 ns which is about 2.7 meters. The gates should be shorter than laser pulse FWHM, namely, from about 6 ns to about 12 ns. The two gates will be separated by an amount equal their &#xbd; width, which is a total of about 1 gate width. The range to target of about 1.25 m equals about 11.1 ns round-trip laser travel time. For the closest point of about 0.75 m, this results in about 6.7 ns round-trip laser travel time.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one example, the first gate <b>90</b> (i.e., Gate 1) is 6 ns wide, starts in time to hit full sensitivity in about 3 ns after light-out from laser. The second gate <b>92</b> (i.e., Gate 2) is 6 ns wide and starts 6 ns later. The gated return pulse looks Gaussian, with FWHM or about 16 ns.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Having explained the configuration and parameters of system <b>10</b>, reference is now made to its operation and various features. The present disclosure relates to a robotic vision system that can perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging precisely enough that a robotic manipulator could perform a function based on the 3D image. One exemplary task that the 3D image could be used to accomplish would be to defuse an underwater mine. The robotic manipulator is typically carried by an underwater vehicle that may be manned or unmanned. One exemplary manipulator is an autonomous reacquisition manipulator system (ARMS). The ARM system is an underwater robotic system having a compact, highly maneuverable, stable unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) with a dual-manipulator system that enable reacquisition and mitigation of underwater explosive hazards by providing personnel the capability to remotely access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize or move/remove underwater mines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or objects <b>21</b> from a safe distance. To perform the manipulations, the ARMS device needs an imaging system so that an operator operating the manipulators can view the underwater mine or IED or object <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">To perform the 3D imaging underwater, which can be a scattered and/or turbid medium, there are choices that can be made to accomplish the 3D imaging. One exemplary possibility is a 2-camera system that takes images in parallax. However, parallax image processing comes with some problems associated with correspondence problems that are very complicated in a scattering medium, such as ocean water where everything is blurred. Thus, there continues to be a need for an underwater 3D imaging system that does not rely on a two-camera system in order to obviate or eliminate or reduce the parallax problem associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another exemplary attempt for underwater 3D imaging may be a LiDAR-based system. However, conventional LiDAR systems do not operate at the processing speeds required to achieve the need of providing a rapid rate 3D imaging feed achieved by the solution of the present disclosure. Namely, the present disclosure seeks to provide a solution for providing 3D images at video rate in a turbid and scattering underwater environment that may be dark due to extreme depths nearing a thousand feet deep. Video rate able to be achieved by the present disclosure is at least about 20 Hz, and preferably about 30 Hz. For 1080p, the video data standard frame rate is about 8 Mbps and the video data high frame rate is about 12 Mbps. For 720p, the video data standard frame rate is about 5 Mbps and the video data high frame rate is about 7.5 Mbps. For 480p, the video data standard frame rate is about 2.5 Mbps and the video data high frame rate is about 4 Mbps. For 360p, the video data standard frame rate is about 1 Mbps and the video data high frame rate is about 1.5 Mbps.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">System <b>10</b> provides an imaging system for underwater vehicles or platform <b>12</b> that uses a single camera <b>38</b> to achieve a 3D image, thereby reducing or eliminating the parallax problem normally associated with 3D image processing. The system of the present disclosure uses a laser or a plurality of lasers modified with a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV camera) that allows the system to operate with at least one laser and only one camera. This allows the system to be a significantly more compact system. The PIV camera is configured to track particle flows in a turbid environment. The PIV camera is adapted to now perform 3D imaging in a manner that is now more precise than traditional stereoscopic cameras and in a fewer number of pictures and data than was previously possible with the same stereoscopic cameras or a LiDAR system at the desired video rate. The PIV camera is able to perform the 3D imaging more precisely than standard stereoscopic camera systems with many fewer pictures or less data than would if the 3D imaging process were attempted with a brute force tined LiDAR system.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The imaging system of the present disclosure requires that two laser beam pulses be generated and transmitted sequentially shortly one after the other (on the microsecond level). However, the generation of the two laser beams may be accomplished in a number of different ways. For example, there may be two separate laser generators having common output optics to transmit the beams. Alternatively, there could be a single laser generator that generates two different laser beams in rapid succession. Each scenario is possible provided that the overlap of the first gate <b>90</b> associated with the first laser beam and the second gate <b>92</b> associated with the second laser beam is achieved. The timing of the pulses occurs sequentially within microseconds of each other. For example, the first pulse may be fired at a first time and the second pulse fired sequentially thereafter at a second time that is in a range from 1 microsecond to about 5 or 10 microseconds after the first time. Sequential firing of the two pulses enables the PIV camera to gather the two different images at the two different times so the movement of the particles may be evaluated between the first captured image at the first time at the PIV camera <b>38</b> and the second captured image at the second time at the PIV camera <b>38</b>. The PIV camera <b>38</b> is gated to the lasers so that it frames when the first laser fires and frames again when the second laser fires. Essentially, it is one camera <b>38</b> taking two quick succession snapshots within a few microseconds of each other. These two images are stored or sent directly to a processor that may be in any location but is preferably on the underwater vehicle. However, it is entirely possible for the PIV-captured images to be sent to an above-surface processor because data rate is low enough compared to other 3D imaging systems to send the images over a tether or cable from the underwater device to an above-surface processing unit. Regardless of the processor's location, processing the captured PIV images to create a 3D image is relatively simply and the data rate is low. Data rate for this configuration and method is about the same as a conventional video data rate.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In operation and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the two lasers need to be pulsed or fired in order to illuminate a field of view <b>82</b>. PIV camera <b>38</b> is gate timed with the two pulses. The gate timing refers to the PIV camera only accepting light from a certain range of distances; for example, one meter to three meters away from the PIV camera <b>38</b>. This is accomplished through a gating module that is coupled with the sensor or camera <b>38</b> controller and timing generator or may be a part thereof. The gating module takes the Q-switch signal from the laser or some other equivalent signal from the laser that is indicative of when the laser fired and the gating module sets a timer that tells the camera to start the exposure at some time thereafter and to stop the exposure at another time thereafter that would equate to the range from the PIV camera <b>38</b> to the object <b>21</b>. So the gating module enables the PIV camera <b>38</b> to capture the first gate <b>90</b> corresponding to a distance from one meter to three meters from the PIV camera that is associated with the first laser pulse. For the second laser pulse, the gating module may start the exposure and end the exposure of the camera associated with the second laser pulse in the second gate <b>92</b> located at a distance from two meters to four meters from the PIV camera. This creates and overlap region <b>94</b> from two meters to three meters away from the PIV camera. When the object <b>21</b> is within the overlap region <b>94</b>, it may be detected in both images and the slight movement of the object between the two images can be processed for 3D imaging. The overlap area achieves very precise ranging. The overlap does not need to be one meter in distance, it could be larger or smaller. This would be a design choice of the application-specific needs of the operator. When the overlap is smaller, there is a higher sensitivity and when the overlap is larger, there is a lower sensitivity. The smaller the overlap region <b>94</b>, the most sensitivity the system needs to have in the receiver to overcome noise sources, such as dark noise or photon noise. Thus, the overlap region can be optimized based on the application-specific needs of the user; however, one envisioned overlap region may be about a meter in length.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In operation and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the target <b>21</b> is revealed or shown in the image of both the image associated with first gate <b>90</b> and the image associated with the second gate <b>92</b>. When the object <b>21</b> is shown in each of the gated images, there is a precise overlap region <b>94</b> to allow ranging and 3D imaging processing to be accomplished for the portions of the object that reveal themselves in each gated image. If the object is only revealed in one of the gate images, then the system <b>10</b> may adjust the distance and corresponding time for the gated image to achieve the capture of the object so that the 3D image may be processed at a video rate. The PIV camera <b>38</b> captures the first image, such as the gated first image, and then sequentially captures the second image, the gated second image. Those images are then transferred to a processor to accomplish the 3D calculations. The process of creating the 3D image from the two gated images may be accomplished by 3D imaging techniques.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, one exemplary system that incorporates the PIV camera <b>38</b> is distinguishable from previous uses of PIV cameras inasmuch as previous attempts used PIV cameras were on static systems often used in a controlled environment. One distinction about the example of the present disclosure is that the PIV camera is used on an underwater vehicle in a moving or dynamic environment. With the vehicle drifting under water due to currents, and even sometimes in an uncontrollable manner, the PIV camera <b>38</b> enables precise 3D imaging methods, processes, logic, or algorithms to generate a 3D video stream at a sufficiently low data rate based on the high-speed capture of images from the PIV camera <b>38</b> in order to guide the underwater vehicle. Because the vehicle or platform <b>12</b> is drifting and moving, the data for the 3D imaging must be obtained within microseconds in order to do the 3D processing at a video rate. If the system <b>10</b> waited too long or there was too much of a time period between the successive snapshots, then the errors due to the range changing based on platform movement/drift would become too large. Further, because the platform is drifting, a transmission rate in the video range is needed so that the two pictures and the motion of the platform, the roll, tilt, and yaw, and pitch, and translation of the objects relative to each other are largely not affected because the timeframes between the images is so short so as to not affect the imagery.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Regarding the operation of the gating module is part of the sensor controller that is operatively connected to the timing generator. Together, the sensor controller engaging module operate to image the target. The object <b>21</b> is located within the wide field of view, which must be wide. The term &#x201c;wide&#x201d; with referring to the field of view refers to a field of view greater than 45 degrees. In one particular embodiment, the field of view is in a range from about 50 degrees to about 90 degrees. In one specific example, the field of view is about 80 degrees. Typically, a wide field of view is difficult for precise 3D imaging for a significant depth of field. A significant depth of field in this instance refers to a depth of field that is in a range from about half a meter to about two meters. Accomplishing a wide field of view is typically very problematic and difficult for a stereoscopic system having two cameras. The present disclosure sought to solve this need by utilizing a single camera so that it can achieve the wide field of view needed for the present disclosure. However, the selected camera needs to be a very fast or very rapid camera that can obtain two-gated image in rapid succession. Thus, one exemplary camera of the present disclosure is the PIV camera. Wide field of view is achieved by a unique underwater lens system for both the laser and the camera. The wide field of view is accomplished through a hemispherical dome having a radius of curvature that centers the effective focal plane on the effective origin of the laser to not distort the laser or the camera.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation, when the lasers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are initiated, the clock from the timing generator begins. This must account for any timing delays in the laser. That clock then instructs the camera to start its exposure and it also sets when the intensifier turns on and when it turns off. Thus, the order of operations will be that the camera turns on, then the intensifier turns on, then the intensifier turns off, then the camera turns off. The laser clock is the master clock that controls the time from when those functions occur.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In operation, the sensor controller and timing generator, and included gating module, are in electrical communication with the laser sources <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the camera <b>38</b>. In addition to the gating function, the sensor controller and the timing generator are adjusting the camera exposure time. Additionally, the sensor controller and timing generator will be adjusting the gain of the camera. For example, the gain may need to be increased if there is a very turbid medium or very turbid underwater environment. Additionally, the sensor controller may adjust various power levels on the laser, to the extent that they are adjustable, depending on the turbidity of the medium. The power can be turned down if there is more light than expected or increased if the environment is darker than expected. The timing generator and sensor controller will also timestamp the lasers and the camera so that they are consistent with each other.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sensor controller and timing generator determines the time separation between the first image and the second image. The sensor controller and timing generator further determines when, or the time at which the images were taken, in conjunction with when the laser pulses were fired from the beam former. There also may be safety interlocks that are implemented in the sensor controller that could prevent the lasers from firing so as to not inadvertently fire the laser pulses at an undesired time. The image sensor processor is in electrical communication with the sensor controller. The processor is located on the sensor containment unit <b>22</b> and is electrically coupled to the processor on the remotely-operated vehicle or underwater platform. This image processor processes the obtained image from the camera to perform the 3D imagery creation on the underwater remotely-operated vehicle so that the effective 3D image stream at a video rate can be transferred to the ROV processor and transmitted through the tethered cable up to the operator located above the surface of the water.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The camera <b>38</b> obtains the first gated image and the second gated image in response to the instructions received by the sensor controller as to when to capture the photographs. The images are sent to the image processor at a relatively fast rate. In one example, the pair of images are sent twenty times per second. Each pair of images is processed to generate two additional images. Namely, a processed grayscale image to give the operator an image that is utilized to create a 3D range image. The 3D range image enables the operator to determine how far away the target is from the underwater vehicle. The image processor may also filter or clean any poor images or bad pixels. Then, the image processor performs calibrations or calibrates for an adjustment of the gain of the camera. Then, the 3D image processing may be completed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The image processor then transfers the black and white photograph as well as the 3D ranged photograph to the operator on the surface. In one particular embodiment, the image processor is electrically coupled with the ROV processor so that the two images are transferred through the ROV processor. However, it is entirely possible for the image processor to send the black and white image and the 3D range image directly to the operator thereby bypassing the ROV processor.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, the processing or image processor for processing the two images into the 3D range photograph or video stream may occur entirely on platform <b>12</b> and not need to be processed through the ROV processor. This enables the 3D images to be streamed at a video rate back to the controller or control module <b>20</b> located above the water's surface. An additional embodiment of system <b>10</b> may include an automated process or algorithm on the under water platform <b>12</b> that receives the processed 3D images from the imager as an input into a manipulator logic. The manipulator logic is part of the ARMS system that utilizes the 3D video stream or plurality of images from the image processor to determine how to manipulate the extending members or implements that are dexterous to manipulate items in an automatic manner in repose to the 3D video imagery obtained by system <b>10</b>. Particularly, the automated algorithm or process may also be embodied and executed through a processor on the platform <b>12</b> to manipulate or advance the dexterous arms or members towards the target or object <b>21</b> to manipulate said object in a desired manner.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The system <b>10</b> may also provide feedback to the ROV system controller. This is an advantage inasmuch as even if the camera is out of range for 3D imaging, if the object is in range of either of the two photographs, the sensor controller will be able to indicate to the ROV system controller that the ROV is approximately some distance relatively close to the object. Taking the previous distance example provided, it could indicate that the ROV is more than one meter away from the object but less than two meters away because the object would be detected in one of the images but not in the overlap region. This will allow the platform <b>12</b> or ROV operator to adjust how fast the platform <b>12</b> or ROV advances towards the target or object <b>21</b> until the object <b>21</b> appears in the overlap region <b>94</b> of both images so that the 3D imaging may begin to occur where the images are overlapped. Similarly, if the images indicate that the ROV is too close to the object <b>21</b>, which may be indicated by a high shadowing in the images, it could send instructions to the ROV system controller to back up or reverse direction so to space the ROV more appropriately from the object in order for 3D imaging to occur at the video rate when the object is in the overlap region.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As depicted in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the response of the optical system reflecting a laser pulse from a reflective surface is typically a bell-shaped curve, rising to a peak as the gate-start approaches the reflective object, then falling to zero as the gate-start moves past the object. The response may in some cases have a flattened top, depending on the gate width and the laser pulse shape and duration. The net system response is a function of the transmitted laser pulse temporal shape, the receiver gate duration, and the receiver gate turn-on and turn-off time constants. The laser pulse is typically emitted in a Gaussian manner, though other shapes, such as Lorentzian, log-normal, or others are also used. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the laser pulse duration is a 12 ns Gaussian, and the gate is a 12-ns-wide rectangular function, so that the net response is the bell-shaped curve depicted. In other embodiments, the gate response may not be a perfect rectangular function, but may have a ramp-up and ramp-down time, which will also contribute to the rounded edges of the net gated response. The X-axis of the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> represents a nominal round-trip time of flight (ToF) in nanoseconds of the start of a gate, relative to the ToF to the reflective surface for a delta-function impulse response, and the first Y-axis represents the intensity of the gated responses, and the second Y-axis represents the ratio of the first gate response to the second gate response over time in nanoseconds.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows the same example, but with the ratio of responses replaced by the contrast between the responses, with contrast defined as: Contrast=(Gate1&#x2212;Gate2 response)/(Gate1+Gate2 response). Both the ratio and the contrast depend strongly on distance to the reflective surface, and much less on the reflectance of the surface.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the first gate <b>90</b> and the second gate <b>92</b> are offset from each other in delay time, typically by one-half of the nominal gate width, though other non-zero offsets may be used, up to the full duration of a gate. Delay time is the duration between the time a laser pulse is emitted, and the time at which a gate is turned on to collect reflected light. Due to the finite speed of light, delay time corresponds to the distance to where the gate starts. As shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, since there is delay in timing, the portions of the response that are most strongly on the object, namely, the peaks of the first gate curve and the second curve, are also offset from each other, so that when the ratio of the curves is obtained, there is a significant range over which the ratio is monotonic versus Gate 1 delay. Stated otherwise, the ratio is proportional to the range over the monotonic region. The ratio curve is the range versus ratio curve for calibrating range versus ratio of the two images. The ratio is monotonic only in the gate-overlap region defined by the response both being bright enough, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> by a horizontal line showing a threshold in the gated responses. The threshold is chosen so that, when both responses exceed the threshold, there is enough signal to compute a range- from-ratio LUT, or a range-from-contrast LUT, or both LUTs. The threshold may also be adjusted to accommodate system noise or water backscatter interference</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The ratio line indicates that there is a monotonic relationship over about 35 nanoseconds between range and ratio in tis example. The algorithm takes the corrected images and divides one by another. This is the ratio of one image divided by another. The ratio of the two images, because they have been offset, is proportional to the range to target. The more linear this proportionality is, the easier it is to determine how far away things are. If it is not linear, then it is still able to be utilized via a look-up table (LUT) that gives the distance to the reflective surface for any value of the gate-response ratio. The LUT can be in the form of a numerical table or a continuous-function fit, such as a linear function or a polynomial. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>shows that the contrast also has a monotonic portion such that range is proportional to contrast, and for which a LUT can be computed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the image includes a bad pixel or a bad pixel map, these will be corrected. If there is dark noise that varies, the dark noise must be subtracted. Further, the gain may vary from pixel to pixel that needs flattened. Thus, the processing for each camera is to obtain the raw data, subtract the darks and divide by the flats. Then, black out the bad pixels. Then heel in the bad pixels with some heeling algorithms. This is performed for both pictures. Then, the ratio of the first picture to the second picture is obtained with a check to determine that both pictures are bright enough to use. If the ratio of the first image and the second image is linear over a period of time, then, report 3D ranges for those parts of the image that are bright enough to do 3D ranging.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">It will normally be the case that the water background is so dark that the range to the background is inconsequential and only the target object is of consequence for the 3D ranging. In very turbid water, the water background may be non-negligible, so that the gated-response threshold for computing range will be higher than in very clear water.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">With continued reference to the operation of the system of the present disclosure, to select the best delays for system <b>10</b> computations, proceed as follows: 1. Measure and plot a gain profile; 2. Convert the target height h to delay time t through t=(2nh/c), where n is the index of refraction, and c is the speed of light in vacuum; 3. Find the point of maximum slope for each ramp, and center an interval of width t around this point; and 4. If the gain profile was measured at the furthest distance of the target, then use the end of each interval that has the shortest delay time.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">For Gate Profile Generation, the following sequence of data processing steps assumes knowledge of how to choose the correct time values for the gate profile for the laser. In addition, depending on the environment, one can choose a 10 ns, 15 ns, or 20 ns laser pulse width. For shallow water it is desirable to use the shortest pulse width possible that produces monotonic ratio or contrast LUTs Most of the experiments used a pulse width of 15 ns, which corresponds to a gate thickness of 7.5 feet in air, and 5.6 feet in water.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one example the system collected 100 frames per time slice, therefore each raw file contains 100 frames sampled at 30 Hz. Typical time values used for the laboratory setup were in the range of 50&#x2212;70 ns, with samples taken at 1 ns intervals. To create a plot of the Gate Profile over time, a region of interest within the frame was chosen, typically a small rectangle within the center of the image frame. The gate profile across different regions of the image are not identical. Therefore a ROI representative of the target and at a similar field of depth was selected. The Gate Profiles were created in Excel.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Because the gate profile is used as the empirical calibration data for producing a range map, this data should be as accurate as possible. This means imaging points in time spanning 35&#x2212;45 ns to produce a gate profile curve.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For ratio image file generation, once the gate profile is calculated the next step is to average each of the 100 frames in each data file into a single image. Then the average image from the &#x201c;down&#x201d; portion of the gate profile is divided by the average image from the &#x201c;up&#x201d; portion of the gate profile. This stage requires some experience on selecting the best image pairs that will create the optimal 3D image. In general, if there are 5 images on the up ramp and 5 images collected on the down ramp, there are 5*5=25 possible pairings of up/down images. Of these 25 image ratio combinations some combinations will produce better results with regard to noise, illumination, and SNR.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For distance calibrated relief image generation, the next step in the processing is to convert the best ratio image products created in the ratio image file generation stem into distance (which may be any unit, but for these examples, centimeters was chosen). The interpolation of ratio-to-distance values is calculated in situ by calibration imagery taken at the beginning of the field exercise and the known water depth. The initial conversion proved to be too noisy to handle effectively, and therefore was spatially smoothed using a contra-harmonic mean filter. The filters were implemented with the MATLAB function ordfilt2, a 2-D order-statistic filtering function. Once the distance calibrated image is spatially filtered, the surface function in MATLAB can be used to create 3D surfaces with this 2D matrix.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For a one camera setup, the first data collects in the program utilized only one camera (receiver) in the set-up, using two sequential images for the 3-dimensional images can be created using a &#x201c;gate profile&#x201d; function to create a relationship between intensity ratio and distance. The intensity ratio is the ratio between two co-located pixels imaged at different times. This output distance, or relief, corresponds to a 3D shape of the scene. The returning light from a scene is a convolution between the laser pulse, the scene reflectance, and the gain profile of the camera intensifier. To create this distance map of an object or scene, what is needed is: 1) a gate profile, and 2) two images from within this gate profile time range.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a one camera setup, the camera needs to be sufficiently fast to allow for the ability to rapidly sample an underwater scene, with two images sampled within a few nanoseconds. This rapid sampling allows the system to operate even in the presence of turbulence and distortions on the water surface.
