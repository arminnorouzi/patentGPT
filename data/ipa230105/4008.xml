trapped within the waveguide so as to propagate by internal reflection, and avoidance of overlap between an image and its conjugate within the waveguide.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF

invention provides a display for projecting large field images using small sized optics by projecting a plurality of partial, narrow field images to be combined and viewed by the viewer as a single, large field image.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;field&#x201d; as used herein should be understood to refer to the field of view of a projected image. The term &#x201c;eye-box&#x201d; as used herein should be understood to refer to the general area where a pupil is expected to be while viewing an image. It is expected that the actual pupil position within the eye-box will vary across different viewers (e.g. based on interpupillary distance (&#x201c;IPD&#x201d;)), and even for a given viewer at different times (e.g. based on eyeball rotation).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The principles and operation of the display according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates schematically projecting a wide field onto an eye-box. Image generator <b>10</b>a transmits light rays onto optics <b>12</b><i>a </i>that collimate the light rays and illuminate eye-box <b>14</b>. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, to generate an image with a large field, optics <b>12</b><i>a </i>must be relatively large. As also apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a substantial amount of light rays <b>16</b><i>a </i>transmitted through optics <b>12</b><i>a </i>fall outside eye-box <b>14</b> and hence are &#x201c;wasted&#x201d; in the sense of being unviewable by the pupil.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates schematically projecting a narrow field onto an eye-box. For a narrow field, image generator <b>10</b><i>b </i>and optics <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be smaller compared to the image generator and optics required to project a large field (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Additionally, most of the collimated light rays reach eye-box <b>14</b>, with fewer light rays <b>16</b><i>b </i>falling outside the eye-box <b>14</b> relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. However, the field will be relatively narrow as compared to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, (and also narrower than a person's natural view of the world) leaving the viewer with a less than desirable image viewing experience.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates schematically projecting a combination of narrow fields onto an eye-box. A plurality of image generators <b>10</b><i>c </i>are used in combination with one another, with each individual image generator projecting a narrow field partial image such that the final image reaching eye-box <b>14</b> is a much wider field image. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, image generators <b>10</b><i>c </i>and optics <b>12</b><i>c </i>can be small (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), leading to fewer light rays <b>16</b><i>c </i>that fall outside eye-box <b>14</b>, yet the viewer still advantageously views a wide field image, i.e. the combined plurality of narrow field partial images. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> the dashed lines represent overlapping image data (dashed from center image generator and dot-dashed from left generator) that is preferably implemented in order to generate a perception of continuity to the observer. Because of physical limitations, this overlap cannot be generated by conventional optics without cross obscuration. According to an aspect of this invention, a light-guide optical element (&#x201c;LOE&#x201d;) (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;waveguide&#x201d;) is used to generate this overlap without obscuration. The waveguide has a pair of parallel external surfaces for total internal reflection of light rays introduced to it.

The image is shown as dashed lines representing lights rays. Image projector arrangement <b>20</b><i>a </i>generates and projects a partial image, and couples the partial image into waveguide <b>28</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, the image projector arrangement includes a light source, spatial light modulator (such as a liquid crystal on silicon, or &#x201c;LCOS&#x201d;) and collimating optics. These components may advantageously be arranged on surfaces of a number of beam splitter prisms, for example, polarized beam splitter (PBS) cubes, as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Image projector arrangement <b>20</b><i>a </i>is deployed to introduce the partial image into the waveguide so as to propagate the partial image within the waveguide by internal reflection from the pair of parallel external surfaces. The introduction of the partial image into the waveguide is achieved via a suitable optical arrangement, referred to as a coupling-in arrangement, which typically includes a prism with suitably angled surfaces associated with a side edge of the LOE or one of the major surfaces of the LOE and/or one or more coupling-in reflectors which may be located within the LOE or associated with one of the surfaces thereof. Details of the image projector arrangement, including the coupling-in arrangement, are omitted from the schematic drawings for simplicity of presentation of the invention.

Both of these light rays illuminate the pupil.

To address this non-uniformity, it is desirable to reduce the intensity of these pixels. However, as already pointed out above, the number of projector arrangements from which illumination arrives at the viewer's pupil for various pixels in the region of overlap between the partial images will vary according to the pupil position across the eye-box. An intensity correction according to an aspect of the present invention is therefore preferably performed only on a selected subset of the pixels within the region of overlap of the partial images, as will now be detailed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, according to some embodiments, the pixel intensity of selected pixels in regions of overlap are reduced (e.g. via a controller, as will be further detailed below) so as to enhance the perceived uniformity of the image when viewed by a viewer.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrate examples of angular power intensity distribution (lateral axis only) of the partial images generated by the separate image projector arrangements <b>20</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> (respectively denoted &#x2018;(a)&#x2019;, &#x2018;(b)&#x2019;, and &#x2018;(c)&#x2019;) after a reduction in the intensity of pixels in part of the overlapping regions of the partial images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate examples of the lateral angular distribution of pixel intensities when the partial images are combined. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate theoretical pixel intensity distribution across the field, while in practice the intensity distribution of a given projector arrangement is typically non-uniform across the projected field, and gradually drops off towards the ends of the field.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is optimized for the viewer's pupil being located at pupil position <b>15</b><i>a </i>(see FIGS. 2D-<b>2</b>H), in which case the subset of the pixels in image area <b>50</b> that reach the central pupil position from two projectors are reduced to half the intensity, so that after combining the images from all image projector arrangements the pixel intensity reaching the eye will be uniform across the entire image, as shown by the dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">However, if the viewer's eye is repositioned to pupil position <b>15</b><i>b</i>, (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>D-<b>2</b>H</figref>), the intensity of the combined image is no longer uniform, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, due to the change in the subset of pixels from the overlapping regions which reach the eye from two projectors.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The change in pixels which reach the eye due to the different pupil position was described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>F-<b>2</b>G</figref>, where point <b>1002</b>F went from being viewed from two projectors to being viewed only from one, whereas point <b>2002</b>F went from being viewed from one projector to being viewed from two.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Therefore, according to some embodiments, the controller may vary the subset of pixels for which the intensity is reduced based on an overlap region adjustment input, e.g. based on the viewer's anticipated or known pupil position. In some embodiments, the overlap region adjustment input may be derived automatically, e.g. via a pupil sensor. In some embodiments, the overlap region adjustment input may be derived by manual input from the user. For example, a test image can be displayed to the user with overlapping parts. The user can be asked to look at various parts of the image and provide input to reduce the intensity of select pixels, such as by actuating a knob or lever coupled to the controller, when the image appears uniform. Alternatively, the user can provide feedback to adjustments made by the controller, for example during a calibration process. The controller receiving such feedback can vary the subset of pixels for intensity reduction until a best approximation for a uniform perceived image is achieved.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates the angular power intensity distribution based on the viewer's eye located at pupil position <b>15</b><i>b</i>, after having reduced the intensity of the pixels corresponding to image area <b>50</b>&#x2032;. Note that the image area <b>50</b>&#x2032; for pixel intensity reduction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> are somewhat different than the image area <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> due to the different pupil position. After combining the separate images, the intensity across the combined image is made uniform, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">It should be noted that pupil position changes when the viewer looks in different directions, i.e., at different parts of the projected image due to rotation of the eye about its center of rotation. Typically, the sensitivity of the human eye to variations in image intensity is much greater in the central region of view, while a person is much more tolerant of intensity variations in their peripheral vision. Accordingly, it is typically sufficient to perform an adjustment to optimize the region of intensity correction for each &#x201c;seam&#x201d; (region of overlap) for the pupil position which corresponds to an eye direction looking towards that seam. Thus, for example, the aforementioned manual user adjustment may advantageously be performed as part of a software-guided calibration process in which the user is first instructed to look at a projected calibration image spanning a first seam, e.g., to the left, and to make the manual adjustment until that calibration image appears uniform, and then to look at a projected calibration image spanning a second seam, e.g., to the right, and to make the manual adjustment until that calibration image appears uniform. Those settings may then be used continuously for subsequent projection of images, independent of the instantaneous pupil position, with the understanding that the seam regions of the field of view will be at high quality while the user is looking at them with her central vision, and may be somewhat non-uniform in the peripheral vision.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments a pupil sensor can be deployed to dynamically detect eyeball rotation (e.g. as a function of deviation from a predetermined rotation center). Based on the detected eyeball rotation, the controller can determine the subset of pixels to be intensity reduced and make appropriate adjustments, providing full-field uniformity optimization for each instantaneous position of the pupil.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate schematically cross-sectional views of different configurations of a display according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the display can include a separate waveguide for each image projector arrangement. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the display includes three projector arrangements, and three corresponding waveguides, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The three projector arrangement configuration advantageously allows the middle field, corresponding to the viewer looking at the center of the image (as opposed to looking to the sides) to be generated by the middle projector arrangement only and generally free of overlap and naturally uniform. Parenthetically, both here and in all other implementations described herein, the fields of view of the different projector arrangements do not need to be equal. In certain examples, it may be advantageous to provide a projector arrangement with a relatively larger field of view for the central region of the FOV, while the lateral regions of the overall FOV may be provided by projector arrangements that project a smaller FOV.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates schematically an alternative embodiment where two projector arrangements are used with corresponding waveguides.

Use of differing sized FOV for the two projectors may allow offsetting of the seam region outside the central region.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates schematically an embodiment having non-parallel waveguides <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>41</b><i>c</i>, which can further expand the image field by orienting the waveguides to extend around or partially encompass the observer (or an eye of the observer). It should be noted that in this embodiment, the edges of the waveguides may be within the field of view of the observer, and might therefore cause a scattering and/or perturbation effect in the viewed image. These effects can be at least partially suppressed or eliminated by introducing an index-matched medium <b>43</b> (e.g. such as conformal plastic) between these edges thereby forming an optically smooth transition with the edges of the LOE.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">This embodiment can be further extended to multiple light guide panels encompassing any desired angle around the observer, and optionally replicated in two dimensions to provide an overall concave display, which could be extended to form a viewing dome or the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates schematically an embodiment of a display configured for 2D image expansion.

The angle of horizontal or vertical tilt between the projector arrangements <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> determines the offset between the optical axes of the two projectors, and hence the degree of vertical and horizontal overlap exists in the image viewed by the observer. Note that the actual positioning of the projector arrangements <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> is typically not critical because two-dimensional aperture expansion is performed by facets <b>32</b> and <b>30</b> on light from both projector arrangements.

In some embodiments, the controller is preferably implemented in, but not limited to, a head-mounted display, and most preferably in an eye-glasses form factor.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, display <b>70</b> further includes a pupil sensor <b>72</b> configured to detect a current pupil position of the viewer, and to update the controller <b>74</b> with data indicative of current pupil position.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, controller <b>74</b> is configured to determine a subset of common pixels between the partial images, based on the data obtained from the pupil sensor or based on a user input, for which image illumination is arriving at the pupil from two projectors simultaneously, and to implement intensity reduction for that subset of pixels. In some embodiments, the controller is further configured to vary the selection of the subset of common pixels in response to an overlap region adjustment input. The overlap region adjustment input can be derived from the pupil sensor, or from manual user input.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the controller can be configured to obtain calibration data in cooperation with pupil sensor <b>72</b> and store the obtained calibration data in memory <b>78</b>, and determine the appropriate overlap region adjustment for every pupil position based on the stored calibration data.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example flow-chart of a method for displaying an image to an eye of a viewer in accordance with certain embodiments where a sensor is used to detect pupil position of the viewer, either as a one-time calibration process or for ongoing real time adjustment. All steps are performed by processor <b>76</b> unless otherwise noted.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>86</b>, the pupil sensor detects the pupil position of the viewer's eye.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">At step <b>88</b>, at each different pupil position, determine a subset of pixels in the overlapping region of the image displayed to the viewer.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">At step <b>90</b>, the intensity of pixels within the determined subset is reduced so as to enhance the uniformity of the image displayed to the eye of the viewer. This intensity reduction is typically performed by modifying the image data sent to the projector, reducing the pixel intensity values for the relevant subset of pixels which are sent to both projectors. For example, a pixel with RGB values of (200,80,168) from the region of perceived overlap could be sent to both projectors as if the pixel data were a dimmer pixel of the same color, such as (100,40,84), assuming ideal linear response of the projector. In practice, the correction may need to be calibrated according to the specific hardware properties of the projector assemblies. Additionally, as described above, the output intensity of the different projector assemblies are typically not uniform across the field, and intensity correction should preferably take into account these non-uniformities.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Although the intensity reduction profile has been illustrated herein as a step function, with <b>50</b>% intensity being contributed by each projector in the region of perceived overlap, it should be noted that the subdivision of intensity between the two projectors need not be equal for any given pixel, and that the smoothness of the resulting image will typically be greatly enhanced by use of a linear tapering, or an otherwise smoothed transition profile.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the visible image intensity progressively hands-off between each two adjacent projectors across the region of perceived overlap, preferably starting at more than 80% intensity at the beginning of the region of perceived overlap, passing 50:50 somewhere in the middle, and reaching less than 20% contribution to the relevant pixel intensity at the outer extremity of the perceived-overlapping pixels for each projector. This progressive variation is preferably monotonic and occurs gradually across the transition area.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates the intensity distribution in the combined mage after the correction by linear tapering as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, if intensity correction is performed by linear or other gradual tapering as described above, preferably with a more gentle slope and over a larger transition area, the corrected image may be well within acceptable limits for viewing at any pupil position, thereby obviating the need to detect pupil positon and perform dynamic correction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>. In the case of a manual user input to adjust the intensity reduction regions, the intensity reduction profile may advantageously be temporarily switched to the step function profile during calibration in order to render the intensity non-uniformity more noticeable, and then switch back to a progressive variation during normal operation. In addition, in cases where the projector arrangements are of the type having gradual spatial intensity attenuation, the progressive intensity degradation described here can be modified according to the attenuation characteristics of the respective projector arrangements, as well as the pupil position within the eye-box, in order to maintain a uniform image intensity as viewed by an eye.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the displays provided herein may be implemented both in virtual reality and in augmented reality applications (i.e. where virtual display elements are combined with a direct view of the real world).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as examples, and that many other embodiments are possible within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-6" num="001-6"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>6</b>.
