The conventional endoscope holder pinches and grips the endoscope inserted into the body with the pair of semi-cylindrical clips, whereby the endoscope holder can fix and hold the endoscope at the predetermined insertion position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be preferable that the endoscope is turned in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the insertion position, in order to observe the surroundings of the insertion position or to perform the required treatment. At this time, since the conventional endoscope holder includes the plurality of rollers which are rotatably provided at an inner surface of the clip, the endoscope which is fixed at the insertion position can be turned by the rollers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2015-198933</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is preferable that the endoscope swing relative to an axial direction in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the insertion position, so that the distal end of the endoscope approaches an intestinal wall, a stomach wall, or the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope holder which can turnably fix and hold an endoscope inserted into a body at a predetermined insertion position, and can swing the endoscope in a state fixed at the insertion position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope holder which can be easily attached to an endoscope.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve such objects, an endoscope holder of a first aspect of the present invention is an endoscope holder which fixes and holds an endoscope inserted into a body at a predetermined insertion position, the endoscope holder comprising a hollow cylindrical holder main body which comprises an insertion hole into which the endoscope is to be inserted, first and second gripping members each having a plate-like body extending in a lengthwise direction of the insertion hole, and contacts the endoscope inserted into the insertion hole to pinch the endoscope, a first elastic member which is disposed between the first and second gripping members and urges the first and second gripping members in a direction in which the first and second gripping members are separated from each other, a pressing member which presses the first gripping member toward the second gripping member against an urging force of the first elastic member, a switching mechanism which holds or releases a pressing state by the pressing member, rollers which are rotatably provided at surfaces of the first and second gripping members which are in contact with the endoscope, along the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole, and a second elastic member which is provided between the second gripping member and an inner wall of the insertion hole, and swingably supports the second gripping member with respect to the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention, the first and second gripping members each having a plate-like body extending in a lengthwise direction of the insertion hole are provided in the insertion hole of the hollow cylindrical holder main body, and the first elastic member urging in a direction in which the first and second gripping members are separated from each other is disposed between the first and second gripping members. The first gripping member is pressed by the pressing member toward the second gripping member against the urging force of the first elastic member, thereby pinching the endoscope between the first gripping member and the second gripping member. The pressing state by the pressing member is maintained by the switching mechanism, resulting that the endoscope holder of the present invention can hold the endoscope between the first and second gripping members, thereby capable of fixing the endoscope inserted into the body at the predetermined insertion position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">At this time, the first and second gripping members are provided with the rollers in the surfaces which are in contact along the endoscope, in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole, and the rollers are rotatable. The rollers enable the endoscope pinched between the first and second gripping members to be turned in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the predetermined insertion position in the body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">At this time, the second gripping member is swingably held in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole by the second elastic member disposed between the inner wall of the insertion hole and the second gripping member. Accordingly, the endoscope pinched between the first and second gripping members can swing, together with the first and second gripping members, in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole, in other words, in an axial direction of the endoscope, in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the predetermined insertion position in the body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the pressing state by the pressing member is released by the switching mechanism, the first gripping member can be returned to the original position by the urging force of the first elastic member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention may comprise a third elastic member which is disposed between the first gripping member and the pressing member and swingably supports the first gripping member with respect to the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to this configuration, the first gripping member is also swingably held in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole by the third elastic member disposed between the pressing member and the first gripping member, so that the endoscope pinched between the first and second gripping members can readily swing in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole together with the first and second gripping members.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention, a plurality of the second elastic members are preferably disposed in at least two positions along the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole. The second elastic members are disposed in at least two positions in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole, thereby enabling the second gripping member to stably swing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention preferably comprises a restricting member on an inner wall surface of the insertion hole, the restricting member restricting mutual approach between the first and second gripping members. The endoscope holder of the present invention comprises the restricting member on the inner wall surface of the insertion hole, thereby enabling the endoscope to be prevented from being excessively firmly pinched between the first and second gripping members to thereby prevent the endoscope from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that the endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention comprise at least a pair of columnar members in the insertion hole, the columnar members being erected on opposite sides of a center axis of the insertion hole, and the first and second gripping members comprise hole portions into which the columnar members are to be inserted, and the hole portions each have at least a gap in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole with respect to the columnar member.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first and second gripping members comprise the hole portions, and the columnar members are inserted in the hole portions, so that the first and second gripping members can be moved along the columnar members when being pressed by the pressing member or being released from pressing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">On the other hand, when the first and second gripping members swing as described above, the first and second gripping members may be prevented from swinging due to the interference with the columnar members. However, in the endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention, the hole portions each have at least a gap in the lengthwise direction of the insertion hole with respect to the columnar member, thereby capable of preventing the columnar members from interfering with the first and second gripping member even when the first and second gripping member swing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention preferably comprises a fixing member which is provided on an outer peripheral surface of a distal end of the holder main body and detachably fixes the holder main body to a mouth piece. The endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention is fixed to the mouth piece by the fixing member, and is thereby capable of holding the endoscope inserted into the body through the mouth piece.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The endoscope holder of the first aspect of the present invention may have a deaeration preventing valve which seals between the endoscope inserted into the insertion hole and an inner wall of the insertion hole. According to this configuration, the deaeration preventing valve prevents deaeration from the body into which the endoscope is inserted, thereby capable of always maintaining good observation field of view of the endoscope in the body.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An endoscope holder of a second aspect of the present invention is an endoscope holder which fixes and holds an endoscope inserted into a body at a predetermined insertion position, the endoscope holder comprising a holder main body having a hollow square cylindrical shape which comprises an endoscope housing part with an opening in one side surface thereof, the endoscope housing part being configured to house the endoscope therein, first and second gripping members each having a plate-like body extending in a lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, and contacts the endoscope housed in the endoscope housing part to pinch the endoscope, a first elastic member which is disposed between the first and second gripping members and urges the first and second gripping members in a direction in which the first and second gripping members are separated from each other, a pressing member which presses the first gripping member toward the second gripping member against an urging force of the first elastic member, a switching mechanism which holds or releases a pressing state by the pressing member, rollers which are rotatably provided at surfaces of the first and second gripping members which are in contact with the endoscope, along the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, and a second elastic member which is provided between the second gripping member and an inner wall of the endoscope housing part, and swingably supports the second gripping member in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, when the endoscope holder comprises a holder main body made of a hollow square cylindrical body but having no opening in one side surface thereof, the endoscope holder must be mounted to the endoscope by inserting the long endoscope into the holder main body from a distal end of the endoscope. In contrast, the endoscope holder of the present invention comprises a holder main body having a hollow square cylindrical shape and an opening in one side surface thereof, and an endoscope housing part configured to house the endoscope therein. According to the endoscope holder of the present invention, an opened side surface of the holder main body is set parallel to arbitrary portion in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope, and the endoscope is housed in the endoscope housing part from the opened side surface, thereby capably of easily mounting the endoscope holder to the long endoscope.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention, the first and second gripping members each having a plate-like body extending in a lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part are provided in the endoscope housing part of the holder main body, and the first elastic member urging in a direction in which the first and second gripping members are separated from each other is disposed between the first and second gripping members. The first gripping member is pressed by the pressing member toward the second gripping member against the urging force of the first elastic member, thereby pinching the endoscope between the first gripping member and the second gripping member. The pressing state by the pressing member is maintained by the switching mechanism, resulting that the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention can hold the endoscope between the first and second gripping members, thereby capable of fixing the endoscope inserted into the body at the predetermined insertion position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At this time, the first and second gripping members are provided with the rollers in the surfaces which are in contact along the endoscope, in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, and the rollers are rotatable. The rollers enable the endoscope held between the first and second gripping members to be turned in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the predetermined insertion position in the body.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At this time, the second gripping member is swingably held in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part by the second elastic member disposed between the inner wall of the endoscope housing part and the second gripping member. Accordingly, the endoscope held between the first and second gripping members can swing in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, in other words, in an axial direction of the endoscope, in a state in which the endoscope is fixed at the predetermined insertion position in the body.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention, when the pressing state by the pressing member is released by the switching mechanism, the first gripping member can be returned to the original position by the urging force of the first elastic member.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention preferably comprises a third elastic member which is disposed between the first gripping member and the pressing member and swingably supports the first gripping member with respect to the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention, a plurality of the second elastic members are preferably disposed in at least two positions along the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part. The second elastic members are disposed in at least two positions in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, thereby enabling the second gripping member to stably swing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention comprises the third elastic member, and thereby the first gripping member is also swingably held in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part, so that the endoscope held between the first and second gripping members can readily swing along the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention preferably comprises a restricting member on an inner wall surface of the endoscope housing part, the restricting member restricting mutual approach between the first and second gripping members. The endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention comprises the restricting member on the inner wall surface of the endoscope housing part, thereby enabling the endoscope to be prevented from being excessively firmly pinched between the first and second gripping members to thereby prevent the endoscope from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is preferable that the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention comprise a plurality of columnar members erected along a side surface facing the opened side surface of the endoscope housing part, and the first and second gripping members comprise oblong hole portions into which the columnar members are to be inserted, and the oblong hole portions each have at least a gap in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part with respect to the columnar member.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first and second gripping members comprise the oblong hole portions, and the columnar members are inserted in the oblong hole portions, so that the first and second gripping members can be moved along the columnar members when being pressed by the pressing member or being released from pressing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, when the first and second gripping members swing as described above, the first and second gripping members may be prevented from swinging due to the interference with the columnar members. However, in the endoscope holder of the second aspect of the present invention, the oblong hole portions each have at least a gap in the lengthwise direction of the endoscope housing part with respect to the columnar member, thereby capable of preventing the columnar members from interfering with the first and second gripping member even when the first and second gripping member swing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The endoscope holder of any one of aspects of the present invention comprises an arm supporting the holder main body at an arbitrary position and posture, and the holder main body may be integrally fixed to a distal end of the arm or detachably attached to the distal end. According to this configuration, the endoscope holder is supported by the arm at an arbitrary position and posture, thereby capable of holding the endoscope at appropriate position and posture corresponding to various conditions.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this case, the endoscope holder of any one of aspects of the present invention may have an arm fixing unit configured to detachably fix a proximal end of the arm to a frame or a rail part of a bed or another fixing member. Thus, the arm is fixed to the bed or the like, thereby capable of holding the holder main body by the arm at an arbitrary position in a space on the bed at an arbitrary posture. Accordingly, the endoscope can be held at appropriate position and posture corresponding to various conditions of a patient undergoing a procedure on the bed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The endoscope holder of any one of aspects of the present invention may hold a large intestine endoscope as an endoscope held by the endoscope holder. According to this, while the large intestine endoscope is appropriately held as described above, an examination can be performed on a patient on the bed with the large intestine endoscope.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
