The lubricant compositions are effective at reducing oxidation and viscosity increase in the lubricating oil of an internal combustion engine.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The demand on engine lubricants has become more severe to cope with modern engine designs which have stronger anti-oxidation requirements. This has forced additive companies to develop robust engine oils with stronger antioxidant capabilities.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Engine oil is usually blended with various additives in order to satisfy various performance requirements. One well known way to increase fuel economy is to decrease the viscosity of the lubricating oil. Most internal combustion engine oils, which demonstrate excellent fuel economy performance, are usually formulated to be low viscosity oils with a viscosity index improver (VII) to reduce fluid friction from viscosity resistance under low temperature. In order to improve fuel efficiency, many original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) are looking at shifting to downsized turbo diesel (DE) and gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines for the improvement of fuel efficiency. The drawback to the move to lower viscosity oils with higher VII is an increase in oxidation and the formation of deposits. These are mainly derived from the partially burned fuel and fuel soot which, along with the engine oil, can adhere to the piston top, piston ring, as well as the engine combustion chamber surfaces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Oxidation of engine oils negatively impacts the performance of the lubricating oils and result in reducing the performance life of the engine oil and damage to metal surfaces of the engine. Thus, reducing oxidation in lubricating engine oils is needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a lubricating oil composition which comprises:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(a) from about 6 wt. % to about 15 wt. %, based on the total weight of the lubricating oil composition, of one or more base oils (A) comprising one or more polyalphaolefin (PAO) base oils having a kinematic viscosity at 100&#xb0;

Oils of lubricating viscosity derived from coal or shale are also useful base oils.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">Synthetic lubricating oils include hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins (e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propylene-isobutylene copolymers, chlorinated polybutylenes, poly(1-hexenes), poly(1-octenes), poly(1-decenes); alkylbenzenes (e.g., dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di(2-ethylhexyl)benzenes; polyphenols (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenols); and alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulfides and the derivatives, analogues and homologues thereof.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids (e.g., malonic acid, alkyl malonic acids, alkenyl malonic acids, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acids and alkenyl succinic acids, maleic acid, fumaric acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, phthalic acid) with a variety of alcohols (e.g., butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether, propylene glycol). Specific examples of these esters include dibutyl adipate, di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, di-n-hexyl fumarate, dioctyl sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2-ethylhexyl diester of linoleic acid dimer, and the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of sebacic acid with two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of 2-ethylhexanoic acid.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120">Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C<sub>5 </sub>to C<sub>12 </sub>monocarboxylic acids and polyols, and polyol ethers such as neopentyl glycol, trimethylolpropane, pentacrythritol, dipentaerythritol and tripentaerythritol.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">The base oil may be derived from Fischer-Tropsch synthesized hydrocarbons. Fischer-Tropsch synthesized hydrocarbons are made from synthesis gas containing H<sub>2 </sub>and CO using a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. Such hydrocarbons typically require further processing in order to be useful as the base oil. For example, the hydrocarbons may be hydroisomerized; hydrocracked and hydroisomerized; dewaxed; or hydroisomerized and dewaxed; using processes known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122">Unrefined, refined and re-refined oils can be used in the present lubricating oil composition. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source without further purification treatment. For example, a shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation or ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process and used without further treatment would be unrefined oil. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Many such purification techniques, such as distillation, solvent extraction, acid or base extraction, filtration and percolation are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0123">Re-refined oils are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils applied to refined oils which have been already used in service. Such re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques for approval of spent additive and oil breakdown products.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124">Hence, the base oil which may be used to make the present lubricating oil composition may be selected from any of the base oils in Groups I-V as specified in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines (API Publication 1509). Such base oil groups are summarized in Table 1 below:</p><p id="p-0130" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="161pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Base Oil Properties</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Saturates<sup>(b)</sup>, </entry><entry>Sulfur<sup>(c)</sup>, </entry><entry>Viscosity </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Group<sup>(a)</sup></entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>Index<sup>(d)</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Group I</entry><entry>&#x3c;90 and/or</entry><entry>&#x3e;0.03</entry><entry>80 to &#x3c;120</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Group II</entry><entry>&#x2265;90</entry><entry>&#x2264;0.03</entry><entry>80 to &#x3c;120</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Group III</entry><entry>&#x2265;90</entry><entry>&#x2264;0.03</entry><entry>&#x2265;120</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="161pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Group IV</entry><entry>Polyalphaolefins (PAOs)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Group V</entry><entry>All other base stocks not included </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>in Groups I, II, III or IV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00001"><sup>(a)</sup>Groups I-III are mineral oil base stocks.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00002"><sup>(b)</sup>Determined in accordance with ASTM D2007.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00003"><sup>(c)</sup>Determined in accordance with ASTM D2622, ASTM D3120, ASTM D4294 or ASTM D4927.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00004"><sup>(d)</sup>Determined in accordance with ASTM D2270.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0131" num="0125">Base oils suitable for use herein are any of the variety corresponding to API Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V oils and combinations thereof, preferably the Group III to Group V oils due to their exceptional volatility, stability, viscometric and cleanliness features.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0126">The oil of lubricating viscosity for use in the lubricating oil compositions of this disclosure, also referred to as a base oil, is typically present in a major amount, e.g., an amount of greater than 50 wt. %, preferably greater than about 70 wt. %, more preferably from about 80 to about 99.5 wt. % and most preferably from about 85 to about 98 wt. %, based on the total weight of the composition.
