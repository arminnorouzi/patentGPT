FIELD</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to methods of treating ocular disorders using a composition including a human trabecular meshwork stem cell (TMSC) secretome, wherein the composition can reduce or treat the impairment of ocular cells.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">5. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Glaucoma can be a cause of blindness, as there is irreversible damage to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye. This damage can result in permanent vision loss.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Increased IOP in glaucoma is due to the dysregulation of the major outflow pathway in the eye comprised of the trabecular meshwork (TM), causing accumulation of aqueous humor (AH) inside the eye. This accumulation causes an increased IOP, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve head and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). IOP is mainly regulated by the TM and the Schlemm's canal endothelium by providing resistance to the aqueous humor outflow. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), which accounts for up to 90% of all forms of glaucoma, is characterized by an elevation of IOP without pain. A certain range of IOP and anterior chamber angle can appear normal and remain asymptomatic until patients realize that there is a significant permanent loss of eyesight. There is a reduction of TM cells with age at the rate of 0.58% per year. There is a reduction in TM cellularity in glaucoma, and this loss can be aggravated by pathological conditions involving TM thickness, hyperplasia, abnormal ECM deposition, leading to increased outflow resistance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hypoxia is implicated in the death of RGCs in glaucoma through increased VEGF production, causing retinal edema, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased accumulation of glutamate extracellularly, which causes excessive Ca<sup>+</sup> influx and RGC death by ionotropic and metabotropic receptor activation and enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing treatment options for glaucoma include eye drops (beta-blockers, alpha agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, rho kinase inhibitors, and prostaglandin analogs), laser procedures, and surgery. However, all such treatments have various limitations and side effects. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved techniques to treat ocular disorders without significant adverse side effects.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">6.

Accordingly, the disclosed composition can be formulated in the form of a solution, a suspension, a gel, an emulsion, an ointment, a cream, or a controlled-release/sustain-release vehicle. In non-limiting embodiments, the disclosed composition can be formulated as an eye drop or eye ointment. It is desirable that the pharmaceutical composition is sterile or sterilizable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the TMSC secretome can include a set of proteins that relate to axon guidance, neurogenesis, neuron death, neuron apoptosis, or combinations thereof. For example, the TMSC secretome can include proteins related to the axon guidance pathways, such as TUBB2A (Tubulin beta-2A), ACTR3, ARPC4, and Semaphorin 5A (SEMA5A). The TMSC secretome can also include proteins involved in neurogenesis (e.g., NEO1, SPTBN1, GAS6, and/or SDC2), proteins involved in negative regulation of neuron death (e.g., PARK7, HYOU1, NONO, and/or PIN1), proteins involved in the clearance of neuron apoptotic process (e.g., NQO1, HSP90AB1, G6PD, and/or UBE2V2). In some embodiments, the TMSC secretome can include proteins involved in positive regulation of neuron differentiation (e.g., CAPRIN1, CFL1, CRABP2, and CTSZ), positive regulation of neurogenesis (e.g., CRKL, CSF1, DPYSL3, and/or EIF4G1), neuron projection maintenance and development (e.g., APP, INS, MAP1A, ACTR2, ARHGDIA, CAPRIN1, and/or CFL1) and positive regulation of neuron projection development (e.g., DPYSL3, FN1, HGF, and/or ITGA3).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, the disclosed TMSC secretome can include proteins related to neuroprotection and rescue RGCs from apoptosis. For example, the disclosed TMSC secretome can include a neuralized E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 protein (NEURL1, formation of functional synapses), a neurofascin protein (neurite extension, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, myelination, and neuron-glial cell interactions), and/or a neuroligin-1/3/4X protein (synapse function and synaptic signal transmission).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In certain embodiments, the disclosed composition can include an array of neuroprotective proteins, which can regulate different aspects of neurogenesis and provide neuroprotective effects on RGCs.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the disclosed composition can include an effective amount of the TMSC secretome, wherein the effective amount can be present in an amount to reduce impairment of RGCs, wherein the TMSC secretome can include proteins involved in neuroprotection, wherein the neuroprotection can be selected from the group consisting of axon guidance, neurogenesis, negative regulation of neuron death, neuron apoptosis, clearance of neuron apoptotic bodies, or combinations thereof, wherein the TMSC secretome can be a cell-free secretome, wherein the TMSC secretome can be harvested from TMSCs by incubating the TMSCs with serum-free media, wherein the TMSC secretome can be concentrated by a factor of about 25, wherein the impairment can be selected from the group consisting of cell apoptosis, axon loss, vision loss, increased intraocular pressure, dysregulation of aqueous humor outflow, and combinations thereof, wherein the ocular disorder can be glaucoma, wherein the composition can be formulated in a form, wherein the form can be selected from the group consisting of a solution, a suspension, a semi-solid gel, a gel, an emulsion, semi-liquid, an ointment, a cream, foam gel, a controlled-release/sustain-release vehicle, an eye drop, and combinations thereof, and wherein the composition is formulated in a form for injection into the subject, wherein the injection can be selected from the group consisting of a systemic injection, an intravenous injection, an intramuscular injection, and combinations thereof.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">8.2. Methods of Treatment</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the disclosed subject matter provides a method of treating an ocular disorder comprising administering an effective amount of a TMSC secretome to reduce impairment of RGCs in a target tissue of the subject. In non-limiting embodiments, the target tissue can be an eye or a component of the visual apparatus (e.g., the eye itself, nerves innervating the eye, and associated musculature).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the disclosed composition can be administered to the target tissue by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, topical instillation, periocular injection, intravitreal injection, systemic administration, or the insertion of a reservoir that provides sustained release of the composition. In certain embodiments, the disclosed composition can be periocularly administered. For example, a composition including about 1 ul to about 1000 ul of the concentrated TMSC secretome can be perioculary injected into a target tissue. In certain embodiments, the volume of the concentrated TMSC secretome can be from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 500 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 400 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 300 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 200 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 100 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 50 &#x3bc;l, from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 10 &#x3bc;l, or from about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 5 &#x3bc;l. In certain embodiments, the volume of the concentrated TMSC secretome can be from about 500 &#x3bc;l to about 1000 &#x3bc;l, from about 500 &#x3bc;l to about 900 &#x3bc;l, from about 500 &#x3bc;l to about 800 &#x3bc;l, from about 500 &#x3bc;l to about 700 &#x3bc;l, or from about 500 &#x3bc;l to about 600 &#x3bc;l. In certain embodiments, the volume of the concentrated TMSC secretome can be from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 900 &#x3bc;l, from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 800 &#x3bc;l, from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 700 &#x3bc;l, from about 600 &#x3bc;l to about 500 &#x3bc;l, from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 400 &#x3bc;l, from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 300 &#x3bc;l, from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 200 &#x3bc;l, or from about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 150 &#x3bc;l.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one non-limiting embodiment, the disclosed composition can be administered to an affected eye topically, for example, as eye drops or as an ointment. For example, but not by way of limitation, the administration can be at least once a day, at least twice a day, at least once a week, at least twice a week, at least once a month, at least twice a month, at least six times a year, at least four times a year, at least twice a year or at least once a year, and/or up to twice a day, up to three times a day, up to once a week, up to twice a week, up to three times a month, up to six times a year, or up to four times a year. In a specific non-limiting embodiment, where the composition can be administered as eye drops, about 1 &#x3bc;l to about 1000 &#x3bc;l of the composition comprising the concentrated TMSC secretome can be administered to the affected eye at a time with the appropriate number of drops. The secretome proteins can cross the corneal barrier when they are administered in the form of eye drops.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In non-limiting embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can be used to treat the impairment of RGCs. In some embodiments, the impairment can include cell apoptosis, axon loss, vision loss, increased intraocular pressure, dysregulation of aqueous humor outflow, or combinations thereof. In particular non-limiting embodiments, the impairment can be cell apoptosis and increased intraocular pressure. The disclosed composition can also be used for any ocular disorders associated with the impairment of RGCs. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that such impairment can affect and induce ocular disorders (e.g., glaucoma, cataracts, leucoma, and/or retinal degeneration).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Ocular disorders that can be treated according to the disclosed subject matter include, but are not limited to, glaucoma, cataracts, leucoma, and retinal degeneration. Retinal ganglion cell damage can be a contributor to a number of optic neuropathies (e.g., glaucoma), and it can be implicated in other diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis). During development, RGCs can be produced in about a two-fold excess, but the insufficiency to form an efficient synaptic connection in the brain and lack of signal from neighboring retinal neurons can lead to the death of RGCs. During adulthood, pathological conditions can disrupt the synaptic connectivity or induce RGC death after optic nerve injury due to the deprivation of various factors (e.g., growth factor) or changes in electrical activity. Most optic neuropathies that involve damage to an optic nerve (e.g., traumatic optic neuropathies, ischaemic optic neuropathies, and glaucoma) can lead to RGC death by apoptosis. RGCs can be damaged in a variety of diseases that involve acute diseases (e.g., ischaemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, and glaucoma). For example, retinal ischemia, retinal artery, or vein occlusions can directly injure RGC cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer and can lead to vision loss. In certain embodiments, RGC viability (neuroprotection) and/or RGC function (neuroenhancement) can be enhanced by the disclosed subject matter. In non-limiting embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can be used to treat the impairment of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The impairment can be cell apoptosis, axon loss, vision loss, increased intraocular pressure, dysregulation of aqueous humor outflow, and/or combinations thereof. The disclosed composition can also be used for any ocular disorders associated with the impairment of RGCs. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that such impairment can affect and induce ocular disorders (e.g., glaucoma, cataracts, leucoma, and/or retinal degeneration). The disclosed TMSC secretome can reduce the impairment of RGCs directly and/or indirectly.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In certain embodiments, administering the effective does of the disclosed composition can reduce the death of ocular cells and preserve cellular activities. In particular, the disclosed TMSC secretome can include proteins related to neuroprotection and rescue RGCs from apoptosis. In some embodiments, the disclosed TMSC secretome can protect RGCs from apoptosis through the neurotrophin and/or PI3-Akt signaling pathway. In certain embodiments, the disclosed TMSC secretome can prevent axon loss and vision loss. Since the RGC apoptosis leading to axon loss in the optic nerve can be the main reason for vision loss in glaucoma, the disclosed TMSC secretome can prevent/treat vision loss in genetic glaucoma by protecting RGCs from cell death. In non-limiting embodiments, the disclosed TMSC secretome can preserve RGCs' functions. Preservation of RGC functions can be important for treating primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and reducing IOP. In certain embodiments, administering the effective does of the disclosed composition can reduce IOP. For example, administering the disclosed composition can result in maintaining IOP at normal ranges without causing damages to the optic nerve.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can treat ocular disorders by regenerating TM cells. In particular, the disclosed composition can preserve gene expression related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. For example, administering the disclosed composition can preserve the expression level of the CHI3L1 gene, which is a TM cell marker and involved in ECM remodeling. In non-limiting embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can also reduce mutations in genes, which can cause ocular disorders. For example, myocilin and ANGPTL7 are glaucoma associated genes, and mutations in these can be associated with glaucoma. The increased expression of Myoc and ANGPTL7 of glaucoma patients can be reduced by TMSC secretome, preventing steroid-induced glaucoma. In some embodiments, the disclosed composition can reduce the excess formation of fibrous tissues after a wound in ocular cells. For example, the disclosed subject matter can reduce fibrotic gene expression including a secreted protein acidic and cysteine-rich (SPARC) gene, fibronectin, and/or a connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can be used to treat ocular disorders by activating neuroprotective proteins, enzymes, or signaling pathways. For example, the expression level of TMEM177, COX2, PGE2, or combinations thereof can increase after administering the disclosed secretome of TMSC into the subject. TMEM177 can stabilize or increase the biogenesis of COX2. Increased TMEM177 after the secretome of the TMSC treatment can increase COX2 stabilization and biogenesis, leading to increased PGE2 expression that can reduce IOP. In non-limiting embodiments, the increased PGE2 can reverse glaucomatous changes and promote the self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells (e.g., ABCB5+ and OCT4+ endogenous stem cells). In non-limiting embodiments, the TMSC can be transplanted to increase the expression level of TMEM177, COX2, PGE2, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In certain embodiments, the disclosed subject matter can be used to treat gliosis. Gliosis can be caused by neurodegeneration of RGC (e.g., alteration of structure, function, and gene expression profile of glial cells). Administering the disclosed composition, including the effective amount of TMSC secretome, can reduce gliosis and further enhance regeneration in RGC. The proteins in the secretome can induce axon guidance pathway activation, neurogenesis, negative regulation of neuron death, and clearance of neuron apoptotic process leading to the enhanced RGC protection, survival, and function. In non-limiting embodiments, the TMSC secretome can increase autophagy to promote RGC survival. For example, the expression level of Beclin1 and Atg5, which controls autophagy, can be restored or increased.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain embodiments, the method of treating an ocular disorder can further include harvesting the TMSC secretome by incubating the TMSCs with serum-free media.

Four-months old wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory as wildtype control (WT). Adult C57BL/6J mice were periocularly injected with 20 &#x3bc;l of dexamethasone acetate (Dex-Ac) (DE122, Spectrum Chemicals) at 10 mg/ml once a week. In the genetic POAG model, transgenic mice with myocilin Y437H mutation (Tg-MyocY437H) were obtained from North Texas Eye Research Institute and bred with C57BL/6J WT mice and genotyped to confirm the myocilin mutation. Littermates were used as controls. Primary human TMSC, TM cells, and corneal fibroblasts were derived from deidentified corneas unsuitable for corneal transplantation obtained from the Center for Organ Recovery and Education (CORE, Pittsburgh, Pa.) or from the corneal rims after corneal transplantation. Proper informed consent for using the donated corneas for research purposes was obtained from all the donors by the CORE. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) cell lines were used and maintained in the laboratory. Blinded methods were used for study outcomes and designs. In particular, the histological evaluations of cell immunofluorescence for different antibodies and TM and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) counts were performed by two independent researchers blindly. Axon count in the optic nerve sections was performed by an expert in a blinded fashion. qPCR experiments were performed by another researcher in a blinded manner. The sample size was estimated based on the variability of different assays and potential outliers. The sample size for Dex-Ac and Tg-MyocY437H mice cohorts was estimated by power analysis before the initiation of the experiments.

The results confirmed reasonably pure secretome released by live cells with less than 5% cell death as required. Secretome from human corneal fibroblasts served as a control, and the viability of fibroblasts was also confirmed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>D</figref>). To evaluate if the TMSC secretome was cytotoxic, human TM cells were treated with TMSC-Scr for 48 h and did MTT and alamarBlue assays. The results showed no significant difference in cell viability and proliferation between cells with and without TMSC-Scr treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E-<b>1</b>F</figref>). Collectively, these assays demonstrate that the secretome was harvested from healthy cells and had no cytotoxicity to human TM cells, supporting its safety. Then we examined if the TMSC secretome has protective roles to human TM cells in vitro. One of the characteristics of TM cells is that they are responsive to dexamethasone (Dex) treatment with increased intracellular myocilin expression. Myocilin and angiopoietin-like 7 (ANGPTL7) are both glaucoma-associated markers. Chitinase 3 Like 1 (CHI3L1) is involved in ECM remodeling in the outflow pathway and has been used as a TM cell marker as water channel protein aquaporin 1 (AQP1). Fibronectin, an ECM component in the TM, is increased in glaucoma and is believed to contribute to TM stiffness and increased outflow resistance. Cultured TM cells were treated with 100 nM Dex for 5 days and examined that TM cells had reduced CHI3L1 and AQP1 levels and increased myocilin, ANGPTL7, and fibronectin expression as compared to no-Dex control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>). TMSC-Scr was added together with Dex for 5 days (Parallel TMSC-Scr, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) or together with Dex for another 5-day after the initial 5-day Dex-alone treatment (Post TMSC-Scr, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to assess its therapeutic effect. TMSC-Scr prevented reduction and restored the levels of TM markers CHI3L1 and AQP1, and reduced myocilin, ANGPTL7, and fibronectin expression as demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>G</figref>).

The injections of Dex-Ac and secretome from week-3 to week-6 were given at the same time but at different periocular regions (superior and inferior) to avoid reagents being intermixing before getting into target sites. One week after TMSC-Scr injection, the IOP reduced to 13.8&#xb1;0.5 mmHg (week-4) as compared to mice treated with Dex-Ac alone (15.9&#xb1;0.4 mmHg) and then reduced to a normal range from week-5 to -8 (10.7&#xb1;0.4 mmHg), similar to that of vehicle control (12.2&#xb1;0.6 mmHg). However, Fibro-Scr did not reduce the Dex-Ac elevated IOP (16.2&#xb1;0.8 mmHg at week-4 and 15.4&#xb1;0.5 mmHg at week-8) but remained similar to Dex-Ac treated eyes (15.9&#xb1;0.9 mmHg at week-4, 15.2&#xb1;0.3 mmHg at week-8). We counted the TM cells on plastic sections obtained at week-8 and found that TMSC-Scr injection increased the TM cellularity (19.1&#xb1;1.7 cells/TM section) as compared to Dex-Ac mice (14.7&#xb1;1.3), similar to normal control (20.7&#xb1;1.5), while Fibro-Scr treatment could not increase TM cell number significantly (16.7&#xb1;1.3) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C-<b>3</b>D</figref>).

The presence of PGE2 in TM cells plays an important role in the maintenance of IOP in a normal range. Human TM cells secrete PGE2, which is abrogated by glucocorticoid treatment. A dramatic reduction of COX2 expression was detected in Dex-treated TM cells in vitro, which was restored after TMSC-Scr treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Transmembrane protein 177 (TMEM177), a mitochondrial protein, acts upstream of COX2 to increase and stabilize COX2 expression. Analysis of TMEM177 in cultured human TM cells showed a diminished expression after Dex treatment, which was restored after parallel- and post-TMSC-Scr treatments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting of mouse limbal tissue showed that COX2 levels were reduced in Dex-Ac treated tissue and increased after TMSC-Scr treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C-<b>4</b>D</figref>).

The TM cells on plastic sections were counted, which showed that Tg-MyocY437H mice had a reduced number of TM cells (10&#xb1;1.4/TM section) as compared to WT mice (16.4&#xb1;2.1/TM) at week-10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>). Similar to its effects on the Dex-Ac mice, treatment with TMSC-Scr significantly increased the TM cellularity in Tg-MyocY437H mice (17.5&#xb1;1.1/TM). One feature of the Tg-MyocY437H mice is that mutant Myoc cannot be secreted out but stuck in the ER of TM cells leading to ER stress. Indeed, an increased level of Myoc accumulated in the limbus tissue of the Tg-MyocY437H mice was detected, which was reduced to the level as WT control after TMSC-Scr treatment as detected by staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) and by immunoblotting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>).

Similar to Dex-Ac mice, GRP78 expression was significantly increased in Tg-MyocY437H mice and reduced to WT level after TMSC-Scr treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>). Using an anti-CD31 antibody to stain the Schlemm's canal and vascular endothelium to mark the TM tissue location, an increased expression of ECM marker fibronectin and collagen IV was observed in the TM in Tg-MyocY437H mice, which was reduced after TMSC-Scr treatment while the sham group showed no reduction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C-<b>6</b>D</figref>). Similar to Dex-Ac mice, an analysis of the COX2-PGE2 signaling axis in Tg-MyocY437H mice showed increased levels of COX2 and TMEM177 by immunoblotting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>G-<b>5</b>H</figref>), PGE2 by ELISA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>I</figref>), ABCB5+ and OCT4+ stem cells, and Ki67+ dividing cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>J-<b>5</b>M</figref>) after TMSC-Scr treatment. These results further confirmed the therapeutic effects of the TMSC-Scr in the Tg-MyocY437H mouse model of glaucoma. Since TMSC secretome periocular injection enhanced the COX2-PGE2 signaling axis in the TM tissue of both Dex-Ac and Tg-MyocY437H mice, we investigated whether COX2 is upregulated in the TM tissue after TMSC intracameral injection and homing to the TM tissue. 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>DiO labeled TMSC was intracamerally injected per eye in Tg-MyocY437H mice, and at 2-month after injection, COX2 expression was significantly increased in the TM as well as ciliary body (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>). TMSC homed into the TM region and expressed COX2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>). Similarly, TMEM177 expression was also increased in the TM and ciliary body (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>E-<b>7</b>F</figref>) as well as the transplanted TMSC after TMSC injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0038" level="2">TMSC Secretome Prevents RGC Death In Vitro and In Vivo.</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0103">Preserving and restoring the RGC and their function is the ultimate goal of glaucoma treatment. Pattern electroretinography (PERG) is an optimal approach to evaluate RGC function. PERG shows that TMSC-Scr treatment preserved the RGC function of Tg-MyocY437H mice as indicated by increased amplitude of P1 wave (7.74&#xb1;1.75 &#x3bc;V), similar to that of WT (7.76&#xb1;1.14 &#x3bc;V), while the sham treatment could not recover P1 amplitude (4.05&#xb1;1.95 &#x3bc;V), similar to that of untreated Tg-MyocY437H (5.86&#xb1;2.24 &#x3bc;V) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>). RGC numbers counted from retinal plastic sections showed an average of about 36% loss of the RGC of Tg-MyocY437H mice (24.3&#xb1;7.8 cells/mm) as compared to WT (37.8&#xb1;9.3 cells/mm). This loss was rescued by TMSC-Scr treatment (37.3&#xb1;9.4 cells/mm) while no protective effect was observed in the sham group (28.5&#xb1;9.2 cells/mm) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>D</figref>). Consistently, the optic nerves of Tg-MyocY437H mice had reduced axon number (146.0&#xb1;42.5 axons/400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) as compared to WT control (184.0&#xb1;45.0 axons/400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>). The axon reduction was rescued in mice receiving TMSC-Scr treatment (164.7&#xb1;32.2 axons/400 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>), but sham injection did not show any effect (128.1&#xb1;37.5 axons/400 &#x3bc;m2) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>E-<b>8</b>F</figref>). Gliosis in the optic nerve (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, long streaks), hypertrophy, or proliferation of glial cells in response to neural damage, was correlated to the axonal degeneration in the optic nerve (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>). The gliotic area was increased in Tg-MyocY437H mice and reduced in TMSC-Scr treated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>E and <b>8</b>G</figref>). These results indicate that TMSC-Scr has therapeutic effects on preventing and rescuing RGC from degeneration in a genetic glaucoma model.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0104">To explore the potential of RGC regeneration in a more controlled system, human iPSCs were differentiated to RGC, which expressed RGC markers RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) and Thy1.1 with extensive elongated axons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>). CoCl2 is known to induce RGC apoptosis via induction of hypoxia. After iPSC-RGC cells were treated with 500 &#x3bc;M CoCl2 for 48 h, significant apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining examined by flow cytometry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). TMSC-Scr treatment effectively prevented CoCl2-induced apoptosis, and TMSC-Scr alone (0+TMSC-Scr) did not show cell toxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Autophagosomes become acidic when fused with lysosomes, which results in the loss of green fluorescence in acridine orange, leaving only red fluorescence, so acridine orange has been used to detect cell autophagy. Acidic vesicular organelles in autophagic cells show bright red fluorescence with higher red indicating higher autophagy, while cell cytoplasm and nucleus show green fluorescence. The red fluorescence, an indicator of autophagolysosome formation, was significantly reduced after CoCl2 treatment and increased to normal after TMSC-Scr treatment, associated with increased cell survival (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). The involvement of autophagy was further confirmed by immunoblotting of autophagy proteins Beclin1 and Atg5, which were reduced after CoCl2 treatment and increased after TMSC-Scr treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>). TMSC-Scr had no effect on the levels of Atg7, Atg12, and Atg16L1, which were reduced after CoCl2 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>). The results indicate that TMSC-Scr can protect RGC from apoptosis by modulating autophagy.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">TMSC Secretome Contains Cytoprotective and Neuroprotective Proteins Revealed by Proteomic Analysis.</heading><p id="p-0109" num="0105">The label-free proteomic identification and quantification of secretome proteins from two strains of human TMSC from different donors were performed and compared with the secretomes from two fibroblast strains. Total proteins expressed in secretomes of both TMSC strains and fibroblast strains were identified, and significant gene ontology (GO) terms uncovered in the proteomes of both TMSC and fibroblast secretomes were identified. Total GO terms discovered in the secretomes of TMSC and fibroblasts were also identified. 841 and 1196 total number of proteins were identified from the TMSC1 and TMSC2 secretomes, and 415 and 291 proteins in the secretomes of fibroblast1 and fibroblast2. Out of these, 549 proteins were commonly secreted by both TMSC strains, while 212 proteins were in both fibroblast strains with positive distributed normalized spectral abundance factor (dNSAF) average values. 165 proteins were expressed in both TMSC and fibroblast secretomes, and both cell types showed different expressions for these proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>). As observed by pathway enrichment and comparative analysis, TMSC-Scr showed upregulation of important proteins related to unfolded protein response (UPR), ECM organization proteins, and collagen catabolic process proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref>). TMSC-Scr also showed upregulation of proteins related to protein folding, cell-cell adhesion, and mRNA protein stability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>C-<b>10</b>F</figref>). TMSC-Scr displayed an array of neuroprotective proteins which regulate different aspects of neurogenesis and can account for the neuroprotective effect of TMSC-Scr on RGC. Out of the 549 proteins present in the secretomes of both TMSC strains, 74 proteins related to the axon guidance pathway and 78 proteins involved in neurogenesis were found to be unique to the TMSC-Scr (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>).

A detailed summary of the therapeutic effect induced by TMSC-Scr on various aspects of glaucoma involving different pathways is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">Discussion</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0108">The therapeutic potential of the secretome from human TMSC was explored, and potential mechanisms were discovered. TMSC-Scr was able to prevent as well as reverse Dex-induced TM cell changes in culture. By minimal invasive periocular injection, TMSC-Scr reduced the IOP, increased the TM cellularity, remodeled the ECM of the TM, activated the endogenous stem cells, promoted cell proliferation, and prevented and reversed RGC loss as well as preserved the RGC function in both steroid-induced and genetic myocilin mutant mouse models. The rejuvenating and therapeutic effects of TMSC-Scr on glaucoma are associated with the activation of COX2-PGE2 signaling as well as their neuroprotective proteins. Our novel discovery indicates the feasibility of stem cell-free therapies for glaucoma in preserving both the TM function and RGC function. Steroid-induced ocular hypertension is a common side-effect among patients using steroid therapy. Myocilin mutations have been reported to be the most common form of genetic glaucoma. The results show that Dex treatment leads to increased fibrotic ECM proteins, such as fibronectin as well as myocilin in the TM, resulting in protein misfolding, ER stress, and IOP elevation. A transgenic mouse model with myocilin Y437H mutation is characterized by increased IOP, persistent TM ER stress, and RGC loss and axonal degeneration, which resembles POAG in patients. All these characteristics of the Tg-MyocY437H mice were identified through the disclosed experiments. These two mouse models represent typical steroid-induced and genetic glaucoma. TM cell loss is associated with elevated IOP in glaucoma, and reducing IOP is the only effective treatment so far. TMSC-Scr treatment led to reduced IOP in both mouse models of glaucoma, which started as early as the following week of secretome periocular injection and effectively maintained at normal range two to three weeks after secretome withdrawal when experiments terminated.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0109">CHI3L1 and AQP1 are involved in the TM cell function of remodeling ECM, maintaining TM homeostasis, and modulate aqueous outflow. After Dex-Ac treatment, TM cells lose these proteins and become stiffer. Increased CHI3L1 and AQP1 and reduced glaucoma-associated genes MYOCILIN and ANGPTL7 after TMSC-Scr treatment in Dex-treated TM cells reflect the rejuvenating ability of TMSC-Scr on TM cells. Postoperative fibrosis is a major complication in glaucoma, and fibronectin is the main fibrotic protein. TMSC-Scr treatment in Dex-treated cells shows TMSC-Scr mediated fibrosis reduction. Additionally, secretome treatment increased the number of TM cells reflecting its ability to regenerate TM tissue in vivo. Collagen forms a major connective tissue protein in ECM, and its degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is crucial for remodeling and repairing of tissue. TMSC-Scr treatment dramatically downregulated the fibrotic ECM components fibronectin and collagen IV, which can help TM cell survival. The TMSC-Scr proteins involved in ECM organization and collagen catabolic process can lead to enhanced ECM turnover and lower IOP. ER stress of the TM cells is involved in both glaucoma models. To counteract protein misfolding, cells activate the UPR pathway. ER chaperones GRP78 and CHOP are activated by UPR, resulting in the restoration of ER homeostasis by proteasome-mediated induction of ER-associated degradation. Here, the presence of UPR in TMSC-Scr can further induce the cellular responsiveness of TM cells to reduce ER stress.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0110">Prostaglandin analogs are commonly used for glaucoma treatment to reduce IOP. COX2, a rate-limiting enzyme, is known to convert arachidonic acid to PGH2, which is isomerized to PGE2 by PGE2 synthase. COX2 modulates PGE2 synthesis in response to growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and other physiological demands. Under normal conditions, COX2 is restricted mostly in the kidney. COX2 expression can be increased substantially in other tissues in response to proinflammatory cytokines or sheer stress. COX2 expression is completely lost in the non-pigmented secretory epithelium of the ciliary body and aqueous humor of end-stage POAG human eyes. Glucocorticoids are well known for inhibiting COX2 activity. Human TM cells can secrete PGE2, which was inhibited significantly after a moderate Dex treatment. Mitochondrial TMEM177 has also been reported to associate with COX2 to stabilize/increase the biogenesis of COX2. Hence, increased TMEM177 after TMSC-Scr treatment can be responsible for increased COX2 stabilization and biogenesis, which further indicates its therapeutic potential for glaucoma. Further evaluation of increased TMEM177/COX2 expression in Tg-MyocY437H mice after TMSC transplantation confirmed that both stem cell-based and cell-free therapy involves upregulation of COX2 to impart a therapeutic benefit.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0111">Mobilization and maintenance of endogenous stem cells are very crucial for inducing tissue regeneration. Endogenous stem cell regeneration involves a complex interplay of cues in terms of growth factors, modulation in stem cell niche, and chemokines inducing differentiation, proliferation, and migration of these cells. Glaucoma and ER stress can decrease endogenous stem cells and increase apoptosis. PGE2 has been reported to increase the self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells. Increased PGE2 secretion in the aqueous humor of both mouse models after TMSC-Scr treatment can be crucial for maintaining the ABCB5+ and OCT4+ endogenous stem cells and reversing glaucomatous changes. The stem cell proliferation and renewal are further enhanced by TMSC-Scr by the presence of crucial proteins involved in promoting cell proliferation and stemness in progenitor cells. Hypoxia can lead to RGC death by inducing a number of degenerative changes. The increased secretion of response to hypoxia proteins in TMSC-Scr can be responsible for RGC survival/rescue in hypoxic conditions. The optic nerve is a tract of the central nervous system and is comprised of axons of RGC with various glial cells like oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia as support cells. Neurodegeneration of RGC results in alteration of structure, function, and gene expression profile of glial cells, termed as gliosis. Gliosis is associated with neurodegeneration in chronic and age-related models of glaucoma. Reduced gliosis after TMSC-Scr treatment can further enhance regeneration in RGC. The proteins uncovered in TMSC-Scr involving proteins related to axon guidance pathway, neurogenesis, negative regulation of neuron death, and clearance of neuron apoptotic process can directly enhance RGC protection, survival, and function by activation of some intrinsic developmental pathways, which can result in RGC regeneration, which will be interesting for future investigations. Furthermore, therapeutic effects of TMSC-Scr given through the periocular route emphasize that secretome proteins can cross the corneal barrier and can be a good approach for the development of glaucoma eye drops. Autophagy has been reported to promote RGC survival following optic nerve axotomy. TMSC-Scr was able to restore the levels of Beclin1 and Atg5 indicating that TMSC-Scr induced increased autophagy is mediated by these proteins.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0112">Stem cell secretome therapy, with low risk, minimal invasive administration, and effectiveness, is an attractive treatment strategy for glaucoma, which can be soon for clinical trials after confirmation in animals more relevant to humans like non-human primates. The key secretome proteins that have been identified in the current experiments can potentially lead to the designing of small molecule-based therapeutics for glaucoma in the future.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="1">10.
