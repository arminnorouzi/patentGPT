The C in CpG is mostly methylated, with a methyl group attached thereto. This methylation of CpG inhibits the expression of repetitive sequences in the genome, such as Alu or transposons, and CpG is the site where extragenic changes most frequently occur in mammalian cells. 5-mC of this CpG is naturally converted into T through deamination. Accordingly, CpG appears in the mammalian genome with a frequency of only 1%, which is much lower than the normal frequency thereof (&#xbc;&#xd7;&#xbc;=6.25%).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are regions called CpG sites (CpG islands) in which CpGs are exceptionally dense. A CpG site is 0.2-3 kb in length, and is a highly concentrated region in which the distribution percentage of C and G bases is greater than 50% and the distribution percentage of CpG is 3.75% or more. About 45,000 CpG sites appear in the entire human genome, and are intensively found in the promoter region, which regulates gene expression. Indeed, CpG sites appear in promoters of housekeeping genes, which account for about half of human genes (Cross S. et al., Curr. Opin. Gene Develop., 5:309, 1995). Abnormal DNA methylation is known to occur mainly in the 5&#x2032; regulatory region of the corresponding gene, thereby reducing expression of the corresponding gene.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, in somatic cells of normal persons, the CpG islands of these housekeeping gene promoter regions are not methylated, but imprinted genes and inactivated genes on the X chromosome are methylated so as to prevent expression thereof during development.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During the carcinogenesis process, methylation occurs in the promoter CpG island, and expression of the corresponding gene is impaired. In particular, when methylation occurs in the regulatory region CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell cycles or apoptosis, repair DNA, participate in cell adhesion and intercellular interaction, and inhibit invasion and metastasis, the expression and function of these genes are blocked, like mutations in coding sequences, thereby promoting the development and progression of cancer. Partial methylation may also appear on CpG islands due to aging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regulatory region methylation of tumor-related genes is an important indicator of cancer, so it may be used in various ways, such as diagnosis and early diagnosis of cancer, prediction of cancer risk, prediction of cancer prognosis, follow-up after treatment, prediction of response to anticancer therapy, and the like. Indeed, recent attempts have been actively made to investigate the promoter methylation of tumor-related genes in the blood, sputum, saliva, stool, urine, and the like, and to use the results thereof in the treatment of various types of cancer (Ahlquist, D. A. et al., Gastroenterol., 119:1219, 2000).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Against this technical background, the inventors of the present application have ascertained that methylation of colorectal cancer marker genes may be detected with high detection limit and accuracy using primers specifically amplifying a plurality of methylated colorectal cancer marker genes, thus culminating in the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of providing information for diagnosing colorectal cancer using primers specifically amplifying a plurality of methylated colorectal cancer marker genes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition for diagnosing colorectal cancer using primers specifically amplifying a plurality of methylated colorectal cancer marker genes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a kit for diagnosing colorectal cancer including the composition.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to accomplish the above objects, the present invention provides a method of providing information for diagnosing colorectal cancer including (a) treating a sample with at least one reagent differently modifying methylated SDC2 (syndecan 2) and ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing 1) genes and non-methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes and (b) performing treatment with primers specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the present invention provides a composition for diagnosing colorectal cancer including at least one reagent differently modifying methylated SDC2 (syndecan 2) and ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing 1) genes and non-methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes and primers specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the present invention provides a kit for diagnosing colorectal cancer including the composition.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the results of genome-level methylation analysis (MeDIA-CpG microarray) using cancer tissue of colorectal cancer surgery patients and normal tissue DNA adjacent thereto;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the results of amplification using methylation-specific primers on the ADHFE1 gene;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the results of amplification using methylation-specific primers on the ADHFE1 gene; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the results of diagnosing colorectal cancer by detecting methylation of the SDC2 gene and methylation of the ADHFE1 gene in normal persons and colorectal cancer patients.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">MODE FOR INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as those typically understood by those skilled in the art to which the present invention belongs. Generally, the nomenclature used herein is well known in the art and is typical.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors of the present application have ascertained that the sensitivity and specificity of detection of methylated DNA may be improved using primers specifically amplifying a plurality of methylated colorectal cancer marker genes, compared to the extent of methylation detection based on a single colorectal cancer marker gene. In a specific embodiment according to the present invention, compared to the detection of methylation of the SDC2 gene, the sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer diagnosis were improved by detecting methylation of the SDC2 gene and the ADHFE1 gene, and thus usefulness in diagnosing colorectal cancer was high.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of providing information for diagnosing colorectal cancer including (a) treating a sample with at least one reagent differently modifying methylated SDC2 (syndecan 2) and ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing 1) genes and non-methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes and (b) performing treatment with primers specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, step (a) is treating the sample with at least one reagent differently modifying the methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes and the non-methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;methylation&#x201d; means modification into 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), in which a methyl group is attached to the fifth carbon of a cytosine base ring, and 5-methylcytosine is always attached only to C of the CG dinucleotide (5&#x2032;-mCG-3&#x2032;), and this CG is often referred to as CpG. Methylation of CpG inhibits the expression of repetitive sequences in the genome, such as Alu or transposons, and CpG is the site where extragenic changes most frequently occur in mammalian cells. 5-mC of this CpG is naturally converted into T through deamination, and thus, CpG is present in the mammalian genome at a frequency of only 1%, which is much lower than the normal frequency thereof (&#xbc;&#xd7;&#xbc;=6.25%).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There are regions called CpG islands in which CpGs are exceptionally dense. A CpG island is 0.2-3 kb in length, and is a highly concentrated site in which the distribution percentage of C and G bases is greater than 50% and the distribution percentage of CpG is 3.75% or more. About 45,000 CpG islands appear in the entire human genome, and are intensively found in the promoter region, which regulates gene expression. CpG islands actually appear in promoters of housekeeping genes, which account for about half of human genes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The nucleic acid isolated from a specimen is obtained from a biological sample of the specimen. In order to diagnose colorectal cancer or the progression of colorectal cancer, the nucleic acid has to be isolated from colorectal tissue by scraping or biopsy. Such a sample may be obtained through various medical procedures known in the art.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The extent of methylation of the nucleic acid of the sample obtained from the specimen is measured through comparison with the same portion of the nucleic acid from a specimen without a colorectal tissue cell growth abnormality. Hypermethylation indicates the presence of a methylated allele in at least one nucleic acid. When the same nucleic acid is tested in a specimen without a colorectal tissue cell growth abnormality, the methylated allele does not appear.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Normal&#x201d; cells are cells that do not show abnormal cell morphology or a change in cytological properties. &#x201c;Tumor&#x201d; cells are cancer cells, and &#x201c;non-tumor&#x201d; cells are cells that are part of the diseased tissue but are not the site of the tumor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, early diagnosis of cell growth abnormalities in the colorectal tissue of a specimen is possible by determining the methylation stage of at least one nucleic acid isolated from the specimen. The methylation stage of at least one nucleic acid may be compared with the methylation stage of at least one nucleic acid isolated from a specimen not exhibiting abnormal colorectal tissue cell growth. Preferably, the nucleic acid is a CpG-containing nucleic acid such as a CpG island.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the present invention, it is possible to diagnose predisposition to cell growth abnormalities in the colorectal tissue of a specimen, including determining the methylation of at least one nucleic acid isolated from the specimen. The methylation stage of at least one nucleic acid may be compared with the methylation stage of at least one nucleic acid isolated from a specimen having no predisposition to abnormal cell growth in colorectal tissue.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;predisposition&#x201d; refers to the property of being susceptible to the above-mentioned cell growth abnormality. A specimen having a predisposition is a specimen which does not yet exhibit a cell growth abnormality but in which a cell growth abnormality is present or in which the likelihood of developing a cell growth abnormality is increased.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The presence of CpG methylation in target DNA may be an indicator of a disease, and, for example, CpG methylation of any one of a promoter, a 5&#x2032; untranslated region, and an intron of target DNA may be measured.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The CpG-containing gene is typically DNA. However, the method of the present invention may be performed using a sample containing, for example, DNA, or DNA and RNA including mRNA, in which the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, or a sample containing a DNA-RNA hybrid may be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A nucleic acid mixture may also be used. As used herein, the term &#x201c;multiple&#x201d; includes both the case in which there is a plurality of specific nucleic acid sequence sites to be detected in a gene and the case in which a plurality of target DNA sequences is included in one tube (a single reactor). The specific nucleic acid sequence to be detected may be a fraction of a large molecule, or may initially be present in the form of a discrete molecule in which the specific sequence constitutes the entire nucleic acid sequence. The nucleic acid sequence need not be a nucleic acid present in a pure form, and the nucleic acid may be a minor fraction of a complex mixture, such as one contained in whole human DNA.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Particularly, the present invention is directed to detecting methylation of a plurality of target DNA sequences in a sample in a single reactor, in which the sample may include multiple target DNA sequences, and any target DNA may be used without limitation, so long as it is a gene that affects the development or progression of colorectal cancer when expression thereof is suppressed due to abnormal methylation, as well as a control gene.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present invention, the sample may be derived from a human body, and the sample may include, for example, colorectal cancer tissue, cell, stool, urine, blood, serum, or plasma.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At least one reagent differently modifying the methylated DNA and the non-methylated DNA may be used without limitation, so long as it is able to distinguish between the non-methylated cytosine base and the methylated cytosine base, and examples of the reagent may include, but are not limited to, bisulfite, hydrogen sulfite, disulfite, and combinations thereof. Particularly, when treated with the reagent, the methylated cytosine base is not converted, and the non-methylated cytosine base may be converted into uracil or a base other than cytosine.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present invention, step (b) is performing treatment with primers specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 gene and the methylated ADHFE1 gene.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the primers, for example, forward and reverse primers may be paired and used simultaneously for PCR. The methylated &#x201c;C&#x201d; of the CpG region is necessarily positioned at the 3&#x2032; end of the primers, thereby exhibiting high specificity for methylation detection. The forward primer specifically amplifying the methylated ADHFE1 gene may include, for example, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 4. The reverse primer may include, for example, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 5. The primer specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 gene may include the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 or 11.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention may further include performing treatment with a probe capable of complementary hybridization to each of the methylated SDC2 gene and the methylated ADHFE1 gene specifically amplified using the primers in step (b).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a hybridization reaction, the conditions used to achieve a certain stringent level vary depending on the properties of the nucleic acid to be hybridized. For example, the length of the nucleic acid site to be hybridized, the extent of homology, the nucleotide sequence composition (e.g. GC/AT ratio), and the nucleic acid type (e.g. RNA, DNA) are taken into consideration in selecting the hybridization conditions. An additional consideration is whether the nucleic acid is immobilized on, for example, a filter or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples of very stringent conditions are as follows: 2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature (hybridization conditions), 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature (low-stringency conditions), 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at 42&#xb0; C. (moderate-stringency conditions), and 0.1&#xd7;SSC at 68&#xb0; C. (high-stringency conditions). The washing process may be performed using any one of these conditions, and, for example, high-stringency conditions or any of the above conditions may be used. The conditions may be applied for 10 to 15 minutes each time in the order described above, or all or some of the conditions described above may be repeatedly applied. As described above, however, the optimal conditions vary depending on the particular hybridization reaction that is involved, and may be determined experimentally. Generally, high-stringency conditions are used for hybridization of the probe of interest.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The probe capable of complementary hybridization to the amplified methylated SDC2 gene may include, for example, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or 6. The probe capable of complementary hybridization to the amplified methylated ADHFE1 gene may include the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some cases, the probe may be detectably labeled, and may be labeled with, for example, a radioactive isotope, a fluorescent compound, a bioluminescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, a metal chelate, or an enzyme. Appropriate labeling of the probe as described above is a technique that is well known in the art, and may be performed through a typical method.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The amount of the amplification product may be detected based on a fluorescence signal. The detection method may include an intercalating method using an intercalator that exhibits fluorescence by binding to the double-stranded DNA of the amplification product to which the probe is bound, a method of using an oligonucleotide in which the 5&#x2032; end is labeled with a fluorescent material and the 3&#x2032; end is labeled with a quencher, or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amplification according to the present invention may be performed through real-time quantitative amplification, for example, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in real-time PCR, the amount of a PCR amplification product may be detected using a fluorescence signal. As real-time PCR proceeds, the intensity of the fluorescence signal increases in proportion to the increase in the amount of the polynucleotide, and an amplification profile curve showing the intensity of the fluorescence signal depending on the number of amplification cycles is obtained.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, the amplification profile curve is divided into a baseline region, which shows a fluorescence signal in the background that does not substantially reflect the amount of polynucleotide, an exponential region, in which the fluorescence signal increases with an increase in the amount of a polynucleotide product, and a plateau region, in which PCR reaches saturation and thus the intensity of the fluorescence signal no longer increases.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Typically, the fluorescence signal intensity at the transition point from the baseline region to the exponential region, namely at the point at which the amount of the PCR amplification product reaches an amount detectable by fluorescence, is referred to as a threshold, and the number of amplification cycles corresponding to the threshold value on the amplification profile curve is referred to as a threshold cycle (Ct) value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">By measuring the Ct value, analyzing the standard curve in which the concentration is determined based on the Ct (threshold cycle) value for a standard material, and confirming the concentration of the amplified gene, methylation-specific sensitivity and/or specificity may be determined.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the methylation may be detected using any method selected from the group consisting of PCR, methylation-specific PCR, real-time methylation-specific PCR, PCR using a methylated-DNA-specific binding protein, PCR using a methylated-DNA-specific binding antibody, quantitative PCR, gene chip, sequencing, sequencing by synthesis, and sequencing by ligation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">(1) Methylation-specific PCR: For detection by methylation-specific PCR, when treated with a bisulfate, the cytosine in the 5&#x2032;-CpG&#x2032;-3 region remains as cytosine in the case of methylation, and is converted into uracil in the case of non-methylation. Therefore, a primer corresponding to a region in which the 5&#x2032;-CpG-3&#x2032; nucleotide sequence exists may be constructed for the modified nucleotide sequence obtained after treatment with bisulfite. When PCR is performed using primers, in the case of methylation, a PCR product is made due to the use of the primers corresponding to the methylated nucleotide sequence, and methylation may be confirmed through agarose gel electrophoresis. Here, the methylation detection probe may be TaqMan, Molecular Beacon, or a probe having a self-reporting function or an energy-transfer labeling function, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">(2) Real-time methylation-specific PCR: Real-time methylation-specific PCR is a real-time measurement method modified from methylation-specific PCR, and includes treating genomic DNA with bisulfite, designing PCR primers corresponding to the methylated case, and performing real-time PCR using the primers. Here, there are two detection methods: a detection method using a TaqMan probe complementary to the amplified nucleotide sequence and a detection method using SYBR Green. Therefore, real-time methylation-specific PCR is capable of selectively quantitatively analyzing only methylated DNA. As such, a standard curve is created using an in-vitro methylated DNA sample, and a gene having no 5&#x2032;-CpG-3&#x2032; sequence in the nucleotide sequence is also amplified as a negative control for standardization, thus quantitatively analyzing the extent of methylation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(3) PCR using methylated-DNA-specific binding protein, quantitative PCR, and DNA chip assay: In PCR using a methylated-DNA-specific binding protein or the DNA chip method, when a protein that specifically binds only to methylated DNA is mixed with DNA, the protein specifically binds only to methylated DNA, so methylated DNA may be selectively isolated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, methylation may be measured through quantitative PCR, and methylated DNA isolated with the methylated-DNA-specific binding protein is labeled with a fluorescent dye and hybridized to a DNA chip integrated with complementary probes, thereby measuring methylation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">(4) Detection of differential methylation bisulfite sequencing method: Another method of detecting a nucleic acid containing methylated CpG includes bringing a nucleic-acid-containing sample into contact with an agent that modifies non-methylated cytosine and amplifying the CpG-containing nucleic acid in the sample using CpG-specific oligonucleotide primers. Here, the oligonucleotide primers may be characterized in that the methylated nucleic acid is detected by distinguishing between modified methylated and non-methylated nucleic acids. The amplification step is optional and preferable, but not essential. This method relies on the PCR reaction to distinguish between modified (e.g. chemically modified) methylated DNA and non-methylated DNA.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(5) Bisulfite sequencing method: Another method of detecting a nucleic acid containing methylated CpG includes bringing a nucleic-acid-containing sample into contact with an agent that modifies non-methylated cytosine and amplifying the CpG-containing nucleic acid in the sample using methylation-independent oligonucleotide primers. Here, the oligonucleotide primers may be characterized in that the nucleic acid is amplified without distinguishing between modified methylated and non-methylated nucleic acids. The amplification product has been described in connection with bisulfite sequencing for detection of methylated nucleic acids by next-generation sequencing methods or for sequencing by the Sanger method using a sequencing primer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">(6) Next-generation sequencing methods include a sequencing-by-synthesis method and a sequencing-by-ligation method. These methods are characterized in that, instead of creating a bacterial clone, a single DNA fragment is spatially separated, amplified in situ (clonal amplification), and sequenced. Here, since hundreds of thousands of fragments are read simultaneously, such a method is also called a massively parallel sequencing method.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Basically, a sequencing-by-synthesis method is performed, a method of obtaining signals by sequentially attaching mono- or di-nucleotides is used, and examples thereof may include pyrosequencing, ion torrent, and Solexa methods.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Examples of NGS devices based on the sequencing-by-synthesis method include Roche's 454 platform, Illumina's HiSeq platform, Life Technology's Ion PGM platform, and Pacific BioSciences' PacBio platform. 454 and Ion PGM use emulsion PCR as a clonal amplification method, and HiSeq uses bridge amplification. The sequencing-by-synthesis method reads the sequence by detecting phosphate, protons, or pre-attached fluorescence generated when DNA is synthesized by sequentially attaching one nucleotide. In the method of detecting the sequence, 454 uses a pyrosequencing method using phosphate, and Ion PGM uses proton detection. HiSeq and PacBio detect fluorescence to decode the sequence.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A sequencing-by-ligation method is a sequencing technique using DNA ligase, which identifies nucleotides at certain positions in a DNA nucleotide sequence. Unlike most sequencing techniques using a polymerase, the sequencing-by-ligation method does not use a polymerase and is characterized in that DNA ligase does not ligate mismatched sequences. An example thereof is the SOLiD system. In this technique, two bases are read with spacing, which is repeated five times independently through primer reset, so accuracy is improved by reading each base twice in duplicate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the sequencing-by-ligation method, among the dinucleotide primer sets made of 16 combinations, dinucleotide primers corresponding to the nucleotide sequences are sequentially ligated, the combination of these ligations is finally analyzed, and the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding DNA is completed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, the next-generation sequencing method may be exemplified by a sequencing-by-synthesis method or a sequencing-by-ligation method. The methylated-DNA-specific binding protein includes, but is not limited to, MBD2bt, and the antibody is a 5&#x2032;-methyl-cytosine antibody, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With regard to the primer used in the present invention, when a reagent such as bisulfite is used in step (a), the cytosine in the 5&#x2032;-CpG&#x2032;-3 site remains as cytosine in the case of methylation, and is converted into uracil in the case of non-methylation. Therefore, a primer corresponding to a region in which the 5&#x2032;-CpG-3&#x2032; nucleotide sequence exists may be constructed for the modified nucleotide sequence obtained after treatment with a reagent, such as bisulfite.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The primer may be constructed to have &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; complementarity with each strand of the gene locus to be amplified. This means that the primer has sufficient complementarity to hybridize with the corresponding nucleic acid strand under conditions for the polymerization reaction.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a composition for diagnosing colorectal cancer including at least one reagent differently modifying methylated syndecan 2 (SDC2) and ADHFE1 genes and non-methylated SDC2 and ADHFE1 genes and primers specifically amplifying the methylated SDC2 gene and the methylated ADHFE1 gene.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since the components contained in the composition according to the present invention overlap the components described above, a description thereof applies equally thereto.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Still another aspect of the present invention pertains to a kit for detecting methylation of target DNA including the composition described above.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, the kit includes compartmentalized carrier means that accommodates a sample therein, a container including a reagent, and a container including a primer for each of the methylated SDC2 gene and the methylated ADHFE1 gene.
