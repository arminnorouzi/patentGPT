Therefore, governments of each country have establish emission standards for pollutants in exhaust gas such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for exhaust gas regulation, and these exhaust gas regulations are gradually being strengthened.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, automobile manufacturers are making a lot of effort to effectively respond to stricter exhaust gas regulations, and new vehicles are being produced in accordance with exhaust gas emission standards.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, in order to meet the exhaust gas emission standards in automobiles, a three-way catalyst converter supported with noble metals is mounted in an exhaust system to promote decomposition of hydrocarbons, oxidation of carbon monoxide, and reduction of nitrogen oxides.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The three-way catalyst refers to a catalyst that simultaneously reacts with hydrocarbon-based compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are harmful components of exhaust gas, to remove these compounds. The three-way catalyst performs a function of reducing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and reducing nitrogen oxides according to changes in lean (excessive oxygen) and rich (excessive fuel) states based on an air-fuel ratio of exhaust gas.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, these three-way catalysts have a problem in that the conversion rate of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the lean region rapidly drops. In addition, the three-way catalyst has a problem in that ammonia (NH3) is generated in a rich region in the process of reducing nitrogen oxides, and a large amount of nitrous oxide (NO2) is generated at a low temperature.

Therefore, the exemplary embodiments described in the present specification and the configurations illustrated in the drawings are merely the most preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention and are not intended to represent all of the technical ideas of the present invention, and thus, it should be understood that various equivalents and modifications capable of replacing the exemplary embodiments at the time of this application.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention provides a catalyst for simultaneously inhibiting the emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide by doping an iridium-ruthenium catalyst component into a three-way catalyst (TWC), a diesel oxidation catalyst, or a lean NOx trap supported on a honeycomb support.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, in order to meet the exhaust gas emission standards in automobiles, a three-way catalyst converter supported with noble metals is mounted in an exhaust system to promote decomposition of hydrocarbons, oxidation of carbon monoxides, and reduction of nitrogen oxides.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The three-way catalyst refers to a catalyst that simultaneously reacts with harmful components such as hydrocarbon compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gas to remove these compounds, mainly Pt/Rh, Pd/Rh or Pt/Pd/Rh-based three-way catalysts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The three-way catalyst according to the present invention may increase a nitrogen oxide conversion rate by doping the iridium-ruthenium catalyst into the support on which the commercial three-way catalyst described above is supported.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, the three-way catalyst according to the present invention may simultaneously inhibit the emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide by doping the iridium-ruthenium catalyst into the support on which the commercial three-way catalyst is supported.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The support may be Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, CexZr1-xO2, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an embodiment of the present invention, after the support is primarily doped with ruthenium, iridium may be secondarily doped. In addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in order to prevent iridium from being doped before ruthenium, it is also preferred to dope ruthenium and iridium at the same time. Through the doping method, iridium and ruthenium may be prepared in an alloy state.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When iridium is doped first, iridium and ruthenium exist separately due to a strong interaction between iridium and the support, so that a synergistic effect between iridium and ruthenium cannot be expected.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The support may be uniformly doped with an iridium-ruthenium catalyst. In this case, the iridium-ruthenium catalyst may be applied to the support and a calcinating process may be further performed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The calcinating may be performed at a temperature of 300 to 800&#xb0; C. When the calcinating temperature is less than 300&#xb0; C., the precursor cannot be removed, and an iridium-ruthenium alloy cannot be formed. In addition, when the calcinating temperature is more than 800&#xb0; C., the catalytic performance may be deteriorated due to catalyst calcinating and volatilization, it is preferred to be calcinated within the temperature range.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Conventional three-way catalysts generally use a method of applying metal powder slurry, which is a catalyst component, to a support by wash coating. Therefore, there is a problem in that it is difficult to add a catalyst component to improve the performance of aged three-way catalysts or three-way catalysts already included in mass-produced automobiles.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, since the present invention uses a simple manufacturing method of dipping the three-way catalyst into a metal precursor solution without using a metal powder slurry coating that requires a separate support and is difficult to establish a process in order to coat the iridium-ruthenium on the three-way catalyst, there are also economic advantages.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The iridium-ruthenium catalyst according to the present invention may contain iridium in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt %. If the iridium is contained in an amount of less than 0.1 wt %, the low catalyst content may cause a decrease in performance, and if the content of the iridium is more than 10 wt %, there is a problem that the performance of the existing three-way catalyst may be reduced due to the high catalyst content, and the catalyst price is increased, so that the above range is preferable.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The iridium may be easily converted to a water-soluble or partially water-soluble compound, and may be prepared from any iridium compound that may be deposited on the support. For example, iridium in a metallic state, an iridium salt, an iridium oxide, etc. are preferable, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As the iridium salt, halogenated iridium is generally used. More specifically, the halogenated iridium may include IrI3, IrBr3, IrCl3, IrI3.4H2O and IrBr3.4H2O, but is not limited thereto, and IrCl3 is preferably used.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The iridium-ruthenium catalyst according to the present invention may contain ruthenium in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt %. If the ruthenium is contained in an amount of less than 0.1 wt %, the low catalyst content may cause a decrease in performance, and if the content of the ruthenium is more than 10 wt %, there is a problem that the performance of the existing three-way catalyst may be reduced due to the high catalyst content, and the catalyst price is increased, so that the above range is preferable.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The ruthenium may be easily converted to a water-soluble or partially water-soluble compound, and may be prepared from any ruthenium compound that may be deposited on the support. Examples of the ruthenium compound include RuCl3, and Ru(NO)(NO3)3, but is not limited thereto, and RuCl3 is preferably used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to an embodiment of the present invention, other noble metal components may be additionally doped in addition to the iridium-ruthenium catalyst.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The noble metal component that can be additionally doped may be at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium, and silver.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a three-way catalyst system for purifying exhaust gas capable of increasing the reduction performance of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in an area where an air/fuel ratio (A/F) of exhaust gas is 14.7 (&#x3bb;=1) or more, by using a catalyst for simultaneously inhibiting the emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide by doping an iridium-ruthenium catalyst component into a three-way catalyst (TWC), a diesel oxidation catalyst, or a lean NOx trap supported on a honeycomb support.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the present invention, when the iridium-ruthenium catalyst component is doped into the three-way catalyst supported on the support, the reduction performance of nitrogen oxides is increased in a lean region in which the air/fuel ratio (&#x3bb;) of exhaust gas is 1 or more.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The three-way catalyst system according to an embodiment of the present invention may inhibit the emission of ammonia at a temperature of 300 to 400&#xb0; C. Existing three-way catalysts have a problem that ammonia is emitted by mixing nitrogen in the air when the engine is operated in a rich region, but when the iridium-ruthenium catalyst according to the present invention is doped into the three-way catalyst, there is an advantageous effect that ammonia is not emitted.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the three-way catalyst system according to an embodiment of the present invention, in a rich region in which the air/fuel ratio of exhaust gas is 14.7 (&#x3bb;=1) or less at a temperature of 300 to 400&#xb0; C., it is advantageous that the conversion rate of carbon monoxide (CO) is 80% increased compared to the existing three-way catalysts.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, according to the present invention, it can be expected to increase the conversion performance of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide to 40 to 50% or more as compared to commercial three-way catalysts at a low temperature of 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Most of nitrous oxide emitted from automobiles is generated from automobiles equipped with the three-way catalysts. An increase in the concentration of nitrous oxide leads to the destruction of an ozone layer, and the emission amount of nitrous oxide increases when the nitrogen component during combustion of automobiles is combusted at a low temperature or the three-way catalyst deteriorates due to a long driving distance. However, according to the present invention, the effect of inhibiting the emission of nitrous oxide compared to the commercial three-way catalyst may be expected.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides an exhaust gas post-treating apparatus comprising a three-way catalyst for simultaneously inhibiting the emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide by doping an iridium-ruthenium catalyst component into a three-way catalyst (TWC), a diesel oxidation catalyst, or a lean NOx trap supported on a honeycomb support.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples for specific description.
