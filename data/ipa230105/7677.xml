DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sidelink (SL) communication is a communication scheme in which a direct link is established between User Equipments (UEs) and the UEs exchange voice and data directly with each other without intervention of an evolved Node B (eNB). SL communication is under consideration as a solution to the overhead of an eNB caused by rapidly increasing data traffic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to a communication technology through which a vehicle exchanges information with another vehicle, a pedestrian, an object having an infrastructure (or infra) established therein, and so on. The V2X may be divided into 4 types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P). The V2X communication may be provided via a PC5 interface and/or Uu interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a wider range of communication devices require larger communication capacities, the need for mobile broadband communication that is more enhanced than the existing Radio Access Technology (RAT) is rising. Accordingly, discussions are made on services and user equipment (UE) that are sensitive to reliability and latency. And, a next generation radio access technology that is based on the enhanced mobile broadband communication, massive Machine Type Communication (MTC), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and so on, may be referred to as a new radio access technology (RAT) or new radio (NR). Herein, the NR may also support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing for describing V2X communication based on NR, compared to V2X communication based on RAT used before NR. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding V2X communication, a scheme of providing a safety service, based on a V2X message such as Basic Safety Message (BSM), Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM), and Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) is focused in the discussion on the RAT used before the NR. The V2X message may include position information, dynamic information, attribute information, or the like. For example, a UE may transmit a periodic message type CAM and/or an event triggered message type DENM to another UE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the CAM may include dynamic state information of the vehicle such as direction and speed, static data of the vehicle such as a size, and basic vehicle information such as an exterior illumination state, route details, or the like. For example, the UE may broadcast the CAM, and latency of the CAM may be less than 100 ms. For example, the UE may generate the DENM and transmit it to another UE in an unexpected situation such as a vehicle breakdown, accident, or the like. For example, all vehicles within a transmission range of the UE may receive the CAM and/or the DENM. In this case, the DENM may have a higher priority than the CAM.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereafter, regarding V2X communication, various V2X scenarios are proposed in NR. For example, the various V2X scenarios may include vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, based on the vehicle platooning, vehicles may move together by dynamically forming a group. For example, in order to perform platoon operations based on the vehicle platooning, the vehicles belonging to the group may receive periodic data from a leading vehicle. For example, the vehicles belonging to the group may decrease or increase an interval between the vehicles by using the periodic data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, based on the advanced driving, the vehicle may be semi-automated or fully automated. For example, each vehicle may adjust trajectories or maneuvers, based on data obtained from a local sensor of a proximity vehicle and/or a proximity logical entity. In addition, for example, each vehicle may share driving intention with proximity vehicles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, based on the extended sensors, raw data, processed data, or live video data obtained through the local sensors may be exchanged between a vehicle, a logical entity, a UE of pedestrians, and/or a V2X application server. Therefore, for example, the vehicle may recognize a more improved environment than an environment in which a self-sensor is used for detection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, based on the remote driving, for a person who cannot drive or a remote vehicle in a dangerous environment, a remote driver or a V2X application may operate or control the remote vehicle. For example, if a route is predictable such as public transportation, cloud computing based driving may be used for the operation or control of the remote vehicle. In addition, for example, an access for a cloud-based back-end service platform may be considered for the remote driving.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, a scheme of specifying service requirements for various V2X scenarios such as vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like is discussed in NR-based V2X communication.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Objects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure provides a method for communication between devices (or UEs) based on V2X communication, and device(s) (or UE(s)) performing the method.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure provides a method for performing LTE sidelink transmission based on a timing offset in NR V2X, and device(s) (or UE(s)) performing the method.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Based on an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for performing sidelink (SL) communication by a first device may be provided.

Among them, a physical (PHY) layer belonging to the first layer provides an information transfer service by using a physical channel, and a radio resource control (RRC) layer belonging to the third layer serves to control a radio resource between the UE and the network. For this, the RRC layer exchanges an RRC message between the UE and the BS.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show a radio protocol architecture, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The physical layer is connected to a medium access control (MAC) layer which is an upper layer of the physical layer through a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the physical layer through the transport channel The transport channel is classified according to how and with what characteristics data is transmitted through a radio interface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Between different physical layers, i.e., a physical layer of a transmitter and a physical layer of a receiver, data are transferred through the physical channel The physical channel is modulated using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and utilizes time and frequency as a radio resource.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The MAC layer provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer, which is a higher layer of the MAC layer, via a logical channel. The MAC layer provides a function of mapping multiple logical channels to multiple transport channels. The MAC layer also provides a function of logical channel multiplexing by mapping multiple logical channels to a single transport channel. The MAC layer provides data transfer services over logical channels.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The RLC layer performs concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of Radio Link Control Service Data Unit (RLC SDU). In order to ensure diverse quality of service (QoS) required by a radio bearer (RB), the RLC layer provides three types of operation modes, i.e., a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode (UM), and an acknowledged mode (AM). An AM RLC provides error correction through an automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A radio resource control (RRC) layer is defined only in the control plane. The RRC layer serves to control the logical channel, the transport channel, and the physical channel in association with configuration, reconfiguration and release of RBs. The RB is a logical path provided by the first layer (i.e., the physical layer or the PHY layer) and the second layer (i.e., the MAC layer, the RLC layer, and the packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer) for data delivery between the UE and the network.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Functions of a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer in the user plane include user data delivery, header compression, and ciphering. Functions of a PDCP layer in the control plane include control-plane data delivery and ciphering/integrity protection.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer is defined only in a user plane. The SDAP layer performs mapping between a Quality of Service (QoS) flow and a data radio bearer (DRB) and QoS flow ID (QFI) marking in both DL and UL packets.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The configuration of the RB implies a process for specifying a radio protocol layer and channel properties to provide a particular service and for determining respective detailed parameters and operations. The RB can be classified into two types, i.e., a signaling RB (SRB) and a data RB (DRB). The SRB is used as a path for transmitting an RRC message in the control plane. The DRB is used as a path for transmitting user data in the user plane.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When an RRC connection is established between an RRC layer of the UE and an RRC layer of the E-UTRAN, the UE is in an RRC_CONNECTED state, and, otherwise, the UE may be in an RRC_IDLE state. In case of the NR, an RRC_INACTIVE state is additionally defined, and a UE being in the RRC_INACTIVE state may maintain its connection with a core network whereas its connection with the BS is released.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Data is transmitted from the network to the UE through a downlink transport channel. Examples of the downlink transport channel include a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting system information and a downlink-shared channel (SCH) for transmitting user traffic or control messages. Traffic of downlink multicast or broadcast services or the control messages can be transmitted on the downlink-SCH or an additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Data is transmitted from the UE to the network through an uplink transport channel. Examples of the uplink transport channel include a random access channel (RACH) for transmitting an initial control message and an uplink SCH for transmitting user traffic or control messages.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Examples of logical channels belonging to a higher channel of the transport channel and mapped onto the transport channels include a broadcast channel (BCCH), a paging control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control channel (MCCH), a multicast traffic channel (MTCH), etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The physical channel includes several OFDM symbols in a time domain and several sub-carriers in a frequency domain. One sub-frame includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in the time domain. A resource block is a unit of resource allocation, and consists of a plurality of OFDM symbols and a plurality of sub-carriers. Further, each subframe may use specific sub-carriers of specific OFDM symbols (e.g., a first OFDM symbol) of a corresponding subframe for a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), i.e., an L1/L2 control channel. A transmission time interval (TTI) is a unit time of subframe transmission.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a structure of an NR system, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

A Resource Block (RB) may be defined as a plurality of consecutive subcarriers (e.g., 12 subcarriers) in the frequency domain. A Bandwidth Part (BWP) may be defined as a plurality of consecutive (Physical) Resource Blocks ((P)RBs) in the frequency domain, and the BWP may correspond to one numerology (e.g., SCS, CP length, and so on). A carrier may include a maximum of N number BWPs (e.g., 5 BWPs). Data communication may be performed via an activated BWP. Each element may be referred to as a Resource Element (RE) within a resource grid and one complex symbol may be mapped to each element.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">Meanwhile, a radio interface between a UE and another UE or a radio interface between the UE and a network may consist of an L1 layer, an L2 layer, and an L3 layer. In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the L1 layer may imply a physical layer. In addition, for example, the L2 layer may imply at least one of a MAC layer, an RLC layer, a PDCP layer, and an SDAP layer. In addition, for example, the L3 layer may imply an RRC layer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Hereinafter, a bandwidth part (BWP) and a carrier will be described.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">The BWP may be a set of consecutive physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a given numerology. The PRB may be selected from consecutive sub-sets of common resource blocks (CRBs) for the given numerology on a given carrier.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">When using bandwidth adaptation (BA), a reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of a UE are not necessarily as large as a bandwidth of a cell, and the reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of the BS may be adjusted. For example, a network/BS may inform the UE of bandwidth adjustment. For example, the UE receive information/configuration for bandwidth adjustment from the network/BS. In this case, the UE may perform bandwidth adjustment based on the received information/configuration. For example, the bandwidth adjustment may include an increase/decrease of the bandwidth, a position change of the bandwidth, or a change in subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">For example, the bandwidth may be decreased during a period in which activity is low to save power. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in a frequency domain. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in the frequency domain to increase scheduling flexibility. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed to allow a different service. A subset of a total cell bandwidth of a cell may be called a bandwidth part (BWP). The BA may be performed when the BS/network configures the BWP to the UE and the BS/network informs the UE of the BWP currently in an active state among the configured BWPs.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">For example, the BWP may be at least any one of an active BWP, an initial BWP, and/or a default BWP. For example, the UE may not monitor downlink radio link quality in a DL BWP other than an active DL BWP on a primary cell (PCell). For example, the UE may not receive PDCCH, physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), or channel state information&#x2014;reference signal (CSI-RS) (excluding RRM) outside the active DL BWP. For example, the UE may not trigger a channel state information (CSI) report for the inactive DL BWP. For example, the UE may not transmit physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) or physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) outside an active UL BWP. For example, in a downlink case, the initial BWP may be given as a consecutive RB set for a remaining minimum system information (RMSI) control resource set (CORESET) (configured by physical broadcast channel (PBCH)). For example, in an uplink case, the initial BWP may be given by system information block (SIB) for a random access procedure. For example, the default BWP may be configured by a higher layer. For example, an initial value of the default BWP may be an initial DL BWP. For energy saving, if the UE fails to detect downlink control information (DCI) during a specific period, the UE may switch the active BWP of the UE to the default BWP.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092">Meanwhile, the BWP may be defined for SL. The same SL BWP may be used in transmission and reception. For example, a transmitting UE may transmit an SL channel or an SL signal on a specific BWP, and a receiving UE may receive the SL channel or the SL signal on the specific BWP. In a licensed carrier, the SL BWP may be defined separately from a Uu BWP, and the SL BWP may have configuration signaling separate from the Uu BWP. For example, the UE may receive a configuration for the SL BWP from the BS/network. The SL BWP may be (pre-)configured in a carrier with respect to an out-of-coverage NR V2X UE and an RRC_IDLE UE. For the UE in the RRC_CONNECTED mode, at least one SL BWP may be activated in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of a BWP, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The PSSS may be referred to as a sidelink primary synchronization signal (S-PSS), and the SSSS may be referred to as a sidelink secondary synchronization signal (S-SSS). For example, length-127 M-sequences may be used for the S-PSS, and length-127 gold sequences may be used for the S-SSS. For example, a UE may use the S-PSS for initial signal detection and for synchronization acquisition. For example, the UE may use the S-PSS and the S-SSS for acquisition of detailed synchronization and for detection of a synchronization signal ID.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0100">A physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) may be a (broadcast) channel for transmitting default (system) information which must be first known by the UE before SL signal transmission/reception. For example, the default information may be information related to SLSS, a duplex mode (DM), a time division duplex (TDD) uplink/downlink (UL/DL) configuration, information related to a resource pool, a type of an application related to the SLSS, a subframe offset, broadcast information, or the like. For example, for evaluation of PSBCH performance, in NR V2X, a payload size of the PSBCH may be 56 bits including 24-bit CRC.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0101">The S-PSS, the S-SSS, and the PSBCH may be included in a block format (e.g., SL synchronization signal (SS)/PSBCH block, hereinafter, sidelink-synchronization signal block (S-SSB)) supporting periodical transmission. The S-SSB may have the same numerology (i.e., SCS and CP length) as a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH)/physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) in a carrier, and a transmission bandwidth may exist within a (pre-)configured sidelink (SL) BWP. For example, the S-SSB may have a bandwidth of 11 resource blocks (RBs). For example, the PSBCH may exist across 11 RBs. In addition, a frequency position of the S-SSB may be (pre-)configured. Accordingly, the UE does not have to perform hypothesis detection at frequency to discover the S-SSB in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a UE performing V2X or SL communication, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Although it is a method that can indicate/configure timing offset value(s) flexibly without conditions, there is a limit of resolution according to a given number of bits and a limit by the pre-configured range.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0156">In another embodiment, any timing offset values that can be candidate values may be pre-configured or determined by higher layer signaling, and a table may be configured with these values. If intend to indicate/configure a specific value as a timing offset value, a table index value corresponding to the timing offset value may be indicated/configured. Through this embodiment, there may be no restrictions on the resolution of candidate timing offset values, and it is possible to significantly reduce the signaling overhead required to indicate/configure the timing offset because the number of bits required to express indexes determined by the number of table elements is small compared to the number of bits required to transmit a timing offset value. However, there is a disadvantage in that timing offset values that can be indicated/configured should be limited to specific values in advance or by higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0157">In another embodiment, in the case of the above candidate values, a reference timing offset value may be determined instead of any timing offset values that can be candidate values, and difference values between the reference timing offset value and any timing offset values that can be candidate values may be used as table elements. The method of indicating/configuring a specific timing offset value may be performed by signaling a table index corresponding to the timing offset value. This has an advantage in that a timing offset value can be expressed with a relatively higher resolution in a given number of bits for processing, compared to the method of configuring the candidate timing offset values themselves as table elements.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0158">In another embodiment, instead of pre-configuring candidate timing offset values or configuring candidate timing offset values based on higher layer signaling, a method of expressing candidate timing offset values as a unit value for a reference timing offset value and relative difference values from the reference timing offset value may be used. For example, if the relative difference value with respect to the reference timing offset value is referred to as a delta, candidate timing offset values may include, for example, the following values.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">Index <b>0</b>: Reference Timing Offset Value</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">Index <b>1</b>: Reference Timing Offset Value+Delta</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">Index <b>2</b>: Reference Timing Offset Value+2*Delta</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">Index (N&#x2212;1): Reference Timing Offset Value+(N&#x2212;1)*Delta</p><p id="p-0168" num="0163">In the above description, the value of N is the number of candidate timing offset values. In order to indicate/configure a specific timing offset value, only the index value needs to be signaled. The receiving UE may restore a specific timing offset value by using a pre-configured reference timing offset value and an index value for a signaled unit difference value.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0164">Since the above-described methods signal the entire table including all candidate timing offset values, or signal the entire table including difference values between the reference timing offset value and all candidate timing offset values compared to the reference timing offset value, an overhead for signaling the entire table representing candidate timing offset values is very large. On the other hand, the method using the above-described unit difference value has the advantage of remarkably reducing the signaling overhead because only the reference timing offset value and the unit difference value need to be signaled.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0165">As an embodiment of a method of using a table including the reference timing offset value and candidate timing offset values related to the reference timing offset value, or a method of using a table including difference values from candidate timing offset values, or a method of signaling by expressing difference values from candidate timing offset values as an index of a unit difference value previously described, an SL inter-RAT timing offset indication method may be used.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0166">In SL inter-RAT communication, an operation in which one RAT system indicates/configures a timing offset to another heterogeneous RAT system may be applied. In one embodiment, if the NR base station configures a type-<b>2</b> configured grant (CG) to the LTE SL UE and indicates activation/release for resource(s) configured by the type-<b>2</b> CG through a SL DCI, the NR base station may configure a specific timing offset through the SL DCI, and the LTE SL UE may apply activation/release for the type-<b>2</b> CG with respect to the first available LTE SL subframe after the configured timing offset.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0167">In this case, the timing offset value configured by the NR base station through the SL DCI is the X+Z value, and the definition of each value is as follows.
