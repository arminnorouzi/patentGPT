Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a screw hub, a centrifuge screw, and a solid bowl screw centrifuge. A screw hub according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b> is known from WO 2016/019944 A1, for example.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solid bowl screw centrifuges are characterized by a drum having a closed or solid bowl. The drum is rotated at high rotational speed, whereby a multiphase mixture located within the drum can be separated into at least a heavy phase and a light phase. Usually, the heavy phase is a solid phase, which is conveyed out from the drum by means of a screw, i.e., a centrifuge screw. For this purpose, the screw is mounted within the drum to be rotational relative to the drum, and has a screw spiral coil. The screw spiral coil is arranged around a screw hub.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The screw spiral coil strikes or sweeps along the inner side or the inner bowl surface of the drum, and thus conveys the product of the heavy phase to an axial end region of the drum. At the end of the drum, the product of the heavy phase is conveyed out from a discharging cone, for example. The multiphase mixture to be clarified thus is located between the inner side of the drum and the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In certain solid bowl screw centrifuges, a large pond depth is aspired, in particular for clarification technological reasons. At the same time, however, the pond depth is restricted by the diameter of the screw hub and resulting buoyancy and deposition effects there of the mixture to be clarified or of the light phase.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the initially mentioned WO 2016/019944 A1, a solid bowl screw centrifuge having a screw hub is known, which has a cylindrical section with a grid structure. A screw spiral coil is arranged externally to the screw hub. The grid structure is substantially formed of longitudinal bars so that the medium to be clarified can flow through openings between the longitudinal bars into the drum space or separating space. Such a grid structure formed only of longitudinal bars disadvantageously has insufficient torsional rigidity. Furthermore, high centrifugal forces act upon the longitudinal bars during operation so that the operating behaviour of the screw hub is negatively impacted. In addition, the longitudinal bars only provide a small area at their outside so as to weld the screw spiral coil to the grid structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For increasing the rigidity of the screw hub according to WO 2016/019944 A1, reinforcements in the form of oblique struts are employed inside the cylindrical section. The oblique struts can only be installed at high adjusting and welding expenditure, whereby the total costs associated with the production of the screw hub are increased. Since the oblique struts are arranged inside the cylindrical section, the screw hub furthermore has degraded material utilization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is therefore based on the task to provide a screw hub for a centrifuge screw, which has increased rigidity and improved flow properties and can be manufactured in a simplified manner due to an improved constructional structure. Furthermore, the invention is based on the task to propose a centrifuge screw and a solid bowl screw centrifuge.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, this task is solved with respect to the screw hub by the subject matter of claim <b>1</b> or <b>15</b>. With respect to the centrifuge screw and the solid bowl screw centrifuge, the task mentioned above is in each case solved by the subject matter of claim <b>17</b> (centrifuge screw) and of claim <b>18</b> (solid bowl screw centrifuge). The subclaims comprise at least appropriate configurations and further developments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specifically, the task is solved by a screw hub for a centrifuge screw, which extends along a longitudinal axis and has at least one longitudinal portion having an opening structure. The opening structure is formed by a plurality of strut elements or struts, which delimit a plurality of openings for the passage of a medium. The struts are arranged radially outside on the longitudinal portion relative to the longitudinal axis and define a circumference of the longitudinal portion. Two struts form in each case a strut pair that delimits at least one opening, both struts of the strut pair extending in the longitudinal direction and transversely to the longitudinal direction, or a first strut of the strut pair extending in the longitudinal direction and a second strut of the strut pair extending transversely to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The medium may be a two-phase mixture or a three-phase mixture, for example.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The opening structure may also be referred to as an open wall structure. The notions &#x201c;opening structure&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;open wall structure&#x201d; are meant to illustrate that in the longitudinal portion of the screw hub, the wall structure has a high number of openings and/or a large opening surface in total.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a strut, a volume body is to be understood substantially extending along a body-related longitudinal axis or a longitudinal axis of a strut.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a variant according to the invention of the screw hub, both struts of the strut pair extend in the longitudinal direction and transversely to the longitudinal direction. In other words, both struts of the strut pair extend obliquely, in particular angularly in relation to the longitudinal direction. The respective strut is thus arranged such that the longitudinal axis of the strut runs at a defined angle to the longitudinal direction of the screw hub. In other words, the struts do not run in parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub in this variant.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further, in particular alternative variant according to the invention of the screw hub, a first one of the two struts extends in the longitudinal direction, and a second one of the two struts extends transversely to the longitudinal direction. In other words, the first strut extends substantially in parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub, and the second strut extends transversely to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub. The second strut may be arranged in this case obliquely, in particular angularly relative to the longitudinal direction. The second strut runs at a defined angle to the longitudinal direction of the screw hub. In this further variant, the second strut does not run in parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub. It is possible for the second strut to extend rectangularly, in particular orthogonally to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The longitudinal portion may be substantially cylindrical. The two struts of the strut pair may be converging or diverging in the longitudinal direction. The opening structure is formed of a plurality of struts. In other words, the opening structure is formed of a plurality of strut pairs. The struts of the strut pairs may form the circumference over the entire strut length. Preferably, the struts extend only in the circumferential region of the longitudinal portion. Thereby, an inner space of the longitudinal portion is kept free from disturbing objects, whereby the flow properties in the area of the longitudinal portion and in particular in the area of an inflow zone for the medium to be clarified are improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Within the scope of the invention, the longitudinal direction corresponds to a direction in parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub. Under the direction transversely to the longitudinal direction or the transverse direction, a direction along the circumference of the longitudinal portion transversely to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub is to be understood.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention has various advantages. Since the opening structure of the longitudinal portion is formed according to the invention of a plurality of struts and has a plurality of openings, a large pond depth can be formed in an associated solid bowl screw centrifuge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Due to the longitudinal and/or transverse extension of the struts of the opening structure, the longitudinal portion and thus the screw hub have an increased torsional and flexural rigidity. This is particularly advantageous when the screw hub is employed in a solid bowl screw centrifuge having great longitudinal extension since the entire system thereby has increased rigidity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the screw hub according to the invention can be realized with an enlarged length/diameter ratio due to the high rigidity of the opening structure, since imbalances occurring, in particular in a two-rotor system have less effects upon the operating behaviour and thus on machine vibrations due to the increased rigidity of the entire system. In addition, the screw hub according to the invention has high stability during operation when forces occur due to the buoyancy and deposition effect of the medium to be clarified.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, possible reinforcement elements or oblique struts inside the longitudinal portion are cancelled due to the extension of the struts in the longitudinal direction and/or in the transverse direction. The screw hub has a reduced weight, whereby the load of centrifugal force is reduced during operation. Furthermore, the screw hub is of simplified production, since complex aligning and welding of the reinforcement elements is omitted. This has the further advantage that distortion, for example, by the welding process, as well as inner material and component tensions are reduced in producing the screw hub. Manufacturing tolerances can thereby be complied with at low expenditure. Furthermore, the operating behaviour of the screw hub is improved in an advantageous manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Due to reinforcement elements being cancelled, unimpeded entering or immerging of the medium into the pond is enabled, in particular in the region of an inlet zone of the medium. The screw hub according to the invention thus has improved flow properties. In general, it is possible for the longitudinal portion having the opening structure to immerge at least partially into the medium, in particular into the pond, during operation. Alternatively. The longitudinal portion of the screw hub may also be located outside the pond during operation. In other words, the longitudinal portion of the screw hub cannot immerge into the pond.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The opening structure of the longitudinal portion is optimized according to the invention in that, due to the position of the struts or strut pairs in the circumferential region of the longitudinal portion, the highest possible proportion of the opening structure cross-section is at maximum spaced from the longitudinal axis forming the axis of rotation of the screw hub. Especially in the region of the longitudinal portion, the screw hub has a high geometrical moment of inertia.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention has the further advantage that the struts arranged radially outside form a circumferential, in particular subdivided support area for a screw spiral coil. Thereby, connecting of the screw-spiral coil to the struts or the opening structure is enabled by welding, for example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the struts of the strut pair enclose the opening partially or completely. In other words, the struts of the strut pair delimit the opening partially or completely. The struts together may form a contour of the strut pair that is open towards a side of the strut pair. Preferably, the two struts form a contour of the strut pair that is closed in itself. This has the advantage that the single strut pairs and thus the entire longitudinal portion of the screw hub have increased torsional and flexural rigidity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the opening is formed between the two struts. Alternatively, or additionally, one strut of two adjacent strut pairs may respectively delimit an intermediate opening partially or completely. In other words, both within the strut pair and in each case between two strut pairs, an opening for the medium may be formed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the struts of the strut pair are formed to be separated from one another or to be in one piece with one another. The struts may also be formed as single elements. In this case, the struts each may be formed by one single rod. As an alternative, the strut pair may be formed of one piece. The struts may be produced in one casting process. In other words, the struts of the strut pair are bonded together in the form of a substance fit. The strut pair may be formed in one piece by precision casting. Alternatively, the struts of the strut pair may also be bonded together in one piece by welding. Due to the separated design of the strut pair, a plurality of different shapes and strut pair geometries can be realized. This increases a diversity of variants when the screw hub is formed. The one-piece design of the strut pair has the special advantage that an increased rigidity of the strut pair results from the contour being closed in itself.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the struts are arranged such that the strut pair is formed in the shape of a triangle. In other words, the struts of the strut pair can form a triangle. The triangle can be open or closed. More specifically, the triangle can enclose the opening partially or completely. The triangle can thus have an open contour or a closed contour. It is possible for the struts to be alternatively arranged such that the strut pair has a trapezoidal shape. In general, the strut pair may also be formed to be at least partially circular, in particular arcuate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the strut pair comprises an inner side and an outer side each having a radius towards the opening, wherein the radius of the inner side is greater than the radius of the outer side. In other words, the strut pair can be rounded at the outer side and the inner side towards the opening, wherein the curve at the inner side has a greater radius than the curve of the outer side. The opening is in this case formed between the two struts of the strut pair. Due to the great radius at the inner side of the strut pair, passage of the medium is facilitated in an advantageous manner so that a deposition of the medium or the mixture, for example, the two-phase mixture or the three-phase mixture, is reduced during operation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inner side of the strut pair is facing the longitudinal axis of the screw hub or the interior of the longitudinal portion. The outer side of the strut pair is facing away from the longitudinal axis or the interior of the longitudinal portion. In other words, the outer side of the strut pair is facing the inner side of the drum in the installed state of the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the strut pair has in each case a surface at the inner side and at the outer side, wherein the surface at the outer side is greater than the surface at the inner side. Specifically, in each case one strut has a surface at the inner side and/or the outer side. The surface of the outer side preferably forms a part of the circumference, for example, for contacting a screw spiral coil. The great surface of the outer side has the advantage that an area as large as possible is made available for fixing a screw spiral coil. In particular, a screw spiral coil is thereby allowed to be welded to the strut pair or the plurality of strut pairs in a facilitated manner.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the inner side and/or the outer side of the strut pair are/is formed to be arched, in particular curved, and/or flat. The strut pair may be formed to be arched to the inside and/or arched to the outside. In other words, the inner side and/or the outer side of the strut pair may be formed to be convex. Preferably, the strut pair at the outer side is arched towards the outside. Particularly preferred, the strut pair is arched towards the outside such that a screw spiral coil can two-dimensionally rest at the surface of the outer side. Alternatively, or additionally, the strut pair can be formed to be flat at the inner side and/or at the outer side. In this case, it is advantageous that a constant resting surface as large as possible is provided for an improved contact of a screw spiral coil or screw blades.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further preferred, the strut pair has at least two front-side connecting areas bonded together by struts in the form of a substance fit. The front-side connecting areas connect the two struts of the strut pair together at their respective ends. The connecting areas may be a part of the struts, i.e., formed in one piece with them. Advantageously, this results in a contour of the strut pair which is closed in itself and encloses the opening.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The front-side connecting areas may be arranged opposite one another in the longitudinal direction. The connecting areas may be formed to have different sizes. In particular in the design of the strut pair as a triangle, a first connecting area connects the struts at the sharp end of the triangle, and a second connecting area connects the struts at the diverging, in particular broad end of the triangle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the connecting areas each have at least one passage opening, by means of which the strut pair is connected to at least one hub element, in particular a transverse disc, a bearing bush or a screw cone, or a further strut pair. The passage opening can be a bore. Preferably, the first connecting area has a single passage opening and/or the second connecting area has at least two passage openings. In order to form the opening structure of the longitudinal portion, the strut pairs can be connected by the passage openings in an easy manner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The strut pairs can be bonded to the hub element, in particular a transverse disc, a bearing bush or a screw cone, or the further strut pair in a substance-fit and/or force-fit manner. Specifically, the strut pairs can be bonded to the hub element, in particular a transverse disc, a bearing bush or a screw cone, or the further strut pair by welding and/or screwing. In the substance-fit bonding of the strut pairs, in particular by screwing, to a hub element or a further strut pair, the respective strut pair can, for example, due to wear, be easily and rapidly detached and thus exchanged. Further, such a bonding of the strut pairs enables the opening structure to be of modular construction, whereby the screw hub can be fabricated easily in different constructional sizes and constructional lengths, respectively.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The strut pairs may be provided with a wear protection. In this case, at least one metallic layer can be arranged within the strut pairs at least in some portions. By way of example, the metallic layer can be welded to the respective strut pair, in particular to the inner side and/or outer side. A lifetime of the single strut pairs and thus of the screw hub is increased advantageously.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the struts of the strut pair each have a cross-section between the two connecting areas, which is substantially constant in the longitudinal direction or along the longitudinal axis of the struts. In other words, the single struts have an unchanged, in particular equal cross-section over the length thereof between the two connecting areas. The cross-section of the struts may be formed to be of a circle form, in particular circular, oval and/or elliptical and/or angular, in particular in a triangular shape, rectangular shape and/or in an X-shape. Other not mentioned cross-sections of the connection elements are possible. The cross-section of the struts is formed in consideration of a high required rigidity, at a material use as low as possible.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment of the invention, the longitudinal portion has at least one strut segment formed by several strut pairs interconnected in the longitudinal direction of the screw hub and/or transversely to the longitudinal direction. Preferably, the strut pairs of the strut segment are arranged to be evenly distributed in the circumferential direction. The strut pairs, for example, can be alternatingly arranged, for example, turned by 180 degrees in the circumferential direction. The strut pairs are in this case spaced from one another.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The strut segment may be formed to be ring-shaped or elongated in the axial direction. The strut pairs can be bonded together in the circumferential direction by single connecting bridges. It is possible for adjacent strut pairs to be bonded together directly or indirectly in the longitudinal direction and/or in the transverse direction. By forming strut segments, the screw hub can be constructed to be arbitrarily modular. Thereby, a variant variety of the screw hub is decisively increased.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the longitudinal portion has several strut segments arranged along the longitudinal axis and connected to one another by intermediate transverse discs, wherein the strut pairs of the strut segments are coupled to the transverse discs. The strut pairs of two adjacent strut segments may be arranged to be oppositely alternating, in particular be turned alternatingly. The transverse discs may be formed to be closed, in particular free from passage openings, or open and having a concentric bore, respectively. Due to the transverse discs, the strut pairs are axially supported.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, the screw hub according to the invention may have, in addition to the longitudinal portion, a solid matter discharge side portion, which is formed, for example, as a conical portion, and a bearing portion. The longitudinal portion is in this case arranged between the solid matter discharge side portion and the bearing portion. All of the three portions are situated on a common longitudinal axis, which also forms the axis of rotation of the screw hub. In order to connect the single strut segments to one another, the transverse discs are arranged between the strut segments. The single strut pairs may in this case be frontally connected, in particular by the respective connecting area, to the associated transverse disc in a substance-fit and/or force-fit manner. Due to the construction of the longitudinal portion by means of strut segments, a modular construction of the screw hub is enabled and the variant diversity is increased as described before. In the event of signs of wear, such strut segments furthermore can be easily and rapidly replaced.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A subordinate aspect of the invention is related to a screw hub for a centrifuge screw extending along a longitudinal axis and having at least one longitudinal portion formed by a tube, wherein within the tube, in particular within the tube wall, a plurality of openings for the passage of a medium is formed. The openings each have a longitudinal extension, which is preferably greater than the width of the respective opening.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In comparison to the initially mentioned WO 2016/019944 A1, the screw hub according to the further aspect has the advantage that it can be easily and cost-efficiently produced. The openings within the tube wall may substantially be formed by mechanical processing. Alternatively, the openings may be formed by laser cutting. In this case, it is advantageous for a welding effort to be considerably reduced during production and the screw hub has high stability. Furthermore, based on this embodiment of a screw hub, a large and continuous resting surface for a screw spiral coil, for example, is provided. Thereby, an automation of subsequent working steps in producing the screw or centrifuge screw is advantageously enabled.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The medium may be, for example, a two-phase mixture or a three-phase mixture.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment of the subordinate aspect of the invention, the openings are formed in the circumferential direction to be spirally or helically distributed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Due to the spiral or helical arrangement of the openings, two spirals or helices are basically formed. A first spiral or helix has the openings spaced from one another. A second spiral or helix is formed between the first spiral or helix and has a full tube material. The second spiral or helix serves in particular as a resting surface and/or fixing surface for the screw spiral coil.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The longitudinal portion may be formed in one piece. Due to the one-piece design, only low tensions occur. In this case, no or only a small number of welding seams are required advantageously so as to form the longitudinal portion. Thereby, concentricity of the screw hub is improved.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The openings may have a parallelogram-like shape, for example.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It applies for all of the screw hubs according to the invention that the described longitudinal portion may concern the complete cylindrical longitudinal portion of the screw hub or only a portion of the cylindrical longitudinal portion.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is possible, for example, that the described longitudinal portion having the described opening structure is formed between two further longitudinal portions having a closed wall structure. It is likewise possible that the described longitudinal portion having the described opening structure is formed between a portion having a closed wall structure and a solid matter discharge side portion of the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A further subordinate aspect of the invention is related to a centrifuge screw having a screw hub according to the invention and a screw spiral coil arranged at the screw hub to be circumferential.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A further subordinate aspect of the invention is related to a solid bowl screw centrifuge having a centrifuge screw of the kind mentioned above and/or a screw hub according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With respect to the centrifuge screw and the solid bowl screw centrifuge, reference is made to the advantages explained in conjunction with the screw hub. Furthermore, the centrifuge screw and/or the solid bowl screw centrifuge may have alternatively or additionally single features or a combination of several features mentioned above with respect to the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is possible for the screw hub according to the invention and/or the centrifuge screw according to the invention to have a further developed inlet region. An inlet tube, which has an inlet tube opening, opens into the inlet region, wherein opposite the inlet tube opening, an impact element, in particular an impact disc, having an acceleration element is formed. The acceleration element is formed such that a medium impinging on the acceleration element can be accelerated in the direction of openings of the screw hub. The openings are in this case the openings formed due to the opening structure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the screw hub has according to the invention at least in some sections a longitudinal portion having an opening structure, a large pond depth can be formed in an associated solid bowl screw centrifuge. Since the inlet region is not formed as in the classical sense as an inlet chamber having corresponding massive and mostly closed walls, but is itself formed by an opening structure of the screw hub, for instance, the openings of the screw hub can serve themselves as the openings of the inlet region.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other words, the inlet region of a centrifuge screw comprises at least in some sections an inlet tube, wherein at least the portion of the inlet tube, which has an inlet tube opening, is formed as an integral part of the inlet region of the centrifuge screw. The impact element preferably is formed as an impact disc. Such an impact disc may also be designated as a closing disc. Due to the acceleration element formed on the impact element, pre-acceleration of the medium to be processed can be performed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The acceleration element preferably has impact surfaces positioned obliquely to the axis of rotation. Due to the formed acceleration element, the medium impinging on the impact element or the acceleration element can be carefully pre-accelerated relatively free from turbulences.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The surrounding geometry having the openings structure of the screw hub or the openings of the screw hub and an open liquid surface, may anyway receive the medium in the longitudinal and circumferential direction more carefully than a tube construction having only sporadic inlet openings. With inserting an acceleration element, however, the speed difference when the medium is impinging, is again reduced in a positive manner.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The acceleration takes place in the direction of the openings of the screw hub. Only then, the medium gets into the drum interior or separating space via the free spaces when the screw hub is rotating.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Occurring turbulences known from the state of the art in conjunction with the medium flow flowing into an inlet chamber and subsequently getting into the drum interior can be damped according to the invention and energy losses be reduced.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The massive walls known from inlet chambers formed in a standard way, are omitted in the inlet region according to the invention and are rather formed by longitudinal bars and/or strut elements and/or openings and/or material recesses, for example.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Apart from the improved pre-acceleration of the medium to be processed, the inlet region according to the invention promotes additives to be better mixed in. These additives may be, for example, precipitants or flocculants.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The size or the passage surface of the openings is preferably determined based on the distances formed between the strut elements or the opening edges. In a further embodiment of the invention, the size or the passage surface of the free spaces is formed by the size and the shape of longitudinal slots of the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The acceleration element substantially is formed as a protrusion pointing in the direction of the inlet tube opening. It is possible for the protrusion to be arranged on a disc or plate. The disc or plate may be of a flat or arcuate design.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Together with the disc or plate, the protrusion may form an autonomous component which can be produced separately from the impact element, in particular the impact disc. This facilitates retrofitting an impact element with the acceleration element, for example.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a further embodiment of the invention, it is possible for the protrusion to be directly fixed on the impact element, in particular the impact disc. This enables material to be saved.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment of the invention, the acceleration element has struts which are in particular arranged in a cross-shape relative to one another. It is also conceivable for several struts to form a star-shape in a top view of the acceleration element. In such an embodiment of the invention, the protrusion is formed by an arrangement of struts.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an embodiment of the invention, it is possible for the height of the struts to increase in the direction of a point of intersection of the struts. As the height of the struts, the relative distance from the impact element, in particular the impact disc, or&#x2014;if formed&#x2014;the relative distance from the separate disc or plate is understood.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Preferably, the acceleration element is arranged on the impact element such that a point of intersection and/or a highest point of the acceleration element are/is formed to be aligned to the center point of the impact element, in particular the impact disc. In other words, the point of intersection and/or the highest point of the acceleration element is arranged on the longitudinal axis of the centrifuge screw.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a further or alternative embodiment of the invention, the acceleration element may be formed as a protrusion protruding from the impact element and pointing in the direction of the inlet tube opening. This protrusion has several radial flanks. Radial flanks are to be understood to be such flanks running in the direction of the impact element starting from a centrally arranged central point. Preferably, the radial flanks are arranged uniformly or evenly spaced from one another in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is furthermore possible for channels to be formed between the flanks, wherein the channels can have a swirling course. If a medium impinges upon such an acceleration element, the medium will be deviated and accelerated along the channels in the direction of the impact element and in the direction of the free spaces. In other words, the channels and/or flanks are evenly distributed across the protrusion.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is possible for the acceleration element to be formed as a protrusion protruding from the impact element and pointing in the direction of the inlet tube opening, and which has several, for example four, impact surfaces arranged obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the inlet region. The longitudinal axis of the inlet region is in particular the axis of rotation of the centrifuge screw.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The impact surfaces may be arranged relative to one another, for example, in such a manner that the protrusion has a pyramid shape. The pyramid tip may in particular be formed to be flattened.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a further embodiment of the invention, several oblique struts stabilizing the screw hub are attached to the impact element, in particular the impact disc. An end of the stabilizing oblique struts may be formed on the impact element. The further end may be attached, for example, to a further transverse disc of the centrifuge screw or to an end disc of a centrifuge screw.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a further embodiment of the invention, the screw hub according to the invention and/or the centrifuge screw according to the invention may have a further developed transverse disc.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A transverse disc of this kind is formed such that at least one opening is formed at least in some sections on at least 75% of all the imaginary circle lines of the transverse disc from the center point to the transverse disc circumference. The imaginary circle lines are all of those circle lines that can be formed in the radial extension between the center point and the transverse disc circumference.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Preferably, only a distance of 5 mm, in particular of 2 mm, in particular of 1 mm, in particular of 0.5 mm between the circle lines is formed in the theoretical or imaginary formation. In such an observation of the circle lines, the distance between the circle lines preferably is formed to be of equal size.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As a transverse disc of a centrifuge screw, such a disc is to be understood, which is formed transversely to the longitudinal axis of the screw hub. The transverse disc serves for stabilizing a screw hub, which has an opening structure or a plurality of openings. A transverse disc may also be designated as a support disc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Starting from the center point in the direction of the disc circumference, the transverse disc has imaginary circle lines.

At the same time, such a transverse disc has sufficient rigidity so that the transverse disc continues also to cause the screw hub to be well stabilized.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an embodiment of the invention, in particular a diameter area of the transverse disc delimiting a central middle opening can be formed without opening(s). Such a section free from openings can serve for additionally stabilizing the transverse disc.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, an opening or a section of an opening is formed on all imaginary circle lines of the transverse disc at least in some sections. In other words, across the entire diameter area of the transverse disc, at least one opening or at least one partial section of an opening is formed with respect to each diameter in a particularly preferred manner.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is possible for the transverse disc to be constructed such that across the entire diameter area of the transverse disc, the liquid or the centrate is enabled to flow off.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Preferably, the openings of the transverse disc are formed such that these openings have different geometries and/or opening sizes and/or arrangement patterns.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As the geometry of an opening, the shape of the opening is to be understood. It is possible for the transverse disc to have several openings having different geometries.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The opening size of an opening concerns in other words the opening surface.

The symmetry axis is formed in the area of the superimposed base surfaces of the two truncated cones.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In a further embodiment of the invention, the truncated cones forming the double truncated-cone shape have different heights. Preferably, the truncated cone formed adjacent to the cylindrical longitudinal portion has a smaller height than the second truncated cone pointing in the direction of the frontal surface of the screw hub.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">By means of forming the solid matter discharge side portion in the form of a double truncated-cone, fine matters of materials to be processed and being already separated in terms of phases can be separated better again.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Due to forming the double truncated-cone shape, such centrifuge screws can moreover be formed, which have a lower screw spiral coil height and/or a lower baffle plate height. In this respect, material may consequently be saved in conjunction with the screw spiral coils as well as in conjunction with baffle plates to be formed potentially.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Additionally, the mentioned components of a centrifuge screw or a solid bowl screw centrifuge, namely a screw spiral coil and/or a baffle plate are less heavily loaded than this is the case in conjunction with forming simple cone shapes in the solid matter discharge side portion.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">When a screw hub having a double truncated-cone shape is formed in the area of the solid matter discharge side portion, furthermore a calmer and more stable operational behavior of a corresponding solid bowl screw centrifuge is observed.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Due to forming a double truncated-cone shape, the distance between the screw and the drum of the solid bowl screw centrifuge is reduced. This presses the solid matter, for example, against the baffle plate and increases a pressing force. Separated liquid, in particular separated water, may flow off unpressurized along the screw due to this construction.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">It should be pointed out that all of the features mentioned in the application documents and in particular in the dependent claims, should be provided with an autonomous protection even singly or in any combination despite the performed formal back-reference to one or several certain claims.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">This concerns in particular combinations of the various embodiments of the screw hubs having further constructional details such as transverse discs and/or an inlet region and/or a special shaping of the solid matter discharge side portion of the screw hub.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The invention will be explained in more detail below by means of particulars while referring to the appended drawings.
