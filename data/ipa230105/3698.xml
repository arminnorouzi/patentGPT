For example, in some embodiments, a chromatography instrument support apparatus may include: first logic to generate one or more peak locations for a chromatogram data set and to generate one or more baselines for the chromatogram data set, wherein an individual peak has an associated baseline, and wherein the first logic includes a machine-learning computational model that outputs estimated peak locations and estimated baselines; second logic to cause the display of the one or more peak locations and the one or more baselines concurrently with the display of the chromatogram data set; and third logic to, for individual peaks, generate an associated integrated value representing an area above the associated baseline and under a portion of the chromatogram data set corresponding to the individual peak.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The chromatography instrument support embodiments disclosed herein may achieve improved performance relative to conventional approaches. As discussed in further detail below, conventional chromatography requires a significant amount of effort on the part of users to identify the peak locations, droplines, and/or baselines that are used to extract constituent information from a chromatogram of a sample mixture. This required effort can be a significant bottleneck in the throughput of a chromatography process, constraining the volume, types, and speed of chromatographic analysis that can be performed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The chromatography instrument support embodiments disclosed herein may include a machine-learning computational model that outputs estimated peak locations and estimated baselines, and that is trained on data that has been provided by an individual or institution and reflects that individual's or institution's preferences for peak and baseline identification. The machine-learning computational model may be trained to recognize the &#x201c;subjective,&#x201d; difficult-to-quantify preferences that govern an individual's or institution's method of defining peaks and baselines, and may significantly reduce the amount of human intervention required to process and characterize a chromatogram, significantly decreasing errors and significantly increasing throughput. The embodiments disclosed herein thus provide substantial improvements to chromatography technology (e.g., improvements in the computer technology supporting chromatography instruments, among other improvements).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof wherein like numerals designate like parts throughout, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, embodiments that may be practiced.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;logic&#x201d; may include an apparatus that is to perform a set of operations associated with the logic. For example, any of the logic elements included in the support module <b>1000</b> may be implemented by one or more computing devices programmed with instructions to cause one or more processing devices of the computing devices to perform the associated set of operations. In a particular embodiment, a logic element may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable media having instructions thereon that, when executed by one or more processing devices of one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform the associated set of operations. As used herein, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; may refer to a collection of one or more logic elements that, together, perform one or more functions associated with the module. Different ones of the logic elements in a module may take the same form or may take different forms. For example, some logic in a module may be implemented by a programmed general-purpose processing device, while other logic in a module may be implemented by an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). In another example, different ones of the logic elements in a module may be associated with different sets of instructions executed by one or more processing devices. A module may not include all of the logic elements depicted in the associated drawing; for example, a module may include a subset of the logic elements depicted in the associated drawing when that module is to perform a subset of the operations discussed herein with reference to that module.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b> may be configured to generate one or more peak locations <b>112</b> (examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) for a chromatogram data set <b>102</b>, as well as to generate one or more baselines <b>106</b> (examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) for the chromatogram data set <b>102</b>. The chromatogram data set <b>102</b> may be data generated by a chromatography instrument, such as any of the chromatography instruments discussed herein.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example graphical representation <b>100</b> of a chromatogram data set <b>102</b>, represented as magnitude as a function of retention time, along with peak locations <b>112</b> and baselines <b>106</b> that may be generated by the peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b>. In the graphical representation <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, five peaks <b>104</b> (labeled <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>4</b>, and <b>104</b>-<b>5</b>) and four baselines <b>106</b> (labeled <b>106</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>106</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>106</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>106</b>-<b>4</b>) have been generated by the peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b>.

In the field of chromatography, there are no canonical or universal definitions of a peak <b>104</b>, a baseline <b>106</b>, a peak start location <b>114</b>, or a peak end location <b>116</b>. Different individuals and institutions may have their own preferences for how peak locations <b>112</b>, baselines <b>106</b>, peak start locations <b>114</b>, and/or peak end locations are identified in chromatogram data set <b>102</b>, and these individual or institutional preferences may themselves differ for different types of sample mixtures or different questions of interest. For example, the particular identification of peak locations <b>112</b> and baselines <b>106</b> illustrated in the graphical representation <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be considered &#x201c;correct&#x201d; by one user of a chromatography instrument and &#x201c;incorrect&#x201d; by another user of the chromatography instrument (who may instead wish, for example, to combine the peaks <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>104</b>-<b>4</b> into a group of peaks associated with a single baseline <b>106</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and as discussed below). Further, there may be no readily identifiable and/or human-understandable metrics or rules that an average user can directly program into a chromatography system to achieve consistent and desired identification of peak and baseline characteristics in chromatogram data. Instead, a user of conventional chromatography systems has typically been limited to receiving chromatogram data annotated with generically defined peaks and baselines, which the user has to then manually adjust to achieve their desired result. If that process is burdensome, a user may alternately choose to forgo any kind of automatic generic definition of peaks and baselines, and may simply define the peaks and baselines manually themselves. Both of these approaches require a tremendous amount of human intervention, slowing the rate at which chromatography analysis can be performed and thereby throttling chromatography throughput.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As noted above, to address and overcome some or all of these issues, the peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b> may include a machine-learning computational model that outputs estimated peak locations and estimated baselines, and that is trained on data that has been provided by an individual or institution and reflects that individual's or institution's preferences for peak and baseline identification. The machine-learning computational model included in the peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b> may be trained to recognize the &#x201c;subjective,&#x201d; difficult-to-quantify preferences that govern an individual's or institution's method of defining peaks and baselines, and may significantly reduce the amount of human intervention required to process and characterize a chromatogram, significantly decreasing errors and significantly increasing throughput.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the machine-learning computational model may be a neural network computational model that receives, as an input, chromatogram data set <b>102</b>, and outputs a data structure representative of estimated peak locations <b>112</b> and estimated baselines <b>106</b> for the chromatogram data set <b>102</b>. The architecture of the machine-learning computational model may take any of a number of forms, such as a neural network model (e.g., a convolutional neural network model). For example, the peak/baseline generation logic <b>1002</b> may include a machine-learning computational model with an architecture similar to that of the U-NET convolutional neural network, but with U-NET's two-dimensional convolutions (suitable for a two-dimensional input image) replaced by one-dimensional convolutions (suitable for a one-dimensional input chromatogram data array). Different kernel sizes (e.g., a kernel size between 3 and 20) and numbers of blocks (e.g., four blocks in the descending portion of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; of the U-NET architecture) may be used and/or adjusted as suitable.
