No limitation of the scope of the invention is intended by the selection or description of the drawings.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Conventional tappet roller assemblies rely on oil transferred from the cam to tappet roller due to the surface tension of the oil, and from the tappet roller to the roller shoe, for lubrication of the groove in which the tappet roller rotates. However, much of the oil is squeezed out after passing the cam/tappet roller interface. The remaining oil is not sufficient to provide a film of oil on the groove. The problem is exacerbated in high pressure application. This results in excessive wear of the groove and the tappet roller.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present disclosure provides a tappet roller assembly in which a roller shoe receives and holds the tappet roller by the shape or contouring of a groove formed within the roller shoe. The present disclosure further provides a tappet roller assembly that is configured to directly lubricate the tappet roller. This architecture of the tappet roller assembly allows the high pressure fuel pump to operate at high speed with reduced power drawn from the engine to operate the pump. Furthermore, direct lubrication of the tappet roller results in a light weight architecture and smaller size within the high pressure fuel pump. Additionally, improved lubrication may allow smoother operation of the high pressure fuel pump and lower production and maintenance costs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, in conventional tappet roller assemblies, the spring rests on the transverse wall, or ledge, and when the tappet shoe and body move up, the ledge impacts the spring, causing noise and, over time, debris. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this form of operation of the plunger causes the plunger to seize.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present disclosure further provides a tappet roller assembly that is configured to reduce noise and debris by preloading the plunger on the shoe. A retainer is provided which keeps the tappet roller off the camshaft if the plunger seizes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, a high pressure fuel pump <b>100</b> is shown.

Shaft <b>106</b> of plunger <b>105</b> is inserted through an opening in retractor <b>140</b>, which has a smaller diameter than the diameter of foot <b>107</b>, and optionally through a wave washer <b>141</b>. Retractor <b>140</b> is retained by transverse wall <b>120</b>. Roller shoe <b>120</b> is then inserted, optionally press-fit, into shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> and retained therein. In some examples, spring <b>118</b> has between 800 and 1,000 Newtons of force, more preferably between 850 and 950 Newtons, and even more preferably between 900 Newtons+/&#x2212;15%. In some variations of the present embodiment, roller shoe <b>120</b> has grooves <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> extending from a top surface <b>164</b>. Drain passages <b>166</b> extend through roller shoe <b>120</b> from grooves <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> to drain oil from top of tappet roller assembly <b>110</b> to cam <b>108</b>. Two drain passages <b>166</b> extend from groove <b>160</b>, providing space for lubrication passage <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the pressure carried by the lubrication oil film between roller shoe <b>120</b> and shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is greater than 2,000 bar, preferably greater than 2,400 bar and even more preferably greater than 2,600 bar, and the average roughness, Ra, of the surface of shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is less than 0.5 micron, preferably less than 0.3 micron, and even more preferably 0.2 micron or less. The fine surface finish ensures that the lubrication oil film, which could be less than 3 micron in thickness, and even less than 2 micron in thickness, is sufficient to prevent direct contact between roller shoe <b>120</b> and shoe mounting bore <b>116</b>. Average roughness is measured by standard measurement methods, such as ASME B46.1. The surfaces may be treated by mechanical polishing, polishing slurries, and/or electropolishing reactions to achieve such fine finish. In one example, the pressure carried by the lubrication oil film between roller shoe <b>120</b> and shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is greater than 2,500 bar, and the Ra of the surface of shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is less than 0.25 micron. In another example, the pressure carried by the lubrication oil film between roller shoe <b>120</b> and shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is at least 2,600 bar, and the Ra of the surface of shoe mounting bore <b>116</b> is less than 0.20 micron.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, roller shoe <b>120</b> includes roller bore <b>122</b> which has a radius &#x201c;a&#x201d; and an arc greater than 180 degrees. Accordingly, tappet roller <b>130</b>, which is cylindrically shaped and has a radius slightly smaller than radius a of roller bore <b>122</b>, is inserted longitudinally and retained in roller shoe <b>120</b> by roller bore <b>122</b>. The arcuate opening defines an aperture in the bottom surface. The roller has a cross-section along its length larger than the aperture in the bottom surface of the roller shoe, therefore the roller does not pass through the aperture and is retained by the shape of the arcuate opening within the roller shoe.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, roller bore <b>122</b> has an arc equal to or less than 180 degrees. The arcuate opening has an arcuate surface in rotatable contact with the roller shoe, i.e. the cylindrical surface of the roller shoe rotates within the space defined by the arcuate surface, and the arcuate surface has an average surface roughness, Ra, preferably less than 0.3 micron, and more preferably less than 0.2 micron.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, roller shoe <b>120</b> comprises an upper section <b>170</b> with a lower section <b>172</b> of smaller diameter than the diameter of upper section <b>170</b>, with an undercut <b>174</b> therebetween.

Internal section <b>182</b> extends from external section <b>180</b> at one end and terminates at an inner groove <b>184</b> in roller bore <b>122</b>. The combination of the diameters of sections <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and inner groove <b>184</b> creates a favorable dispersion of oil onto tappet roller <b>130</b> to increase lubrication. The diameter of internal section <b>182</b> controls the dispersion of oil. An oil reservoir is provided (not shown) which provides oil to lubrication passage <b>124</b> even when the engine is not operating, thereby providing initial lubrication during start-up.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The term &#x201c;oil&#x201d; is used to simplify the description of the operation of the tappet roller assembly.
