Patent Literature 1 describes, for example, a wireless power transmission system that detects a wireless tag around a transmitter and switches the state of power transmission in accordance with the detection result (e.g., lowers transmission power in response to a wireless tag being detected).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-191268</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The wireless tags in Patent Literature 1 are used with devices (e.g., pacemakers) to avoid power transmission radio waves. A wireless tag can also be used to reduce power exposure on a human body carrying the wireless tag (power density). The technique described in Patent Literature 1 simply detects any wireless tag in an environment and cannot limit its transmission power in response to power exposure on a human body exceeding a predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For a human (human body) in an environment including power transmission radio waves, the transmission power to a power transmission target is to be increased but power exposure on a human body is to be reduced. To reduce power exposure on a human body, the total power exposure on a human body during power transmission to the power transmission target is to be determined.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To determine the total power exposure on a human body, a wireless tag that can measure power exposure may be carried on a human body. A signal from the wireless tag may be used to detect whether the human body is in the environment or to estimate power exposure on the human body. An estimated value of power exposure on the human body can be compared with a predetermined value. In response to the estimated value exceeding the predetermined value, the transmission power is limited (the output is reduced or stopped) to reduce power exposure on the human body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To practically estimate power exposure on a human body using a wireless tag carried on a human body, a single wireless tag may be attached to a predetermined human body part (e.g., the head), and a signal from the single wireless tag may be used to estimate the total power exposure on the human body. However, metal components in an environment may form multiple paths with radio wave reflection and cause varying levels of power exposure on different parts of the human body (e.g., the head, abdomen, and feet). Thus, using a signal from the single wireless tag can cause a greater error in estimating the total power exposure on the human body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The transmission power cannot be limited appropriately due to a greater estimation error in the estimated value of power exposure on the human body. For example, the estimated value of power exposure on the human body greater than the actual value may excessively limit the transmission power and cause less power to be transmitted to the power transmission target. The estimated value of power exposure on the human body less than the actual value may inappropriately limit the transmission power and cause power exposure on the human to exceed the predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In response to the above issue, one or more aspects of the present invention are directed to a wireless power transmission system and a program for estimating power exposure on a human body that can estimate power exposure on a human body with a decreased estimation error.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A wireless power transmission system according to a first aspect of the present invention includes a host unit that outputs a power transmission radio wave, a plurality of secondary units that receive power with the power transmission radio wave, and at least one human body tag to be carried on a human body in an environment in which the host unit transmits power. The at least one human body tag wirelessly communicates with the host unit. Power transmission from the host unit to the plurality of secondary units undergoes directivity control using different antenna directivity for each of the plurality of secondary units. Directivity control for a secondary unit of the plurality of secondary units is performed for one slot. Directivity control for all the plurality of secondary units is performed for one cycle. The host unit communicates with the at least one human body tag in each slot to estimate power exposure on a human body per slot for a human body carrying the at least one human body tag, calculates power exposure on a human body per cycle based on the estimated power exposure on a human body in each slot, and limits power transmission to the plurality of secondary units in response to the power exposure on a human body per cycle exceeding a predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This structure uses power exposure on a human body in each slot to calculate the power exposure on a human body per cycle with a decreased estimation error compared with power exposure on a human body in each slot, thus estimating the power exposure on a human body with a decreased estimation error.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the above wireless power transmission system, the host unit may communicate with the at least one human body tag in each slot to estimate power exposure on a human body per slot for a human body carrying the at least one human body tag and calculate power exposure on a human body per cycle as an average of power exposure on a human body for all slots or for one or more slots.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above wireless power transmission system, the at least one human body tag may measure received power from a signal received from the host unit to transmit the measured received power to the host unit.

The program is executable to estimate power exposure on a human body in an environment in which the host unit transmits power.

The at least one human body tag wirelessly communicates with the host unit. Power transmission from the host unit to the plurality of secondary units undergoes directivity control using different antenna directivity for each of the plurality of secondary units. The host unit includes a power exposure estimator that estimates, based on a result of communication with the at least one human body tag in each slot, power exposure on a human body per slot for a human body carrying the at least one human body tag and calculates power exposure on a human body per cycle based on the estimated power exposure on a human body in each slot, and a transmission power limiter that limits power transmission to the plurality of secondary units in response to the power exposure on a human body per cycle exceeding a predetermined value. The program causes a computer included in the host unit to function as the power exposure estimator and the transmission power limiter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above program, the power exposure estimator may estimate, based on a result of communication with the at least one human body tag in each slot, power exposure on human body per slot for a human body carrying the at least one human body tag, and calculate power exposure on a human body per cycle as an average of power exposure on a human body for all slots or for one or more slots.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The wireless power transmission system and the program for estimating power exposure on a human body according to the above aspects of the present invention use power exposure on a human body for multiple slots to determine power exposure on a human body per cycle and thus estimate the power exposure on a human body with a decreased estimation error.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a wireless power transmission system according to an embodiment of the present invention showing its example structure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic functional block diagram of a power transmitter included in the wireless power transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic functional block diagram of a wireless sensor included in the wireless power transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic functional block diagram of a human body tag included in the wireless power transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a timing chart of a power transmission and communication procedure in one cycle in the wireless power transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a control operation performed in one cycle by the power transmitter in the wireless power transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An example use of a wireless power transmission system (hereafter, the system) according to one or more embodiments of the present invention is, for example, a wireless sensor system installed at a factory or another facility.

The human body tag <b>300</b> includes a power supply <b>310</b>, a power monitor <b>320</b>, a storage <b>330</b>, a communicator <b>340</b>, and an antenna <b>350</b>. The structures of the power supply <b>310</b>, the storage <b>330</b>, the communicator <b>340</b>, and the antenna <b>350</b> in the human body tag <b>300</b> may be basically the same as the structures of the power supply <b>210</b>, the storage <b>230</b>, the communicator <b>240</b>, and the antenna <b>250</b> in the wireless sensor <b>200</b>. The power monitor <b>320</b> measures the received power of a reception signal received from the power transmitter <b>100</b>. The received power measured by the power monitor <b>320</b> is temporarily stored into the storage <b>330</b> and is transmitted in response to a command signal from the power transmitter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The operation of the system will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a timing chart of a power transmission and communication procedure in one cycle in the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a control operation performed in one cycle by the power transmitter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the system, the operation of the system performed in one cycle substantially includes a directivity control period and a power transmission-communication period as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The system includes three wireless sensors <b>200</b> (sensors <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and a single human body tag <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the directivity control period, the power transmitter <b>100</b> first transmits a signal request selectively to one wireless sensor <b>200</b> (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Upon receiving the signal request, the wireless sensor <b>200</b> (e.g., the sensor <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) responds to the request (transmits a response signal). During the directivity control period, the response signal from the wireless sensor <b>200</b> includes information (e.g., radio wave strength for the wireless sensor <b>200</b>) used for antenna directivity control in the power transmitter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Upon receiving the response signal from the wireless sensor <b>200</b> (Yes in S<b>2</b>), the power transmitter <b>100</b> uses the response signal to generate antenna directivity for the wireless sensor <b>200</b> (S<b>3</b>). More specifically, the signal determiner <b>122</b> in the power transmitter <b>100</b> extracts information from the response signal from the wireless sensor <b>200</b> and outputs the extracted information to the phase-amplitude adjustment calculator <b>131</b>. The phase-amplitude adjustment calculator <b>131</b> uses the information to calculate the phases and amplitudes of the antenna elements to generate antenna directivity.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the power transmitter <b>100</b> fails to receive a signal from the wireless sensor <b>200</b> (No in S<b>2</b>), the processing in steps S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> is repeated until the failure count reaches a predetermined number (No in S<b>4</b>). When the failure count reaches or exceeds the predetermined number (Yes in S<b>4</b>), the antenna directivity for the wireless sensor <b>200</b> is set to the same value as a previous value (S<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Subsequent to step S<b>3</b> or step S<b>5</b>, the power transmitter <b>100</b> transmits a signal request to the human body tag <b>300</b> (S<b>6</b>). Upon receiving the signal request, the human body tag <b>300</b> responds to the signal request (transmits a response signal). The response signal from the human body tag <b>300</b> includes information about received power from the power transmission signal measured by the power monitor <b>320</b> in the human body tag.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Upon receiving the response signal from the human body tag <b>300</b> (Yes in S<b>7</b>), the power transmitter <b>100</b> uses the signal to estimate power exposure per slot on the human body carrying the human body tag <b>300</b> (S<b>8</b>). More specifically, the signal determiner <b>122</b> in the power transmitter <b>100</b> extracts information (received power from the power transmission signal) from the response signal from the human body tag <b>300</b> and outputs the extracted information to the power exposure estimator <b>141</b>. The power exposure estimator <b>141</b> includes a conversion formula or a conversion table that uses the received power from the power transmission signal to calculate power exposure on a human body. Thus, power exposure on a human body can be estimated using the conversion formula or the conversion table. The conversion formula or the conversion table for calculating (estimating) power exposure on a human body is obtained experimentally in advance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the power transmitter <b>100</b> receives no response signal from the human body tag <b>300</b> (No in S<b>7</b>), the power exposure per slot is substituted with minimum reception sensitivity (S<b>9</b>). In other words, when the power transmitter <b>100</b> receives no response signal from the human body tag <b>300</b>, radio waves to the human body tag <b>300</b> may be in an inappropriate state, causing a communication failure. In this case, the minimum reception sensitivity is expected to correspond to the power exposure on a human body.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A single slot in this example includes a directivity generation process for a single wireless sensor <b>200</b> followed by an estimation process that uses the human body tag <b>300</b> to estimate power exposure on a human body. In the above example using three wireless sensors <b>200</b>, the directivity control period includes three slots. Although the above example includes the single human body tag <b>300</b>, other examples may include multiple human body tags <b>300</b>. For multiple human body tags <b>300</b>, the processing in steps S<b>6</b> to S<b>9</b> may be repeated in each slot for each of the human body tags <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Subsequent to step S<b>8</b> or step S<b>9</b>, the power transmitter <b>100</b> determines whether the directivity generation process is performed on all the wireless sensors <b>200</b>. When the processing is performed on all the wireless sensors <b>200</b> (Yes in S<b>10</b>), the processing advances to step S<b>11</b>. The processing in steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>9</b> is repeated when the processing has yet to be performed on all the wireless sensors <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In S<b>11</b>, the power exposure on a human body obtained from the human body tag <b>300</b> in each slot is used to determine power exposure on a human body per cycle. In other words, when the directivity control period includes three slots as in the above example, the power exposure on a human body per cycle is determined as the average of power exposure on a human body over the three slots. For multiple human body tags <b>300</b>, the power exposure on a human body per cycle is determined for these human body tags <b>300</b>. The power exposure on a human body per cycle may be determined, rather than by averaging the power exposure on a human body for all slots, by averaging power exposure on a human body over a predetermined number of slots.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the power exposure on a human body per cycle obtained in S<b>11</b> is less than or equal to a predetermined value (Yes in S<b>12</b>), the power transmitter <b>100</b> transmits power normally (S<b>13</b>) in the power transmission-communication period. In the normal power transmission sequential process, the array antenna <b>150</b> sequentially uses different antenna directivity to transmit power to a different wireless sensor <b>200</b> without limiting the transmission power. The predetermined value is set in accordance with the safety standards in the Radio Radiation Protection Guidelines. When the power exposure on a human body per cycle is less than or equal to the predetermined value, no adverse effects are expected on the human body.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the power exposure on a human body per cycle obtained in S<b>11</b> is greater than the predetermined value (No in S<b>12</b>), the power transmitter <b>100</b> limits the power transmission (S<b>14</b>). Limiting the power transmission includes lowering transmission power during power transmission or stopping power transmission. More specifically, the transmission power calculator (transmission power limiter) <b>142</b> can limit the transmission power by reading appropriate transmission power corresponding to the estimated power exposure on a human body from the table stored in the storage <b>160</b>. Limiting the power transmission in this manner allows the system to prevent power exposure on a human body from exceeding the safety standards in the Radio Radiation Protection Guidelines. For multiple human body tags <b>300</b>, at least one of the multiple human body tags <b>300</b> with the power exposure on a human body per cycle exceeding the predetermined value causes negative determination in S<b>12</b>, and the power transmission is limited in S<b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system uses the human body tag <b>300</b> to estimate power exposure on a human body per slot. However, the estimated power exposure per slot may have an increased estimation error. Thus, the system does not limit the power transmission when the power exposure per slot exceeds the predetermined value, but limits the power transmission when the power exposure per cycle exceeds the predetermined value. The estimation error in power exposure per slot is more likely to differ greatly due to different antenna directivity during power transmission and is expected to occur with no specific direction. Thus, averaging power exposure over multiple slots allows power exposure per cycle with a decreased estimation error through the averaging. This allows the system to increase transmission power to power transmission targets and to reduce the power exposure on a human body in the environment in which power is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system produces the advantageous effects described above when power exposure on a human body over multiple slots is averaged. In other words, multiple wireless sensors <b>200</b> serving as secondary units produce the advantageous effects, and more slots (more wireless sensors <b>200</b>) generate more advantageous effects.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system described above estimates power exposure on a human body with a program executable by a central processing unit (CPU) (e.g., the central controller <b>140</b>) included in the power transmitter <b>100</b>.
