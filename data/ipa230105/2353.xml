Five mAChR subtypes have been cloned, M<sub>1 </sub>to M<sub>5</sub>. The M<sub>1 </sub>mAChR is predominantly expressed post-synaptically in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus; M<sub>2 </sub>mAChRs are located predominantly in the brainstem and thalamus, though also in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum where they reside on cholinergic synaptic terminals (Langmead et al., 2008 <i>Br J Pharmacol</i>). However, M<sub>2 </sub>mAChRs are also expressed peripherally on cardiac tissue (where they mediate the vagal innervation of the heart) and in smooth muscle and exocrine glands. M<sub>3 </sub>mAChRs are expressed at relatively low level in the CNS but are widely expressed in smooth muscle and glandular tissues such as sweat and salivary glands (Langmead et al., 2008 <i>Br J Pharmacol</i>).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system, especially the M<sub>1 </sub>mAChR, play a critical role in mediating higher cognitive processing. Diseases associated with cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease, are accompanied by loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (Whitehouse et al., 1982 <i>Science</i>). In schizophrenia, which also has cognitive impairment as an important component of the clinical picture, mAChR density is reduced in the pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and caudate putamen of schizophrenic subjects (Dean et al., 2002 <i>Mol Psychiatry</i>). Furthermore, in animal models, blockade or damage to central cholinergic pathways results in profound cognitive deficits and non-selective mAChR antagonists have been shown to induce psychotomimetic effects in psychiatric patients. Cholinergic replacement therapy has largely been based on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to prevent the breakdown of endogenous acetylcholine. These compounds have shown efficacy versus symptomatic cognitive decline in the clinic, but give rise to dose-limiting adverse events resulting from stimulation of peripheral M<sub>2 </sub>and M<sub>3 </sub>mAChRs including disturbed gastrointestinal motility, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (www.drugs.com/pro/donepezil.html; www.drugs.com/pro/rivastigmine.html).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Further discovery efforts have targeted the identification of direct M<sub>1 </sub>mAChR agonists with the aim of inducing selective improvements in cognitive function with a favourable adverse effect profile. Such efforts resulted in the identification of a range of agonists, exemplified by compounds such as xanomeline, AF267B, sabcomeline, milameline and cevimeline. Many of these compounds have been shown to be highly effective in pre-clinical models of cognition in both rodents and/or non-human primates. Milameline has shown efficacy versus scopolamine-induced deficits in working and spatial memory in rodents; sabcomeline displayed efficacy in a visual object discrimination task in marmosets and xanomeline reversed mAChR antagonist-induced deficits in cognitive performance in a passive avoidance paradigm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder (26.6 million people worldwide in 2006) that affects the elderly, resulting in profound memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. The aetiology of the disease is complex, but is characterised by two hallmark brain pathologies: aggregates of amyloid plaques, largely composed of amyloid-&#x3b2; peptide (A&#x3b2;), and neurofibrillary tangles, formed by hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The accumulation of A&#x3b2; is thought to be the central feature in the progression of AD and, as such, many putative therapies for the treatment of AD are currently targeting inhibition of A&#x3b2; production. A&#x3b2; is derived from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane bound amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is processed by two routes, nonamyloidgenic and amyloidgenic. Cleavage of APP by &#x3b3;-secretase is common to both pathways, but in the former APP is cleaved by an &#x3b1;-secretase to yield soluble APP&#x3b1;. However, in the amyloidgenic route, APP is cleaved by &#x3b2;-secretase to yield soluble APP&#x3b2; and also A&#x3b2;. In vitro studies have shown that mAChR agonists can promote the processing of APP toward the soluble, non-amyloidogenic pathway. In vivo studies showed that the mAChR agonist, AF267B, altered disease-like pathology in the 3&#xd7;TgAD transgenic mouse, a model of the different components of Alzheimer's disease (Caccamo et al., 2006 Neuron). The mAChR agonist cevimeline has been shown to give a small, but significant, reduction in cerebrospinal fluid levels of A&#x3b2; in Alzheimer's patients, thus demonstrating potential disease modifying efficacy (Nitsch et al., 2000 <i>Neurol</i>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Preclinical studies have suggested that mAChR agonists display an atypical antipsychotic-like profile in a range of pre-clinical paradigms. The mAChR agonist, xanomeline, reverses a number of dopamine mediated behaviours, including amphetamine induced locomotion in rats, apomorphine induced climbing in mice, dopamine agonist driven turning in unilateral 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and amphetamine induced motor unrest in monkeys (without EPS liability). It also has been shown to inhibit A10, but not A9, dopamine cell firing and conditioned avoidance and induces c-fos expression in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, but not in striatum in rats. These data are all suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic-like profile (Mirza et al., 1999 <i>CNS Drug Rev</i>). Muscarinic receptors have also been implicated in the neurobiology of addiction. The reinforcing effects of cocaine and other addictive substances are mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine system where behavioral and neurochemical studies have shown that the cholinergic muscarinic receptor subtypes play important roles in regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. For example M(4) (-/-) mice demonstrated significantly enhanced reward driven behaviour as result of exposure to cocaine (Schmidt et al Psychopharmacology (2011) August; 216 (3):367-78). Furthermore xanomeline has been demonstrated to block the effects of cocaine in these models.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Muscarinic receptors are also involved in the control of movement and potentially represent novel treatments for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, ADHD, Huntingdon's disease, tourette's syndrome and other syndromes associated with dopaminergic dysfunction as an underlying pathogenetic factor driving disease.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Xanomeline, sabcomeline, milameline and cevimeline have all progressed into various stages of clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and/or schizophrenia. Phase II clinical studies with xanomeline demonstrated its efficacy versus various cognitive symptom domains, including behavioural disturbances and hallucinations associated with Alzheimer's disease (Bodick et al., 1997 <i>Arch Neurol</i>). This compound was also assessed in a small Phase II study of schizophrenics and gave a significant reduction in positive and negative symptoms when compared to placebo control (Shekhar et al., 2008 <i>Am J Psych</i>). However, in all clinical studies xanomeline and other related mAChR agonists have displayed an unacceptable safety margin with respect to cholinergic adverse events, including nausea, gastrointestinal pain, diahorrhea, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), hypersalivation (excessive salivation), syncope and bradycardia.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Muscarinic receptors are involved in central and peripheral pain. Pain can be divided into three different types: acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic. Acute pain serves an important protective function in keeping the organism safe from stimuli that may produce tissue damage; however management of post-surgical pain is required. Inflammatory pain may occur for many reasons including tissue damage, autoimmune response, and pathogen invasion and is triggered by the action of inflammatory mediators such as neuropeptides and prostaglandins which result in neuronal inflammation and pain. Neuropathic pain is associated with abnormal painful sensations to non-painful stimuli. Neuropathic pain is associated with a number of different diseases/traumas such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), viral infection (such as HIV or Herpes). It is also common in cancer both as a result of the disease or a side effect of chemotherapy. Activation of muscarinic receptors has been shown to be analgesic across a number of pain states through the activation of receptors in the spinal cord and higher pain centres in the brain. Increasing endogenous levels of acetylcholine through acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, direct activation of muscarinic receptors with agonists or allosteric modulators has been shown to have analgesic activity. In contrast blockade of muscarinic receptors with antagonists or using knockout mice increases pain sensitivity. Evidence for the role of the M<sub>1 </sub>receptor in pain is reviewed by D. F. Fiorino and M. Garcia-Guzman, 2012.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">More recently, a small number of compounds have been identified which display improved selectivity for the M<sub>1 </sub>mAChR subtype over the peripherally expressed mAChR subtypes (Bridges et al., 2008 <i>Bioorg Med Chem Lett; </i>Johnson et al., 2010 <i>Bioorg Med Chem Lett; </i>Budzik et al., 2010 <i>ACS Med Chem Lett</i>). Despite increased levels of selectivity versus the M<sub>3 </sub>mAChR subtype, some of these compounds retain significant agonist activity at both this subtype and the M<sub>2 </sub>mAChR subtype. Herein we describe a series of compounds which unexpectedly display high levels of selectivity for the M<sub>1 </sub>and/or M<sub>4 </sub>mAChR over the M<sub>2 </sub>and M<sub>3 </sub>receptor subtypes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">The Invention</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0012">The present invention provides compounds having activity as muscarinic M<sub>1 </sub>and/or M<sub>4 </sub>receptor agonists.

suffering from, or at risk of suffering from, or potentially at risk of suffering from the disease or disorder in question. Thus, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; covers both preventative (prophylactic) treatment and treatment where measurable or detectable symptoms of the disease or disorder are being displayed.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">The term &#x201c;effective therapeutic amount&#x201d; as used herein (for example in relation to methods of treatment of a disease or condition) refers to an amount of the compound which is effective to produce a desired therapeutic effect. For example, if the condition is pain, then the effective therapeutic amount is an amount sufficient to provide a desired level of pain relief. The desired level of pain relief may be, for example, complete removal of the pain or a reduction in the severity of the pain.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">The term &#x201c;non-aromatic hydrocarbon group&#x201d; as in &#x201c;C<sub>1-10 </sub>non-aromatic hydrocarbon group&#x201d; or &#x201c;acyclic C<sub>1-5 </sub>non-aromatic hydrocarbon group&#x201d; refers to a group consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms and which contains no aromatic rings. The hydrocarbon group may be fully saturated or may contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-carbon triple bonds, or mixtures of double and triple bonds. The hydrocarbon group may be a straight chain or branched chain group or may consist of or contain a cyclic group. Thus the term non-aromatic hydrocarbon includes alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl alkyl and so on.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0146">The terms &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d;, &#x201c;alkenyl&#x201d;, &#x201c;alkynyl&#x201d;, &#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; aryl, heteroaryl and &#x201c;cycloalkenyl&#x201d; are used in their conventional sense (e.g. as defined in the IUPAC Gold Book) unless indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0147">The term &#x201c;saturated hydrocarbon group&#x201d; as in &#x201c;C<sub>1-4 </sub>saturated hydrocarbon group&#x201d; refers to a hydrocarbon group containing no carbon-carbon double bonds or triple bonds. The saturated hydrocarbon group can therefore be an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a cycloalkylalkyl group, an alkylcycloalkyl group or a alkylcycloalkylalkyl group. Examples of C<sub>1-4 </sub>saturated hydrocarbon groups include C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl groups, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl and cyclopropylmethyl.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">The term &#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; as used herein, where the specified number of carbon atoms permits, includes both monocyclic cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl, and bicyclic and tricyclic groups.

It will be appreciated that when a carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom, the lower valencies of the heteroatoms compared to carbon means that fewer atoms will be bonded to the heteroatoms than would have been bonded to the carbon atom that has been replaced. Thus, for example, replacement of of a carbon atom (valency of four) in a CH<sub>2 </sub>group by oxygen (valency of two) will mean that the resulting molecule will contain two less hydrogen atoms and replacement of a carbon atom (valency of four) in a CH<sub>2 </sub>group by nitrogen (valency of three) will mean that the resulting molecule will contain one less hydrogen atom.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150">Examples of a heteroatom replacements for carbon atoms include replacement of a carbon atom in a &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; chain with oxygen or sulfur to give an ether &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; or thioether &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, replacement of a carbon atom in a group CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C&#x2261;C&#x2014;H with nitrogen to give a nitrile (cyano) group CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C&#x2261;N, replacement of a carbon atom in a group &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; with C&#x2550;O to give a ketone &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, replacement of a carbon atom in a group &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; with S&#x2550;O or SO<sub>2 </sub>to give a sulfoxide &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; or sulfone &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S(O)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, replacement of a carbon atom in a &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; chain with C(O)NH to give an amide &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;NH&#x2014;, replacement of a carbon atom in a &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; chain with nitrogen to give an amine &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, and replacement of a carbon atom in a &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; chain with C(O)O to give an ester (or carboxylic acid) &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;O&#x2014;.

Determination of the crystal structure of a compound can be performed by X-ray crystallography which can be carried out according to conventional methods such as those described herein and as described in Fundamentals of Crystallography, C. Giacovazzo, H. L. Monaco, D. Viterbo, F. Scordari, G. Gilli, G. Zanotti and M. Catti, (International Union of Crystallography/Oxford University Press, 1992 ISBN 0-19-855578-4 (p/b), 0-19-85579-2 (h/b)). This technique involves the analysis and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction of single crystal. In an amorphous solid, the three dimensional structure that normally exists in a crystalline form does not exist and the positions of the molecules relative to one another in the amorphous form are essentially random, see for example Hancock et al. <i>J. Pharm. Sci. </i>(1997), 86, 1).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">Accordingly, in further embodiments, the invention provides:</p><p id="p-0186" num="0183">1.160 A compound according to any one of Embodiments 1.1 to 1.153 in a crystalline form.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0184">1.161 A compound according to any one of Embodiments 1.1 to 1.153 which is:</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">(a) from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly is at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">1.162 A compound according to any one of Embodiments 1.1 to 1.153 which is in an amorphous form.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Prodrugs</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0187">The compounds of the formula (1) as defined in any one of Embodiments 1.1 to 1.162 may be presented in the form of a pro-drug.

Chem. High Throughput Screen, </i>2008). ERK1/2 phosphorylation is a downstream consequence of both Gq/11 and Gi/o protein coupled receptor activation, making it highly suitable for the assessment of M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>3 </sub>(Gq/11 coupled) and M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>4 </sub>receptors (Gi/o coupled), rather than using different assay formats for different receptor subtypes. CHO cells stably expressing the human muscarinic M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2, </sub>M<sub>3 </sub>or M<sub>4 </sub>receptor were plated (25K/well) onto 96-well tissue culture plates in MEM-alpha+10% dialysed FBS. Once adhered, cells were serum-starved overnight. Agonist stimulation was performed by the addition of 5 &#x3bc;L agonist to the cells for 5 min (37&#xb0; C.). Media was removed and 50 &#x3bc;L of lysis buffer added. After 15 min, a 4 &#x3bc;L sample was transferred to 384-well plate and 7 &#x3bc;L of detection mixture added. Plates were incubated for 2 h with gentle agitation in the dark and then read on a PHERAstar plate reader.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0341">pEC<sub>50 </sub>and E<sub>max </sub>figures were calculated from the resulting data for each receptor subtype.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0342">The results are set out in Table 4 below.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0343">For each example with the 4-5 spiro system two diastereomers exist which have been separated, unless stated otherwise, and assigned based on their retention time on LCMS analytical trace.
