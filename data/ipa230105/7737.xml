level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of electric heaters for heating a liquid or frozen substance in a motor vehicle, in particular for a system for reducing the environmental pollution of the motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electric heater is particularly adapted to heat water or a solution of water and urea.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To heat a liquid or frozen substance in a motor vehicle, electric heaters may be used, provided with a heating element which generates heat by means of the Joule effect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the main issues encountered in these applications is the adequate insulation between the heating element and the substance to be heated, which must not come into contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another issue concerns the control of the temperature of the heating element, which must not exceed the limits imposed by the features of the materials with which the electric heater is made, which may degrade when the heating element reaches a temperature which is too high.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The need is therefore felt for an electric heater whose heating element is adequately insulated from the substance to be heated, even when it is in the liquid state, and which may reach a maximum temperature compatible with the materials with which it is made.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric heater whose heating element is adequately insulated from the substance to be heated, even when it is in the liquid state, and which may reach a maximum temperature compatible with the materials with which it is made.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this context, it is another object of the present invention to provide an electric heater made of a material chemically compatible with the substance to be heated; in particular, which has an adequate chemical resistance with respect to the substance to be heated.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a thin electric heater which allows an effective and efficient heating of the substance and which may be easily produced at low cost.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention achieves at least one of such objects, and other objects which will be apparent in the light of the present description, by means of an electric heater for heating a substance in a motor vehicle, in particular for a tank for a system for reducing the environmental pollution of a motor vehicle; the electric heater comprising<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0013">a metal sheet

id="ul0005-0003" num="0015">at least one PTC layer, electrically conductive and having a positive temperature coefficient, which at least partially coats the metal sheet;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">wherein the two polymeric layers are hermetically sealed to each other, defining a casing which prevents the substance to be heated from coming into contact with the metal sheet;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">wherein the metal sheet is in contact, in particular directly in contact, with both of said polymeric layers;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">wherein said at least one PTC layer preferably has a thickness from 5 to 50 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">Advantageously, such a thin thickness allows to optimally produce an electric heater wherein the metal sheet is in contact, in particular directly in contact, with both of said polymeric layers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Advantageously, thereby, the heating effect of the electric heater is optimized.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">It is particularly preferable that said at least one PTC layer is formed by or consists of an electrically conductive ink. An electrically conductive ink allows to optimally produce a particularly thin PTC layer, in particular having the aforesaid thickness.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Advantageously, it is not necessary, and preferably it is not provided, a further metal sheet which extends on a distinct plane, in particular distinct and parallel, with respect to the plane in which said metal sheet of the electric heater extends. Indeed, as already said, the metal sheet of a heater in accordance with the invention can advantageously come into contact with both of the polymeric layers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Preferably, said thickness of said at least one PTC layer is from 30 to 50 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">The invention also relates to a tank, or a device adapted to receive a liquid, according to claim <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Advantageously, the polymeric layers sealed to each other prevent the substance to be heated from coming into contact with the metal sheet, even when the substance is in the liquid state.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">It is also advantageous that at least one layer or element is provided with Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC), i.e., the resistivity of which increases with the increase of the temperature.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The PTC layer allows to substantially obtain a self-regulation of the temperature of the metal sheet, and therefore unwanted overheating of the polymeric layers is avoided. Therefore, the range of usable polymeric materials may be expanded.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">It is however preferable, as it is particularly advantageous, to make the polymeric layers in a material comprising or consisting of polypropylene. In other words, the polymeric layers are preferably made of polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">Polypropylene has been carefully selected as it is chemically compatible with aqueous solutions of water and urea, such as, for example, AdBlue&#xae;, which is very often used in motor vehicles to reduce the environmental pollution thereof. Furthermore, polypropylene can be heated up to relatively high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In the present description, &#x201c;substance&#x201d; means, in particular, a liquid which may be subject to freezing and thawing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">Further features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in light of the detailed description of non-exclusive example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">The dependent claims describe particular embodiments of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0033">In the description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which are provided by way of non-limiting example, in which:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a section of an electric heater according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a tank provided with an electric heater according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a top plan view of an electric heater in accordance with the invention, in which a component is not shown for illustrative purposes;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> diagrammatically shows the section A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> diagrammatically shows the section B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0037" num="0039">The same elements or components have the same reference numerals.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0040">With reference to the Figures, exemplary embodiments of an electric heater <b>1</b> according to the invention and of a tank <b>100</b> comprising an electric heater <b>1</b> therein are described.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">The electric heater <b>1</b> and the tank <b>100</b> are used, in particular, for heating a substance contained in a tank <b>100</b> of a motor vehicle (such as for example a car, van or truck), in particular, a substance for reducing the environmental pollution of a motor vehicle.
