the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein, for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to rotary valves, and more particularly to systems for monitoring wear and/or alignment of rotary valves.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multi-position rotary valve (also sometimes referred to as a domed rotary valve) is a large, multi-way valve, a part of which rotates intermittently among a number of discrete positions to control fluid flow, such as in a petrochemical refinery or food processing plant. A rotary valve acts as a multi-way switch among a plurality of pipes terminating at the rotary valve. The rotary valve selectively directs fluid arriving at one of the pipes to another of the pipes, depending on rotational position of a rotor plate within the rotary valve. In many embodiments, the rotor plate is on the order of two to ten feet (0.6 to 3 m) in diameter and about &#xbd; inch to six inches (12.7 to 152 mm) thick and is made primarily of carbon steel or stainless steel. In many embodiments, the rotor plate may be rotated to any of approximately two dozen discrete positions, thereby providing that number of different fluidic interconnections among the pipes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A circumferential misalignment between an aperture in the rotor plate and an aperture in a fixed track plate of the rotary valve would impede or prevent fluid flow. Typically, a visible target is fixed to a vertical pipe or a circumferential side surface of the rotor plate, and a sight glass in the rotary valve casing permits a technician to directly observe the target to check alignment between the rotor plate and the track plate. However, the rotor plate typically has only one target, which can therefore be checked at only one rotational position of the rotor plate. In typical operation, a rotary valve is advanced intermittently, such as about every 90 seconds. Because the alignment can be checked only once per revolution of the rotor plate, the alignment can be checked only once about every 36 minutes (assuming a 24-position rotary valve and a 90 second advancement period). Missing a window of opportunity to check the alignment may therefore require a technician to wait over half an hour to check the alignment, thereby allowing a process to run unoptimized for a long period of time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, wear and tear to a seal sheet disposed between the rotor plate and the track plate can prevent proper fluid control within the rotary valve. The seal sheet can be damaged by corrosion, erosion, friction, distortion, excessive heat, or by the presence of foreign objects. Once the seal sheet is damaged, either repair or replacement is necessary to reestablish an acceptable seal and better process control.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the working surface of the seal sheet is not visible from the sight glass and, thus, cannot be inspected via the sight glass. Instead, disassembly of the rotary valve is necessary to inspect the seal sheet. Disassembly is a costly and time-consuming process, due to the weight, size, and number of the components involved. Furthermore, disassembly necessarily involves a temporary halt in production and commensurate loss of revenue.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A better way to check and control rotor plate alignment, and a better way to check seal sheet condition, would be highly desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the present invention provides a multi-position rotary valve for selectively fluidically interconnecting subsets of pipes terminating at the rotary valve.

However, the working surface of the seal sheet <b>124</b> is not visible from the sight glass <b>304</b> and, thus, cannot be visually inspected via the sight glass <b>304</b>. To alleviate this problem, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, some embodiments include a digital camera <b>300</b> or other sensor attached to one of the pipes that terminates at the rotary valve <b>100</b>, for example pipe <b>102</b>.

The segmented washers <b>1100</b> and screws <b>1102</b> secure the seal sheet <b>124</b> to the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b>. If the bottom of the seal sheet <b>124</b> or the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> includes a fiducial mark, such as fiducial mark <b>215</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and the rotor plate <b>112</b> is suitably rotationally positioned, the fiducial mark <b>215</b> can be visible through the pipe <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> provides five other exemplary views up through the pipe <b>102</b>, at respective rotational positions of the rotor plate <b>112</b>, as visible to the camera <b>300</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> (<b>2</b>), the rotor plate <b>112</b> is rotationally positioned such that an aperture <b>2000</b> (such as aperture <b>128</b> or <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>17</b></figref>) in the track plate <b>122</b> is well aligned with an aperture <b>2002</b> in the rotor plate <b>112</b>, as indicated by the apertures <b>2000</b> and <b>2002</b> being concentric.

In these embodiments, the fiducial mark <b>215</b> can be disposed on a bottom surface of the rotor plate <b>112</b> or the bottom of the seal sheet <b>124</b>. The bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> or the seal sheet <b>124</b> can have one or more fiducial marks <b>215</b> thereon. For example, the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> or the seal sheet <b>124</b> can be engraved or otherwise marked to create the fiducial mark(s) <b>215</b>. Optionally or alternatively, as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b></figref> (<b>1</b>)-(<b>5</b>), at least a portion of one or more of the apertures <b>132</b>-<b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) through the rotary plate <b>112</b> may be used as the fiducial mark(s) <b>215</b>. For example, an edge of the aperture <b>132</b> may be used as the fiducial mark <b>215</b>. For example, the rotor plate <b>112</b> can be considered well aligned with the track plate <b>122</b> when the aperture <b>132</b> in the rotor plate <b>112</b> is concentric with the corresponding aperture <b>128</b> in the track plate <b>122</b>.

In these cases, a distance between the camera <b>300</b> and the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> can be arbitrary, at least with respect to the camera's field of view.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, in other cases, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the pipe <b>102</b> is straight, while a port hole through the track plate <b>124</b> is angled, for example at <b>1300</b>. In these cases, the camera's distance from the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> is limited by the angle <b>1300</b>. If the camera <b>300</b> is disposed too far from the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b>, the angle <b>1300</b> obscures at least a portion of the camera's view of the fiducial mark <b>215</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Contrast the view of the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> with the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. In these cases, the camera <b>300</b> can be attached to a T-plug <b>1302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), which disposes the camera <b>300</b> or other sensor inward of the flange <b>1004</b> and, therefore, reduces the distance between the camera <b>300</b> or other sensor and the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b>. The camera's or other sensor's view of the bottom of the rotor plate <b>112</b> or the seal sheet <b>124</b> may be partially obscured.

The scrubber <b>1500</b> is disposed on the surface of the sight glass <b>1502</b> opposite the digital camera <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, the scrubber <b>1500</b> includes a perforated pipe configured to spray a fluid on the sight glass <b>1502</b> to remove debris from the sight glass <b>1502</b>.
