In this way, a bonding structure is formed between the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>. An end of the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> facing toward the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> is a first contact surface <b>14</b>, and an end of the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> facing toward the first contact surface <b>14</b> is a second contact surface <b>24</b>. In addition, an area occupied by the first conductor group <b>131</b> on the first contact surface <b>14</b> is smaller than an area occupied by the second conductor group <b>132</b> on the first contact surface <b>14</b>, and an area occupied by the third conductor group <b>231</b> on the second contact surface <b>24</b> is smaller than an area occupied by the fourth conductor group <b>232</b> on the second contact surface <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The semiconductor structure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure includes the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b>.

During low-temperature (such as the first temperature) fusion, on upper and lower layers, tin (Sn) is directly opposite to each other, and copper (Cu) is directly opposite to each other. In the fusion process, tin is fused with nearby copper to form a Cu<sub>5</sub>Sn<sub>6 </sub>intermetallic compound (IMC). The upper and lower layers are made of a same material and opposite to each other, such that the intermetallic compound may be formed to improve the bonding strength, and resistance for slippage of stacked chips caused by external force or movement is provided to the stacked chips (especially alignment accuracy of chips on upper and lower layers).
