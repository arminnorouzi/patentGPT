description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method to prepare an alumina bismuth catalyst support for emission control applications, to an alumina bismuth catalyst support prepared according to the method of the invention and to an alumina bismuth catalyst support having specific characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The main raw emission pollutants in exhaust gases are CO, NOx, unburned hydrocarbons and soot particles. Catalyst systems, including various components and precious metals, for application in emission control are known in the art. Usually a so-called Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) containing precious metals supported on high-surface area refractory oxides such as alumina or silica-alumina converts CO into CO<sub>2 </sub>and the unburned hydrocarbons into CO<sub>2 </sub>and water. Due to continuously stricter legislation regarding tailpipe emissions and the introduction of more realistic driving cycles, including RDE (Real Driving Emissions) and WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure), the low temperature activity of such catalyst systems has become an important field of development.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The incorporation of activating and/or stabilizing additives (for example metal oxides) to the catalyst or catalyst support materials respectively is a well-known approach. WO 2017/064498 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,611,680 B2 disclose the beneficial effect of low temperature conversion for CO and hydrocarbons by the addition of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>to a catalyst. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,611,680 it is described that the bismuth is added as a promoter by an in situ reduction process. In WO 2017/064498 A1 the bismuth is supported on a support.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art therefore teaches the incorporation of the Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>as a separate crystalline phase. This leads to low specific surface area of the promoting additive and therefore to limited beneficial interaction with the active precious metal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved alumina bismuth support applicable in emission control catalysis having improved characteristics and a novel method for preparation of same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method to prepare an alumina bismuth catalyst support, the method comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">i) providing an aluminum containing composition, wherein the aluminum containing composition comprises a) boehmite or b) silica containing aluminum oxide;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">ii) providing a bismuth aqueous solution, the bismuth aqueous solution comprising a bismuth salt and a base comprising nitrogen, preferably ammonia, and having a pH value of between 4 and 9;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">iii) contacting the aluminum containing composition with the bismuth aqueous solution to form an aluminum bismuth intermediate; wherein the contacting is carried out:    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">in case of process step i) involving the aluminum containing composition comprising boehmite by mixing the aluminum containing composition in dried powder form or in the form of a suspension with the bismuth aqueous solution to form an aluminum bismuth intermediate, or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">in case of process step i) involving the aluminum containing composition comprising silica containing aluminum oxide by impregnating the aluminum containing composition in dried powder form with the bismuth aqueous solution to form an aluminum bismuth intermediate, and</li>    </ul>    </li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">iv) calcining the aluminum bismuth intermediate to form an alumina bismuth catalyst support.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0013">In step iii) the aluminum bismuth intermediate may also be called a boehmite bismuth intermediate in case in step i) the aluminum containing composition comprised boehmite.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0014">In step iii) the aluminum bismuth intermediate may also be called a silica aluminum oxide bismuth intermediate in case in step i) the aluminum containing composition comprised silica.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0015">Preferably the aluminum containing composition consists of boehmite or consists of silica containing aluminum oxide with respect to the aluminum containing compounds in the composition.
