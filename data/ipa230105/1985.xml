The invention also relates to a vehicle comprising such a chassis assembly. The chassis assembly is applicable on vehicles, in particularly trucks which are propelled by electric machines. Although the invention will mainly be described in relation to a truck, it may also be applicable for other types of vehicles propelled by electric machines.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to meet the increasing demands on vehicles, in particular the demands on heavy-duty trucks to provide more sustainable and low-emission based propulsions systems, there is a continuous development within a number of different fields relating to components and structures making up the chassis and the frames of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of example, a conventional manufacturing and assembly process of a truck vehicle is based around a chassis structure of having two longitudinally extending beams with cross sections in the form of C-profiles. These longitudinally extending beams are generally connected to each other by a suitable number of cross-members. In addition, the prime mover and gearbox are generally arranged in the front of the chassis, while essentially all other components are attached to the longitudinally extending beams.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, with the introduction of new energy storage systems, such as batteries and fuel cells, there has been an increasing activity for developing new frame structures and chassis assemblies so as to provide adequate space for sufficiently large batteries. Hence, one area of particular interest in heavy-duty vehicles is the arrangement of the energy storage system to the chassis assembly. Typically, the battery connected to the electric machine propelling the vehicle needs to be relatively large to be able to deliver a substantial amount of electric power to the electric machine(s), in particular when aiming for covering a long driving range without having to charge the battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to providing sufficient space for the energy storage system, the chassis assembly and the associated frame structures of heavy-duty vehicles need to be developed in order to handle forces that may be generated during a frontal vehicle crash. In fact, there is not only a need for mitigating the forces generated by the actual collision, but also a need for handling any movement of the high mass of the batteries on the vehicles.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is thus a desire to improve the chassis and its associated frame structure of a vehicle, in particular for heavy-duty vehicles including one or more energy storage systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a chassis assembly for a vehicle that at least partly overcomes the above-described deficiencies.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, there is provided a chassis assembly for a vehicle. The chassis assembly has a longitudinal centre line and extends in a transverse direction and in a vertical direction. The chassis assembly comprises an upper frame structure having at least two longitudinally extending upper side regions arranged on opposite sides of the longitudinal centre line. The upper side regions are connected to each other by upper connection portions. The chassis assembly further comprises a front crash structure configured to absorb energy during an impact generated from a vehicle collision. The front crash structure extends in the transverse direction. The upper frame structure is connected to the front crash structure. Moreover, the chassis assembly further comprises a lower frame structure having at least two longitudinally extending lower beams arranged on opposite sides of the longitudinal centre line. The lower beams are connected to each other by lower connection portions. Further, the lower frame structure is connected to the upper frame structure and to the front crash structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By the configuration of the chassis assembly, there is provided an improved reinforcement structure so as to better handle loads generated from a frontal crash. The proposed chassis assembly also contributes to an improved impact protection for an energy storage system, ESS, such as a battery pack, which is at least partly supported by the components making up the chassis assembly of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The chassis assembly is particularly useful for heavy-duty vehicles containing energy storage systems, such as batteries.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the chassis assembly provides for a more cost-efficient and weight-effective chassis reinforcement, without negatively impacting the main frame structure of the vehicle, such as the upper frame structure of the chassis assembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the chassis assembly contributes to an improved load path for forces generated from a frontal crash in that the front crash structure may be further joined to one or more suspended ESS units and an optimal rear suspension part, as further described herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, by the configuration of the chassis assembly, it becomes possible to improve the force distribution in the front of the vehicle during a frontal crash. That is, by providing an arrangement in which the lower frame structure is connected to the upper frame structure and to the front crash structure, it becomes possible to avoid, or at least reduce frame bending/deformation, while reducing risk of transferring critical forces into any support arrangements for the batteries, such as battery support brackets. To this end, it become possible to provide a robust, yet simple and weight-effective chassis assembly for a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, by the arrangement of having the lower frame structure connected both to the upper frame structure and to the front crash structure, it becomes possible to provide a separate impact protection in the form of the longitudinally extending lower beams for an ESS, such as a battery pack, that is supported by the upper and lower longitudinally extending frame portions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By the arrangement of the upper and lower frame structures, the chassis assembly is adapted to be a load bearing frame arrangement, in which the components making up the upper and lower frame structures may generally increase the stiffness of the load bearing frame arrangement. As such, the chassis assembly can also absorb the load generated by heavy-duty vehicle batteries connected to the frame structures.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One advantage with connecting the longitudinally extending lower beams to each other by the lower connection portions, is that the load paths during a collision is further improved. Typically, a frontal collision with another vehicle may also result in that the impact from the collision is absorbed by the chassis assembly slightly offset from the longitudinal center line of the vehicle. The provision of connecting the longitudinally extending lower beams to each other by the lower connection portions may contribute to an overall stiffer structure, thus may also further improve the chassis assembly for handling such frontal collision with another vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be noted that the lower frame structure is arranged vertically spaced apart from the upper frame structure by a distance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an example embodiment, the longitudinally extending upper side regions are provided in the form of longitudinally extending upper beams, respectively. In this manner, there is proved a simple, yet stiff and robust chassis assembly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Typically, the chassis assembly may further comprise an energy storage system, ESS, adapted to store at least one ESS unit so that the ESS unit is supported by one of the longitudinally extending upper beams and one of the longitudinally extending lower beams.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By way of example, the ESS unit is a battery unit, the battery unit is supported by one of the longitudinally extending upper beams and one of the longitudinally extending lower beams.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, or alternatively, at least one of the ESS unit may be any one of a hydrogen tank and diesel tank. Hence, by way of example, the ESS unit may be any one of a hydrogen tank and diesel tank.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an example embodiment, the ESS is adapted to store the at least one ESS unit on at least one of the transverse outsides of the upper frame structure and the lower frame structure. One advantage with providing an assembly where e.g. larger batteries can be arranged on the transverse outsides of the upper frame structure and the lower frame structure is that more space for the batteries is created compared to more conventional arrangement of batteries, e.g. chassis assemblies where the batteries are arranged in the transverse centre of the vehicle. Hence, another advantage is that the assembly and mounting processes of the batteries to the chassis assembly can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an example embodiment, the ESS units are arranged to the chassis assembly by a number of interconnecting portions. By way of example, the inter-connecting portions are provided in the form of brackets. The ESS unit brackets may be positioned along the longitudinal extension of the vehicle assembly at a predetermined distance from each other.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an example embodiment, a vertical distance between one of the longitudinally extending upper side regions and one corresponding longitudinally extending lower beam is at least <b>0</b>.<b>3</b> meters. In this manner, the chassis assembly may be further improved in terms of robustness and effectiveness in handling forces generated during a frontal collision with other objects, such as another vehicle. Typically, although strictly not required, each one of the at least two longitudinally extending lower beams may be connected to the front crash structure. According to an example embodiment, the front crash structure is a collapsible crash structure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, or alternatively, the front collapsible crash structure may comprise a horizontal profile having at least two vertical support members configured to attach to the upper frame structure and at least two horizontal support members configured to collapse during the vehicle collision. An advantage is that the front crash structure is adapted to deform and/or collapse in a more effective manner.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an example embodiment, each one of the at least two longitudinally extending lower beams is connected to the upper frame structure by means of a frame bracket. In this manner, the loads absorbed by the vehicle assembly during a collision is further improved. In addition, there is provided a simple, yet robust way of connecting the lower frame structure to the upper frame structure. By way of example, the frame backet is a rear frame bracket, wherein each one of the at least two longitudinally extending lower beams is connected to the upper frame structure by means of the rear frame bracket at a rear portion of the chassis assembly. According to an example embodiment, the chassis assembly comprises a number of frame brackets arranged spaced apart along the longitudinal direction of the vehicle assembly. The bracket(s) may also increase the stiffness of the chassis assembly while at the same time serve as connector elements for one or more of the ESS units. Typically, and according to an example embodiment, the frame bracket may be connected to the vehicle assembly and extends transversally away from the longitudinal side regions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, each one of the at least two longitudinally extending lower beams may be connected to a rear suspension frame bracket. An advantage is that the weight and costs of the overall chassis assembly may be reduced in comparison to other hitherto known frame structures for heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an example embodiment, the lower frame structure is connected to the upper frame structure at a front region and at a rear region of the chassis assembly. By way of example, the lower frame structure is connected to the upper frame structure at the front region via the front crash structure and at the rear region via the rear suspension frame bracket.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an example embodiment, each one of the at least two longitudinally extending upper side regions and the at least two longitudinally extending lower beams is located at a substantially same transversal distance from the longitudinal centre line. Hereby, there is provided a chassis assembly that may allow for a simple, yet reliable connection of other vehicle components to the chassis assembly, which is at least partly due to that the upper and lower frame structures are located in the same plane, or at least relative close to each other as seen in a transverse direction from a centre plane.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an example embodiment, each one of the two longitudinally extending upper beams is made of a continuous C-profile beam.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an example embodiment, the upper frame structure is a composite sandwich structure continuously extending between the longitudinally extending upper side regions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a second aspect, there is provided a vehicle, comprising a vehicle chassis according to any one of the embodiments described above in relation to the first aspect. By way of example, the vehicle is any one of an electric vehicle and a hybrid vehicle comprising at least an electric powertrain system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an example embodiment, the vehicle may comprise a electric machine for propelling the vehicle, the vehicle further comprises a plurality of vehicle batteries electrically connected to the electric machine, wherein the vehicle batteries are connected to the vehicle assembly transversally outside the sides of the upper and lower frame structures.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Effects and features of the second aspect are largely analogous to those described above in relation to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further features of, and advantages with, the present invention will become apparent when studying the appended claims and the following description. The skilled person realize that different features of the present invention may be combined to create embodiments other than those described in the following, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure, will be better understood through the following illustrative and non-limiting detailed description of exemplary embodiments, wherein:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of a vehicle according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a chassis assembly according to an example embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the chassis assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of the chassis assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to an example embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a bottom view of the chassis assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> according to an example embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments are shown. The disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided for thoroughness and completeness. Like reference character refer to like elements throughout the description.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is provided a vehicle <b>10</b> in the form of a truck. The vehicle <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a pair of front wheels <b>12</b> and a pair of rear wheels <b>14</b>. It should however be readily understood that the vehicle <b>10</b> may equally as well comprise a first pair of rear wheels and a second pair of rear wheels, where the first pair of wheels is positioned longitudinally in front of the second pair of rear wheels. The second pair of rear wheels may be connected to a so-called tag-axle and the first pair of rear wheels may be connected to a so-called pusher axle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vehicle <b>10</b> further comprises a chassis assembly <b>20</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. The chassis assembly <b>20</b> has a longitudinal centre line X<sub>c</sub>. The chassis assembly <b>20</b> has an extension in the longitudinal direction X. Moreover, the chassis assembly has an extension in a transverse direction Y and in a vertical direction Z. It should be noted that the terms top, above, upper, upward, below, lower, downward and bottom, as well as any other similar terms are used in reference to the position of the vehicle assembly <b>20</b> as depicted in the drawings and the vehicle assembly may be positioned and used in other orientations. In other words, also terms such as front, rear, side, and any other similar terms refers to the directions and orientations as depicted in the drawings and the vehicle assembly may be positioned and used in other orientations. The chassis assembly <b>20</b> is generally intended and configured to provide a load bearing support to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning now to e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the chassis assembly <b>20</b> comprises an upper frame structure <b>30</b> comprising at least two longitudinally extending upper side regions <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> arranged on opposite sides of the longitudinal centre line Xc. The upper side regions are connected to each other by upper connection portions <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>88</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. By way of example, the longitudinally extending upper side regions <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are provided in the form of longitudinally extending upper beams, respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. Hence, the vehicle assembly here comprises two longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. The longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are connected to each other by a number of upper connection portions <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>88</b>. By way of example, the upper connection portions <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>88</b> are provided in the form of transverse cross-members. The transverse cross-members are connected to the longitudinally extending upper beams in a suitable manner, e.g. in the form of fastening elements to form connection portions. The fastening elements can, for example, be formed by screw joints, bolts, rivets, welds, etc. or any other suitable fasteners for connecting components to the each other. The transverse cross-members can be provided in several different manners. By way of example, the cross-members can extend in-between the longitudinally extending upper beams so as to connect them to each other. Examples of such cross-members are the cross-member <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>88</b>. In addition, or alternatively, the cross-members can extend between the upper beams and be arranged vertically above the longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> so as to connect them to each other. One example of such cross-member is the cross-member <b>84</b>. Another type of cross-member is the front closing structure <b>85</b>. The front closing structure <b>85</b> is arranged at the front of the chassis assembly <b>20</b>, thus at the front of the upper frame structure <b>30</b>. The front closing structure <b>85</b> is arranged to close the front gap defined by the longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> so as to provide further stability to the chassis assembly. In this example, the front closing structure <b>85</b> comprises two side brackets <b>86</b>, <b>87</b> and a front plate <b>89</b>. The front plate extends in the transverse direction Y between the longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. The side brackets <b>86</b>, <b>87</b> are connected to the front plate <b>89</b> and further connected to the longitudinally extending upper beams <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>.

The front crash structure <b>40</b> is here a collapsible crash structure. The front collapsible crash structure comprises a horizontal profile <b>42</b> having at least two vertical support members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> configured to attach to the upper frame structure <b>30</b> and at least two horizontal support members <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> configured to collapse during the vehicle collision. In this context, the term horizontal generally means that the components have at least a substantial orientation in alignment with the longitudinal direction X, as illustrated in e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The horizontal support members <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> are here made by a deformable material and/or with a deformable structure, e.g. a standard steel profile shaped to provide a defined deformation.
