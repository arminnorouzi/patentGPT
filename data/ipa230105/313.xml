In this case, the control unit <b>52</b> (the focus control unit <b>61</b>) controls the wobbling operation of the focus lens <b>41</b> according to the emission timings of the WLI light and the IR light. More specifically, the focus control unit <b>61</b> does not move the focus lens <b>41</b> in the wobbling operation at least during the emission period of the WLI light and moves the focus lens <b>41</b> in the wobbling operation at least during the emission period of the IR light.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0093">The evaluation process (determination of the direction and the movement amount of the focus lens <b>41</b>) using the AF evaluation value is performed in the stopping period (the exposure period of the WLI image) of the focus lens <b>41</b> in the wobbling operation and the result thereof is used in the subsequent movement of the focus lens <b>41</b>. In the evaluation process, the AF evaluation value calculated from the WLI image captured in the previous stopping period in the wobbling operation and the AF evaluation value calculated from the WLI image captured in a stopping period before the previous stopping period are acquired. In the evaluation process using the AF evaluation value, an AF evaluation value calculated from at least two WLI images may be acquired. The focus control unit <b>61</b> may perform control so that the focus lens <b>41</b> is not moved in the wobbling operation at least during an exposure period of pixels for receiving a WLI light and calculating an AF evaluation value. For example, when the pixels for calculating the AF evaluation value used in the wobbling operation are pixels positioned near the center of an imaging element, the focus lens <b>41</b> is not moved in a period in which the pixels positioned around the center are exposed to the WLI light, and the focus lens <b>41</b> is moved in a period in which the other pixels are exposed to the WLI light. In this way, by moving the focus lens in an exposure period of an invalid region of an endoscope image which becomes dark due to vignetting resulting from the scope, it is possible to secure a longer moving time of the focus lens.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0094">According to the above-described operation, the focus lens <b>41</b> is moved in the wobbling operation in an exposure period (an emission period of the IR light) of an IR image that is not used for calculation of the AF evaluation value. That is, since the focus lens <b>41</b> is not moved during capturing of a WLI image in the wobbling operation, the focus shake can be reduced and an evaluation process (determination of the direction and the movement amount of the focus lens <b>41</b>) using the AF evaluation value calculated from two clear WLI images can be performed. In other words, the movement amount and direction of the focus lens <b>41</b> are calculated by comparing the AF evaluation values of the two WLI images.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0095">In this way, even when a wobbling operation is performed in special light observation in which normal light such as WLI light and special light such as IR light are irradiated alternately, it is possible to obtain an appropriate AF evaluation value and realize more accurate AF.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0096">As described above, although an IR image is captured so as to correspond to an emission period of IR light, an AF evaluation value is not calculated from the IR image. However, the AF evaluation value calculated from the IR image is not used in the evaluation process even if the AF evaluation value is not stored in the storage unit <b>55</b> of the control apparatus <b>18</b> or is stored in the storage unit <b>55</b>. If the difference between the two AF evaluation values is larger than a predetermined value, the wobbling operation may be reset. As a result, it is possible to reset the AF evaluation value when the AF evaluation value of the WLI image and the IR image is compared due to error (for example, a synchronization error).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0097">In the wobbling operation of the medical observation system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the focus lens <b>41</b> is moved in the wobbling operation with reference to the center of balance of the exposure period corresponding to a WLI light. Specifically, a midpoint (the center of balance of an exposure period corresponding to IR light) between the centers of balance of two successive exposure periods (exposure periods used for calculation of the AF evaluation value) corresponding to WLI light coincides with a midpoint of the moving time of the focus lens <b>41</b> in the wobbling operation. The center of balance of an exposure period may be regarded as an exposure time of pixels positioned at the center of an imaging element.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0098">In this way, in the evaluation process of the wobbling operation, when the AF evaluation values calculated from two WLI images are compared, it is possible to equalize the respective AF evaluation values.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0099">As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, although movement of the focus lens <b>41</b> to the in-focus position by the hill-climbing AF method as well as the wobbling operation of the focus lens <b>41</b> is controlled, the movement of the focus lens <b>41</b> may be stopped completely during the emission period of the WLI light.

Modified Example</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0100">(Special Light Observation Mode and Normal Light Observation Mode)</p><p id="p-0101" num="0101">The medical observation system according to the present embodiment can operate in a normal light observation mode in which a surgical area serving as a subject is irradiated with normal light only in addition to a special light observation mode in which the surgical area is alternately irradiated with normal light and special light. In the normal light observation mode, a wobbling operation is performed regardless of an emission timing or the like.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0102">In this case, the movement amount of the focus lens in the wobbling operation may be different from the special light observation mode and the normal light observation mode. Moreover, the movement amount of the focus lens in the hill-climbing AF operation may be different from the special light observation mode to the normal light observation mode. Here, the movement amount being different means that the focus lens moves different distances.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103">For example, the movement amount of the focus lens during the emission period of IR light in the wobbling operation in the special light observation mode may be smaller than that in the normal light observation mode. A user may frequently switch from the normal light observation mode to the special light observation mode when a region to be observed is already in focus. Therefore, in the special light observation mode, it is not necessary to move the focus lens as much as in the normal light observation mode. Furthermore, by decreasing the amount of the focus lens in the wobbling operation, it is possible to reduce the influence of image distortion due to the wobbling operation. Moreover, for example, the movement amount of the hill-climbing AF operation in the special light observation mode may be smaller than that in the normal light observation mode. Furthermore, in the special light observation mode, the movement amount of the hill-climbing AF operation during the emission period of second wavelength light may be smaller than the movement amount of the hill-climbing AF operation during the emission period of first wavelength light. In this way, it is possible to flexibly set the irradiation time of the second wavelength light and the imaging frame rate of the second wavelength light. Moreover, the movement amount of the focus lens during the emission period of IR light in the wobbling operation in the special light observation mode may be larger than that in the normal light observation mode. There is a possibility that a region to be observed by an operator may be different from the normal light observation mode to the special light observation mode. Therefore, by increasing the movement amount of the focus lens in the special light observation mode to be larger than that in the normal light observation mode, it is possible to focus on an observation target different from that of the normal light observation mode.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">Since the focus in the special light observation is on the deeper side than the focus in the normal light observation, the focus lens in the wobbling operation in the special light observation mode may be moved closer to the FAR side (i.e., the side further away from the object under observation as viewed on an optical axis of the imaging device) than in the normal light observation mode. Similarly, a reference position of the focus lens in the wobbling operation in the special light observation mode may be moved closer to the FAR side than in the normal light observation mode.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0105">The moving speed of the focus lens in the wobbling operation may be different from the special light observation mode and the normal light observation mode.

In this way, when it is necessary to shorten the emission period of IR light, a sufficient wobbling operation can be performed. Moreover, for example, the moving speed of the hill-climbing AF operation in the special light observation mode may be higher than that in the normal light observation mode. In this way, it is possible to move the focus lens to the in-focus position more quickly while suppressing the influence on the evaluation value. Moreover, by increasing the movement amount during emission of normal light to be larger than during emission of IR light, it is possible to suppress the influence of a rolling shutter while suppressing increase in focusing time and acquire a more accurate evaluation value. Furthermore, in the special light observation mode, the moving speed in the hill-climbing AF operation during the emission period of second wavelength light may be higher than the moving speed in the hill-climbing AF operation during the emission period of first wavelength light. In this way, it is possible to flexibly set the irradiation time of the second wavelength light and the imaging frame rate of the second wavelength light.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">As described above, when the movement amount and the moving speed of the focus lens in the wobbling operation are different from the special light observation mode and the normal light observation mode, the movement amount and the moving speed in the special light observation mode may be changed according to the irradiation time of the IR light to move the focus lens in the wobbling operation. Similarly, the movement amount and the moving speed in the special light observation mode may be changed according to the imaging frame rate to move the focus lens in the wobbling operation. In this way, in the special light observation mode, the irradiation time of the first wavelength light can be easily made different from that of the second wavelength light and the frame rate can be easily made different, and the degree of freedom in design can be improved.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">When it is determined by image recognition that an organ serving as a surgical site is in focus, the movement amount of the focus lens in the wobbling operation may be decreased.
