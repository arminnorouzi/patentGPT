Moreover, fuel conditioning system and control system <b>10</b> can provide gas turbine <b>300</b> operations with a variety of LPG fuel compositions, including but not limited LPG fuel that includes at least one of methane, ethane, hexane, pentane, propane, and butane</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiments, fuel conditioning system and control system <b>10</b> transports liquid LPG fuel downstream from storage or storage tank <b>102</b> to gas turbine <b>300</b>, while converting the liquid LPG fuel from a liquid state to a supercritical state. The flow of LPG fuel is in fuel delivery sub-system <b>100</b> and controlled by fuel and control system <b>20</b>. From storage tank <b>102</b> the liquid LPG fuel flow in conduit <b>104</b>L with low-pressure pump <b>106</b> and high-pressure pump <b>108</b> providing motive force to the liquid LPG fuel. As noted, VFD/SR <b>115</b> drives high-pressure pump <b>108</b>. VFD/SR <b>115</b> drives high-pressure pump <b>108</b> through signals from fuel and control system <b>20</b>. GC/WIM <b>126</b> obtains constituent information of liquid LPG fuel including interchangeability of liquid LPG fuel gases, heating specifics of the liquid LPG fuel and liquid LPG fuel's relative ability to deliver energy before the liquid LPG fuel is moved through low-pressure pump <b>106</b> and high-pressure pump <b>108</b>. After low-pressure pump <b>106</b> and high-pressure pump <b>108</b>, the liquid LPG fuel flows downstream to a first set of sensors, pressure sensor <b>110</b> PT<sub>0 </sub>and temperature sensor <b>112</b> TE<sub>0</sub>. The flow of liquid LPG fuel then is metered and controlled by LFMV <b>114</b> that permits downstream flow as determined by fuel and control system <b>20</b>. After LFMV <b>114</b>, the liquid LPG fuel has its pressure and temperature sensed by another set of sensors, pressure sensor <b>116</b> PT<sub>L </sub>and temperature sensor <b>118</b> TE<sub>L</sub>. The liquid LPG fuel then enters reactor or vaporizer/heat exchanger <b>120</b>. In vaporizer/heat exchanger <b>120</b>, heat is applied to vaporizer/heat exchanger <b>120</b> by heating source <b>140</b> to heat the liquid LPG fuel to supercritical LPG fuel. The then supercritical LPG fuel flows downstream and again has its pressure and temperature sensed by pressure sensor <b>122</b> PT<sub>SC </sub>and temperature sensor <b>124</b> TE<sub>SC </sub>that provide supercritical LPG fuel thermodynamic property information and feedback to fuel and control system <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The supercritical LPG fuel next flows in conduit <b>104</b>SC to SOV <b>130</b>. After SOV <b>130</b> the pressure and temperature of the supercritical LPG fuel is again sensed by pressure sensor <b>132</b> PT<sub>SC </sub>and temperature sensor <b>134</b> TE<sub>SC </sub>and provide supercritical LPG fuel thermodynamic property information and feedback to fuel and control system <b>20</b> and PLC <b>200</b> along signal paths <b>202</b>, and enable fuel and control system <b>20</b> to manage flow of supercritical LPG fuel in its liquid, gaseous, and/or supercritical states through the fuel conditioning system and control system <b>10</b>. After pressure sensor <b>132</b> PT<sub>SC </sub>and temperature sensor <b>134</b> TE<sub>SC </sub>the supercritical LPG fuel is then fed through FCV <b>136</b> in fuel demand amounts determined and controlled by fuel and control system <b>20</b>. Flow control module <b>138</b> can be based on gas turbine core control <b>206</b> information about gas turbine <b>300</b> and its component's operational characteristics.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Fuel conditioning system and control system <b>10</b> in conjunction with fuel and control system <b>20</b> and gas turbine <b>300</b> operational information and fuel demand enable the overall fuel conditioning system and control system <b>10</b> to provide real-time and dynamic control and conditioning of liquid LPG fuel to supercritical LPG fuel. Accordingly, FCV <b>136</b> can be set to a desired position in accordance with the instantaneous, dynamic, and real time values using at least one of sensed fuel pressure, temperature, and composition characteristics, including those values at FCV <b>136</b> to set desired FCV <b>136</b> position meeting fuel demand of gas turbine <b>300</b>. The desired position of FCV <b>136</b> permits supercritical LPG to pass therethrough in appropriate amounts to operation gas turbine <b>300</b> in dynamic and steady state conditions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.
