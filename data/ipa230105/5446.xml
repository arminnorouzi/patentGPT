In particular, it may be highly advantageous to detect whether images that are being displayed at corresponding screen are moving according to, for example, real scenarios captured by a camera or, on the contrary, become frozen. Nowadays, it is unacceptable, for example, in the automotive industry to have frozen images in a video displayer showing images from, for example, a rear-view video camera or similar.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects disclosed herein generally provide, inter alia, new video displayers, methods and computer programs aimed at solving the aforementioned problem.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, a video displayer with image freezing detection is provided. The video displayer includes a multi-layer display panel including a plurality of layers with at least a front layer and a pixel generator layer. The front layer and the pixel generator layer are configured to at least partially allow light therethrough, and the pixel generator layer is configured to emit pixel light in an emitting direction towards the front layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The video displayer further comprises a light reflector, a light sensor, and a controller. The light reflector is arranged in the plurality of layers in such a way that, in use, the light reflector reflects pixel light from the pixel generator layer in a reflection direction towards the pixel generator layer. The light sensor is arranged in such a way that, in use, the light sensor receives the reflected pixel light at a receiving location and senses light variations in the received reflected pixel light. The controller is configured to receive the light variations sensed by the light sensor and to detect image freezing depending on the received sensed light variations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The proposed video displayer may detect whether image freezing has occurred or is occurring while displaying video images. If no variation of light from one image to another is detected, it may be concluded that image freezing has occurred or is occurring. Any number of consecutive images may be considered to discern whether image displaying become frozen or not. If no light variation is detected within the sequence of consecutive images, it may be determined that image freezing has occurred or is occurring. Alternatively, light variations may refer to light divergences between image to be displayed and light produced by what is really displayed. If light divergences are detected, it may be concluded that image freezing has occurred or is occurring, or the contrary situation otherwise.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thresholds may be used to achieve such a conclusion. In some examples, if some light variation between consecutive displayed images is detected below a corresponding variation threshold, it may be determined that image freezing has occurred or is occurring. Otherwise, if variation threshold is exceeded, it may be determined that image freezing has not occurred or is not occurring. In other examples, if some light divergence between an image to be displayed and what is really displayed is detected below the corresponding divergence threshold, it may be determined that image freezing has not occurred or is not occurring. Otherwise, if divergence threshold is exceeded, it may be determined that image freezing has occurred or is occurring.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Light variations and/or divergences may refer to variations/divergences of any light parameter that permits distinguishing one image from another and/or differences between image to be displayed and what is really displayed. For example, the light parameter may correspond to at least one of light frequency, light amplitude, light intensity, etc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, the control unit or module may be configured to generate at a &#x201c;pattern&#x201d; region of the pixel generator layer a dynamic pattern of pixel light according to predefined light variations in the emitting direction, and to detect image freezing depending on whether the sensed light variations correspond to the predefined light variations. The detector system may further comprise a pattern generator arranged at or integrated within the &#x201c;pattern&#x201d; region of the pixel generator layer, and the control unit may be accordingly configured to control the pattern generator to generate the dynamic pattern of pixel light.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The proposed video displayer with dynamic pattern generation may permit effectively and accurately detecting image freezing even if images being displayed correspond to a monotonous scenario, i.e., without clearly detectable changes in light. In a vehicle rear-view system, for example, images captured and displayed on video displayer may correspond to uniform landscape or environment while, for example, a vehicle is circulating on a highway or stopped. The proposed solution permits generate dynamic pattern(s) with clearly discernible light variations for ensuring accurate detection of discrepancies between predefined and sensed light variations. For example, predefined light variations may be defined with a minimum variability such that differences between predefined and sensed light variations are clearly detectable. The proposed video displayer may thus permit a very effective and accurate detection of image freezing based on such detectable differences. When, for example, differences are above a predefined difference threshold, it may be determined that image freezing has occurred or is occurring. Otherwise, occurrence of image freezing may be discarded.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some configurations, the light reflector may be arranged at the front layer or at an intermediate layer between the pixel generator layer and the front layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Video displayers according to present disclosure are based on a multi-layer display panel permitting light through and having a pixel generator layer configured to emit pixel light towards front layer (in emitting direction). Examples of such displayers may be those based on light emitting diode (LED) technology, such as, for example organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The plurality of layers may further comprise, in some implementations, a back layer, and the pixel generator layer may be arranged between the front layer and the back layer. Such a back layer may be configured to at least partially let light through or may be opaque. In the second case, the back layer may be the only opaque layer in the multi-layer display panel and may be made of metal such as, for example, copper.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The opaque back layer may include an opening to permit light therethrough between the light reflector and the light sensor. In other words, the light sensor may be arranged in such a way that, in use, the light sensor receives the reflected pixel light at the receiving location through the opening in the back layer. In any case, with or without the opening in the back layer, the light reflector and the light sensor may thus be in optical communication.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In examples according to a &#x201c;direct reception&#x201d; approach, the back layer may include an outside side of the multi-layer display panel, and the light sensor may be arranged in such a way that, in use, a sensing side of the light sensor receives light from the light reflector at the receiving location. Such a sensing side may be facing the outside side of the back layer. Sensing side may be defined as a side of the light sensor at which light is received and accordingly sensed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In implementations according to &#x201c;direct reception&#x201d; approach, the light sensor may be arranged attached to the outside side of the back layer or attached to a Printed circuit board (PCB) of the video displayer facing the outside side of the back layer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively to &#x201c;direct reception&#x201d; approach, the light sensor may include a sensor unit and a light guide. The sensor unit may be arranged remotely with respect to the multi-layer display panel, and the light guide may be arranged to cause transmission of the reflected pixel light from the receiving location to the sensor unit. These implementations may be referred to as an &#x201c;indirect reception&#x201d; approach in the sense that the reflected pixel light is received by sensor unit indirectly through the light guide.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In examples according to &#x201c;indirect reception&#x201d; approach, the light guide may be made of optical fibre or methacrylate, and/or the sensor unit may be arranged on a PCB of a Camera Monitoring System (CMS) which is arranged in a remote position with respect to the multi-layer display panel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some configurations, the light sensor may be arranged to receive the reflected pixel light at the receiving location through the aforementioned opening in the back layer so that passage of light is permitted and/or enhanced. Alternatively, &#x201c;indirect reception&#x201d; approach may be implementable without the need of such an opening in the back layer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to examples, the light reflector may be arranged at a margin or near-margin location of the multi-layer display panel, the margin or near-margin location being covered or coverable by a bezel of the video displayer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, the controller may be configured to detect image freezing further depending on an ambient light sensed by an ambient light sensor (ALS). Such an ambient light sensor may be comprised in the detector system and/or in the video displayer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further aspect, a method is provided for any one of the proposed video displayers to detect image freezing. This &#x201c;detector&#x201d; method comprises receiving, by the control unit, light variations sensed by the light sensor in reflected pixel light received at receiving location from the light reflector which has originated the reflected pixel light by reflecting pixel light from the pixel generator layer in a reflection direction towards the pixel generator layer. The &#x201c;detector&#x201d; method further comprises detecting, by the control unit, image freezing depending on the received sensed light variations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a still further aspect, a computer program is provided comprising program instructions for causing a computing system to perform methods of detecting image freezing, such as the ones proposed herein. The computer program may be embodied on a storage medium.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a yet further aspect, a computing system is provided for detecting image freezing in a video displayer, the computing system comprising a memory and a processor, embodying instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and the instructions comprising functionality or functionalities to execute methods of detecting image freezing such as the ones proposed herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to examples, vehicle rear-view systems may be provided including a rear-view camera, any of the video displayers disclosed herein, and a connection between the video displayer and the rear-view camera in such a way that, in use, the video displayer receives video signal from the rear-view camera through the connection and displays the received video signal with image freezing detection.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In further examples, a vehicle may be provided including any of the aforementioned vehicle rear-view systems.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Non-limiting examples of the disclosure will be described in the following, with reference to the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>schematically illustrates a portion of a video displayer with image freezing detection, according to examples.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>schematically illustrates a portion of a video displayer with image freezing detection, according to further examples.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>schematically illustrates a portion of a video displayer with image freezing detection, according to other examples.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d </i></figref>schematically illustrates a portion of a video displayer with image freezing detection, according to still further examples.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>schematically illustrates a portion of a video displayer with image freezing detection, according to yet further examples.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart schematically illustrating detector methods according to examples, which are suitable for being performed at/by video displayers equal or similar to the ones shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>1</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>schematically illustrate a rear-view video displayer including a bezel, and with equal or similar configurations to the ones shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>1</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a cross-sectional view of a video displayer in line with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>according to cutting plane <b>300</b><i>a. </i></p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms.
