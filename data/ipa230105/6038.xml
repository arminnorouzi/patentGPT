Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following description relates to a semiconductor device.

Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, an ESD circuit may be formed to protect a semiconductor device formed inside a core circuit from an electrostatic discharge (ESD) or an electrical over stress (EOS). In addition, a gate insulating film may be formed to be thick in order to be prepared for an example in which an ESD or an EOS enters through the gate electrode of the semiconductor device. Such an approach may be used because a thin gate insulating film may be destroyed when an ESD or an EOS is applied to the semiconductor device. In addition, in order to withstand the ESD or the EOS, a structure in which the resistance of the gate electrode is increased may often be used. Therefore, in order to increase the resistance of the gate electrode, a silicide blocking insulating film may be formed on the surface of the gate electrode. In this manner, a high ESD or a high EOS applied to the gate electrode may be mitigated to some extent.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when a high electric field, such as an ESD or an EOS, is formed, there may take place a phenomenon in which leakage current occurs between the gate electrode and the drain electrode, or leakage current may occur between the gate electrode and source electrode. In order to prevent this phenomenon, the distance between the gate electrode and the drain electrode may be increased. Thus, despite a high electric field due to the ESD or the EOS, a leakage current between the gate electrode and the drain electrode may nonetheless be blocked. However, the source region and the gate electrode may be disposed to be as close as possible, in order to form a channel between the gate electrode and the source electrode. Due to using this structure, when a high electric field is applied to the gate electrode, a leakage current may occur between the gate electrode and the source electrode region.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

For example, the sequences of operations described herein are merely examples, and are not limited to those set forth herein, but may be changed as will be apparent after an understanding of the disclosure of this application, with the exception of operations necessarily occurring in a certain order. Also, descriptions of features that are known in the art may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The features described herein may be embodied in different forms, and are not to be construed as being limited to the examples described herein. Rather, the examples described herein have been provided merely to illustrate some of the many possible ways of implementing the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein that will be apparent after an understanding of the disclosure of this application.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Accordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Expressions such as &#x201c;at least one of,&#x201d; when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the individual elements of the list.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Throughout the specification, when an element, such as a layer, region, or substrate, is described as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element, it may be directly &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; the other element, or there may be one or more other elements intervening therebetween. In contrast, when an element is described as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element, there can be no other elements intervening therebetween.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and &#x201c;third&#x201d; may be used herein to describe various members, components, regions, layers, or sections, these members, components, regions, layers, or sections are not to be limited by these terms. Rather, these terms are only used to distinguish one member, component, region, layer, or section from another member, component, region, layer, or section. Thus, a first member, component, region, layer, or section referred to in examples described herein may also be referred to as a second member, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the examples.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Spatially relative terms such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element's relationship to another element as shown in the figures. Such spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, an element described as being &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;upper&#x201d; relative to another element will then be &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower&#x201d; relative to the other element. Thus, the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; encompasses both the above and below orientations depending on the spatial orientation of the device. The device may also be oriented in other ways (for example, rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative terms used herein are to be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The terminology used herein is for describing various examples only, and is not to be used to limit the disclosure.

Each of the regions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, and <b>240</b> of the active region <b>200</b> may be formed by using an active mask pattern, as a non-limiting example.

A drain contact plug <b>211</b>, a source contact plug <b>221</b>, and a body contact plug <b>231</b> and a DNW contact plug <b>241</b> may be formed in the drain region <b>210</b>, the source region <b>220</b>, the body pickup region <b>230</b> and the deep well pickup region <b>240</b> of the active region <b>200</b>, respectively. The above-described contact plugs <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> may be formed by including one or more of the contact plugs <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> in a corresponding region.

That is, the source region <b>220</b> and the drain region <b>210</b> may be present on both sides of the gate electrode <b>110</b>, and the gate contact plug <b>111</b> may be formed on the gate electrode <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> the semiconductor device may include a first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and a second insulating film pattern <b>400</b>. Because the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may be formed by etching an LDD insulating film, it may also be referred to as an LDD insulating film pattern. In addition, the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be formed by using a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film material so that a salicide or a silicide is not formed. Because the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> is formed using such a non-sal process, it may be referred to as a non-sal dielectric pattern. The first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be formed by using respective mask patterns, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>D and <b>9</b>H</figref>. Each mask pattern may be designed using different layouts corresponding to the shapes of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b>. The first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may also be formed in various forms, which is illustrated in greater detail in other examples, to be described further later.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the present one or more examples, the shape, size, and area of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may be determined by using a lightly doped region or lightly doped drain (LDD) forming process.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may be formed over a part of the source region <b>220</b> and the gate electrode <b>110</b>. That is, the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may be formed to extend to a top surface of the gate electrode <b>110</b>. Also, a part of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may overlap the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b>. The first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may extend to the top surface of the gate electrode, so as to have lengths E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>. The gate silicide layer <b>120</b> may be formed on the gate electrode <b>110</b>, where no first and second insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> are formed. In such an example, the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may be divided into a first region having a length E<b>1</b>, and a second region having a length E<b>2</b>. The length of E<b>1</b> may be formed longer than E<b>2</b>. The longer the length of E<b>1</b>, the less the leakage current between the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the source region <b>220</b>. This result may occur because a resistance is increased between the gate electrode and the source region by the presence of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be a region in which the silicide layer <b>120</b> is not formed by the second mask pattern, for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>H</figref>. The second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be disposed entirely or partially on the top surfaces of the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the drain region <b>210</b>. Also, the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may overlap a part of the edge of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b>. The second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be formed to extend onto a part of the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the drain region <b>210</b>. As such, the region <b>400</b> in which the silicide layer is not formed on the gate electrode <b>110</b> may be larger than the region <b>120</b> in which the silicide layer is formed. The resistance of the gate electrode <b>110</b> may be increased by the presence of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b>. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent failure of a semiconductor device caused by an ESD or an EOS, due to such greater resistance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may include a main region <b>400</b><i>a </i>and an extended region <b>400</b><i>b</i>. The main region <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be disposed to include a part of the top surface of the gate electrode <b>110</b> and to include a part of the drain region <b>210</b> where the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> may partially overlap. The extension region <b>400</b><i>b </i>may be formed to extend in the Y-axis direction so that the gate silicide layer <b>120</b> may remain at one end of the main region <b>400</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the main region <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be larger in size than the extended region <b>400</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In general, in order to form an Ohmic contact on the surface of the gate region, a silicide such as a cobalt silicide such as CoSi<sub>2</sub>, or a nickel silicide such as NiSi, or a titanium silicide such as TiSi<sub>2</sub>, may be formed. However, when a second insulating film pattern, such as a non-silicide region, is formed between the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the drain region <b>200</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, resistance may increase between the gate electrode and the drain region, which may thereby reduce leakage current.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a semiconductor device that is described in greater detail below. Each of the cross-sectional views, A-A&#x2032;, B-B&#x2032;, and C-C&#x2032;, is described in greater detail with reference to examples below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a device isolation region, for example, a shallow trench isolation (STI) region, may be formed around the active region <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device with respect to the line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, according to one or more examples. Referring to the drawings, the semiconductor device may include a well region <b>20</b> of a first conductivity type, that is, as a non-limiting example, a P type, formed at a predetermined depth on the top surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. The well region <b>20</b> may be disposed between the device isolation regions <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> and may be formed to be deeper than the device isolation regions <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The gate insulating film <b>50</b> including the first gate insulating film <b>51</b> and the second gate insulating film <b>52</b>, which may have different thicknesses, are formed on the well region <b>20</b>. The gate electrode <b>110</b> may be disposed on the gate insulating film <b>50</b>. The drain region <b>210</b> and the source region <b>220</b> may be formed in the well region <b>20</b> and may be disposed on both sides, underneath the gate insulating film <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The gate insulating film <b>50</b> may include a first gate insulating film <b>51</b> and a second gate insulating film <b>52</b>, each having different thicknesses. For example, the first gate insulating film <b>51</b> may be thinner than the second gate insulating film <b>52</b>, and the second gate insulating film <b>52</b> may be formed to be thicker than the first gate insulating film <b>51</b>. The second gate insulating film <b>52</b> may be further divided into two parts. That is, the second gate insulating film <b>52</b> may have a part that becomes smaller in thickness as it approaches the first gate insulating film <b>51</b>, and may have a part that has a constant thickness in a direction of the spacer <b>60</b>. Such a part where the thickness becomes smaller as it approaches the first gate insulating film <b>51</b> may occur during the process of manufacturing the gate insulating film <b>50</b>. By using the gate insulating films <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to have different thicknesses, it may be possible to implement a level shift semiconductor device in which a voltage used in a medium voltage or high voltage device may be allowed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The thinner first gate insulating film <b>51</b> may be disposed near the source region <b>220</b>, and the thick second gate insulating film <b>52</b> may be disposed near the drain region <b>210</b>. Such an approach may be used to prevent the gate insulating film <b>50</b> from being destroyed, because the drain voltage may be higher than the source voltage. For example, if the drain voltage is over 3.3V, which is a medium voltage, and the gate voltage is about 0.5V to 2V, which is a low voltage, there may be a problem that the drain current may become too low, and for this reason, the width of the channel region is to be widened, so that the region of the semiconductor device may be increased, if only a thick gate insulating film is used. Conversely, if only a thin gate insulating film is used, there may be an issue that the gate insulating film may be destroyed due to using a drain voltage higher than a medium voltage. Therefore, the above-described issue may be solved by using the gate insulating film <b>50</b> to have a structure that includes the thin gate insulating film <b>51</b> and the thick gate insulating film <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Because the drain voltage may be higher than the source voltage, the gate insulating film <b>50</b> may be formed to have an incline so that the thickness of the insulating film becomes thinner as it extends from the drain region to the source region. The drain region may be formed to be spaced apart by a predetermined distance from the gate electrode <b>110</b>, which may increase the breakdown voltage.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the spacer <b>60</b> may be formed on both sides of the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the gate insulating film <b>50</b>, respectively. Typically, only spacers are formed on both sides of the gate electrode <b>110</b>. However, in the present one or more examples, the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> formed by using the first mask during the LDD process may be disposed near the source region <b>220</b> side, such that the source region <b>220</b> may overlap a part of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b>. In addition, a spacer <b>60</b> may be formed on the drain region <b>210</b> side. The spacer <b>60</b> may be formed in the region in which no first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> is formed. Such an approach is used because the first insulating film may be formed as a spacer-shaped insulating film on all sides of the gate electrode <b>110</b> if a blanket etch-back process is performed without the first mask pattern. Thus, the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and the spacer insulating film <b>60</b> may be formed of the same material.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may overlap a part of the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b> and may extend to the drain region <b>210</b>, while covering the top surface of the gate electrode <b>110</b> and the spacer <b>60</b>. The thickness of the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be formed to be thicker than the first insulating film pattern <b>300</b>. For example, the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be designed to have a sufficient thickness for proper operation. Such a choice of thickness may be made because when the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> is thin, the second insulating film pattern <b>400</b> may be removed when various etching processes are performed in a subsequent process. For example, in such a case, an unwanted silicide layer may be formed, and using approaches according to examples may avoid such an undesired result.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The semiconductor device may further include an extended drain junction region <b>80</b>. The extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may extend from the drain region <b>210</b> to the second gate insulating film <b>52</b>, in order to provide low drain resistance. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may have an additional length L that extends to the first gate insulating film <b>51</b>, which may be a thin gate insulating film. That is, the additional length of the extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may be disposed by freely adjusting the length between the gate insulating films <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Also, the extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may be formed to surround the drain region <b>210</b>, because an ion implantation may be performed with higher energy than that used for the drain region <b>210</b>. The extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may be formed by using N-type impurities, such as phosphorus or arsenic, as non-limiting examples. The depth of the extended drain junction region <b>80</b> may be formed to be thinner than the device isolation region <b>40</b> disposed next to the extended drain junction region <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The semiconductor device may further include a P-body region <b>90</b> of the first conductivity type, which may be P-type. The body region <b>90</b> may be located under the first gate insulating film <b>51</b>, which may be a thin gate insulating film, and may serve as a channel region. The body region <b>90</b> may surround the source region <b>220</b> and the body contact region <b>230</b>. The depth of the body region <b>90</b> may be thinner than the device isolation region <b>41</b> disposed next to the body region <b>90</b> and deeper than the extended drain junction region <b>80</b>. The body region <b>90</b> may be disposed to be spaced apart from the extended drain junction region <b>80</b> by a predetermined distance. In the absence of the body region <b>90</b>, the well region <b>20</b> of the first conductivity type may perform the channel region instead. Therefore, the body region <b>90</b> may be considered as an optional region. This choice may be made possible because the conductivity types of the body region and the well region are the same, that is, for example, both P-type, as a non-limiting example. An example in which the body region <b>90</b> is not formed is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, below.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The semiconductor device may further include a deep well region (DNW) <b>30</b> of the second conductivity type, which may be N-type. The deep well region <b>30</b> of the second conductivity type may be required when a semiconductor device and other devices are to be isolated. The deep well region <b>30</b> may be disposed between the device isolation regions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, and may include a well region <b>20</b> of a first conductivity type. A second conductivity type deep well pickup region <b>240</b> used for applying a bias voltage to the second conductivity type deep well region <b>30</b> may be further formed, in a non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The semiconductor device may include isolation regions <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> formed next to the drain region <b>210</b> and the body pickup region <b>230</b> to isolate the semiconductor device from adjacent devices.
