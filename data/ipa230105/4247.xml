As an example of the sensor, a capacitive sensor capable of detecting contact or approach of an object, based on a variation in electrostatic capacitance is well known. A detection electrode and a sensor driving electrode constituting the sensor are disposed in a display area in which images are displayed, and opposed to each other with a dielectric interposed between the electrodes. The detection electrode is electrically connected to a lead line located outside the display area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Requests for downsizing of the display device are increased while the display area is extended, and a periphery outside the display area tends to become a narrow frame. For this reason, the sensor driving electrode and the lead line are often disposed closely to each other. In this case, the lead line may function as a sensor due to capacitive coupling between the sensor driving electrode and the lead line. For example, if an object which is to be detected contacts or approaches the vicinity of an outermost periphery of the display area, variation in the electrostatic capacitance of the lead line is detected. For this reason, the detection electrode connected to the lead line performs error detection as if the detection electrode detected the detected object at a position different from a position where the detection electrode should detect the detected object.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, for example, a technology of disposing a grounded conductive material outside the display area between the sensor driving electrode and the outer peripheral line (lead line) and blocking the capacitive coupling between the sensor driving electrode and the outer peripheral line has been proposed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application generally relates to a sensor-equipped display device and a sensor device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment, a sensor-equipped display device includes a display panel which includes a sensor driving electrode disposed in a display area for displaying an image, detection electrodes each including a body portion opposed to the sensor driving electrode in the display area and a broadened portion connected to the body portion and formed to be wider than the body portion, and a lead line disposed in a non-display area outside the display area and electrically connected to the broadened portion.

In other words, the body portion RR extends in the direction of intersecting the plural divisional electrodes C. The body portion RR is formed in a strip shape as illustrated if seen macroscopically but, strictly, the body portion RR is composed of an assembly of fine metal wires as explained later.

The side edges EA and EB are parallel to the second direction Y. The pair of surrounding portions SR is located in the non-display area NDA extending along the side edges EA and EB so as to sandwich the display area DA. A gap between the adjacent broadened portions RSL is small and each of the broadened portions RSL is configured to suppress leakage of the electric field which will be explained later, though the illustration is simplified.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The common electrode CE and the detection electrodes Rx are opposed to sandwich various dielectrics as explained above. In the X-Y plane, each of the divisional electrodes C is opposed to the pixel columns and the source lines S shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and intersects the gate lines G. Each of the detection electrodes Rx is opposed to the pixel rows and the gate lines G shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and intersects the source lines S. The number, size and shape of the divisional electrodes C are not particularly limited and can be variously changed.

The lead lines L are disposed in the non-display area NDA and located in the same plane as the detection electrodes Rx, on the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>. The lead lines L are electrically connected to the detection electrodes Rx in a one-to-one correspondence. Each of the lead lines L allows a sensor output value to be output from the detection electrode Rx.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In the example illustrated, the lead lines L are disposed on both sides of the display area DA so as to sandwich the display area DA. For example, the lead lines L connected to odd-numbered detection electrodes Rx, of the detection electrodes Rx arranged in the second direction Y, are disposed in the non-display area NDA on the left side of the drawing (i.e., the non-display area NDA extending along the side edge EA), and the lead lines L connected to even-numbered detection electrodes Rx are disposed in the non-display area NDA on the right side of the drawing (i.e., the non-display area NDA extending along the side edge EB). The layout of the lead lines L corresponds to the uniform width and the narrow frame of the non-display area NDA. It should be noted that the layout of the lead lines L is not limited to the example illustrated. For example, the embodiment can also employ the layout in which the lead lines L connected to the detection electrodes Rx at upper part of the display area DA are located on either of the end portions of the non-display area NDA while the lead lines L connected to the detection electrodes Rx at lower part of the display area DA are located on the other end portion of the non-display area NDA.

For example, at least several parts of the common electrode drive circuit CD are built in the driving IC chip IC<b>1</b>, but are not limited to this example. The common electrode drive circuit CD may be disposed, for example, outside the driving IC chip IC<b>1</b>. The common electrode drive circuit CD functions as a driving module configured to supply a common drive signal to the common electrode CE at the display drive or displaying an image and to supply a sensor drive signal to the common electrodes CE at the sensing drive for sensing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The flexible printed circuit FPC<b>2</b> is connected to the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> and also electrically connected to each of the lead lines L, in the non-display area NDA on the lower side (i.e., the side close to the driving IC chip IC<b>1</b>) of the drawing. A detection circuit RC is built in, for example, the driving IC chip IC<b>2</b>. The detection circuit RC functions as a driving module configured to allow the sensor drive signal from the common electrode CE to be detected as detection signals by the detection electrodes Rx and to read variation of the detection signals via the lead lines L as a sensor output signal. The detection circuit RC having such a function detects contact or approach of a detected object to the liquid crystal display device DSP, based on the sensor output values from the detection electrodes Rx. Furthermore, the detection circuit RC can also detect position information of the portion which the detected object has contacted or approached. The detection circuit RC may be disposed in the control module CM.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">If the layout of the lead lines L illustrated is noticed, the detection electrodes Rx located on the lower side of the drawing are connected to the lead lines L located on the inner side (i.e., the side close to the display area DA) in the non-display area NDA. In addition, the detection electrodes Rx located on the upper side of the drawing are connected to the lead lines L located on the outer side (i.e., the side remote from the display area DA) in the non-display area NDA. The lead lines L located on the outer side are longer than the lead lines L located on the inner side, in the non-display area NDA. For this reason, the electric resistance of the lead lines L having a greater length needs to be reduced. For example, the lead lines L having a greater length include wider portions as compared with the lead lines L having a smaller length. In the non-display area NDA on the lower side of the drawing, each lead line L has a comparatively small width due to a large number of lead lines L, though not explained in detail. In the non-display area NDA on the upper side of the drawing, each lead line L has a comparatively great width since the number of lead lines L is small. For example, the lead lines L located on the outermost side in the non-display area NDA have a gradually increased width, from the lower side to the upper side in the drawing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view enlarging and schematically showing a part of the sensor SE shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

For this reason, a linear gap crossing the broadened portion is not formed between the adjacent broadened portions RSL. In other words, the broadened portions RSL of the adjacent detection electrodes Rx are disposed such that either of the broadened portions RSL is engaged with the other broadened portion RSL in planar view. In the example illustrated, an area between the adjacent broadened portions RSL is bended by the detection lines LB of the same waveform shape, and leakage of the electric field from the area between the broadened portions can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The broadened portions RSL are arranged on the same straight line in the second direction Y so as to form the surrounding portion SR. In other words, in the adjacent detection electrodes Rx, the gap opposed to the common electrode CE is formed between the body portions RR while, in the non-display area NDA, the gap between the body portions RR is surrounded by the broadened portions RSL arranged in the same straight line, along the boundary B. The broadened portions RSL forming the surrounding portion SR are physically separated from each other, but disposed to be engaged with each other as explained above. For this reason, the surrounding portion SR can implement an electric field shielding along the boundary B in the non-display area NDA extending without a gap. More specifically, the end portion of one of the adjacent broadened portions RSL includes bent portions by forming the first detection lines LB<b>1</b> in a waveform shape. Since the broadened portions RSL are disposed to have the end portions engaged with each other and the surrounding portion SR is formed, a gap between the broadened portions adjacent to is also bended, not extending in a straight line from the display area DA to the non-display area NDA. Thus, an electric line of force does not reach the non-display area NDA from the display area DA, but is captured by (the end portion of) any one of the broadened portions RSL, and an electric field is formed between the broadened portion RSL and the common electrode CE.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The surrounding portion SR is interposed between the common electrode CE of the display area DA and the lead lines L of the non-display area NDA, in planar view.

In other words, electrostatic capacitance is formed between the common electrode CE and the broadened portion RSL, through the gap between the body portions RR and, consequently, formation of electrostatic capacitance between the common electrode CE and the lead lines L through the gap can be suppressed.

Each of the detection electrode Rx and the lead lines L may be a single-layer body of the metallic material or a laminate formed by stacking layers of the metallic materials. Furthermore, each of the detection electrode Rx and the lead lines L may be composed of a combination of a single-layer body or a laminate of the metallic material with a transparent conductive layer of ITO or the like. The body portion RR of the detection electrodes Rx is located above the common electrode CE and the pixel electrodes PE. In the example illustrated, none of the common electrode CE and the pixel electrode PE is disposed under the broadened portion RSL. In other words, the body portion RR is opposed to the common electrode CE while the broadened portion RSL is connected to the body portion RR without being opposed to the common electrode CE. The sealing member SM is disposed under the lead lines L. The detection electrode Rx located in the display area DA is formed of the nontransparent metallic material but does not remarkably reduce the transmittance of each pixel since the detection electrode Rx is formed of, for example, the detection lines LB formed of fine wires having a width of approximately 3 to 5 &#x3bc;m.

The off state corresponds to a state in which a potential difference is not formed between the pixel electrodes PE and the common electrodes CE. In the off state, liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer LC are subjected to initial alignment in the single orientation in the X-Y plane by the alignment restriction force between the first alignment film AL<b>1</b> and the second alignment film AL<b>2</b>. Part of the backlight from the backlight unit BL is transmitted through the polarizer of the first optical element OD<b>1</b> and is made incident on the display panel PNL. The light incident on the display panel PNL is linearly polarized light which is orthogonal to an absorption axis of the polarizer. The polarized state of the linearly polarized light hardly changes when the linearly polarized light passes though the display panel PNL in the off state. For this reason, most of the linearly polarized light which has passed through the display panel PNL is absorbed by the polarizer of the second optical element OD<b>2</b> (black display). In other words, the light from the backlight unit BL does not contribute to the display, and a black screen is displayed in the display area DA. A mode of displaying the black screen on the display panel PNL in the off state is called a normally black mode.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">Next, the on state in which the fringe field is formed in the liquid crystal layer LC will be explained. The on state corresponds to a state in which a potential difference is formed between the pixel electrodes PE and the common electrodes CE. In the on state, the common drive signal is supplied from the common electrode drive circuit CD to the common electrodes CE. In contrast, a video signal to form the potential difference relative to the common potential is supplied to the pixel electrodes PE. The fringing field is thereby formed between the pixel electrodes PE and the common electrodes CE.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In the on state, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the orientation different from the initial alignment orientation within the X-Y plane due to influence of the fringing field formed in the liquid crystal layer. The linearly polarized light orthogonal to the absorption axis of the polarizer of the first optical element OD<b>1</b> is incident on the display panel PNL and the polarized state is varied in response to the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules when passing through the liquid crystal layer LC. For this reason, at least part of the light which has passed through the liquid crystal layer LC transmits the polarizer of the second optical element OD<b>2</b>, in the on state (white display). In the above-explained display modes, vicinity to the edges of the pixel electrodes PE mainly contributes to the display since the fringing field is formed along the edges of the pixel electrodes PE.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Next, a sensing drive operation of detecting the contact or approach of an object in the liquid crystal display device DSP will be explained.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">A sensor drive signal is supplied from the common electrode drive circuit CD to the common electrodes CE.

A pulse-like write signal (sensor drive signal) Vw is supplied to the divisional electrodes C, sequentially, in a predetermined cycle. In this example, the user's finger which is the detected object is assumed to be present closely to a position where a specific detection electrode Rx and a specific divisional electrode C intersect. A capacitance Cx is generated by the detected object close to the detection electrode Rx. When the pulse-like write signal Vw is supplied to the divisional electrodes C, a pulse-like read signal (sensor output value) Vr lower in level than pulses obtained from the other detection electrodes is obtained from the specific detection electrode Rx.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The detection circuit RC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> can detect two-dimensional position information in the X-Y plane of the sensor SE, based on the timing of supplying the write signal Vw to the divisional electrodes C and on the read signals Vr from the respective detection electrodes Rx. In addition, the capacitance Cx obtained when the detected object is close to the detection electrode Rx is different from that obtained when the detected object is remote from the detection electrode Rx. For this reason, the level of the read signal Vr obtained when the detected object is close to the detection Rx is different from that obtained when the detected object is remote from the detection electrode Rx. Therefore, the detection circuit RC can also detect the proximity of the detected object to the sensor SE (i.e., a distance in a third direction Z from the sensor SE), based on the level of the read signal Vr.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">According to the present embodiment, each of the detection electrodes Rx of the sensor SE comprises the body portion RR opposed to the common electrode CE and the broadened portion RSL wider than the body portion RR. The gap opposed to the common electrode CE is formed between the adjacent body portions RR, at the detection electrodes Rx disposed to be adjacent, while, in the non-display area NDA, the broadened portions RSL are arranged to be adjacent along the boundary B. For this reason, electrostatic capacitance is formed between the common electrode CE and the broadened portions RSL, through the gaps between the body portions RR and, consequently, formation of electrostatic capacitance between the common electrode CE and the lead lines L through the gaps can be suppressed. In addition, undesired formation of the capacitance between the common electrode CE and the lead lines L can be suppressed even in the configuration in which the common electrode CE and the lead lines L are arranged to be close in response to the request for narrower frame. Therefore, in the sensing driving, the capacitive coupling between the common electrode CE and the lead lines L (particularly, lead lines L connected to detection electrodes Rx different from the detection electrodes Rx which are to be read) can be suppressed and the error detection of the sensor SE can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In addition, the broadened portions RSL are not overlaid on the display area DA but disposed in the non-display area NDA, in planar view, in the present embodiment. In other words, the broadened portions RSL are not overlaid or hardly overlaid on the common electrode CE located in the display area DA, in planar view. For this reason, substantially constant capacitance Cc can be obtained between the common electrode CE and the detection electrodes Rx, over the entire display area DA.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">In addition, since the detection electrodes Rx and the lead lines L are located on the outer surface side of the second insulating substrate <b>20</b>, the detection electrodes Rx and the lead lines L can be formed of the same material, in the same process. Furthermore, since the detection electrodes Rx and the lead lines L are formed of a metal having a very lower electric resistance than the transparent conductive material, the line width can be reduced and the wire can be drawn in a long distance while maintaining the small line width.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Moreover, since the width of the detection lines LB is small, the transmittance of each pixel in the display area DA is not remarkably deteriorated. Since each of the detection lines LB extends in a direction different from the directions of alignment of the pixels (i.e., the first direction X and the second direction Y), moire of the pixel layout is suppressed and the deterioration in display quality is also suppressed. In addition, since the width of the lead lines L is small, undesired formation of the capacitance between the lead lines L and the detected object which has contacted or approached the non-display area NDA can be suppressed, and noise can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Next, a modified example of the capacitive sensor SE built in the liquid crystal display device DSP of the present embodiment will be explained. A modified example of the shape of the broadened portion RSL will be particularly explained.

The metal film RM can be formed of the same metal material as the lead lines L or the body portions RR. The metal film RM is remote from the boundary B between the display area DA and the non-display area NDA and does not extend to the display area DA.

Each of the lead lines L is electrically connected to the detection electrode RC via the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>2</b>. In the example illustrated, the lead lines L are disposed in the non-display area NDA along a side edge EC of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> on which the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>2</b> is mounted.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">Each detection electrode Rx comprises a body portion RR located in the display area DA, and the broadened portion RSL connected to the body portion RR and located in the non-display area NDA alone, similarly to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, though not described here. In the example illustrated, the broadened portions RSL are arranged in the non-display area NDA extending along side edge EC. The broadened portions RSL of the respective detection electrodes Rx are arranged in the first direction X so as to form the surrounding portion SR between the common electrode CE and the lead lines L. As explained above, the adjacent broadened portions RSL are configured to suppress leakage of the electric field though illustrated simply. In other words, any one of the configurations explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> can be applied to the detection electrodes Rx, and any one of the configurations explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> can be applied to the gap between the detection electrodes Rx and the lead lines L.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">In this modified example, too, the same advantages as those of the above-explained examples can be obtained. In addition, the length of the lead lines L making connection between the detection electrodes Rx and the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>2</b> can be reduced, and the noise of the lead lines L can be further reduced, as compared with the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> or the like.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">The sensor-equipped display device in which the common electrode CE built in the display panel PNL functions as the sensor driving electrode, and the detection electrodes Rx opposed to the sensor driving electrode and the lead lines L electrically connected to the detection electrodes Rx are disposed, has been explained in the embodiment, but the embodiment can also be applied to the sensor devices which can be combined by being applied on the display panel including no sensor elements such as the sensor driving electrode and the detection electrodes. More specifically, the sensor device comprises a sensor panel including a sensor driving electrode, detection electrodes and lead lines, and a driving module. The sensor driving electrode is disposed at a position opposed to the display area of the display device. The detection electrodes are opposed to the sensor driving electrode. The lead lines are disposed at positions opposed to the non-display area of the display device and electrically connected with the detection electrodes to allow the sensor output value to be output from the detection electrodes. The driving module supplies the sensor drive signal to the sensor driving electrode and allows the sensor drive signal from the sensor driving electrode to be detected as the detection signal by the detection electrodes to read variation of the detection signal. In the sensor device, each of the detection electrodes comprises the body portion and the broadened portion wider than the body portion. The body portion is opposed to the sensor driving electrode. The broadened portion is opposed to the non-display area without being opposed to the display area, and is not opposed to the sensor driving electrode either. In this sensor device, too, the same advantages as those of the above-explained embodiments can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">As described above, the sensor-equipped display device and the sensor device capable of suppressing the sensor error detection can be provided according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
