The solutions disclosed herein can, however, be realized in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the following, embodiments will be described where alternative approaches to paging of a terminal device in a wireless communication network are provided.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example scenario according to some embodiments, wherein a user equipment (UE) <b>110</b> is located within a coverage area of a cell <b>120</b> of a wireless communication network. The cell <b>120</b> is provided by a network node <b>100</b> and a neighboring cell <b>121</b> is provided by another network node <b>101</b> of the wireless communication network. The network node is configured for beam-formed transmission of a plurality of beams, which is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by beams <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each beam of the plurality of beams may be associated with (e.g., configured to transmit) a corresponding synchronization signal block (SSB). For example, in new radio release 15 (NR Rel-15), multiple SSB:s may be configured per cell, spatially covering different regions to improve signal quality compared to a single SSB in a cell. The SSB:s may be transmitted in an SSB burst fashion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The SSB may, for example, comprise a primary synchronization signal (PSS), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), and a physical broadcast channel (PBCH).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some setups, the SSB may be indicative of paging particulars (e.g., information that there is a paging occasion, PO, subsequent to the SSB, timing information of the PO, etc.). In some setups, the SSB is not indicative of any paging particulars. In some setups, the SSB is not directly indicative of any paging particulars, but provides a pointer to where paging configuration information may be found.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A paging occasion typically comprises paging radio network temporary identifier, P-RNTI, physical downlink control channel, PDCCH, and physical downlink shared channel, PDSCH; wherein the PDCCH includes (e.g., constitutes) a paging indicator, PI. In some embodiments, the PDCCH scrambled with P-RNTI is an indicator that a paging message follows.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In many wireless communication networks (e.g., NR Rel-15), the paging signaling of a paging occasion is specified to have a quasi-colocation (QCL) relation with an SSB in a cell. This typically means that a UE that receives an SSB with a certain receiver configuration can rely on that the same spatial receiver configuration and time/frequency offsets will be valid for the paging reception in the PO. In practice, this may manifest by each SSB being accompanied by a paging transmission. Thereby, each configured PO may be instantiated as many times as there are SSB:s in the cell. Each such PO instantiation will be termed a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) paging monitoring occasion (PMO). Thus, a PDCCH PMO is associated with a preceding SSB in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some network implementations, a UE is paged in the entire radio network association (RNA) under consideration.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some network implementations, the network keeps track of the last known cell for each UE (also when it is in a non-connected mode, such as an idle mode or an inactive mode) and initially pages only in that cell to reduce the overall paging load in the network. If there is no paging response (e.g., because the UE has moved to another cell), the UE is thereafter paged in neighboring cells and/or in the entire RNA according to a paging escalation approach.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When multiple SSB:s per cell are configured (e.g., in NR), paging is&#x2014;throughout a paging process such as that defined above&#x2014;typically transmitted for each of the configured SSB:s due to the QCL. This leads to a high paging transmission load in the cell as a whole, since the same paging message is repeated in multiple PO instantiations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, the QCL relationship between SSB and paging&#x2014;and the resulting multiplicative factor for PO&#x2014;typically reduces the number of SSB that are considered to be feasible in typical network deployments. Being able to have a finer granularity SSB allocation might be desirable from beam management and/or mobility considerations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another problem resulting from the QCL is that&#x2014;due to the large amount of transmitted pages&#x2014;there may be a high rate of paging false alarms, wherein a paging false alarm may be defined as a UE demodulating a PO transmission only to conclude that it was not paged with that PO transmission.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Various embodiments may solve one or more of these problems; typically without violating QCL requirements.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>200</b> according to some embodiments. The method <b>200</b> is a method of paging a UE by a network node, wherein the network node is configured for beam-formed transmission of a plurality of beams. For example, the method <b>200</b> may be performed by the network node <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and may be for paging the UE <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The plurality of beams may relate to (e.g., comprise) all available beams of the cell, or may relate to (e.g., comprise) a sub-group of the available beams of the cell.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each beam of the plurality of beams is associated with a corresponding synchronization signal block (SSB). For example, each beam may be configured to transmit the corresponding SSB.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Typically, there may be a one-to-one association between beams and SSB:s. Alternatively, two or more beams of the plurality may be associated with the same corresponding SSB.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a typical scenario, the network node may be configured to perform a beam sweep, in which beams carrying corresponding associated SSB:s are activated in successive time resources.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) paging monitoring occasion (PMO) is associated with a preceding SSB.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated by optional step <b>210</b>, the method may start by acquiring information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE. Step <b>210</b> is typically performed while the UE is in a connected mode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Acquiring information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE may be according to any suitable approach. For example, acquiring information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE may comprise receiving an access request from the UE, wherein the access request is associated with the corresponding SSB of the one or more beams associated with the UE. Alternatively or additionally, acquiring information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE may comprise receiving a measurement report from the UE, wherein the measurement report indicates the one or more beams associated with the UE. Measurement reports may, for example, relate to one or more of radio resource measurements (RRM), beam management (BM) measurements, and channel quality measurements such as channel state information (CSI) measurements, and/or may be indicative of a corresponding SSB and/or a CSI reference signal setting. Yet alternatively or additionally, acquiring information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE may comprise performing channel measurements and/or beam measurements on sounding reference signal (SRS) transmissions from the UE and exploiting channel reciprocity.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The one or more beams associated with the UE may generally be a beam previously used, and/or indicated as preferred, for the UE. Additionally, one or more beams neighboring to a beam previously used, and/or indicated as preferred, for the UE may be included in the beams associated with the UE.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Later&#x2014;while the UE is in a non-connected mode&#x2014;a subset is determined of the plurality of beams (or, typically equivalently, a subset of a plurality of corresponding SSB:s), as illustrated by step <b>240</b>. Typically the subset excludes at least one of the plurality of beams. For example, the subset may comprise one, two, three, or more beams.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also typically, the subset should comprise beams that have a high probability (e.g., exceeding a probability threshold value) to be heard by the UE. For example, the network may determine/estimate which SSB:s the UE can receive and/or is likely to use for tracking of a camping cell, and use these SSB:s to determine the subset (e.g., let the subset comprise the corresponding beams). If a UE has accessed the network via the same beam during multiple connections and/or has reported similar beam qualities for some beams, the network may consider those beams as having a high probability of being reliably received by the UE.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the UE is in a non-connected mode, the network node (or the network for that matter) may not be definitely aware of the location of the UE and/or through which resources (e.g., cells, beams, etc.) the UE can be reached.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, this is solved by determining the subset based on one or more beams previously associated with the UE (e.g., using the information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE acquired in optional step <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, the subset may comprise, or consist of, the one or more beams previously associated with the UE. Additionally, one or more beams neighboring to beam(s) previously associated with the UE may be included in the subset.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the UE <b>110</b> may&#x2014;during execution of step <b>210</b>&#x2014;be in a position indicated by the dashed UE <b>110</b>. Thus, the acquired information in step <b>210</b> might indicate beam <b>134</b> as associated with the UE <b>110</b>. Then, the subset might be determined in step <b>240</b> to comprise beam <b>134</b>, and possibly also the neighboring beams <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>. Even if the UE, which is now in un-connected mode, has re-located slightly&#x2014;to a position indicated by the non-dashed UE <b>110</b>&#x2014;there is a high probability that it will be reached by a page using beam <b>134</b>, and an even higher probability that it will be reached by a page using beam <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the determination of the subset is based (only) on most recent information about beam(s) associated with the UE.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the determination of the subset is based on information about beam(s) associated with the UE for several previous occasions. For example, the subset may comprise all beams associated with the UE during a specified duration of time, or may comprise one or more beams most often associated with the UE during a specified duration of time. This approach typically results in higher reliability and/or robustness than if only the most recent information about beam(s) associated with the UE is used.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, in some embodiments, the determination of the subset may be based on recent activity of the UE (e.g., network access patterns&#x2014;such as a stationary UE that consistently accesses the network in the same SSB of the same cell, and/or UE reporting&#x2014;such as a stationary UE reporting consistent SSB and/or CSI-RS qualities for a set of best beams in the cell).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the determination of the subset is transparent to the UE.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step <b>250</b>&#x2014;while the UE is in a non-connected mode&#x2014;the corresponding SSB for each beam of the plurality of beams is transmitted, e.g., in the form of a beam sweep.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step <b>260</b>&#x2014;while the UE is in a non-connected mode&#x2014;the UE is paged only in PDCCH PMO:s associated with the corresponding SSB:s of the beams of the subset. Thus, paging in other PDCCH PMO:s is omitted. This may provide for lower signaling overhead and/or higher throughput than other paging approaches.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the UE has been paged, the method may comprise monitoring reception of paging response from the UE (according to any suitable method), as illustrated by optional step <b>270</b>. If a paging response is received (Y-path out from optional step <b>280</b>), the UE is successfully paged and the method <b>200</b> may be considered concluded.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">If no paging response is received&#x2014;e.g., within a time duration specified for paging response&#x2014;(N-path out from optional step <b>280</b>) the paging may be escalated as illustrated by optional step <b>290</b>. Paging escalation typically comprises repeating SSB transmission (compare with step <b>250</b>), and paging (compare with step <b>260</b>), but performing the paging using more resources (e.g., beams, cells, etc.). Step <b>290</b> may be followed by the monitoring step <b>270</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, if no paging response is received the UE may be paged in one or more PDCCH PMO:s associated with corresponding SSB:s of the beams of the plurality not comprised in the subset, as well as beams comprised in the subset.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">More generally, paging escalation may comprise paging for larger subset of the plurality of beams, paging for the full plurality of beams, paging for an entire cell (e.g., the cell <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and/or the cell where the UE was most recently know to be located), paging for more than one cell (e.g., the cells <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), or paging for an entire location area (LA).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, paging escalation may comprise successive escalation through one or more of the above examples. For example, it may be determined based on a suitable condition whether to escalate directly from subset to entire location area; or to escalate from subset to entire cell first, and then to entire location area if the cell paging fails. A suitable condition may, for example, comprise whether a latency requirement allows a delay resulting from the maximum number of paging attempts.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In connection with step <b>240</b> (e.g., before as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), one or more suitable conditions (illustrated by optional steps <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>) may be tested to conclude whether or not to proceed with paging for a subset of beams.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Some examples of suitable conditions relate to reliability of the paging for the subset of beams, as illustrated by optional step <b>220</b>, and to a latency requirement, as illustrated by optional step <b>230</b>. In various embodiments, only one of these example conditions may be applied, these example conditions may be applied together, only one of these example conditions may be applied in combination with one or more other suitable conditions, these example conditions may be applied together and in combination with one or more other suitable conditions, or only one or more other suitable conditions may be applied.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">If it is determined to not proceed with paging for the subset of beams (N-paths out from <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>), the method <b>200</b> may proceed directly to the paging escalation of step <b>290</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">If it is determined to proceed with paging for the subset of beams (Y-paths out from <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>), the method <b>200</b> may proceed to steps <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> and execute as described above.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thus, step <b>220</b> may comprise determining whether the beams previously associated with the UE fulfill a reliability condition, and performing the paging in relation to the subset responsive to the beams previously associated with the UE fulfilling the reliability condition.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The reliability condition may typically relate to determining whether there is enough acquired information available about beam(s) previously associated with the UE and/or whether the available information is conclusive enough.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, step <b>220</b> may comprise determining whether there is information available about beam(s) previously associated with the UE which has been acquired more recently than defined by an expiry time threshold, and proceeding to step <b>240</b> only if so.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively or additionally, step <b>220</b> may comprise determining whether the information available about beam(s) previously associated with the UE is conclusive, and proceeding to step <b>240</b> only if so. For example, it may be considered that the information is conclusive when the same beam is associated with the UE for a specified number of acquisitions (e.g., during a specified time window). Alternatively or additionally, it may be considered that the information is conclusive when the same beam is associated with the UE for a majority of a specified number of acquisitions.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Step <b>230</b> may comprise determining whether a paging priority and/or a paging latency requirement allows a paging latency which exceeds a latency threshold value, and performing the paging in relation to the subset responsive to the paging priority and/or the paging latency requirement allowing the paging latency exceeding the latency threshold value.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, step <b>230</b> may comprise determining whether paging the UE has high priority, and proceeding to step <b>240</b> only if not so.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Alternatively or additionally, step <b>230</b> may comprise determining whether paging the UE is urgent (e.g., if a paging response needs to be received within some certain time), and proceeding to step <b>240</b> only if not so.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The paging latency requirement may, for example, comprise that an expected (e.g., average, worst case, etc.) paging latency should be less than the latency threshold value for the method to proceed to step <b>240</b>. The expected paging latency may be estimated based on paging history statistics, for example. The latency threshold value may be static or dynamic, and may depend on, for example, a type of service triggering the paging.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Other suitable conditions may relate to UE power status (e.g., whether the UE is in a sleep mode for some SSB transmissions and does not monitor paging), network resources (e.g., whether traffic is low enough such that overhead signaling is not considered problematic), and channel conditions (e.g., whether a previously associated beam has deteriorating channel conditions such that a page using that beam is less likely to be heard). For example, it may be determined to not proceed to step <b>240</b> when the channel conditions are not stable (e.g., when a quality metric, such as a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), has a variance that exceeds a variance threshold).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Typically, the paging approach according to some embodiments is transparent to the UE. However, in some embodiments, the UE may derive over time how (over which beams; association with access requests and/or measurements reports) it is paged. Based on that knowledge, the UE may choose to only monitor paging on beams where it is likely to be paged. Such an approach may enable more time in sleep mode for the UE than if it were to monitor paging on all beams; which may in turn decrease power consumption.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Thus, in some embodiments, a method for a UE of monitoring paging from a network node is provided, wherein the network node is configured for beam-formed transmission of a plurality of beams, wherein each beam is associated with a corresponding SSB, and wherein a PDCCH&#x2014;PMO is associated with a preceding SSB.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The method comprises deriving a relation between PDCCH PMO:s in which the UE is paged and information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE, and monitoring paging only in PDCCH PMO:s related to one or more beams previously associated with the UE.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, a corresponding apparatus for a UE may be provided, and a UE comprising the apparatus. The apparatus comprises controlling circuitry configured to cause derivation of a relation between PDCCH PMO:s in which the UE is paged and information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE, and monitoring of paging only in PDCCH PMO:s related to one or more beams previously associated with the UE.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">To exemplify these embodiments, the UE can monitor network behavior over time with regard to beam-selective paging to learn the network paging behavior. For example, the UE may notice that the network consistently pages the UE in relation to the beam(s)/SSB(s) that the UE has used for network access. Then, the UE may decide to ignore monitoring paging in relation to beams/SSB:s that it has never or rarely used to access the network.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">This opens the possibility for the UE to choose a low power mode instead of being awake to monitor paging for some periods.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">For robustness, the UE may consider a slightly larger beam set for paging monitoring than inferred from the network access pattern. For example, the UE may include beams adjacent to the ones it has used for network access.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">To avoid completely missing pages (e.g., due to potential misalignment between UE and network), the UE may consider occasionally monitoring paging in all the configured beams/SSB:s. For example, the UE may monitor paging in all the configured beams for every second (or third, or fourth, etc.) PO. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may monitor paging in all the configured beams when channel conditions have changed, or are expected to change (e.g., when the UE is mobile).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments relating to step <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>, the network may send probing signals to the UE to trigger provision of the information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE for the acquisition of step <b>210</b>. The probing signals may be sent for a (e.g., random) selection of beams, for example, or for all beams.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">This approach may be particularly useful when there is no (or too little) available information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE and/or when available information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE is not considered reliable (compare with step <b>220</b>).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When a response (or a sufficient number of responses) is received from the UE, providing the information indicative of one or more beams associated with the UE, the probing procedure may be stopped. When no response (or a non-sufficient number of responses) is received from the UE, the probing procedure may be continued&#x2014;possibly varying or expanding the selection of beams used for the probing.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example apparatus <b>310</b> according to some embodiments.
