Typically, there is also a requirement to connect additional lines, such as electrical distribution cables, to the floating structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2009/141617 (Scotrenewables Marine Power Limited) describes a mooring connector with a &#x201c;moon pool&#x201d; (i.e. a bore extending through the deck and hull of the vessel), into which a buoyant frustoconical connector can be cooperatively received. The connector is latched into position around an annular channel on its outer surface, which enables rotation of the connector in relation to the vessel. This arrangement is of particular benefit in the context of floating tidal turbines which must be rotated end-to-end with each cycle of the tides.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Where the turbine apparatus need not be rotated in this way, for example in use in a constantly flowing body of water such as a river or estuary, or where the turbine blades themselves can rotate in order to obviate the requirement to rotate the entire vessel, a rotatable connector such as described in WO 2009/141617 is not required.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">So-called &#x201c;turret&#x201d; systems are known for use in the oil and gas industry, which take the form of tubular housings extending through the vessel hull to the deck. However conventional systems are not optimised for the particular requirements of floating water current power generation, or the particular stresses transferred via to the mooring connectors of such apparatus by the flowing water acting on turbine blades.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2016/180866 (Single Buoy Moorings Inc.) describes a mooring like connector which has a rotatable guiding body around a central connector body. The connector body is pulled into a tubular housing and locked in place by a complex set of internal end external guide formations and pins, forming part of the guiding body and tubular housing. The connector is specifically adapted to minimise torque, by the provision both of a universal joint at the base of the connector body, and rotational independence between the guide formations and the connector body. Any axial play in the system is prevented only by the weight of the connector and mooring lines. Moreover, the concentric arrangement of guide formations, bearings and connector body takes up the substantial portion of the diameter of the housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">GB 2500904 (Sigma Offshore Limited) describes a similar mooring line connector, in which a male component is pulled into a tubular female component and latched into place by an array of hydraulic latch elements. Relative axial motion is restricted by the latches, but in order to provide a fail-safe, the latch elements are biased away from abutment with the male connector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Prior art systems of this type are not optimised for use in the field of tidal power generating apparatus, or similar applications in which comparatively extreme forces are applied between the moorings and the vessel during normal operation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a pre-tensionable connector apparatus, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a first connector assembly;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">a second connector assembly for connection to the first connector assembly;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">a pre-tensioning arrangement positioned in fixed relation to the second connector assembly, for applying a pre-tensioning force between the first and second connector assemblies; wherein the pre-tensioning arrangement is reconfigurable between a first configuration and a second configuration;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">a pull line extending from the first connector assembly and adapted to be coupled to the pre-tensioning arrangement by coupling apparatus; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0016">coupling apparatus for coupling the pull line to the pre-tensioning arrangement;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0017">wherein, when the first and second connector assemblies are engaged or proximal to one another, a portion of the pull line is positionable in relation to the pre-tensioning arrangement such that the pull line may be coupled thereto by the coupling apparatus; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0018">wherein, when the pre-tensioning arrangement is coupled to the pull line by the coupling apparatus, and the pre-tensioning arrangement is in the second configuration the said-pre tensioning force is applied by the pre-tensioning arrangement between the first and second connector assemblies.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">In use to connect the first and second connector assemblies, once the first connector assembly is engaged with the second connector assembly (or at least proximal thereto), a portion of the pull line is coupled to the pre-tensioning arrangement, typically with the pull line taut, and the pre-tensioning arrangement reconfigured such that the pre-tensioning force is applied.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">The pre-tensioning apparatus provides for efficient connection between the first and second connector assemblies, by pulling the pull line, and the application of a pre-tensioning force to retain the connection. The pre-tensioning force is a residual force applied between the connector assemblies via the pull line to retain them in connection with one another. The pre-tensioning force prevents movement between the first and second connector assemblies, in use. For example, the first connector assembly may be connected in use to a mooring line, or other apparatus prone to applying forces to the first connector assembly which act to disengage the first connector assembly from the second connector assembly, or cause movement therebetween. Any such relative movement, which might otherwise cause damage or wear to the connector assembly or the structures associated therewith (e.g. a floating vessel) may be reduced or eliminated by applying a pre-tensioning force between the first and second connector assemblies. The pre-tensioning force and any additional loads applied to the first connector assembly are also distributed via the pull line to the pre-tensioning arrangement. The structural requirements for receiving such forces can be located away from the connector assemblies themselves. This design flexibility may be of particular benefit in floating applications, to avoid engineering compromises for example in hull design.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0021">The pre-tensioning force may be applied by reconfiguring the pre-tensioning arrangement from the first configuration to the second configuration. In some embodiments, a first force between the first and second connector assemblies is applied to the pull line equal to or in excess of the pre-tensioning force, the pre-tensioning arrangement reconfigured from the first to the second configuration and the first force released, such that the pre-tensioning force between the first and second connector assemblies is maintained by the pre-tensioning arrangement, in the second configuration thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">The connector apparatus may be configured for the coupling apparatus to be connected to the pre-tensioning arrangement when the pre-tensioning arrangement is in the first configuration and wherein, when the pre-tensioning arrangement is coupled to the pull line by the coupling apparatus, reconfiguring the pre-tensioning arrangement from the first configuration to the second configuration applies the said-pre tensioning force.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">By reconfiguring, herein we refer to at least moving one or more parts of the pre-tensioning arrangement. Reconfiguring may include adding one or more components to the pre-tensioning arrangement, such as a retainer or spacer as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">The pre-tensioning arrangement may be extended from the first configuration to the second configuration, in some embodiments to apply the pre-tensioning force. The pre-tensioning arrangement may be contracted or otherwise reconfigured, in some embodiments in order to apply the pre-tensioning force.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">The pull line may comprise a coupling portion. A coupling portion may for example comprise an aperture or other latching formation therein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">The coupling apparatus may be adapted to engage with the coupling portion. The coupling apparatus may for example comprise extendable latches, a clamp, or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">Any suitable latching arrangements may be used, such as one or more collars, plates or pin adapted to be received in a recess, channel, lip or other suitable formation on the coupling portion.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">The coupling apparatus may comprise a latch pin; and the coupling portion may comprise a latch pin aperture extending from a first side to a second side thereof and sized to receive the latch pin.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">The pre-tensioning arrangement may engage with the latch pin on the first and second sides of the coupling portion of the pull line.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">The pull line coupling portion may be a part of the pull line, such as a chain link, or a terminal chain link wherein the pull line is a chain.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">The pull line may extend to and terminate at the coupling portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">The coupling portion may be a separate component. Accordingly, the it may be sized independently of the pull line, and thus any suitable dimensions for the latching apparatus may selected. For example, the width between the first and second sides, and any suitable diameter of latch pin and latch pin aperture, may be selected independently of the dimensions of the pull-line.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">In use the pre-tensioning force will be transmitted to the latch pin and distributed across the portions of the latch pin which engage with the pre-tensioning arrangement. The latch pin and connector portion may therefore be dimensioned so as to distribute these forces more widely than has previously been possible.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">For example, conventional pre-tensioning or latching is achieved by introducing a pin through a chain link, or a loop in a pull line. In such arrangements, the forces are typically applied via an interface between two generally rounded bodies and so stresses are relatively focussed. Moreover, the dimensions of the latch pin may be limited by the size of the chain links.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">The latch pin aperture may be generally tubular. A tubular aperture may transmit the pre-tensioning force along a length of the latch pin, in use.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">The latch pin may fit closely within the latch pin aperture. The pre-tensioning forced may thereby be distributed over as large a surface area of the latch pin as possible. For example, the internal diameter of the aperture may similar to the external diameter of the latch pin, to provide a close, or interference fit therebetween.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">Where the latching apparatus comprises a latch pin, the pre-tensioning arrangement may be configured to engage along all or substantially all of the length of the latch pin extending from the latch pin aperture, in use, so as to distribute the transmitted pre-tensioning forces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">The pre-tensioning arrangement may comprise first and second jacking plates, moveable in relation to the second connector assembly to engage with the respective ends of the latch pin extending from the latch pin aperture to the first and second sides of the coupling portion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The jacking plates may, in use, be positioned adjacent to the coupling portion of the pull line. The skilled person will understand that a gap between the jacking plates and the coupling portion may be desirable to facilitate pulling of the pull line (e.g. via a temporarily attached pilot line), but are desirably as close as possible so as to minimise the unsupported length of latch pin.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">The first and second jacking plates may form part of a jacking plate collar, sized to extend around and to at least the first and second sides of the coupling portion. The jacking plate collar may include a port sized to extend entirely around the coupling portion, or may be open-sided (e.g. defining a U-shaped portion for receiving the coupling portion).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">The first and second jacking plates may be provided with receiving formations, such as recesses, to engage with the ends of the latch pin.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">The pre-tensionable connector apparatus may comprise first and second support plates, in fixed relation to the second connector assembly, the first and second support plates corresponding to the first and second jacking plates, wherein the pre-tensioning arrangement is configured to apply a the pre-tensioning force between the support plates and the jacking plates.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">The first and second support plates may form part of a support plate collar, sized to extend around and to at least the first and second sides of the coupling portion. The support plate collar may include a port sized to extend entirely around the pull line or coupling portion thereof, or may be open-sided (e.g. defining a U-shaped portion for receiving the pull line or coupling portion).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">The pre-tensioning force may be applied by any suitable means, including by hydraulic actuator(s), mechanically or electromechanically. For example, the pre-tensioning arrangement may include one or more hydraulic rams disposed between the support and jacking plates, operable to extend and move the jacking plates into engagement with the latch pin in use. Torqueing nuts and/or tensioning bolts may be used to reconfigure (either by pushing or pulling) the pre-tensioning arrangement. The pre-tensioning arrangement may be reconfigured by levering, for example by rotating a cam.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">When connecting the first and second connector assemblies, a tensioning force may be applied by a winch, such that the pre-tensioning arrangement may be coupled to the pull line terminator, the winch released and the pre-tensioning force thereafter applied by the pre-tensioning arrangement.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">The pre-tensioning arrangement may be configured to be locked in place in the second configuration, to maintain the pre-tensioning force. Stated differently, the pre-tensioning arrangement may be passively retained in the second configuration.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">The term &#x201c;passively retained&#x201d; herein refers to the pre-tensioning arrangement being retained or locked in the second configuration without a hydraulic, electrical or any other type of mechanism requiring to be energised in order to maintain the pre-tensioning force. A passively retained pre-tensioning arrangement, may more reliably maintain the pre-tensioning force over a prolonged period (months or years), as might be required for example for semi-permanently moored vessels such as tidal generators, oil rigs and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">Passively maintaining, or locking, the pre-tensioning arrangement in the second configuration may also provide safety benefits, by avoiding risks otherwise associated with mechanical failure of energised apparatus for applying the pre-tensioning force.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">A pre-tensioning arrangement may be passively retained for example by way or torqueing or tensioning nuts. Star washers or other retainers (e.g. a retainer applied to the head of the a retaining bolt) may be used to retain the tensioning nuts in the position, when the second configuration has been reached. A rotating cam may also be maintained or locked in position in an analogous manner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">A pre-tensioning arrangement may be passively retained by latching or introducing wedges, spacers, plates other members between components of the pre-tensioning arrangement, to block movement from the second to the first configuration. For example, the jacking plates as disclosed below may be lifted by means of a hydraulic or electromechanical actuator or the like, and one or more spacers introduced between the jacking plates and the support plates to passively retain the pre-tensioning arrangement in the second configuration, such that the actuator(s) need not remain energised.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">The connector apparatus may comprise a spacer structure extending between the second connector assembly and the pre-tensioning arrangement. The spacer structure may extend for example between the second connector assembly and the support plates, and at least in part maintain the second connector assembly and support places in their fixed relation to one another.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052">The pre-tensioning arrangement and second connector assembly may be retained in fixed relation to the spacer structure. The pre-tensioning arrangement may be attached to, or fixed proximal to, one end of the spacer structure, and the second connector assembly may be attached to, or fixed proximal to, the other end of the spacer structure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053">The spacer structure may further provide a pathway for pulling the pull line, in order to bring the first and second connector assemblies into engagement with one another.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054">The spacer structure may be a generally tubular structure, such as a moon pool through the hull of a floating vessel, as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">The support plate(s) may be attached to, or proximal to, an end of the tubular structure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0056">The pre-tensioning arrangement (e.g. support plate(s) thereof) may be attached to, or fixed proximal to, an upper end of the tubular structure or moon pool.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057">The pre-tensionable connection apparatus may be for use in securing a mooring line to a floating vessel.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058">The pull line may be flexible. For example, the pull line may comprise a length of cable, chain or the like. A flexible pull line assists in puling the first and second connector assemblies together from a range of respective alignments: For example, where one or both of the first and second connector assemblies may be prone to move during connection, such as when connecting a mooring line to a floating vessel.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">The first connector assembly may be a male connector assembly. The second connector assembly may be a female connector assembly.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">The first and second connector assemblies may be adapted to be brought together from a range or respective alignments.

As shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the male and female connector assemblies are close to one another and within the axial, radial and lateral tolerance, they are guided into alignment by the guide arrangements associated with the pin receptors, by further pulling upon the pull line.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0248">When the male and female assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are close to being engaged, or loosely engaged, and before the pre-tensioning arrangement <b>302</b> has been extended (i.e. when in the first configuration), the coupling portion <b>160</b> is pulled sufficiently for the latch pin aperture <b>164</b> to be above the jacking plate <b>316</b>. The latch pin <b>166</b> is then inserted through the latch pin aperture <b>164</b> and either the jacking plate raised, or more typically the coupling portion slightly lowered, such that the latch pin ends <b>160</b><i>a </i><b>160</b><i>b </i>rest in the recesses <b>324</b><i>a </i>and <b>324</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0226" num="0249">At this stage the male and female connector assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, may be loosely engaged. For example, the portions <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> of the pin <b>110</b> may be within the pin receptors, but not fully engaged in the recesses <b>218</b>. Similarly, the collar <b>206</b> and intermediate potion <b>106</b> may be slightly disengaged, and/or the axes M, F and/or L slightly misaligned. In addition, the pull line <b>150</b> may have some slack.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0250">The pre-tensioning arrangement may then be extended to the second configuration, by actuating the hydraulic jacks <b>330</b>. This at least applies a pre-tensioning force, and in the embodiment shown, pulls the male and female connector assemblies into full cooperative engagement.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0251">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the interior of the latch pin aperture is generally tubular, such that the coupling portion <b>160</b> engages with the latch pin over a portion of the length of the latch pin extending therethrough (rather, for example, at a single point, as between links formed between two members of round cross section). In addition, a substantial portion of the exposed ends <b>166</b><i>a </i>and <b>166</b><i>b </i>of the latch pin <b>166</b> are supported by the jacking plate.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0252">The pre-tensioning force (and any additional force applied via the mooring lines in use) is therefore effectively transmitted via these contacting lengths, to the jacking plate and outwardly to the support plate collar <b>304</b> from the upper part <b>310</b> to the lower part <b>308</b>, via the plates <b>314</b>. Similarly, the counter forces are distributed via the comparatively wide diameter coupling portion <b>160</b> to the pull line, chain <b>150</b>, rather than directly and in a more focussed manner, to a chain link.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0253">Optionally, spacers <b>332</b> can be inserted between the jacking plate <b>320</b> and support plate <b>316</b>, to passively retain the pre-tensioning arrangement in the second configuration, to obviate the need to maintain hydraulic pressure, or to safeguard against a loss of hydraulic pressure.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0254">Whilst the invention has been described in connection with the foregoing illustrative embodiments, 10 various modifications, additions and alterations may be made to the invention by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the claimed invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
