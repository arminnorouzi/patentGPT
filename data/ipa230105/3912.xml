Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Evaluation of cement-bonding quality can be a challenging process as it requires interpret of acoustic measurements to evaluate cement-bonding quality in a through-tubing process, such as for plugged and abandoned (P&#x26;A) wells. For acoustic logging-related through-tubing, most of energy generated by a transmitter may be confined in the tubing because of high impedance contrast of the tubing and fluid. Variances in received waveforms as a result of cement bonding conditions may not be significant or may not be observable. To address this, frequency responses of receivers can be analyzed to recognize features on a frequency spectra of a received waveforms that may be a result of cement bonding conditions. However, such features can be trivial and difficult to reliably identify. In addition, casing-debonding and cement-debonding may not be differentiable using currently-available techniques.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In at least one embodiment, a well inspection method is disclosed.
