selecting a function using a pointing device such as a mouse is performed. Meanwhile, in systems that input or operation is performed on display content projected by a projector, instruction input devices such as a laser pointer that can remotely perform instruction operation or a pen that can directly perform writing operation on a projection plane is used. Furthermore, in a case where a video or the like is projected using a projector, a wall surface or a screen perpendicular to the ground, such as a home theater, is used.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: JP 2015-115682 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, use of a horizontal plane such as a table or a floor by an ultra short throw projector and use of a desirable position in an installation space by a projector capable of dynamically changing the projection direction have become possible. In particular, in a case where a user performs an input operation related to an object present in a real space on a projection plane, there is a problem that it is difficult to perform an input operation matching display content unless the arrangement and the shape of the display content (object), the orientation of projection content, and the orientation of a user who operates are matched.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been made in view of such circumstances, and an object of the present disclosure is to facilitate a pointing input operation in a real space in which there is no operation reference by matching the pointing input operation with the real space.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above problem, an information processing device according to the present disclosure includes: a control unit that performs: control of switching a display coordinate system of display content from a first display coordinate system to a second display coordinate system, the display content displayed on a surface of a real object by a display unit, depending on a state of an input operation of changing a position or an angle of the display content; and control of changing a display position or a display angle of the display content in accordance with the second display coordinate system and causing the display unit to display input assist display corresponding to axes of the second display coordinate system in a case where the display coordinate system is switched from the first display coordinate system to the second display coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, in a case where a display coordinate system is switched from a first display coordinate system to a second display coordinate system, a control unit changes a display position or a display angle of display content in accordance with the second display coordinate system and causes the display unit to display input assist display corresponding to axes of the second display coordinate system. Therefore, it is possible to display the input assist display corresponding to the second display coordinate system serving as an operation reference in a real space where there is no operation reference and to facilitate the pointing input operation in the real space, where there is no operation reference, in a manner that matches the real space.</p><?summary-of-invention
