The contents of the aforementioned applications are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following relates to an assembly for engaging the interior of a pipe, in particular a self-centering assembly used to secure testing or isolation tools within the pipe.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common for testing tools to be utilized for testing the integrity of pipes or welds provided on pipes. In addition, various isolation tools are known, which are used to isolate a particular section of a pipe from another, e.g., to prevent fumes, combustible vapours, etc., contained or generated within the pipe from reaching a welding region wherein heat from the welding procedure may result in ignition of such fumes. An isolation tool may also be used to prevent heat generated by the welding process from being conducted over the length of the pipe, and can be provided with a cooling water flow to act as a thermal barrier. Examples of such tools are provided in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,844,127 and 6,131,441; and PCT Publication No. WO 2010/022502 (the entire contents of these references being incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In testing or isolation tools such as those exemplified in WO 2010/022502, a front plate and a back plate are coupled to an annular ring positioned therebetween using a series of threaded rods. To seal against the inner wall of a pipe, resilient sealing members (e.g., O-rings) are coaxially provided between the front plate and the annular ring, and between the annular ring and the back plate respectively. Either or both the front plate and the annular ring can provide a beveled surface to direct deformation and extrusion of one of the sealing members radially outward when tightened. Similarly, either or both the back plate and the annular ring provide a beveled surface to direct deformation and extrusion of the other of the sealing members radially outward when tightened.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One issue that may be encountered with this arrangement is that when the plates and annular ring are loosely coupled or otherwise not engaged with the sealing members, the sealing members may shift or slide out of alignment with the beveled surfaces causing an inconsistent seal about the circumference of the tool, among other things. Another related issue is that any such misalignment can make it difficult to insert the tool into the pipe or cause undue stress on the sealing members when positioning and securing the tool therein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there exists a need for an improved testing or isolation tool that addresses at least one of these issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A testing or isolation tool is provided in which a circumferential flange is provided between at least one of front and back plates and a centrally positioned annular ring to limit or inhibit radial movement of a sealing member interposed between the plate(s) and the annular ring.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, there is provided an assembly for engaging an inner wall of a pipe, the assembly comprising: first and second end plates adapted to be coaxially aligned when in use, the first and second end plates each comprising one or more members extending from a first surface thereof;

The assembly <b>10</b> includes a front plate <b>12</b> and a back plate <b>14</b> coupled to opposite ends of an annular ring <b>16</b>, using a series of threaded tie rods <b>18</b>. It can be appreciated that the terms &#x201c;front&#x201d; and &#x201c;back&#x201d; are used herein for convenience in terms of the assembly <b>10</b> when installed in a pipe and in use, and can be referred to using other terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; end plates, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; plates, and the like. The front plate <b>12</b>, back plate <b>14</b>, and annular ring <b>16</b> are axially aligned when assembled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">First and second resilient sealing members <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are coaxially provided, wherein the first sealing member <b>22</b> is provided between the front plate <b>12</b> and the annular ring <b>16</b>, while the second sealing member <b>24</b> is provided between the annular ring <b>16</b> and the back plate <b>14</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the opposite ends of the annular ring <b>16</b> are each preferably provided, at the outer edges thereof, with bevels <b>34</b> and <b>44</b> for receiving the respective resilient sealing members <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and for directing its deformation radially outward (as discussed further below). In a similar manner, bevels (not shown) may be provided along the outer circumferential edge of the respective plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for achieving the same result. It will be understood that such bevels can be provided on one or both of the opposing faces of the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the annular ring <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The front plate <b>12</b> is provided with the series of threaded tie rods <b>18</b> that are generally circumferentially- and equidistantly-spaced. The rods <b>18</b> are sized and positioned to extend through the inner diameter of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and the annular ring <b>16</b>. The back plate <b>14</b> is provided with a series of corresponding blind holes <b>20</b> that are reamed, drilled or milled thereinto for threadingly receiving the tie rods <b>18</b>. The rods <b>18</b> allow circumferential tightening to urge together the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and annular ring <b>16</b> using, for example, a series of corresponding nuts (not shown) threaded on the distal ends of the rods <b>18</b>. It can be appreciated that the tie rods <b>18</b> and blind holes <b>20</b> are one example of an urging mechanism that, in general, urges the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> towards the annular ring <b>20</b> to deform the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, the assembly <b>10</b> is preferably pre-assembled in a loose manner and inserted into a pipe <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or other structure in which it is to be used. Once positioned in the desired location, the nuts are tightened, thereby urging all elements of the assembly together. In the result, the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are deformed radially outwardly against the inner wall of the pipe <b>52</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As indicated above, a problem encountered with this assembly process is that the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can become misaligned or otherwise be forced inwardly between the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the annular ring <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To address this problem, and referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the annular ring <b>16</b> is provided with circumferential first and second slots <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> at the opposing ends thereof, for receiving circumferential first and second flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> that extend from the front and back plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> respectively. The sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, which are typically embodied as circular O-rings, can be placed over or otherwise around the respective flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> to limit or inhibit shifting of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> even when the assembly <b>10</b> is pre-assembled in a loose manner. This is due to the size and positioning of the flanges <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> relative to the bevels <b>34</b>, <b>44</b> as will be explained in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It can be appreciated that the flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> could instead extend from the annular ring <b>16</b>, with the slots <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> extending from the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Similarly, while the flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> and slots <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> in this example are shown as continuous circumferential members, multiple discontinuous flanges, posts or other members having various shapes or contours (with corresponding slots to receive same) could also be used without departing from the principles discussed herein. That is, various one or more members extending from the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> or annular ring <b>16</b> could be incorporated in order to provide a barrier to limit shifting of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> as herein described.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is a port <b>46</b> on the central circumferential surface of the annular ring <b>16</b>. This port <b>46</b> is in communication with a quick coupler <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) facing the back plate <b>14</b>. Although not shown, a second port can be provided on the opposite side of the annular ring <b>16</b> and connected to another quick coupler <b>70</b>. It can be appreciated that the quick couplers <b>70</b> can be connected to a medium in order to introduce that medium through the ports <b>46</b> to an area between the seals to establish and verify the seals, e.g., by using a pressure gauge <b>58</b>. A medium such as water can also be introduced using this mechanism and circulated through the assembly <b>10</b> to create a heat exchanger, to cool the seals, pipe wall <b>50</b> and assembly <b>10</b> in high temperature events such as Post Weld Heat Treating. For example, as illustrated in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a flange <b>50</b> is being attached to the pipe <b>52</b> by welding <b>56</b>, and the pressure gauge <b>58</b> can be used to establish and verify the seals made by the first and second resilient sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to ensure the intended isolation is achieved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, further detail concerning the flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> and slots <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> is provided. Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the interface between the annular ring <b>16</b> and the back plate <b>14</b> is shown in which the second flange <b>40</b> extends from the back plate <b>14</b>, and is received by the second slot <b>42</b> to provide a sliding barrier for the sealing member <b>24</b>. It can be appreciated that the sizes and relative dimensions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> are illustrative only. For example, a larger diameter sealing member <b>24</b> may fill the entire notch between the second flange <b>40</b> and the back plate <b>14</b>, instead of having a looser fit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. In either case, the second flange <b>40</b> prevents the second sealing member <b>24</b> from sliding between the annular ring <b>16</b> and the back plate <b>14</b>, and thus maintains axial alignment of the sealing member <b>24</b> relative to the assembly. Moreover, the second flange <b>40</b> and second slot <b>42</b> are sized to permit the aforementioned loose pre-assembly of the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and annular ring <b>16</b> while still providing the barrier. This is illustrated by the relative positioning of the annular ring <b>16</b> and back plate <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a tightened position in which the second sealing member <b>24</b> is urged towards and against the bevel <b>44</b> and deforms and extrudes outwardly as illustrated, e.g., in order to engage the inner wall of the pipe <b>52</b>. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> that as the annular ring <b>16</b> and back plate <b>14</b> are tightened together, the second flange <b>40</b> slidingly enters the second annular slot <b>42</b> so as to permit the tightening while maintaining the barrier to prevent inward movement or extrusion of the sealing member <b>24</b>. It can be appreciated that similar principles apply to the first flange <b>30</b> and first slot <b>32</b> as the front plate <b>12</b> is simultaneously tightened against the annular ring <b>16</b> at the other end.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The front plate <b>12</b> is shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a series of through holes <b>60</b> can be seen, which permit the tie rods <b>18</b> to pass through the front plate <b>12</b>, annular ring <b>16</b> and for insertion and engagement with the back plate <b>14</b>. It can be appreciated that the number and exact spacing of these through holes <b>60</b> would vary based on the diameter of the assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also illustrates the circumferentially equidistantly spaced arrangement of the through holes <b>60</b> and thus the positioning of the tie rods <b>18</b> relative to each other. The central passage <b>62</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can be used to feed lines to the quick couplers <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an example of an O-ring-type sealing member <b>22</b> is shown as being inserted over the first flange <b>30</b> to maintain axial alignment when assembling the sealing member <b>22</b> and front plate <b>12</b> with the annular ring <b>16</b> and back plate <b>14</b>. It has also been found that the flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> can prevent or at least mitigate uneven expansion of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> without the need to necessarily torque the nuts in a particular sequence as was found with prior testing and isolation tools. Preferably, a maximum torque would be recommended to avoid damaging the threads or flanges <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. This also avoids the need for special training for installing new tools <b>10</b>, which can contribute to an improvement in jobsite safety.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Moreover, it can be appreciated that the diameter of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can be varied to accommodate different schedules of pipe <b>52</b>. For example, a single 8&#x2033; tool could be used to isolate or test an 8&#x2033; sched 80, sched 60, sched 40 or sched 20 pipe, by increasing the diameter of the O-ring being used as the resilient sealing member <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, from &#xbd;&#x2033; to &#x215d;&#x2033; to &#xbe;&#x2033; to &#x215e;&#x2033; respectively. In this way, multiple schedules of pipe <b>52</b> can be accommodated with only requiring one assembly <b>10</b>. This can reduce or minimize the need to manufacture additional schedules of the assembly <b>10</b>. Similarly, additional training would not be required to choose the size of the O-ring in this example, since this would already be predetermined as being dependent on the schedule of pipe <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The annular ring <b>16</b> is shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the extent to which the first and second slots <b>34</b>, <b>44</b> extend inwardly can be observed. The slots <b>34</b>, <b>44</b> surround a central passage <b>72</b> that permits the tie rods <b>18</b> to pass therethrough for engagement with the back plate <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the quick couplings <b>70</b> that connect to the ports <b>46</b> that extend outwardly as explained above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> also shows the positioning of the second slot <b>42</b> relative to the central passage <b>72</b>, namely that it encircles the passage <b>72</b> and is axially aligned therewith.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The back plate <b>14</b> is shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the circumferentially and equidistantly spaced blind holes <b>20</b> are axially aligned with a central passage <b>80</b>. The central passage <b>80</b> in this example can be a &#xbe;&#x2033; NPT hole used to vent gases from behind the assembly <b>10</b> to a safe area. This prevents pressure from building up behind the assembly <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, an example of an O-ring-type sealing member <b>24</b> is shown as being inserted over the second flange <b>40</b> to maintain axial alignment when assembling the sealing member <b>24</b> and back plate <b>14</b> with the annular ring <b>16</b> and front plate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second sealing member <b>24</b> can therefore be placed over the second flange <b>40</b>, and the tie rods <b>18</b> threaded into the blind holes <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The first sealing member <b>22</b> can likewise be placed over the first flange <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The annular ring <b>16</b> can then be slid over the tie rods <b>18</b>, followed by the front plate <b>12</b> to axially align the components in the assembly. The sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are prevented from becoming unaligned in the manner depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, such that when nuts are used to tightened the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to the annular ring <b>16</b>, the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> deform and extrude outwardly in a consistent manner to seal against the inner wall of the pipe <b>52</b>. This consistent outward extrusion of the sealing members <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> avoids the need to torque the nuts in a particular sequence, and the need for special training in order to install the assembly <b>10</b> in a pipe <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For simplicity and clarity of illustration, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements.
