Such devices usually rely on multiple individual &#x201c;links&#x201d; or coupling elements interconnected together to transmit external tension or &#x201c;pulling&#x201d; forces through or along the length of the chain between two objects connected to opposite ends of the chain. Such an arrangement may be advantageous in many circumstances such as when pulling or lifting a load but are likely problematic if the goal is to push the load or keep the load from twisting or deflecting out of a particular alignment with the chain. This is because chain assemblies often have no provision for transmitting external compression forces applied between two objects at opposite ends of the chain. Similarly, chain links are often not configured to avoid lateral deflection of one link in relation to another. Thus chain assemblies are commonly only useful in transmitting tension between objects, not for limiting compression, torque, or other forces that may be applied to objects supported by the chain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally many chain assemblies consist of elements which have a very limited ability to control the movement of one element with relation to another. In many applications where the chain is used to apply tension, such a feature may not be necessary or desirable. Such a chain assembly may collapse under compression forces or may not be able to resist forces applied from other directions thus limiting its usefulness to applying tension. Thus chain assemblies are often incapable of delivering or withstanding external compression forces or providing structural support to withstand forces applied from other directions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed are examples of chain assemblies with rotatable support elements arranged linearly such that the support elements extend longitudinally within a reference plane and are substantially prevented from moving or rotating out of the plane. Such assemblies operate as support assemblies limiting motion within or substantially parallel to the plane. This limited motion may be achieved by virtue of the arrangement and positioning of a projecting member extending outwardly from the support elements being received within a receiving cavity of an adjacent support element. This configuration of projecting members and receiving cavities can be configured so that the projecting member is receivable and moveable within the receiving cavity and can rotate around an axis of rotation substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and the reference plane, but not in a direction other than within or parallel to the reference plane. A retention system can be included that is arranged and configured to retain the projecting member of the first element within the cavity of the second element when the retention system can be actuated to prevent disengagement of the elements, or to control the direction and extent of their collective bending or displacement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional examples also disclose various combinations of supporting elements and retention devices in the form of frames, braces, and similar structures useful to support loads. Examples include these or other structures that are configured to move only within or parallel to a plane but not in other directions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The various examples of support assemblies disclosed herein may be used in a variety of different applications, including industrial applications, commercial applications, personal applications, and/or wearable applications</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further forms, objects, features, aspects, benefits, advantages, and examples will become apparent from a detailed description and drawings provided herewith.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a portion of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is another cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with alternative features illustrated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a partial perspective view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with alternative features illustrated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is another cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is an alternative cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a perspective view of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> is a schematic view of another example of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the support assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a side view of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> with close-up sections.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view of a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the examples illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described examples, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. One or more examples of the invention is shown in great detail, although it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that some features that are not relevant to the present disclosure may not be shown for the sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The reference numerals in the following description have been organized to aid the reader in quickly identifying the drawings where various components are first shown. In particular, the drawing in which an element first appears is typically indicated by the left-most digit(s) in the corresponding reference number. For example, an element identified by a &#x201c;100&#x201d; series reference numeral will first appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an element identified by a &#x201c;200&#x201d; series reference numeral will first appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and so on. With reference to the Specification, Abstract, and Claims sections herein, it should be noted that the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d;, and the like include plural referents unless expressly discussed otherwise. As an illustration, references to &#x201c;a device&#x201d; or &#x201c;the device&#x201d; include one or more of such devices and equivalents thereof. Multiple related items illustrated in the drawings with the same part number which are differentiated by a letter for separate individual instances may be referred to generally by a distinguishable portion of the full name, and/or by the number alone. For example, if multiple &#x201c;laterally extending elements&#x201d; <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B, <b>90</b>C, and <b>90</b>D are illustrated in the drawings, the disclosure may refer to these as &#x201c;laterally extending elements <b>90</b>A-<b>90</b>D,&#x201d; or as &#x201c;lateral support elements <b>90</b>,&#x201d; or by a distinguishable portion of the full name such as &#x201c;elements <b>90</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Disclosed herein are various examples of a support assembly comprising various support elements in a linear arrangement similar to a chain with links extending longitudinally in a row. The elements can be arranged longitudinally in this manner within or at least parallel to a supporting plane. The supporting plane in that sense can be thought of as an imaginary reference plane passing through the elements of the assembly, or passing parallel to them. This plane may be referred to as the &#x201c;supporting plane&#x201d; or &#x201c;plane of support&#x201d; to aid in understanding the disclosed examples. The support elements may be configured to reduce or eliminate deflection that may be caused by forces applied to the elements in directions not parallel to the plane of support. The supporting elements can be configured to freely or selectively flex in directions that are fully within or substantially parallel to the plane of support. Thus the support assembly can bend or flex along the plane of support while providing varying degrees of support against flexing or bending in other directions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">This behavior can be achieved by various arrangements of supporting elements that each may include a tongue, tab, or other projecting member extending outwardly away from the supporting element that is configured to be received by a corresponding slot, indention, or cavity defined by adjacent supporting elements. This &#x201c;tab&#x201d; and &#x201c;slot&#x201d; arrangement may be configured such that the tabs and corresponding slots have a semi-circular or rounded shape allowing the tab to rotate or pivot within the receiving cavity. Such an arrangement can allow one supporting element in the assembly to rotate around one axis of rotation while adjacent elements may also rotate around separate axes of rotation. Thus each supporting element may independently pivot with respect to adjacent elements allowing the full assembly of elements to collectively bend or flex along the plane of support. Put another way, the supporting elements in this configuration can collectively control movement of the elements constraining them to rotate or swing substantially parallel to the plane of support while resisting rotation or movement in other directions not substantially parallel to the plane of support.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The projecting member and corresponding receiving cavity may be of any suitable shape to achieve the desired effect. For example, the interior of the receiving cavity may include parallel planar sides with a circular or semi-circular bottom surface. The sides and bottom may be thought of as force bearing surfaces where the sides of the cavity support the inserted projecting member maintaining it within or substantially parallel to the plane of support as the projecting tab pivots within the cavity. The bottom surface may also provide support, for example, if a compressing force is applied longitudinally to the array of supporting elements parallel to the plane of support thus urging the elements together. Any suitable cavity and/or projecting member with shapes configured to achieve satisfactory results similar to those disclosed herein are envisioned.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One supporting element in the chain may pivot with respect to neighboring elements until physically constrained. The extent of this pivotal motion may, for example, be limited by the shape of the supporting elements. One element may rotate until it directly contacts an adjacent element forcing it to stop pivoting further. For example, each supporting element may be configured to rotate no more than 10 degrees with respect to adjacent elements. If five elements are used in the assembly, the full assembly might be able to achieve a maximum overall deflection of 50 degrees.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">This overall deflection can be modified, by varying the points of contact along the corresponding surfaces of the supporting elements. The surfaces may be shaped in various ways to allow more rotation in one direction than another. For example, the supporting elements may be constructed to allow the assembly to straighten longitudinally, flex in one direction within or along the plane of support, but not in the opposite direction. Similarly, the supporting elements may be constructed to provide greater flexibility in one direction parallel to the plane of support, and less in any other direction. In this way, the support assembly may provide not only support against movement normal to the plane of support, but support against movement beyond a particular maximum deflection of the support assembly as a whole parallel to the plane of support as well.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This support assembly may include lines passing through the support elements in the assembly serving various purposes. These lines may be any combination of cables, tubes, wires, or retention devices for keeping the assembly engaged together. For example, each support element may define various passageways that collectively can align to create passageways running longitudinally through the support assembly. Such openings running through the assembly allow a line to be positioned within the assembly and configured to apply a tension force to the supporting elements so that the projecting members are retained within the receiving cavities. This application of tension may allow compression forces to then be transmitted longitudinally along or through the assembly. In other words, by &#x201c;pulling&#x201d; the individual elements together under internal tension, the assembly as a whole may be used to &#x201c;push&#x201d; objects or otherwise apply compression forces externally to other objects.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Lines operating in this fashion may be retention lines operating as part of a retention system. Examples of such a line or lines include any suitable biasing element such as an elastic band made of rubber, a spring, or an elastic chord to name a few non-limiting examples. The lines may also include cables coupled to actuating devices configured to be selectively tightened or shortened in length causing the supporting assembly to perhaps flex or bend in one direction versus another along the plane of support. Similarly, the retention system may collect data from the actuating devices or other sensors regarding position of individual elements in the assembly. The retention system may also measure the extent of overall deflection by measuring the position or length of one of the retention lines as the actuating devices are activated to adjust the position and arrangement of the support elements in the assembly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The support elements can take any form, as well. Besides being linked together in a selectively rigid chain, support elements can include other structures with projecting tabs and receiving slots at different locations along the structure such as at opposing ends. For example, a connecting segment with coupling tabs and receiving cavities at opposite ends can be configured as discussed herein such that the projecting members at each end of one connecting segment are received within corresponding cavities at the ends of adjacent connecting segments. The connecting segments may also define a shape such as an arch. This arrangement may be characterized as two support assemblies combined operating together, or as one support assembly with additional features providing additional rigidity. Both sets of tabs and cavities on each end of the connecting segments can be thought of as having the same plane of support, or two separate planes of support that are substantially parallel. In either case, the combination can be additionally resistant to bending or flexing in a direction that is not substantially parallel to the supporting plane or planes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Support elements in the assembly may be configured in other ways as well. For example, bracing members, arms, plates, and the like may include the projecting members and cavities as well as similar passageways discussed herein to provide different types of supporting structures such as selectively flexible supporting frames or other structures.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One example of a support assembly is illustrated at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, support elements <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>F can be organized linearly in a chain or stacked arrangement with individual elements <b>105</b> positioned adjacent one another and engaged together to collectively flex or bend fully within or substantially parallel to a reference plane while resisting twisting, flexing or bending in other directions. As noted herein elsewhere, support elements <b>105</b> can be arranged so that a portion of one supporting element can be fit within or are received within cavities or slots defined by an adjacent element or elements. For example, projecting members <b>107</b>A-E may extend outwardly away from corresponding elements <b>105</b> and may be received within receiving cavities <b>106</b>A-F of other adjacent support elements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Projecting members <b>107</b> can be retained within cavities <b>106</b> by a retention system that may optionally include a first line <b>110</b> and a second line <b>115</b>. These lines may pass through the support assembly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and may operate as retention members providing tension forces on elements <b>105</b> for maintaining the support elements in engagement with one another. In other words, the assemblies disclosed herein may be &#x201c;rigidized&#x201d; by applying tension through and/or between the multiple elements (like elements <b>105</b>) causing them to engage and collectively stiffen. These tension or &#x201c;rigidizing&#x201d; forces may allow external forces exerted against the assembly pushing or compressing elements <b>105</b> toward one another to be transmitted longitudinally along or through the assembly. In other words, it may be possible to transmit external compression forces applied to the assembly outward away from the assembly and into another object by applying tension inwardly on the individual elements to retain the elements in contact with one another. In another aspect, controlling the tension applied may be accomplished by an actuator or actuating system <b>120</b>. Actuating system <b>120</b> may be configured to control the tension of the first and/or second lines, may be part of the support assembly to control the overall flexibility, the direction in which assembly <b>100</b> flexes along the supporting plane, and the extent to which it may collectively bend.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The shape of the receiving cavities <b>106</b> and projecting members <b>107</b>A-F may dictate how the overall support assembly <b>100</b> can flex or bend, or how resistant to such flexing or bending it may be as well. Supporting elements <b>105</b> can generally rotate or pivot around an axis of rotation defined by the shape of cavities <b>106</b> and projecting members <b>107</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, projecting members <b>107</b> appears as a partial disc being semi-circular or ovular with parallel substantially planar front and back sides and a curved or rounded surface extending away from the rest of supporting element <b>105</b>. The supporting plane for assembly <b>100</b> can be thus defined by the arrangement of substantially planar sides of projecting members <b>107</b> corresponding to substantially planar interior surfaces of cavities <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When, for example, projecting member <b>107</b>A is inserted into receiving cavity <b>106</b>B as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supporting element <b>105</b>A can pivot relative to supporting element <b>105</b>B in, or parallel to, a plane of support that is substantially parallel to the sides of projecting member <b>107</b>A and the interior surfaces of cavity <b>106</b>B. Factors affecting twisting, bending, or other movement in other directions include the positioning of the projecting member within in the receiving cavity, the shape of the projecting member and the cavity, the fit between projecting member or tab and receiving cavity or slot, as well as the rigidity of the materials used in constructing the projecting members <b>107</b> and the receiving cavity <b>106</b>, to name a few. Thus elements <b>105</b>A-F pivot separately relative to one another by virtue of the projecting tongue portion being received by the cavity slot as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which allows the resulting assembly to collectively bend or flex in a direction parallel to the plane of support while being substantially prevented from flexing, bending, or rotating out of a substantially parallel relationship with this first plane by virtue of the positioning of the projecting member within the receiving cavity.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Supporting elements <b>105</b>A-F illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as support assembly <b>100</b>. Elements <b>105</b>A-F are each illustrated with a separate and independent axis of rotation <b>215</b>A-F which can be substantially perpendicular or normal to a supporting plane <b>3</b> denoted by section lines <b>3</b>. Supporting elements <b>105</b>A-F are linearly arranged along a longitudinal axis <b>220</b> within or substantially parallel to the supporting plane <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, support assembly <b>100</b> may be substantially inflexible in a direction other than fully within or substantially parallel to a supporting plane, such as plane <b>3</b>, by virtue of the shape of projecting members and receiving cavities, as well as the materials used in support elements <b>105</b>. For example, support assembly <b>100</b> may be substantially inflexible, that is to say substantially rigid, in the directions indicated by arrows <b>210</b>. Support assembly <b>100</b> in this configuration may provide for flexing according to the combined pivotal movement of support elements <b>105</b>A-F rotatable about several separate axes of rotation <b>215</b>A-F. Thus flexibility along one plane that is substantially perpendicular to the axes of rotation <b>215</b>A-F may be achieved while support assembly <b>100</b> remains substantially inflexible and capable of operating as a support or load bearing structure configured to resist forces applied in substantially other directions not substantially parallel to the plane of support.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a cutaway view of support assembly <b>100</b> cut along section lines <b>3</b> and viewed facing in the direction indicated by the arrows accompanying section lines <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. In one example, supporting elements <b>105</b>A-F collectively define passageways <b>307</b>, <b>305</b>, and <b>310</b> through support assembly <b>100</b>. First passageway <b>305</b> is defined by separate passageways <b>305</b>A-F passing through the corresponding projecting members <b>107</b>A-F extending outwardly from support elements <b>105</b>A-F. Additional optimal passageways laterally displaced from passageways <b>305</b>A-F are shown as <b>307</b>A-F and <b>310</b> A-F.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Any combination of these passageways may be used for various purposes including maintaining supporting elements <b>105</b> engaged together adjacent one another. A retention system that includes elongate members or lines <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> operating as retention members configured to maintain projecting members <b>107</b> within cavities <b>106</b> may be positioned within these passageways. In one example, elongate member <b>115</b> may be a line such as an elastic band, spring, or other biasing member operating alone or as part of a retention system for retaining supporting elements <b>105</b>A-F adjacent one another as illustrated. Line <b>110</b> may be coupled to an actuator <b>120</b> that can, for example, increase or decrease the tension on line <b>110</b> retaining members <b>107</b> within cavities <b>106</b>. Tension on line <b>110</b> may thus allow support elements <b>105</b> to pivot individually with respect to one another while maintaining the ability to flex within or substantially parallel to the plane of support but not in other directions. As the elements pivot, support assembly <b>100</b> can flex within or substantially parallel to the plane of support according to the tension applied by actuator <b>120</b>. In other words, by applying tension to line <b>110</b>, support assembly may collectively rotate substantially parallel to the plane of support with minimal rotation or flexing in directions not substantially parallel to the plane of support. Counter tension pulling against actuator <b>120</b> may be applied by line <b>110</b> itself, or by other retention members. For example, line <b>110</b> may be a biasing member such as an elastic chord or spring applying tension that may be increased or decreased by actuating the actuator <b>120</b>. Actuator <b>120</b> may also be configured with measuring devices to measure the rate, or extent of the flexing of assembly <b>100</b> by, for example, measuring changes in the length, position of the line <b>110</b>, or tension on line <b>110</b>. Examples of measuring devices that may be used devices include string potentiometers, string encoders, cable position transducers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">These passageways may be used for various purposes as illustrated, for example, for additional lines <b>110</b>, or left empty for other uses. Line <b>110</b> may also be a single cable, or bundle of cables, or wires, which may be used in support assembly <b>100</b> for other purposes besides retaining supporting elements <b>105</b> in the linear arrangement as illustrated. Other configurations of lines <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are envisioned as well where line <b>110</b> is positioned within passageway <b>307</b> and line <b>115</b> is positioned within passageway <b>310</b>. Similarly, actuator <b>120</b> may be coupled to line <b>115</b> instead of <b>110</b>, or to both. Any suitable combination of passageways and lines or other elongate members (or lack thereof) may be used in the passageways running through support assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another configuration for retaining elements <b>105</b> engaged to maintain elements <b>105</b> together is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, lines <b>110</b>A-C are positioned within passageway <b>307</b>, but each is a separate and independent retaining member individually coupling a support element (<b>105</b>A) with an adjacent support element (<b>105</b>B) without extending further to other support elements, or without extending the length of the assembly. Retention members <b>110</b>A-C in this configuration might be individual biasing elements such as springs, elastic bands, rubber bands, and the like fixed in position in passageway <b>307</b> to provide retention forces to support elements <b>105</b>. A similar configuration appears as well in the example shown for lines <b>115</b>A-C which are configured similarly in passageway <b>310</b>A. These individual retention members retaining individual elements <b>105</b> together may be used as shown, or in conjunction with other retention elements described and illustrated herein. For example, a single retention member <b>110</b> might be used in conjunction with individual retention members <b>115</b> and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Other examples of other retention mechanisms and configurations appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> where line <b>110</b> again appears as a retention member like those discussed herein, but is configured outside any passageway defined by support elements <b>105</b>. In this example, retention member <b>110</b> is coupled, fixed, or joined to one or more of the support elements <b>105</b> in the assembly on an exterior surface such as an end surface <b>318</b>A and <b>318</b>B. Any suitable coupling device may be used to maintain line <b>110</b> in place such as any suitable adhesive or fastener.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> are retention members <b>320</b>A-C which appear as another example of an external retention member outside any passageways defined by and/or passing through supporting elements <b>105</b>. Retention members <b>320</b> individually retain supporting elements <b>105</b> together by engaging outside features such as mounting holes <b>322</b>A and <b>322</b>B defined by elements <b>105</b>. In other words, elements <b>105</b> may define internal passageways for one or more retention members or lines that are configured to pass transverse to or substantially perpendicular to the plane of support. Retention members <b>322</b> as illustrated represent any suitable device like those discussed herein such as elastic bands, springs, or other suitable biasing devices that are coupled to mounting holes or other exterior features of support elements <b>105</b> and operate to retain adjacent elements together.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another example of retention members is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> where retention members <b>324</b> and <b>326</b> are coupled to outside surfaces <b>325</b>A and <b>325</b>B. Retention members <b>324</b> and <b>326</b> may be constructed and configured like retention member <b>110</b>, <b>320</b>, or any other retention member or device discussed herein. Members <b>324</b> and <b>326</b> may be springs, elastic bands, or any other suitable device for keeping elements <b>105</b> engaged together as disclosed. Any of the retention members discussed herein such as lines <b>110</b>, or members <b>320</b>, <b>324</b>, and <b>326</b> may also be unbiased devices such as metal cables, string, polymeric strands or chords, and the like. Such retention members as these may be substantially inflexible and configured to retain elements <b>105</b> and other similarly disclosed elements in substantially one position relative to other elements. For example, member <b>324</b> may be inflexible or unbiased, while member <b>326</b> may be biased. In this configuration, elements <b>105</b> may rotate in one direction toward element <b>324</b> and within or substantially parallel to the plane of support while not rotating in another direction toward element <b>326</b>. Such an arrangement may be configured using multiple biased and unbiased retention members in any suitable configuration in any of the examples disclosed or envisioned herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additional detail support assembly <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> where supporting elements <b>105</b>A and <b>105</b>B are configured as discussed above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross sectional view of one element <b>105</b>A from supporting assembly <b>100</b> providing additional detail common to other elements <b>105</b>B-F as well. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, supporting elements <b>105</b> include a body <b>430</b> that defines a cavity <b>106</b> with walls <b>432</b> terminating at surface <b>440</b>. The walls <b>432</b> of cavity <b>106</b> may be substantially planar as illustrated, and substantially parallel to the support plane <b>3</b>. In this configuration, walls <b>432</b> and surface <b>440</b> may be configured to provide support and may operate as load bearing surfaces adjacent to or in contact with corresponding outer surfaces <b>437</b> of projecting member <b>107</b> when projecting member <b>107</b> is engaged within cavity <b>106</b>. The sides of member <b>107</b> may be retained between walls <b>432</b> and the furthest extent <b>435</b> of projecting member <b>107</b> may provide for additional support as well as rotational movement.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated, corresponding surfaces <b>435</b> of projecting member <b>107</b> and surface <b>440</b> of cavity <b>106</b> may be circular, semicircular, and the like as illustrated for providing pivotal movement of projecting member <b>107</b> within receiving cavity <b>106</b> around axis of rotation <b>215</b>. Motion of supporting elements <b>105</b> provides for an angle of rotation <b>415</b> of two supporting elements <b>105</b> relative to each other. Pivotal motion of these sporting elements relative to one another may be limited by contact between a second surface <b>425</b>B of element <b>105</b>B and a first surface <b>420</b>A of supporting element <b>105</b>A. As supporting elements <b>105</b> rotate relative to one another, their shape may restrict the maximum pivotal movement of one element with respect to an adjacent element. As illustrated further below, various modifications to the surfaces and resulting shape of the supporting elements may be made to provide for additional rotational motion of each element with respect to adjacent elements thus affecting overall flexibility.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As noted here, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, sides <b>432</b> of cavity <b>106</b> may be configured as primary supporting structures providing support against forces in directions not within or substantially parallel to the plane of support. Such forces may be directed to move or rotate supporting elements <b>105</b> transverse to the supporting plane <b>3</b> thus attempting to &#x201c;bend&#x201d; or &#x201c;flex&#x201d; the supporting elements individually, and the assembly as a whole, in directions not substantially parallel to the plane of support. In using substantially planar or &#x201c;flat&#x201d; sides for cavity <b>106</b>, displacement of elements <b>105</b> by torque or twisting forces exerted circumferentially around, or transverse to, the longitudinal axis <b>220</b> of the combined support assembly can be minimized or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some additional movement in a direction other than within or substantially parallel to the support plane may be provided for. For example, the space between the outer surfaces <b>437</b> of projecting member <b>107</b> and the walls <b>432</b> of cavity <b>106</b> may be increased creating the opportunity for additional movement of each element with respect to adjacent elements in a direction not substantially parallel to the supporting plane. An example of how this might be done appears in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> where elements <b>455</b>A and <b>455</b>B are configured and engaged together in a manner similar to elements <b>105</b>A and <b>105</b>B as discussed above and shown in the preceding figures. Projecting member <b>470</b> extends into a cavity <b>456</b> defined by walls <b>450</b>. In this example, walls <b>450</b> angle outwardly from the center of cavity <b>456</b> such that additional space within cavity <b>456</b> is available between projecting member <b>470</b> and walls <b>450</b>. This additional space provides for rotation of one supporting element with respect to another that is not substantially parallel to the support plane as described previously. This configuration allows support elements <b>455</b> to rotate out of alignment up defining a rotation angle <b>460</b> providing a maximum displacement shown at <b>465</b> in either direction away from the longitudinal axis <b>475</b> of the assembly. Therefore such additional spacing may or may not be advantageous depending whether and to what extent rotation in other directions away from the plane of rotation is desirable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The displacement <b>465</b> may also be achieved by varying the type of material used to construct support elements <b>105</b>. For example, in the case where support elements are formed as a unitary molded structure using a single material, the support element <b>105</b> and others like it disclosed herein may be constructed of substantially rigid materials such as metal, wood, rigid polymeric materials, and the like. Where rigid materials are used, and the space within cavity <b>456</b> between projecting member <b>470</b> and walls <b>450</b> is small, support elements <b>455</b> can rotate within or parallel to a plane like plane <b>3</b> with little deviation in other directions away from the plane <b>3</b>. Using rigid materials may also provide the ability for external compression forces pushing elements together to be applied longitudinally along or through support elements <b>105</b>. In another example, support elements <b>455</b>, and others like it disclosed herein may be constructed of multiple materials that may be less rigid. Projecting members like projecting member <b>475</b> or <b>107</b> may be constructed of a softer material such as a flexible polymeric material or rubber that can maintain its shape but provides additional flexibility normal to the support plane. The body portion of the support element defining cavity <b>106</b> or <b>456</b> may be constructed of a material that is different from the more flexible material used in projecting member <b>107</b> that may be substantially inflexible such as metal, wood, or a rigid polymeric material. In this way, the extent to which support structures disclosed herein can deviate from the supporting plane may be controlled by the space between the cavity walls and the outer surfaces of the projecting member, by the flexibility of the materials used in molding or assembling the support elements, or by any suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It may also be advantageous to vary the construction and materials used for various elements within a particular support assembly as well with elements in one portion of the assembly allowing for greater freedom of movement in directions other than parallel to the plane of support than the elements in another portion of the assembly. Besides increased freedom of movement, the materials and material properties in the supporting elements may be varied according to various advantageous of the materials. Some materials may be used to form parts of supporting elements <b>105</b>, <b>465</b>, and others like them disclosed herein because these materials are stiffer, stronger, more easily obtained, more resistant to friction caused by movement relative to other elements or parts of elements, and the like. Other materials may be used as well which may not be particularly rigid, but may be used to line load bearing surfaces like <b>450</b>, <b>470</b>, <b>475</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>435</b>, and others like them disclosed herein so as to reduce the negative effects of frictional forces. Therefore, it should not be assumed from the figures and description that supporting elements in a support assembly are each a single piece constructed of only one material.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additional support for an assembly like the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>C</figref> may be achieved by combining multiple projecting members in a single supporting element having multiple receiving cavities. One example of this kind of support assembly is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> where supporting elements <b>480</b> having multiple projecting members <b>487</b> and <b>488</b> extending outwardly away from the supporting elements and received within multiple corresponding receiving cavities <b>490</b> and <b>492</b> respectively. Such a configuration allows the supporting elements <b>480</b> to pivot or rotate with axes of rotation like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with a range of motion similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> with respect to angle <b>415</b>. The double column configuration of projecting members and receiving cavities has the advantage of providing additional support parallel to the supporting plane making the structure stronger and more resistant to bending, flexing, twisting, or otherwise moving in a direction other than substantially parallel to the supporting plane. Similar materials and principles of construction might be used in assembly <b>490</b> as are discussed herein elsewhere that may vary the flexibility or rigidity depending on the application.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Various passageways may be included as well in assembly <b>490</b> such as passageways <b>482</b>, <b>483</b>, <b>484</b>, and <b>485</b> defined by the supporting elements <b>480</b> which may, for example, be used for retention members as discussed herein. Also, a central passageway <b>481</b> may also be defined by supporting elements <b>480</b> configured to pass through the support assembly. In the case where passageways <b>482</b>-<b>485</b> are used for retention members such as retention members like <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, passageway <b>481</b> may be used for protecting and retaining other lines such as tubes, wires, cables, and the like which may serve other purposes related or unrelated to the performance of assembly <b>490</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Another example of assembly <b>100</b> appears in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>. As illustrated, the assembly of elements <b>105</b> may be &#x201c;rigidized&#x201d; by, for example, applying tension to retention member <b>115</b> against a load <b>494</b> coupled directly or indirectly to line <b>115</b>. Tension may be applied to retention member <b>115</b> by, for example, actuator <b>120</b>. As noted previously, actuator <b>120</b> may be any device configured to apply tension to member <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Assembly <b>100</b> may be coupled to another structure or structures here illustrated as structures <b>493</b>A and <b>493</b>B. Any of the elements in assembly <b>100</b> may be coupled to structures <b>493</b>A and <b>493</b>B, such as the first and last elements <b>105</b> in assembly <b>100</b> as shown. Structures <b>493</b>A and <b>493</b>B may be a single structure, or part of a collection of multiple other structures configured to maintain a predetermined separation <b>495</b> from one another regardless of whether tension is applied to line <b>115</b> or not.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Elements <b>105</b> maybe aligned within or substantially parallel to a plane of support as discussed above, but may also be laterally offset creating a nonlinear &#x201c;rigidizable&#x201d; structure. When the tension in line <b>115</b> is low or substantially zero, elements <b>105</b> may move relative to one another. Force may be applied by actuator <b>120</b> to &#x201c;rigidize&#x201d; the assembly by applying tension to the retention member <b>115</b> causing it to exert force on elements <b>105</b> urging them together.

First and second support frames <b>530</b> and <b>535</b> may also be support elements similar to support elements <b>505</b>A-D illustrating that no particular shape, size, or length is required for support elements in a support structure, that all elements in a support structure need not have the same physical dimensions, and that therefore support elements may be of any suitable size shape or configuration.

Supporting elements <b>505</b>A-D include passageways defined within the supporting elements similar to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that allow lines <b>510</b>, <b>515</b>, and <b>520</b> to pass through support assembly <b>500</b>.

This combination of passageways and lines allows projecting members of the support assembly to be retained within receiving cavities of adjacent supporting elements or frame members as described above. Lines <b>510</b>, <b>515</b>, and <b>520</b> may also be coupled to an actuator like actuator <b>120</b> as illustrated, or to another similar actuator described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additional detail for supporting elements <b>505</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Supporting elements <b>505</b> define a receiving cavity <b>706</b> for receiving a projecting member <b>707</b> similar to the way cavity <b>106</b> is configured to receive projecting member <b>107</b> illustrated in the preceding figures and described above. Receiving cavity <b>706</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> like receiving cavity <b>107</b> in the preceding figures with a ovular, semicircular, or substantially circular shape with a surface <b>740</b> contacted or adjacent surface <b>735</b>. As with surface <b>440</b> discussed above, the curvilinear shape of surfaces <b>735</b> and <b>740</b> provides pivotal motion around axis of rotation <b>760</b>, which like axes <b>215</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may be substantially perpendicular to the plane of support <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Like the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, pivotal or rotational movement between elements may be constrained by contact between the surfaces of the supporting elements. For example, supporting element <b>505</b>A may pivot around axis of rotation <b>760</b>A until a first surface <b>720</b>A comes in contact with a second surface <b>725</b>B of supporting element <b>505</b>B. This allows for and angle of rotation <b>715</b> of one element relative to another in the support assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. Angle <b>715</b> may be dependent on angle <b>750</b> defined by second surface <b>725</b> that slopes toward the opposing side of element <b>505</b>A in the direction of first surface <b>720</b>. The sloping second surface <b>725</b> allows one element <b>505</b> to rotate further around axis of rotation <b>760</b> before contacting a first surface <b>720</b> of an adjacent element <b>505</b>. By including this &#x201c;cutout,&#x201d; or angled surface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, supporting elements in the support assembly may rotate further relative to one another resulting in an increased range of motion within or substantially parallel to the supporting plane with the same or fewer supporting elements.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another example of a support assembly like those illustrated in the preceding figures and described above is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. First frame member <b>530</b> and second frame member <b>535</b> are illustrated with retention system that includes first line <b>510</b> and third tension member <b>520</b> arranged and configured as discussed above to further include actuators <b>812</b>A and <b>812</b>B which can operate like actuator <b>120</b> discussed above. Support assembly <b>800</b> includes supporting elements <b>805</b>A-C configured to provide rotational movement for support assembly <b>800</b> parallel to or within supporting plane illustrated by cross sectional lines <b>9</b>.

Actuating devices <b>812</b> A and <b>812</b> B may also include systems or devices for measuring the length of extension of lines <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> like the string potentiometers or other devices discussed above.

Like previous support assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>500</b>, support assembly <b>800</b> has passageways <b>907</b> corresponding with passageway <b>617</b> and <b>627</b> in second support frame <b>535</b> and first support frame <b>530</b> respectively. Passageway <b>905</b> is configured to correspond with passageway <b>615</b> and <b>625</b> of second frame <b>535</b> and first frame <b>530</b> respectively. Likewise, passageway <b>910</b> corresponds with passageway <b>620</b> and <b>630</b> of first and second frames <b>535</b> and <b>530</b>. In this example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, passageway <b>615</b> may be unused and therefore passageways <b>905</b>A through <b>905</b>C may not necessarily be aligned accordingly. Unused passageway <b>615</b>, <b>905</b>, and <b>625</b> allows for additional later cabling or other devices to be inserted through support assembly <b>800</b> such as sensors, or control lines for other equipment or devices that may pass through support assembly <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates additional detail of support assembly <b>800</b>. Support elements <b>805</b> comprise a body <b>1050</b> and a projecting member <b>1055</b> which may be separate and independent units. Following the principals disclosed herein, support element <b>805</b> provides an example of how any support element disclosed herein may be formed as a unitary molded structure from a single substance, or constructed of multiple pieces including the same or different materials with similar or different properties. Projecting members <b>1055</b> may be constructed of a separate material, or of the same material as body <b>1050</b>. In this configuration, supporting elements <b>805</b> are not unitary molded structures but are composed of at least two separate individual pieces <b>1050</b> and <b>1055</b>. For example, body <b>1050</b> may be formed from or may include a rigid polymeric material or metallic material while projecting members <b>1055</b> may be formed from or include a different material that may be less rigid, more rigid, or less susceptible to wear from frictional forces than the material used for body <b>1050</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Supporting elements disclosed herein may also be constructed like element <b>805</b> which may define multiple receiving cavities <b>1060</b> and <b>1065</b> rather than a single receiving cavity. As illustrated projecting member <b>1055</b>A may be received within one of the receiving cavities <b>1065</b>A while another separate projecting member <b>1055</b>B may be received within receiving cavity <b>1060</b>A of supporting element <b>805</b>A and cavity <b>1065</b>B of supporting element <b>805</b>B.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As previously discussed, contacting surfaces of adjacent supporting elements may define the limit of rotation of one element with respect to adjacent elements. A first surface <b>1020</b> and a second service <b>1025</b> contacting one another may constrain pivotal movement of elements <b>805</b>. In this example, body <b>1050</b>A may define an angle of rotation with respect to body <b>1050</b>B illustrated by angle <b>1015</b>. Angle <b>1015</b> corresponds with angle <b>1040</b> which may define the angle at which second surface <b>1025</b> angles toward first surface <b>1020</b>A. Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is first surface <b>1020</b>A which may angle toward second surface <b>1025</b>A according to angle <b>1045</b>. Angles <b>1045</b> may be different angles, or they may be the same as well. As illustrated, greater angles <b>1040</b> and <b>1045</b> may result in further increasing the maximum extent of angle <b>1015</b>. Elements <b>805</b>A and <b>805</b>B and others like them may thus rotate around axes of rotation <b>1030</b>A and <b>1030</b>B within or parallel to supporting plane <b>9</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Illustrated at <b>1100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is another example of a support assembly according to the examples and principals discussed previously and illustrated in the preceding figures.

Coupling elements <b>1104</b> and <b>1106</b> can include projecting members and receiving cavities like those illustrated in any of the previous examples and may be constructed according to the principals discussed herein regarding support segments in a support assembly.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As in previous examples, this arrangement of projecting members and receiving cavities or slots provides for flexibility in support assembly <b>1100</b> in or substantially parallel to a supporting plane <b>11</b> illustrated by section lines <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. Additional support and strength may also be achieved by virtue of connecting segments <b>1125</b>A-C and <b>1120</b>A-D which together couple bracing members <b>1130</b>, <b>1131</b>, <b>1135</b>, and <b>1136</b> to form a support assembly with additional rigidity against flexing supporting assembly <b>1100</b> in a direction other than substantially parallel to supporting plane <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">First support frame <b>1132</b>, second support frame <b>1137</b>, and supporting elements <b>1105</b>A-D can be maintained together by a retention system like those discussed previously that may or may not include actuators coupled to lines such as lines <b>1111</b>, <b>1118</b>, and <b>1121</b> passing through bracing member <b>1131</b>, coupling elements <b>1104</b>A-D, and bracing member <b>1136</b>.

The support elements <b>1120</b> may pivot with respect to one another deflecting away from each other according to angle <b>1315</b>.
