To configure the management service equipment for E2E performance measurements in a 5G network with a plurality of network functions (NFs), the processing circuitry is to decode RAN latency received from a RAN within the 5G network. The RAN latency is associated with transmission of an Internet protocol (IP) packet between a UE and a data network (DN) via the RAN. A user plane function (UPF) latency associated with communication of the IP packet between the RAN and a UPF within the 5G network is determined. A DN latency associated with communication of the IP packet between the UPF and the DN is determined. An E2E performance measurement calculation is performed to determine an E2E latency associated with communicating the IP packet between the UE and the DN based on the RAN latency, the UPF latency, and the DN latency.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="105.92mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="233.43mm" wi="173.06mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="245.28mm" wi="175.18mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="206.50mm" wi="170.43mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="243.76mm" wi="175.26mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="241.72mm" wi="169.33mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="245.36mm" wi="172.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="241.05mm" wi="176.02mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="207.77mm" wi="171.70mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="241.05mm" wi="164.85mm" file="US20230007520A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

With the increase in different types of devices communicating with various network devices, usage of 3GPP LTE systems has increased. The penetration of mobile devices (user equipment or UEs) in modern society has continued to drive demand for a wide variety of networked devices in a number of disparate environments. Fifth generation (5G) wireless systems are forthcoming and are expected to enable even greater speed, connectivity, and usability. Next generation 5G networks (or NR networks) are expected to increase throughput, coverage, and robustness and reduce latency and operational and capital expenditures. 5G-NR networks will continue to evolve based on 3GPP LTE-Advanced with additional potential new radio access technologies (RATS) to enrich people's lives with seamless wireless connectivity solutions delivering fast, rich content and services. As current cellular network frequency is saturated, higher frequencies, such as millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, can be beneficial due to their high bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Potential LTE operation in the unlicensed spectrum includes (and is not limited to) the LTE operation in the unlicensed spectrum via dual connectivity (DC), or DC-based LAA, and the standalone LTE system in the unlicensed spectrum, according to which LTE-based technology solely operates in unlicensed spectrum without requiring an &#x201c;anchor&#x201d; in the licensed spectrum, called MulteFire. MulteFire combines the performance benefits of LTE technology with the simplicity of Wi-Fi-like deployments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further enhanced operation of LTE systems in the licensed as well as unlicensed spectrum is expected in future releases and 5G systems.

The network <b>140</b>A is shown to include user equipment (UE) <b>101</b> and UE <b>102</b>. The UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are illustrated as smartphones (e.g., handheld touchscreen mobile computing devices connectable to one or more cellular networks) but may also include any mobile or non-mobile computing device, such as Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), pagers, laptop computers, desktop computers, wireless handsets, drones, or any other computing device including a wired and/or wireless communications interface. The UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can be collectively referred to herein as UE <b>101</b>, and UE <b>101</b> can be used to perform one or more of the techniques disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Any of the radio links described herein (e.g., as used in the network <b>140</b>A or any other illustrated network) may operate according to any exemplary radio communication technology and/or standard.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">LTE and LTE-Advanced are standards for wireless communications of high-speed data for LTE such as mobile telephones. In LTE-Advanced and various wireless systems, carrier aggregation is a technology according to which multiple carrier signals operating on different frequencies may be used to carry communications for a single UE, thus increasing the bandwidth available to a single device. In some aspects, carrier aggregation may be used where one or more component carriers operate on unlicensed frequencies.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">There are emerging interests in the operation of LTE systems in the unlicensed spectrum. As a result, an important enhancement for LTE in 3GPP Release 13 has been to enable its operation in the unlicensed spectrum via Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA), which expands the system bandwidth by utilizing the flexible carrier aggregation (CA) framework introduced by the LTE-Advanced system. Rel-13 LAA system focuses on the design of downlink operation on unlicensed spectrum via CA, while Rel-14 enhanced LAA (eLAA) system focuses on the design of uplink operation on unlicensed spectrum via CA.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Aspects described herein can be used in the context of any spectrum management scheme including, for example, dedicated licensed spectrum, unlicensed spectrum, (licensed) shared spectrum (such as Licensed Shared Access (LSA) in 2.3-2.4 GHZ, 3.4-3.6 GHz, 3.6-3.8 GHz, and further frequencies and Spectrum Access System (SAS) in 3.55-3.7 GHz and further frequencies).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Aspects described herein can also be applied to different Single Carrier or OFDM flavors (CP-OFDM, SC-FDMA, SC-OFDM, filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC), OFDMA, etc.) and in particular 3GPP NR (New Radio) by allocating the OFDM carrier data bit vectors to the corresponding symbol resources.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some aspects, any of the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can comprise an Internet-of-Things (IoT) UE or a Cellular IoT (CIoT) UE, which can comprise a network access layer designed for low-power IoT applications utilizing short-lived UE connections. In some aspects, any of the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can include a narrowband (NB) IoT UE (e.g., such as an enhanced NB-IoT (eNB-IoT) UE and Further Enhanced (FeNB-IoT) UE). An IoT UE can utilize technologies such as machine-to-machine (M2M) or machine-type communications (MTC) for exchanging data with an MTC server or device via a public land mobile network (PLMN), Proximity-Based Service (ProSe) or device-to-device (D2D) communication, sensor networks, or IoT networks. The M2M or MTC exchange of data may be a machine-initiated exchange of data. An IoT network includes interconnecting IoT UEs, which may include uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices (within the Internet infrastructure), with short-lived connections. The IoT UEs may execute background applications (e.g., keep-alive messages, status updates, etc.) to facilitate the connections of the IoT network.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some aspects, NB-IoT devices can be configured to operate in a single physical resource block (PRB) and may be instructed to retune two different PRBs within the system bandwidth. In some aspects, an eNB-IoT UE can be configured to acquire system information in one PRB, and then it can retune to a different PRB to receive or transmit data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some aspects, any of the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can include enhanced MTC (eMTC) UEs or further enhanced MTC (FeMTC) UEs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> may be configured to connect, e.g., communicatively couple, with a radio access network (RAN) <b>110</b>.

The connection <b>107</b> can comprise a local wireless connection, such as, for example, a connection consistent with any IEEE 802.11 protocol, according to which the AP <b>106</b> can comprise a wireless fidelity (WiFi&#xae;) router. In this example, the AP <b>106</b> is shown to be connected to the Internet without connecting to the core network of the wireless system (described in further detail below).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The RAN <b>110</b> can include one or more access nodes that enable the connections <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. These access nodes (ANs) can be referred to as base stations (BSs), NodeBs, evolved NodeBs (eNBs), Next Generation NodeBs (gNBs), RAN nodes, and the like, and can comprise ground stations (e.g., terrestrial access points) or satellite stations providing coverage within a geographic area (e.g., a cell).

In instances when the communication nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are NodeBs (e.g., eNBs or gNBs), one or more TRPs can function within the communication cell of the NodeBs. The RAN <b>110</b> may include one or more RAN nodes for providing macrocells, e.g., macro RAN node <b>111</b>, and one or more RAN nodes for providing femtocells or picocells (e.g., cells having smaller coverage areas, smaller user capacity, or higher bandwidth compared to macrocells), e.g., low power (LP) RAN node <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Any of the RAN nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> can terminate the air interface protocol and can be the first point of contact for the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. In some aspects, any of the RAN nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> can fulfill various logical functions for the RAN <b>110</b> including, but not limited to, radio network controller (RNC) functions such as radio bearer management, uplink and downlink dynamic radio resource management and data packet scheduling, and mobility management. In an example, any of the nodes <b>111</b> and/or <b>112</b> can be a new generation node-B (gNB), an evolved node-B (eNB), or another type of RAN node.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with some aspects, the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can be configured to communicate using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals with each other or with any of the RAN nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> over a multicarrier communication channel in accordance various communication techniques, such as, but not limited to, an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) communication technique (e.g., for downlink communications) or a Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) communication technique (e.g., for uplink and ProSe for sidelink communications), although such aspects are not required. The OFDM signals can comprise a plurality of orthogonal subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects, a downlink resource grid can be used for downlink transmissions from any of the RAN nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> to the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, while uplink transmissions can utilize similar techniques. The grid can be a time-frequency grid, called a resource grid or time-frequency resource grid, which is the physical resource in the downlink in each slot. Such a time-frequency plane representation may be used for OFDM systems, which makes it applicable for radio resource allocation. Each column and each row of the resource grid may correspond to one OFDM symbol and one OFDM subcarrier, respectively. The duration of the resource grid in the time domain may correspond to one slot in a radio frame. The smallest time-frequency unit in a resource grid may be denoted as a resource element. Each resource grid may comprise a number of resource blocks, which describe the mapping of certain physical channels to resource elements. Each resource block may comprise a collection of resource elements; in the frequency domain, this may, in some aspects, represent the smallest quantity of resources that currently can be allocated. There may be several different physical downlink channels that are conveyed using such resource blocks.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) may carry user data and higher-layer signaling to the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.

It may also inform the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> about the transport format, resource allocation, and H-ARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) information related to the uplink shared channel. Typically, downlink scheduling (assigning control and shared channel resource blocks to the UE <b>102</b> within a cell) may be performed at any of the RAN nodes <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> based on channel quality information fed back from any of the UEs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.

One of the current enablers of IoT is the narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT). NB-IoT has objectives such as coverage extension, UE complexity reduction, long battery lifetime, and backward compatibility with the LTE network. In addition, NB-IoT aims to offer deployment flexibility allowing an operator to introduce NB-IoT using a small portion of its existing available spectrum, and operate in one of the following three modalities: (a) standalone deployment (the network operates in re-farmed GSM spectrum); (b) in-band deployment (the network operates within the LTE channel); and (c) guard-band deployment (the network operates in the guard band of legacy LTE channels). In some aspects, such as with further enhanced NB-IoT (FeNB-IoT), support for NB-IoT in small cells can be provided (e.g., in macrocell, picocell or femtocell deployments). One of the challenges NB-IoT systems face for small cell support is the UL/DL link imbalance, where for small cells the base stations have lower power available compared to macro-cells, and, consequently, the DL coverage can be affected and/or reduced. In addition, some NB-IoT UEs can be configured to transmit at maximum power if repetitions are used for UL transmission. This may result in large inter-cell interference in dense small cell deployments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a simplified diagram of a next generation (NG) system architecture <b>140</b>B in accordance with some aspects.
