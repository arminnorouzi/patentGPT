However, friction dust received on the lower plate segment in the rail unit described above accumulates on the lower plate segment in a dispersed manner. Removing such friction dust from the lower plate segment can take time and effort.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Traveling rails that allow easy removal of friction dust and an article transport facility including such traveling rails are awaited.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A traveling rail according to an aspect of the present disclosure defines a traveling path for an article transport vehicle for transporting an article. The traveling rail includes a rail unit extending in a traveling path direction in which the traveling path extends, and a power feeder that feeds power to a power receiver in the article transport vehicle through contact with the power receiver. The rail unit includes an upper plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a width direction, a lower plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the width direction, and being at a position in a downward direction from the upper plate segment, and an intermediate plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a vertical direction, and joining an edge of the upper plate segment in a first width direction and an edge of the lower plate segment in the first width direction. The width direction is a direction orthogonal to the traveling path direction as viewed in the vertical direction. The width direction includes the first width direction and a second width direction opposite to each other. The power feeder is located in a space defined by the upper plate segment, the intermediate plate segment, and the lower plate segment in the rail unit and extends continuously in the traveling path direction. The upper plate segment includes a traveling surface facing in an upward direction to allow a wheel in the article transport vehicle to roll on the traveling surface. The lower plate segment includes a lower flat portion being a flat plate extending in the traveling path direction and the width direction, and a groove protruding in the downward direction from the lower flat portion and extending continuously in the traveling path direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The structure including the power feeder located in the space defined by the upper plate segment, the intermediate plate segment, and the lower plate segment in the rail unit allows friction dust produced upon contact of the power receiver with the power feeder to be received on the lower plate segment in the rail unit. This structure thus reduces scattering of friction dust around. The lower plate segment includes the lower flat portion and the groove to facilitate friction dust received on the lower plate segment to accumulate in the groove. This structure thus reduces scattering of friction dust from the traveling rail and also allows easy removal of friction dust accumulating on the lower plate segment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An article transport facility according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes a first traveling rail being the traveling rail according to the above aspect, a second traveling rail spaced apart from the first traveling rail in the second width direction, and wiring extending continuously in the traveling path direction. The second traveling rail includes a rail unit. The rail unit includes a second upper plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a width direction, a second lower plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the width direction, and being at a position in the downward direction from the second upper plate segment, and a second intermediate plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the vertical direction, and joining an edge of the second upper plate segment in the second width direction and an edge of the second lower plate segment in the second width direction. The second upper plate segment includes a second traveling surface facing in the upward direction to allow a wheel in the article transport vehicle to roll on the second traveling surface. The second lower plate segment includes a second lower flat portion being a flat plate extending in the traveling path direction and the width direction, and a second groove protruding in the downward direction from the second lower flat portion and extending continuously in the traveling path direction. The wiring is located in the second groove.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The structure allows the article transport vehicle to travel along the first traveling rail and the second traveling rail to transport an article. The wiring in the second groove on the second traveling rail is less likely to move in the width direction. The second traveling rail has the same structure as the first traveling rail and includes the second upper plate segment, the second lower plate segment, and the second intermediate plate segment. The first traveling rail and the second traveling rail can thus be formed from members with the same cross section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an article transport facility according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a second traveling rail in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a first traveling rail in another embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">1.

The traveling rail includes a rail unit extending in a traveling path direction in which the traveling path extends, and a power feeder that feeds power to a power receiver in the article transport vehicle through contact with the power receiver. The rail unit includes an upper plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a width direction, a lower plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the width direction, and being at a position in a downward direction from the upper plate segment, and an intermediate plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a vertical direction, and joining an edge of the upper plate segment in a first width direction and an edge of the lower plate segment in the first width direction. The width direction is a direction orthogonal to the traveling path direction as viewed in the vertical direction. The width direction includes the first width direction and a second width direction opposite to each other. The power feeder is located in a space defined by the upper plate segment, the intermediate plate segment, and the lower plate segment in the rail unit and extends continuously in the traveling path direction. The upper plate segment includes a traveling surface facing in an upward direction to allow a wheel in the article transport vehicle to roll on the traveling surface. The lower plate segment includes a lower flat portion being a flat plate extending in the traveling path direction and the width direction, and a groove protruding in the downward direction from the lower flat portion and extending continuously in the traveling path direction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The structure including the power feeder located in the space defined by the upper plate segment, the intermediate plate segment, and the lower plate segment in the rail unit allows friction dust produced upon contact of the power receiver with the power feeder to be received on the lower plate segment in the rail unit. This structure reduces scattering of friction dust around. The lower plate segment includes the lower flat portion and the groove to facilitate friction dust received on the lower plate segment to accumulate in the groove. This structure thus reduces scattering of friction dust from the traveling rail and allows easy removal of friction dust accumulating on the lower plate segment.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The groove may have a groove surface facing in the upward direction, and the groove surface may include a lowermost portion at a position in the second width direction from a contact position of the power feeder with the power receiver.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">This structure allows any friction dust produced at the contact position between the power feeder and the power receiver to be received in the groove.

This structure also allows passage of air between the power feeder and the lower plate segment, thus facilitating heat dissipation from the power feeder.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The power feeder may be supported on the intermediate plate segment.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this structure, the power feeder may be spaced apart from the lower plate segment in the upward direction.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The groove may fully overlap the upper plate segment as viewed in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">This structure reduces the likelihood of dust produced above the upper plate segment entering the space defined by the upper plate segment, the intermediate plate segment, and the lower plate segment, and thus reduces accumulation of dust in the groove after being produced outside the space.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A cross section of the groove orthogonal to the traveling path direction may have an arc shape with a central angle of less than 180&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this structure, the cross section of the groove has an arc shape with a central angle of less than 180&#xb0;, thus allowing the groove to be relatively shallow. This shape allows easy removal of friction dust accumulating in the groove.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The intermediate plate segment may be fixed to a reinforcement reinforcing the rail unit, and may have a surface in the first width direction being in contact with the reinforcement.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this structure, the intermediate plate segment that is a plate extending in the vertical direction is fixed to the reinforcement and has its surface in the first width direction being in contact with the reinforcement, thus allowing the reinforcement to properly reinforce the rail unit.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The rail unit may further include a flange. The flange may be a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the vertical direction. The flange may extend in the downward direction from an edge of the upper plate segment in the second width direction. The flange may include a guide surface to allow a guide wheel in the article transport vehicle to roll on the guide surface.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this structure, the flange in the rail unit has the guide surface. The rail unit can guide the guide wheel in the article transport vehicle in the traveling path direction. Further, the flange extends in the downward direction from the edge of the upper plate segment in the second width direction. The upper plate segment with the traveling surface can easily be highly durable.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">An arc-shaped curved portion as viewed in the traveling path direction may be at a joint between the upper plate segment and the intermediate plate segment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">This structure includes the curved portion at the joint. The upper plate segment with the traveling surface can thus easily be highly durable. For an article to slide on the upper surface of the upper plate segment from a position in the first width direction toward a position in the second width direction, the article is less likely to be stuck on the surface.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">An article transport facility includes a first traveling rail being the traveling rail, a second traveling rail spaced apart from the first traveling rail in the second width direction, and wiring extending continuously in the traveling path direction. The second traveling rail includes a rail unit. The rail unit includes a second upper plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in a width direction, a second lower plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the width direction, and being at a position in the downward direction from the second upper plate segment, and a second intermediate plate segment being a plate extending continuously in the traveling path direction and extending in the vertical direction, and joining an edge of the second upper plate segment in the second width direction and an edge of the second lower plate segment in the second width direction. The second upper plate segment includes a second traveling surface facing in the upward direction to allow a wheel in the article transport vehicle to roll on the second traveling surface. The second lower plate segment includes a second lower flat portion being a flat plate extending in the traveling path direction and the width direction, and a second groove protruding in the downward direction from the second lower flat portion and extending continuously in the traveling path direction. The wiring is located in the second groove.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">This structure allows the article transport vehicle to travel along the first traveling rail and the second traveling rail to transport an article. The wiring located in the second groove on the second traveling rail is less likely to move in the width direction. The second traveling rail has the same structure as the first traveling rail and includes the second upper plate segment, the second lower plate segment, and the second intermediate plate segment. The first traveling rail and the second traveling rail can thus be formed from members with the same cross section.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The technique according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can be used for a traveling rail including a rail unit and a power feeder, and for an article transport facility including the traveling rail.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><b>1</b> article transport vehicle</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><b>2</b> first traveling rail (traveling rail)</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><b>3</b> second traveling rail</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><b>18</b> wheel</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><b>20</b> power receiver</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><b>23</b> power feeder</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><b>26</b> first upper plate segment (upper plate segment)</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><b>27</b> first lower plate segment (lower plate segment)</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><b>27</b>A first lower flat portion (lower flat portion)</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><b>27</b>B first groove (groove)</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><b>28</b> first intermediate plate segment (intermediate plate segment)</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><b>29</b> first flange (flange)</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><b>30</b> curved portion</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><b>36</b> second upper plate segment</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><b>37</b> second lower plate segment</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><b>37</b>A second lower flat portion</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><b>37</b>B second groove</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><b>38</b> second intermediate plate segment</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><b>41</b> reinforcement</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><b>44</b> wiring</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">F<b>1</b> first traveling surface (traveling surface)</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">F<b>2</b> first guide surface (guide surface)</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">F<b>3</b> first groove surface (groove surface)</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">F<b>4</b> second traveling surface</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">S space</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">W article</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">X traveling path direction</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Y width direction</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Y<b>1</b> first width direction</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Y<b>2</b> second width direction</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Z vertical direction</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Z<b>1</b> upward direction</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Z<b>2</b> downward direction</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
