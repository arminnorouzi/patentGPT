In other applications, silica silylate has been included into cosmetics for properties including emollient, binder, thickening agent, and can also help prevent foam formation. Silica silylate is typically characterized as being synthetic, hydrophobic, and thixotropic compound that is commonly used as a thickening agent. As recognized in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/810,356, the external surface characteristics of a sports ball may be augmented or enhanced by the application of silica silylate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ability to apply a compound such as silica silylate to an external surface of a sports ball provides its own challenges. The application of a coating to a ball, especially when used by professional teams, requires repeatability and consistency. For instance, it is approximated that 900 thousand baseballs are used by Major League Baseball per year&#x2014;30 thousand per team. Of the 900 thousand baseballs used by Major League Baseball per year, 200 thousand are used for games at a rate of 80-120 balls per game. Major league players and other stakeholders require consistency in a sports ball to maintain consistency in performance. And while players of a sport do not require the same consistency of product expected by professional level sports such as in Major League Baseball, they may prefer to play the sport with the same quality product as played by the highest level of their sport. Thus, there is a current need for devices and methods for the consistent and repeatable application of silica silylate, or other siloxane polymers, to the external surface of a sports ball.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The application of silica silylate to an exterior surface of a sports ball involves a number of steps dependent upon the level of consistency and repeatability desired. Although the present invention surrounds the application of silica silylate to the exterior of a sports ball, the use of an alternate siloxane polymer or other hydrophobic or oleophilic particles, or the application of such compounds to alternate surfaces not discussed herein for similar benefit are within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an aspect of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide methods, devices, and systems for the surface treatment of sports balls with silica silylate wherein the surface treatment resulting in surface characteristics which are substantially homogeneous around the entirety of the surface of the individual sports ball. Furthermore, it is an aspect of certain embodiments presented herein that the surface characteristics of a plurality of sports balls comprise substantially homogenous surface characteristics following surface treatment wherein the surface treatment of each ball is essentially identical and repeatable within a prescribed margin of error based on physical property testing protocols.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an aspect of certain embodiments of the present invention to monitor the surface treatment process of a singular sports ball or a plurality of sports balls being treated in a batch quantity to ensure that each sports ball receives the same surface treatment with relation to consumable or reusable media. Such media refers to, but is not limited to, silica silylate, abrasive media (such as plastic beads or ceramic rods), and distributing media used for even distribution of silica silylate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a method for providing silica silylate surface treatment for individual sports balls intended for mass manufacture and delivery to individual users. Certain embodiments, well-suited for mass manufacture and delivery to everyday consumers, involve a user applied method wherein the user is provided with a predetermined amount of granulized or powdered silica silylate with instructions as to how to apply the silica silylate to the surface of the sports ball. Certain embodiments provide an applicator such as a glove or swatch of cloth having specific characteristic suited for applying and/or removing silica silylate, while other embodiments provide a method of agitating the ball to ensure a more homogenous and consistent application of the silica silylate to the exterior surface of the ball. Certain embodiments, also well suited for use by everyday consumers, involves the use of a container in which a sports ball is placed with a predetermined amount of silica silylate prior to sealing, wherein the user agitates the container with the sports ball therein to apply silica silylate to the external surface of the sports ball. Such embodiments which comprise a sealed container for agitation are reusable for reapplication of the silica silylate after a period of time or use wherein the benefits of the surface treatment of the silica silylate have diminished.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In is an aspect of further embodiments of the present invention to provide surface treatment methods, systems, and devices for treating the surface of multiple sports balls at a time with silica silylate. Certain embodiments of the present invention comprise methods, systems, and devices configured for a semi-automated process in which the sports balls are placed individually or in a batch into equipment which provides the silica silylate and agitating action. The agitation can be provided through use of vibrational aspects or tumbling action of the equipment. While in certain embodiments the agitation can be accomplished with only silica silylate, alternate embodiments comprise a mixing media to increase surface treatment. Such mixing media promotes even coating through abrasion and mechanical deposition during the treatment process. Abrasion of certain embodiments is used for surface preparation, even coating of silica silylate, as well as eliminating buildup of silica silylate on portions of a sports ball such as on the stitching sports balls such as baseballs and footballs. Mixing media may also be used to force silica silylate particles into gaps in the surface of a sports ball, such as into the fibers of the laces of football or the stitching of a baseball, causing the laces/stitching to become harder and more pronounced. Such mixing media may also be used to decrease the cycle time needed to achieve a prescribed surface treatment level.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, it is an aspect of certain embodiments to allow the treatment of sports balls used in differing environments in a manner that provides a consistent surface treatment result substantially agnostic to the ambient environment at the location of treatment. Certain embodiments of the present invention comprise methods, systems, and devices for the pre-process and post-process storage of sports balls after exterior surfaces have been treated with silica silylate. When stored pre-process or post-process, certain embodiments provide controls to the environment. Sports balls rested in a high humidity or high temperature environment after treatment with silica silylate may exhibit different post-process surface characteristics than when stored in a low temperature or low humidity environment. By providing a prescribed atmosphere in which the sports balls are processed, the resulting surface characteristics will not be affected or differ due to geographic location or ambient environmental differences.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, silica silylate is used to treat the surface of sports balls in a sealed vessel wherein the sealed vessel allows for the adjustment and variation of pressure. In certain embodiments is it preferred to employ a negative pressure within a sealed vessel for the treatment of the exterior surface of the sports balls with silica silylate, while alternative embodiments it is preferred to employ a positive pressure within the sealed vessel for the treatment of the exterior surface of the sports balls with silica silylate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an aspect of certain embodiments to treat the external surface of a sports ball with silica silylate while mitigating potential damage to the external surface of the sports ball. In certain embodiments, silica silylate is applied through a spraying process in which a silica silylate powder is aerosolized or sprayed in a treatment chamber in which a sports ball is passed through. In certain embodiments, the sports ball is pretreated with a compound prior to passing through the chamber to maximize the adhesion of the silylate powder to the sports ball when passing through the treatment chamber.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The use of silica silylate in a nanoparticle form, microparticle form, and/or fine particle form are within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Nanoparticles refer to particles of matter between about 1 and 100 nanometers in diameter, fine particles refer to particles of matter between about 100 and 2500 nanometers in diameter, and microparticles refer to particles of matter between about 1 and 1000 micrometers in diameter. In alternative embodiments, other forms of aerogel or other hydrophobic or oleophilic particles may be used with or in the place of silica silylate. References to silica silylate herein may also refer to such other forms of aerogel or other hydrophobic or oleophilic particles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an aspect of the present invention to positively track the exterior surface treatment of a sports ball. The positive tracking of the treatment of sports ball provides an increased level of quality assurance. The positive tracking of the surface treatment of a sports ball ensures that steps are not skipped, and steps are not duplicated for each sports ball. Therefore, each sports ball undergoes an identical surface treatment process providing a higher level of quality assurance and quality standards ensuring a consistent final product.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is an aspect of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a consistent and repeatable product through the limitation of human interaction and human control of a system which is used for the surface treatment of a sports ball. In certain embodiments, a system for the surface treatment of a sports ball limits the human control wherein security protocols restrict the use of the system and the insertion of sports balls into the system. In certain embodiments security protocols restrict the removal of sports balls from the system such that only authorized personnel are permitted to access the sports balls post-process to mitigate tampering with the sports balls prior to use in play.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Silica silylate dust&#x2014;particularly in finer powder form&#x2014;reduces the reliability of mechanical systems. It is an aspect of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide proper dust collection and dust mitigation surrounding the treatment of sports balls with silica silylate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is an aspect of certain embodiments of the present invention to mitigate static charge levels which may prevent the bonding of silica silylate to sports balls or other objects being treated for surface augmentation with silica silylate. It may be desired in certain embodiments to employ methods including improved grounding, introduction of ionized air, increased moisture, increased localized humidity, and the introduction of polyethylene glycol.
