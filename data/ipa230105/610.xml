More recently, catheters have been used for replacement of heart valves, in particular, the aortic valve in a procedure sometimes known as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). TAVI is now the principal therapeutic option in patients with severe aortic stenosis deemed inoperable or at high surgical risk. Over 300,000 TAVI procedures were performed worldwide in 2018, and the mortality benefits of TAVI in inoperable and high-risk surgical patients have been recognised. However, the benefit of TAVI is attenuated by the occurrence of major disabling stroke which is associated with increased mortality and in the short term reduced quality of life. During TAVI, extensive manipulation of the calcified native valve and aortic wall takes place using large-sized catheters and rigid delivery systems. Subsequently, balloon valvuloplasty, positioning and implanting of the valve, and possibly post- dilation, takes place. Consequently, dislodgement and embolization of aortic debris and crushed calcified native valves seems inevitable and can provoke stroke by reaching brain vessels.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embolic protection devices, also known as embolic filters, have been developed to reduce the risk of stroke by providing an efficient protection of the entire brain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need to provide for improved embolic filter devices having improved filtering capabilities whilst maintaining good anchoring on the vessel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect there is provided an embolic filter comprising: a support frame; and a porous polymeric membrane covering the support frame, wherein the embolic filter is configured to be movable between a collapsed state and a deployed state where the filter extends, in use, into contact with an inner wall of a patient's vasculature, wherein the support frame comprises a shape memory material such that the support frame acts as a deployment arrangement to move the embolic filter from the collapsed state into the deployed state.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The support frame may comprise a shape memory alloy or a shape memory polymer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embolic filter may comprise a nitinol support frame.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The support frame may comprise a neck portion configured to conform to an external surface of a catheter body, in use.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The support frame may comprise a plurality of flexible petals extending from said neck portion, and wherein a distal end of each of the flexible petals are configured, in use, to contact with an inner wall of a patient's vasculature when in the deployed state.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The support frame may be formed from a laser cut nitinol frame.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The embolic filter may comprise an internal leaflet extending across an interior of the support frame and configured and arranged to define the neck portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The support frame may define an inlet region at an upstream end of the embolic filter that is covered with the porous polymeric membrane, and wherein said inlet region tapers towards a neck portion of the support frame, e.g. so as to define a substantially conical inlet region.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The support frame may define an elongate body comprising first and second end regions thereof each region configured, in use, to contact with an inner wall of a patient's vasculature when in the deployed state.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The elongate body may comprise an external surface, said external surface comprising a narrower region between the first and second end regions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This narrower central region provides an external &#x2018;hourglass&#x2019; shape that provides a reduced area of contact with a wall of a patient's vasculature, which can help to prevent calcification from being dislodged.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A first end or region of the porous polymeric membrane may be attachable to a body of a delivery catheter, in use.

The embolic filter assembly <b>10</b> is a combined delivery catheter and embolic filter located within the aorta <b>12</b> of a patient. In the illustrated embodiment, the delivery catheter may be considered to be a TAVI delivery catheter, and the embodiment is described with reference to a TAVI procedure. It will be appreciated, however, that in alternative embodiments the delivery catheter may be used for different valve replacement procedures, or may be used in the placement of an intravascular stent. The features of the aorta include the ascending aorta <b>14</b>, the arch of aorta <b>16</b>, the descending aorta <b>18</b>, the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>,<b>22</b>, the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. Not shown is the aortic valve which is to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The embolic filter assembly <b>10</b> comprises a delivery catheter <b>30</b> and an embolic filter <b>32</b>. The delivery catheter <b>30</b> is a TAVI delivery catheter. The delivery catheter <b>30</b> may, by way of illustrative example only, correspond to the Medtronic EnVeo PRO&#x2122; delivery catheter system. The delivery catheter <b>30</b> includes an elongate catheter body <b>31</b> having a distal tip <b>33</b>. The delivery catheter <b>30</b> further includes a capsule (not shown) containing a replacement valve. The filter <b>32</b> is provided circumferentially around an outer surface of the delivery catheter <b>30</b> and extends across the annulus defined the between the delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the wall <b>34</b> of the ascending aorta <b>14</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the filter <b>32</b> is configured so as to be able to conform to the wall <b>34</b> of the ascending aorta <b>14</b> and thus provide required sealing characteristics against the wall of ascending aorta <b>14</b>. As will also be described in greater detail below, the filter <b>32</b> is provided with a high porosity membrane that doesn't restrict blood flow but at the same time provides the desired filtering characteristics to capture any debris <b>36</b> that may be dislodged by the TAVI procedure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment shown, the filter <b>32</b> is positioned in the ascending aorta <b>14</b> downstream of the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and upstream of the arch of aorta <b>16</b>. Any debris <b>36</b> that may be dislodged by the TAVI procedure is thus captured by the filter <b>32</b> and prevented from reaching and entering the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. It will be appreciated that the filter <b>32</b> may alternatively be positioned in the arch of the aorta <b>14</b> and downstream of the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>,<b>22</b> and upstream of the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>.
