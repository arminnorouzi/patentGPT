There are many types of known casting processes, for example, high pressure die casting, low pressure casting, and squeeze casting. The die is typically formed of a hardened tool steel.

For example, an aluminum alloy capable of forming a component having higher ductility, without loss of fluidity or castability, is desired.

Examples of such components include structural, body-in-white, suspension, or chassis components. The aluminum alloy provides a component with improved ductility and elongation, and without hot tearing or loss of fluidity or castability. The aluminum alloy is also less expensive than other aluminum alloys used for casting, which is especially beneficial for high volume production.

The aluminum alloy also includes an amount of silicon (Si), which helps achieve improved castability of the aluminum alloy and thus reduces a scrap rate and reduces costs. Besides the large amount of silicon eutectic phase, the elongation of the component formed of the aluminum alloy is typically 5% to 8%. The castability, strength, and toughness of the aluminum alloy can also be adjusted based on the amount of silicon.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional alloying elements can also be present in the improved aluminum alloy to further improve elongation and ductility, or to achieve the desired strength and toughness. For example, magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and/or iron (Fe) can be added to further improve ductility, castability, strength, ductility, and/or toughness. In particular, the manganese can be used to prevent die sticking, and the magnesium can be used to form Mg<sub>2</sub>Si for strengthening. The aluminum alloy can also include at least one of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) to increase strength, preferably without negatively impacting corrosion resistance. The zinc is also used as a solid solution strengthener and to improve machinability. The additional alloying elements can provide other metallurgical effects as well, such as improved resistance to hot cracking, soldering, shrinkage, and corrosion. Strontium (Sr) can also be added to modify properties that occur due to the silicon.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a first example embodiment, in addition to at least 80 wt. % aluminum, the aluminum alloy includes 6.0 to 8.0 wt. % silicon, 1.0 to 2.0 wt. % zinc, 0.05 to 0.3 wt. % magnesium, less than 0.05 wt. % copper, 0.2 wt. % to 0.4 wt. % manganese, less than 0.25 wt. % iron, and 0.03 wt. % to 0.08 wt. % strontium, based on the total weight of the aluminum alloy.

The method of forming the cast component typically begins by melting the aluminum alloy. Any casting process used to form components, for example high pressure die casting, low pressure casting, or squeeze casting. In one example embodiment, the casting process is a die casting process, which typically includes forcing the molten aluminum alloy into an unheated die or mold cavity under pressure. The die is typically formed from hardened tool steel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">After the casting the aluminum alloy of example 1 (Aural 5M) and after either artificial age (T5 temper) or exposing the cast aluminum alloy to a body shop paint bake cycle, the cast aluminum alloy has a yield strength of at least 100 to 120 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of at least 180 MPa, and an elongation of 5% to 7%. The cast Aural 5M in the as-cast (F temper) condition has a yield strength of at least 105 MPa to 110 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of at least 180 MPa, and an elongation of 8% to 15%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">An example of the aluminum alloy of the second example embodiment, Aural 5R, has a higher amount of recycled (secondary materials). After casting, the aluminum alloy is either artificially aged (T5 temper) or exposed to a body shop paint bake cycle, and thus the cast aluminum alloy has a yield strength of at least 140 to 150 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 270 MPa, and an elongation of 5% to 7%.

The cast Aural 5R in the solution, forced air quench (4&#xb0; C./sec) and artificially age (T7 temper) condition has a yield strength of at least 125 MPa to 130 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 200 MPa, and an elongation of 8% to 10%.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">The aluminum alloy according to example embodiments provides for exceptional mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, rivetability, and castability. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the mechanical properties of the aluminum alloy of example 1 (Aural 5M) relative to a comparative aluminum alloy (Aural 5S). The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation are tested using ASTM E8/E8M-21 (Standard Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bending curve (load v. extension) comparing the aluminum alloy of example 1 (Aural 5M) to the comparative aluminum alloy (Aural 5S).

The test method used to obtain the bending curve is an adaptation based on a German Association of the Automotive Industry or VDA standard VDA 238-100 (Plate bending test for metallic materials). The VDA 238-100 standard is for 2.0 mm thick wrought products (sheet, etc.). Thus, the test is adapted to include castings. A correction factor is applied if the casting thickness is above 2.0 mm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the results of a rivetability test comparing the aluminum alloy of example 1 (Aural 5M) to the comparative aluminum alloy (Aural 5S). The rivetability test included applying a self-piercing rivet to the aluminum alloy of example 1 (Aural 5M) and the comparative aluminum alloy (Aural 5S). The self-piercing rivet is a single-step technique which includes using a semi-tubular rivet to clinch sheets of the aluminum alloy together. The sheets are clamped between a die and blankholder, and the rivet is driven into the sheets between a punch and a die. The rivet pierces the top sheet and the die shape causes the rivet to flare within the lower sheet to form a mechanical interlock. The die shape causes a button to form on the underside of the tower sheet. Preferably, the rivet tail does not pierce though the button</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">Both the Aural 2R and Aural 5R compositions exhibit good corrosion resistance when subjected to a salt spray test for 100 hours according to ASTM B117-16 (Standard Practice for Operating Salt Spray (Fog) Apparatus).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The cast component 10 formed from the casting step can be, for example, a component for use in a vehicle. The molten aluminum is formed to a solid component having the shape of the mold, which can be a complex shape. Many different types of components can be formed by the casting process, for example, a structural, body-in-white, suspension, or chassis component. After the casting process, the method can include an optional heat treating process or other finishing processes. However, it has been found that a heat treatment process may not be necessary when the component is formed from the improved aluminum alloy, which would provide the advantage of reduced process time and costs.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">Generally, it takes up to 95 percent less energy to recycle than to produce primary aluminum, which reduces the carbon footprint of the foundries. The aluminum alloys of the present invention which include high amounts of recycled material, known as Aural 2R and Aural 5R (R=high amt of recycled material), will utilize both recycled clean crushed road wheels as well as wrought aluminum stamping offal. Development of these green aluminum alloys, using secondary recycled aluminum for BIW and structural components, will allow for both less cost of raw material, and a lower carbon footprint while still meeting stringent automotive industry standards. The cast components formed of the aluminum alloys have good rivetability and castability.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described while within the scope of the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
