However, the sensors of autonomous vehicles are often obstructed or otherwise unable to detect certain regions surrounding the agent, resulting in &#x201c;blind spots&#x201d; which can cause a high-level uncertainty in the agent's understanding of its environment. Conventional systems and methods typically account for this by prescribing overly cautious behavior for the agent in these scenarios, such as coming to a stop or proceeding very slowly. Not only is this behavior inefficient (e.g., slow, overly cautious, requiring the vehicle to come to a stop, etc.) and often frustrating to surrounding drivers, it can also be dangerous in an event that the agent acts in an unexpected way to other drivers, such as coming to a stop in an intersection. Further, maintaining a set of programmed rules and/or behaviors in response to explicitly detecting these blind spots is difficult and often computationally expensive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the autonomous vehicle field to create an improved and useful system and method for operating an autonomous agent with an incomplete understanding of its environment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic of a system for operating an autonomous agent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic of a method for operating an autonomous agent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> depict a schematic variation of operating an autonomous agent in a first conflict zone at a set of time points.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a schematic variation of operating an autonomous agent in a second conflict zone.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a schematic variation of an autonomous agent in its environment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a schematic variation of a visible region and a set of blind regions of an autonomous agent in its environment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a schematic variation of a method for operating an autonomous agent.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a schematic variation of at least a portion of a method and/or system for operating an autonomous agent.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>E</figref> depict an example implementation of a method for operating an autonomous agent.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these preferred embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">1.

Benefits</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The system and method for operating an autonomous agent with incomplete environmental information can confer several benefits over current systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a first variation, the technology confers the benefit of enabling an autonomous agent to operate with incomplete environmental information without requiring the autonomous agent to drive overly cautious manner, in an unnatural manner, in a dangerous manner, and/or otherwise less optimally, which can be bothersome, disruptive, and potentially dangerous to other vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians in the autonomous agent's environment. In examples, the system and/or method enables the ego vehicle to drive in an optimal way through the inclusion of virtual objects (equivalently referred to herein as phantom objects/agents, hypothetical objects/agents, ghost objects/agents, etc.) in planning or trajectory generation of the autonomous agent. In specific examples, the autonomous agent operates as if these virtual objects were real.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the technology can confer the benefit of optimizing the response of the ego vehicle to an incomplete environmental representation by selecting parameters for the virtual objects which are reasonable for the virtual objects to have (e.g., based on physics/dynamics principles, historical information, a situational awareness/understanding of how known objects in the ego vehicle's environment are behaving, statistics and/or probabilities, etc.) rather than, for instance, selecting all predetermined and/or most dangerous parameters for each virtual object, which can result in the ego vehicle being stopped (e.g., &#x201c;getting stuck,&#x201d; not progressing toward a goal, not moving, etc.), driving in dangerous and/or confusing ways to other drivers (e.g., slamming on the brakes despite there not being an object present), and/or otherwise driving in non-optimal ways.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally or alternatively, the technology can enable and/or encourage the ego vehicle to operate in ways which helps the ego vehicle collect (e.g., with its sensors) more information about its environment (e.g., determine whether or not an object is actually present in a blind region), and thereby enable the ego vehicle to operate in efficient, safe, and/or otherwise optimal ways (e.g., not being stopped for long periods of time).

This can function, for instance, to prevent scenarios which result in the ego vehicle getting &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; (e.g., stopped for a long period of time and unable to proceed forward, stopped for a long period of time at a static blind spot, etc.); driving in ways which are surprising and/or dangerous to other drivers (e.g., slamming on the brakes for no actual reason, etc.); driving in overly conservative ways; and/or otherwise operating non-optimally.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Any or all of the analyses to determine a set of likelihoods can take into account any or all of the following information (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>): detected information (e.g., sensor information, if the ego vehicle can detect regions proximal to the blind region, supplementary information, etc.); historical information (e.g., how long that the blind region has been a blind region, how many known objects were present previously vs. are present now, whether or not a known object has disappeared from the environmental representation, whether or not a known object has suddenly appeared in the environmental representation, etc.); aggregated information (e.g., from other sensor systems, from supplementary sensor systems, from an aggregated set of ego vehicles previously on the road, from an aggregated set of ego vehicles currently on the road, etc.); parameters and/or behaviors associated with the known objects (e.g., how fast they are traveling, if they are driving cautiously, etc.); how the ego vehicle's environment has changed over time; and/or any other information.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In specific examples, for instance, determining the virtual object's presence and/or any or all of its parameters can depend on any or all of: for what duration of time the blind region has existed (e.g., wherein if it has persisted for longer than a threshold, it is likely caused by a static object such as a lamp post or parked vehicle; wherein if it has persisted for longer than a threshold and no known object has entered or emerged from it, it likely has no object or a static object or a slow-moving object; etc.); how much of the blind region's immediate surroundings can be confidently detected (e.g., wherein if the ego vehicle can see around a blind region and also knows that in the previous time step no known object was near it, then there is likely no virtual object in the blind region; wherein if the ego vehicle can see around a blind region and also knows that in the previous time step a known object was near it and has since disappeared, then that known object with its previous parameters is likely present in the blind region, etc.); whether or not the number of known objects in the ego vehicle's environment has changed over time (e.g., wherein if a known object disappears proximal to where a blind region appears, that known object is likely in a blind region; wherein if a known object suddenly appears proximal to where a blind region is or was, then there is probably not an object currently in the blind region; etc.); historical information; the behavior and/or parameters associated with known objects (e.g., where if a known object is driving at a high speed toward a blind region, then there is likely no object in the blind region); conventions and/or traffic rules for that area (e.g., where if a known object is not maintaining a predetermined minimum stopping distance while behind a blind region, then there is a low probability that there is an object in the blind region; etc.); and/or any other information.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In a preferred set of variations, the analyses are performed with a set of probabilistic models, algorithms, and/or equations (e.g., untrained and/or unlearned models, trained and/or learned models, rule-based models, programmed models, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, any or all of the analyses can be performed with trained and/or learned models (e.g., machine learning models, deep learning models, etc.), statistical processes, decision trees, hard-coded logic, and/or any other tools.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Additionally or alternatively, any or all of the parameter values can be predetermined (e.g., based on a speed limit associated with the ego vehicle's location, constant, etc.), dynamically determined, determined based on historical information (e.g., the average speed at which vehicles travel in that area, the highest speed at which vehicles have traveled in that area, etc.), and/or otherwise suitably determined.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For instance, S<b>230</b> can optionally include selecting a set of parameters and/or features associated with the virtual object(s). The parameters and/or features can optionally be configured to take into account a set of worst-case or otherwise potentially serious scenarios, such that the most conservative (potentially dangerous) option (e.g., largest size, closest location relative to ego agent, highest speed, etc.) for virtual object is selected. The worst-case scenarios can be determined based on any or all of: historical data, simulated data, aggregated data, and/or any other information. The features and/or parameters can additionally or alternatively be selected to not necessarily result in the worst-case scenario (e.g., which might result in overly cautious behavior of the ego agent) but rather fall within a spectrum of realistic worst-case scenarios (e.g., as described above, based on any of the information described above, etc.), such that extremely unlikely worst-case scenarios are ignored, as they would result in overly cautious and/or otherwise potentially disruptive behaviors for the ego agent.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The parameters and/or features can include, for instance, any or all of: a location of the obstacle relative to the ego agent, a speed of the obstacle, an acceleration of the obstacle, a behavior and/or intent of the obstacle, a size of the obstacle, a location of an agent virtual object within a lane of the road (e.g., in the middle of the lane, on an edge of the lane such as an edge closest to the ego agent, weaving within the lane, etc.), and/or any other parameters and/or features. In some variations, for instance, the virtual object is placed at a location which is any or all of: closest to the ego vehicle (e.g., the lane edge closest to the ego vehicle); closest to where the ego vehicle will be once the ego vehicle and the virtual object would enter a conflict zone and/or other high-risk scenario; most likely (e.g., based on road geometry, driving conventions, based on the locations of known objects, etc.); any combination; and/or otherwise located.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In specific examples, for instance, conservative parameters and/or features for the virtual object can include any or all of: a maximum speed (e.g., the speed limit, 5 mph above the speed limit, an average amount over the speed limit for that roadway, etc.), a closest proximity to the ego agent, a riskiest behavior (e.g., high acceleration, sudden braking, weaving in and out of a lane, etc.), and/or any other parameters/features.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Selecting the virtual object preferably includes selecting a type of virtual object, wherein the types of virtual objects can include, for instance, any or all of: a vehicle/agent (e.g., 4-wheeled vehicle, sedan, van, limousine, school bus or other bus, autonomous vs. manual vehicle, etc.), a bicycle (e.g., manual bike, electric bike, motorcycle, vespa, scooter, etc.), a pedestrian (e.g., walking pedestrian, running pedestrian, pedestrian with a strollers, etc.), static objects (e.g., traffic cones, other obstacles, etc.), and/or any other objects.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A virtual object can optionally be determined based on an actual object. In some variations, for instance, a virtual object can be selected which functions to track one or more real objects. In a specific example, for instance, a virtual object having features corresponding to (e.g., of the same type, make, model, speed of travel, etc.) a real object is selected and placed such that it replaces a known object which has become &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; to the ego agent (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>). The virtual object can then optionally be removed once the real object is visible to the ego agent again and/or the blind region has disappeared.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">S<b>240</b> (and/or S<b>250</b>) can optionally include determining (e.g., predicting) and/or assigning a set of policies (e.g., behaviors, actions, trajectories, etc.) to each of the virtual objects, which functions to enable their interactions with the environment to be simulated in determining the response of the ego vehicle (e.g., as described below). Each virtual object is preferably assigned one or more policies (e.g., a single policy, multiple policies, etc.), but can additionally or alternatively not be assigned a policy and/or be otherwise configured.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some variations, a virtual object can be assigned to have multiple behaviors and/or locations. In some examples, for instance, if the virtual object has the option to turn at an intersection, the virtual object can move (e.g., be simulated to move) in multiple directions (e.g., spawn/fan out) such that the method (e.g., simulations) accounts for the virtual object moving and/or turning in any possible direction.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In a set of specific examples (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>), each of the virtual objects is assigned a set of one or more policies to be used in simulating that virtual object. The policies preferably take into account features of the environment (e.g., which lane the virtual object is located in) and optionally the policy selected for the ego vehicle, such that the policies represent those which could cause an interaction with the ego vehicle (e.g., wherein the 2nd virtual object is not simulated with a &#x201c;drive straight&#x201d; policy as this would not lead to an interaction with the ego vehicle turning left; wherein the 1st virtual object is not simulated with a &#x201c;change lanes&#x201d; policy as this would not lead to an interaction with the ego vehicle turning left; etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the virtual objects can be simulated with a single policy (e.g., most likely policy, policy most likely to lead to a collision, etc.); simulated without a policy; simulated with multiple locations and/or other parameters; otherwise simulated; and/or not simulated.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Any or all of the parameters and/or features can be determined with a database (e.g., lookup table, library, etc.). In specific examples, for instance, a library of different standard sizes (e.g., height, width, length, etc.) and/or parameters for different types of virtual objects (e.g., 4-wheeled vehicles, 2-wheeled vehicles, bikes, pedestrians, etc.) can be referenced when selecting the virtual object(s).
