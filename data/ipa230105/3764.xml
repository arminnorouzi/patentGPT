No. 62/941,463, filed on Nov. 27, 2019, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is directed to a current sensor and, more particularly, to utilizing a pre-calibrated busbar as a device to determine current flowing through the busbar.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mechanical circuit breakers have been used for years to protect electrical components from short circuits or over current conditions, e.g., an electrical fault. However, a time lag between the occurrence of an electrical fault and a mechanical circuit breaker actually breaking the circuit exists due to the slow response time of the breaker's mechanical components. Moreover, as system ratings rise lag times of a mechanical circuit breaker also rise.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, there has been a move towards solid state circuit breakers (SSCBs). SSCBs utilize electronic switches, which have no moving parts, in place of mechanical switches. The electronic switches enable the SSCB to respond to an electrical fault much more quickly than a mechanical circuit breaker and, thereby, provide more responsive protection to electrical circuit components.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An increase in electrical subsystems within aerospace and automotive applications has made circuit protection a top priority in these sectors and SSCBs have become a preferred choice to provide this protection. However, due to the weight and volume constraints (e.g., many electrical components in a small space) present in aerospace and automotive applications, current density within an electrical subsystem must be high. Accordingly, the weight and volume of every electrical component is of concern including the weight and volume of an SSCB.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to a current sensor that has numerous applications and is particularly suited to, for example, a solid state power control system or, its equivalent, a solid state circuit breaker (SSCB) system whose weight and volume is reduced by eliminating a high weight, high volume current detector relied upon by an SSCB. The function of the current detector is replaced by utilizing an existing busbar as a current measurement shunt resistor. The busbar, in combination with a voltage measurement of the voltage between first and second voltage detection points on the busbar and thermal properties of the busbar, are used to provide current monitoring for the SSCB system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a solid state circuit breaker system that includes a parallel configuration of an electronic switching module and an electronic energy absorbing module, a voltage sensor and a controller. The parallel configuration is connected between a voltage source, via a busbar, and a load. The voltage sensor detects a difference in voltage between a first location on the busbar and a second location on the busbar. The controller determines the current flowing to the parallel configuration based on the difference in voltage and based on the electrical resistance of the busbar.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method of determining an over current fault to activate a solid state circuit breaker that is coupled between a power supply, via a busbar, and a load. The method includes obtaining a difference in voltage between a first location on the busbar and a second location on the busbar. The method further includes determining an electrical resistance of the busbar between the first and second locations as well as determining a current flowing to the solid state circuit breaker based on the difference in voltage and the electrical resistance of the busbar. The method further includes determining that an over current fault has occurred based on the determined current exceeding a rated amperage capacity of the load.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another aspect of the present disclosure is directed a current sensing system. The system generally includes a pre-calibrated busbar, a voltage sensor, a temperature sensor and a controller. The pre-calibrated busbar has a known resistance, a known variation in resistance with respect to temperature and known dimensions. The voltage sensor detects a difference in voltage between a first location and a second location on the pre-calibrated busbar. The temperature sensor detects an ambient temperature of the pre-calibrated busbar. The controller determines a resistance of the busbar between the first location and the second location based on the known resistance, known variation in resistance, known dimensions and the ambient temperature. The controller additionally determines a current flowing through the pre-calibrated busbar based on the difference in voltage and the determined resistance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a prior art diagram of solid state circuit breaker system using an external current sensor for detecting over current faults.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of a solid state circuit breaker system of the present disclosure utilizing an existing busbar, absent an external current sensor, for detecting over current faults.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views.

For example, high voltage and high current electrical systems are being proposed for future aircraft ranging from 230 V AC to 1000 V DC, and above. Accordingly, the volume and/or weight of an electrical system's power converter plays an important role in efficient and effective power management as does the volume and/or weight of the circuit breaker that protects electrical components supplied by the converter. Volume and weight constraints affect selection of every electrical component within an electrical system. As such, any possibility to reduce weight or volume of an electrical component is highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reduction in weight and volume within volume-constrained and/or weight-constrained electrical systems has, at least in-part, been achieved by replacing mechanical circuit breakers with solid state circuit breakers (SSCBs). SSCBs replace the traditional moving parts of an electromechanical circuit breaker with power electronics and software algorithms that control power and can interrupt a current within microseconds. In order to operate, SSCBs rely on a component that can be used to measure and monitor current flow. Typically, a current sensor, such as a hall effect sensor, provides the current monitoring ability external to the SSCB. However, the current sensor adds significant weight, takes up significant space and reduces current density. An alternative solution provides for the addition of a shunt resistor external to the SSCB that is used to monitor current flow. However, an external shunt resistor is typically a power resistor that is high in weight, subjects the electrical system to power dissipation and may, itself, require additional cooling.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a simplified diagram of an SSCB system <b>10</b> with an external current sensor <b>110</b>.
