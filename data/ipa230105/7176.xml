In the VCM system, a magnet is arranged on one of the movable part and the fixed part and a coil is arranged on the other of them, and a driving force is generated by energizing the coil in a magnetic circuit formed by the magnet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an example of application of this driving device, there may be mentioned a shake correction mechanism mounted on an image capturing apparatus. In the shake correction mechanism, an image sensor or a shake correction lens is mounted on a movable part, and based on a shake amount detected by a predetermined sensor, the movable part is driven so as to cancel out a detected shake. Particularly, the shake correction mechanism having the image sensor mounted on the movable part is higher in shake correction performance than the shake correction mechanism haying the shake correction lens mounted on the movable part in that it is possible to correct rotation about an axis orthogonal to an imaging surface of the image sensor (image capturing optical axis).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the driving device of this type, a restricting section is provided to prevent drop-off of the movable part from the fixed part. In a driving device in which the movable part is rotatable about the image capturing optical axis, such as the shake correction mechanism of the image capturing apparatus, this restricting section is required to be arranged at a location where it does not interfere with the rotational movement of the movable part. Further, in general, in such a shake correction mechanism, a plurality of balls are arranged between the movable part and the fixed part to reduce contact resistance, whereby it is possible to perform smooth driving. For the arrangement of the balls, an enclosure for preventing the balls from dropping off in a direction parallel to a rolling surface is provided. Further, the movable part and the fixed part are provided with an abutting portion and an abutted portion for restricting the movement of the movable part with respect to the fixed part, respectively.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Japanese Patent No. 3969927 discloses a technique for performing, before photographing, an operation of resetting the position of balls in a shake correction device that moves a lens group by using a two-axis driving device, to thereby prevent the balls from being brought into contact with an enclosure during actual use. Further, Japanese Patent No. 3969927 describes a movable mechanical end provided for limiting the movement of the movable part.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Incidentally, a user sometimes performs photographing using an image capturing apparatus while walking, and here, a shake occurring in this situation is referred to as the &#x201c;walking shake&#x201d;. The walking shake becomes larger in shake amount than a shake occurring in a case where a user performs photographing in a state standing still, and hence there is a demand for a shake correction device that is capable of canceling out a larger shake amount.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The shake correction device of the image capturing apparatus can correct a large shake amount by increasing a movement amount of the movable part holding the image sensor or the shake correction lens with respect to the fixed part. Particularly, when the walking shake occurs, a shake amount of rotation about the image capturing optical axis tends to become large, and hence by increasing a movement amount by which the movable part is rotatable about the image capturing optical axis (as the central axis) with respect to the fixed part, it is possible to increase the effect of shake correction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Here, the shake correction device described in Japanese Patent No. 3969927 is configured to allow the movable part to translationally move only within a plane orthogonal to the optical axis as described above, but is not configured to allow the movable part to rotationally move within the plane. Further, Japanese Patent No. 3969927 does not disclose a specific configuration of the movable mechanical end for limiting the movement of the movable part. Further, if the rotational movement amount of the movable part with respect to the fixed part is increased, an amount by which the movable part protrudes outward increases, which can result in an increase of the size of the image capturing apparatus. To avoid this inconvenience, for the driving device having the movable part that is translationally and rotationally movable, a configuration is required in which the translational movement and the rotational movement of the movable part are properly restricted while preventing the movable part from protruding outward.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p

More specifically, when a shake has caused a change in posture of the image capturing apparatus <b>10</b> during image capturing, imaging positions of an object light flux on the imaging surface <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the image sensor <b>11</b> change, whereby a blur occurs in an image obtained through the image sensor <b>11</b>. At this time, in a case where the change in posture of the image capturing apparatus <b>10</b> is sufficiently small, the changes in the imaging positions are uniform within the imaging surface <b>11</b><i>a </i>and can be regarded to be caused by the translational or rotational movement (imaging surface shake) in the optical axis orthogonal plane <b>12</b><i>c. </i>Therefore, by translationally moving or rotating the image sensor <b>11</b> in the optical axis orthogonal plane <b>12</b><i>c </i>so as to cancel out this imaging surface shake, it is possible to obtain a clear object image in which the image blur has been corrected. Note that the image capturing apparatus <b>10</b> may be configured such that when moving the image sensor <b>11</b> in a direction parallel to the imaging surface, the image sensor <b>11</b> can be moved in a direction orthogonal to the imaging surface (an optical axis direction, i.e. a direction along the optical axis <b>12</b><i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Similarly, the second blur correction unit <b>60</b> corrects an image blur caused by a shake of the image capturing apparatus <b>10</b> by moving the shake correction lens <b>12</b><i>b </i>in the optical axis orthogonal plane <b>12</b><i>c </i>in a direction in which the imaging surface shake can be cancel outed, thereby making it possible to obtain a clear object image.
