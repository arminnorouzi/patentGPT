It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, reference numeral <b>10</b> generally refers to a reinforcing cap attached to a rear wall <b>12</b> of a tub <b>14</b> for an appliance <b>16</b>, such as a laundry appliance. The laundry appliance <b>16</b> can include the tub <b>14</b> within the appliance cabinet <b>18</b> and a drum <b>20</b> rotationally mounted within the tub <b>14</b>. According to the various embodiments, the laundry appliance <b>16</b> can include the tub <b>14</b> having a rear wall <b>12</b>. A hub <b>24</b>, such as a drive hub, is insert injection-molded within the rear wall <b>12</b> of the tub <b>14</b>. It is contemplated that the rear wall <b>12</b> can include a plurality of structural support ribs <b>26</b> that extend outward from a portion of the tub <b>14</b>. An electrical direct drive motor <b>28</b> having a stator <b>30</b> and a rotor <b>32</b> extending around the stator <b>30</b> is attached to the hub <b>24</b>, where the stator <b>30</b> of the motor <b>28</b> is attached to stator fastening portions <b>34</b> that are integrally formed within the hub <b>24</b>. The rotor <b>32</b> is attached to a shaft <b>36</b> that extends through bearings <b>38</b> disposed within a bearing housing <b>40</b> of the hub <b>24</b> and extend to the drum <b>20</b> such that rotation of the rotor <b>32</b> results in a simultaneous rotation of the drum <b>20</b> within the tub <b>14</b>. A reinforcing cap <b>10</b> is attached to the rear wall <b>12</b> of the tub <b>14</b>. The reinforcing cap <b>10</b> is positioned on the rear wall <b>12</b> and is separated from both the hub <b>24</b> and the motor <b>28</b>. Specifically, the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> is positioned between the stator <b>30</b> of the motor <b>28</b> and an exposed outer surface <b>42</b> of the hub <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, it is contemplated that the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> can be positioned between an outer surface <b>42</b> of the hub <b>24</b> and the stator <b>30</b> to prevent inadvertent collision between portions of the motor <b>28</b> and the hub <b>24</b>, which is typically made of metal, such as steel and/or aluminum. It has been found that certain portions of the motor <b>28</b>, such as windings <b>50</b> of the stator <b>30</b>, may come free during use of the appliance <b>16</b> and engage portions of the metallic hub <b>24</b>. This engagement between portions of the motor <b>28</b> and the metallic hub <b>24</b> may result in a short circuit of the motor <b>28</b> and potentially damage to the appliance <b>16</b>. Positioning of the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> between the motor <b>28</b> and the metallic hub <b>24</b> substantially prevents such unwanted engagement of components and diminishes the potential for a short circuit event during use of the appliance <b>16</b>. In order to properly insulate the metallic hub <b>24</b> from inadvertent contact from portions of the motor <b>28</b>, the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> is typically made of plastic.

Additionally, during performance of certain welding methods for attaching the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> to the rear wall <b>12</b> of the tub <b>14</b>, pressure typically needs to be applied to the reinforcing cap <b>10</b> against the rear wall <b>12</b> of the tub <b>14</b>.

This outer plastic overmold <b>258</b> is adapted to retain magnetic components <b>260</b> of the rotor <b>32</b> such that the outer plastic overmold <b>258</b> is at least partially molded around these magnetic components <b>260</b>. The inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> is adapted to engage three-dimensional features <b>262</b> that are defined within the metal plate <b>256</b>. In this manner, the material of the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> forms around and within the three-dimensional features <b>262</b> to increase the connection strength between the metal plate <b>256</b> and the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b>. This increased strength serves to resist slipping between the metal plate <b>256</b> and the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> during operation of the appliance <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">These three-dimensional features <b>262</b> extend at an angle or perpendicularly from the inner region <b>254</b> of the metal plate <b>256</b>.

According to the various embodiments, these three-dimensional features <b>262</b> may take the form of cylindrical retaining features <b>264</b> that are oriented substantially perpendicular to the metal plate <b>256</b>. These retaining features <b>264</b> serve to improve the torque transmission between the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> and the inner region <b>254</b> of the metal plate <b>256</b>. Additionally, these retaining features <b>264</b> serve to provide an additional connection support between the metal plate <b>256</b> and the metallic rotor hub <b>252</b> disposed at the center of the rotor <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is also contemplated that the three-dimensional features <b>262</b> can take the form of punched slots <b>268</b> where a portion of the slot can be bent away from the metal plate <b>256</b> to form a retaining flange <b>270</b>. This retaining flange <b>270</b>, similar to the cylindrical retaining feature, serves to add structural support to the connection between the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> and the inner region <b>254</b> of the metal plate <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The three-dimensional retaining features <b>264</b> of the metal plate <b>256</b> for the rotor <b>32</b> can include various features that can include, but are not limited to, punched holes, extruded holes <b>266</b>, bent flaps, extruded slots, crimped portions, combinations thereof, and other similar three-dimensional features <b>262</b> defined within an inner region <b>254</b> of the metal plate <b>256</b> that engage the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b>. Similar three-dimensional features <b>262</b> can also be included in the engagement between the metal plate <b>256</b> and the outer plastic overmold <b>258</b> to increase the connection strength at this location of the rotor <b>32</b> as well.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The material of the metallic plate can be steel, aluminum, alloys thereof, combinations thereof, and other similar metallic materials.

The stresses experienced by the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> near the rotor hub <b>252</b> can be higher than those experienced by the outer plastic overmold <b>258</b> where the rotor <b>32</b> is in magnetic communication with the stator <b>30</b>. As such, a highly-rigid polymeric material may be used to form the outer plastic overmold <b>258</b>. The use of this highly rigid polymeric material can serve to mitigate noise generation during use of the motor <b>28</b> of the appliance <b>16</b>. Such a rigid polymeric material for use in the outer plastic overmold <b>258</b> can include, but is not limited to, a bulk molding compound (BMC) and other similar highly rigid polymers. Alternatively, it is contemplated that a different polymer can be used to form the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> that engages the rotor hub <b>252</b>. At this location of the rotor <b>32</b>, cyclic high stresses can occur in the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> with less sound issues being present. As such, the inner plastic overmold <b>250</b> can be made of various plastic materials that can include, but are not limited to, glass-filled polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polypropylene, nylon, combinations thereof, and other similar high-performance polymers.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, the stator <b>30</b> for the rotor <b>32</b> of the appliance <b>16</b> can include a stator core <b>280</b> that can be made of various segments, laminations, a coiled helical plate, stacked plates, and other similar configurations of metallic material.

These rivets <b>286</b> serve to secure the ends <b>288</b> of each of the teeth <b>284</b> to prevent unwanted vibration at the ends <b>288</b> of the teeth <b>284</b>. The rivets <b>286</b> may be installed by pre-punching rivet holes <b>290</b> towards the ends <b>288</b> of each of the teeth <b>284</b> either before or after the stator <b>30</b> is constructed. Metallic rivets <b>286</b> can then be extended through the rivet holes <b>290</b> to secure the ends <b>288</b> of the teeth <b>284</b>. The use of rivets <b>286</b> serve to minimize noise and vibration within the teeth <b>284</b> of the stator <b>30</b> that make up the teeth <b>284</b>.
