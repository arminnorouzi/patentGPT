The first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>is operated by a first user A and the second user device <b>100</b><i>b </i>is operated by a second user B. The second user B may also be called a &#x201c;collaborating user&#x201d; or simply a &#x201c;collaborator&#x201d;, for reasons which will become apparent. Furthermore, the collaborators may be called &#x201c;mandatory&#x201d; collaborators, to distinguish from &#x201c;optional&#x201d; collaborators, discussed later. In an example, the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>is being used to generate a final email for transmission to one or more user devices of other users.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In general, an email comprises two main parts: the message header and the message body. The message header has various fields indicating &#x201c;metadata&#x201d; of the email such as From, To, CC (&#x201c;carbon copy&#x201d;), BCC (&#x201c;blind carbon copy&#x201d;), Subject, Date, etc. The message body, on the other hand, is a field for holding the main content of the email. Modern email systems allow for the message body to hold not only text content, but other types of content such as images, hyperlinks, audio files, etc. It is understood that the names given to the various fields of the email are only labels. For example, the &#x201c;To&#x201d; field may be called a &#x201c;Recipient&#x201d; or &#x201c;Recipients&#x201d; field, or the like; the &#x201c;CC&#x201d; field maybe called a &#x201c;Copied&#x201d; field, or the like; the &#x201c;BCC&#x201d; field may be called a &#x201c;Blind Copied&#x201d; or &#x201c;Secret Copied&#x201d; field, or the like, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example, recipients of an email may be categorised as follows:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Primary (or Principal) Recipients: these are recipients to whom the email is addressed. Email addresses (or other identifiers) of primary recipients are held in the To field. Each primary recipient receives a copy of the email when it is sent, and each primary recipient can see the identifiers of the other primary recipients and the secondary recipients.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Secondary Recipients: these are recipients who are &#x201c;copied&#x201d; on the email. Email addresses (or other identifiers) of secondary recipients are held in the CC field. Each secondary recipient receives a copy of the email when it is sent, and each secondary recipient can see the identifiers of the primary recipients and the other secondary recipients.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Tertiary Recipients: these are recipients who are &#x201c;blind copied&#x201d; on the email. Email addresses (or other identifiers) of tertiary recipients are held in the BCC field. Each tertiary recipient receives a copy of the email when it is sent, and each tertiary recipient can see the identifiers of the primary recipients and the secondary recipients. However, identifiers of tertiary recipients are not visible to any of the primary recipients, secondary recipients, or other tertiary recipients.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A sender may compose an email on their own by populating the message body field with a message intended to be read by a recipient. The sender then enters an email address (or other identifier) of at least one recipient into the To field of the message header. The sender may also populate one or more other fields such as the CC or BCC field or the subject field. Some fields may be populated automatically. For example, the From field may automatically indicate the sender, the date may be automatically input by the email system, etc. The sender can then cause the email to be sent to the one or more final recipients, usually by clicking a &#x201c;send&#x201d; button. In this context, &#x201c;final recipients&#x201d; refers to the set of primary and secondary and tertiary recipients (if any) specified in the respective fields at the time the email is sent.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Two or more users may collaborate on a draft email before it is sent to the final recipient(s) by one of the plurality of collaborators. In such cases, it is common for the other collaborators to be included in either the CC field of the final email. However, this does not give the recipient a clear context as to whether all the people indicated in the CC field (and the person indicated in the From field) actually provided input on the email message or not. This situation can be ambiguous for the recipient and can therefore make it difficult for the recipient to direct follow-up questions to the correct one or more users. For example, the recipient may wish to ask a technical question regarding the content of the email itself, or may wish to ask an administrative- or bureaucratic-type question. These types of questions are likely to be answerable by different ones of the users.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>, the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and second user device <b>100</b><i>b </i>each comprise at least one user interface allowing the respective user to interact with the user device <b>100</b>. For example, a user device <b>100</b> may comprise a graphical user interface for displaying graphical content to the user, a keyboard, mouse, etc. for allowing the user to provide user input to control the user device <b>100</b>, a touchscreen allowing for both displaying of graphical content and the input of user input, etc. Examples of user devices include laptop computers, tablet computers, desktop computers, smartphones, etc. The first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and second user device <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be different types of device. In any case, the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and second user device <b>100</b><i>b </i>are able to communicate with each other and other user devices via a network, such as one or more of the Internet, a local area network, a cellular network, etc., (not shown), via which emails and other data can be sent in accordance with known systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Described below is a method allowing the first user A and the collaborating user B to collaborate on an email before a final version of the email is sent to one or more final recipients (not shown).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, the first user A is instigating the preparation of the email with one or more other collaborating users, such as user B, and the user A may therefore be regarded as an instigating or lead user. To begin collaborating on an email with the collaborating user B, the first user A creates a &#x201c;collaboration object&#x201d; <b>200</b>. The collaboration object <b>200</b> is a data structure which can be edited by the first user A and the collaborating user B using their respective user devices <b>100</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some example, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may be sent between the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the second user device <b>100</b><i>b</i>. For example, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may be a logical entity which may be derived from an email whose message body or message header (or both) can be interpreted as a collaboration object <b>200</b>. This is similar to the case of an email invite, where a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; email is sent with an attachment (e.g. &#x201c;invite.ics&#x201d;) specifying that the email is to be treated as a meeting invite email. Hence, in some examples, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may itself be an email. The message body or header (or both) may be standardized for any email client (including web browsers).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other examples, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may be implemented centrally, e.g. on a server. In such cases, the collaboration object <b>200</b> itself is not sent between the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the second user device <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Rather, the collaboration object <b>200</b> resides on a server which is accessible by both the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the second user device <b>100</b><i>b </i>for the first user A and second user B to make changes to the (central) collaboration object <b>200</b>. The first user A may send (e.g. via email) an invite to the second user B inviting the second user B to make modifications to the collaboration object <b>200</b>, e.g. by providing a network address of the server from which the collaboration object <b>200</b> can be accessed by the second user device <b>100</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the methods described herein may be implemented using email software installed on each user device <b>100</b>. In other examples, the methods described herein may be implemented using an in-browser email software. In yet further examples, a combination of the two may be used, e.g. one or more of the user devices <b>100</b> may use email software installed on the user device <b>100</b> and one or more others of the user devices <b>100</b> may use in-browser email software. The email software need not be the same email software on each user device <b>100</b>. Similarly, the in-browser email software need not be the same on each user device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The collaboration object <b>200</b> comprises a plurality of fields. In this first example, the collaboration object <b>200</b> comprises a draft message field <b>201</b> and a draft collaborator field <b>202</b>. More examples are given later below in which the collaboration object <b>200</b> comprises further fields.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The draft message field <b>201</b> is for holding email content. Email content may include text, images, hyperlinks, audio files, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example, the draft collaborator field <b>202</b> is for holding identifiers of one or more collaborating users. For example, a collaborating user may be identified using their email address, names, or some other identifier. Identifiers of the collaborating users may be entered into the draft collaborator field <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first user A operates the first user device <b>100</b><i>a </i>to populate at least the draft collaborator field <b>202</b> with an identifier of at least one other user with whom the first user A wishes to collaborate on an email. This may be done by the first user A providing user input at the first device <b>100</b><i>a </i>using, for example, a mouse, keyboard, voice input device, etc. In this example, the first user A has entered an identifier of the collaborating user B into the draft collaborator field <b>202</b>. In this example the first user A is also a collaborator for the email, but has the special status of being the user who instigated the collaboration request. Therefore, the draft collaborator field <b>202</b> may comprise an identifier of all collaborating users, including the first user A. However, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may be rendered differently to different users on the respective user interfaces of the user devices <b>100</b>. For example, when displaying the collaboration object <b>200</b> to a user, it is not necessary to display the identifier of the user to whom it is being displayed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first user A may also populate the draft message field <b>201</b> in a similar manner, or it may be left blank. In this example, the first user A has populated the draft message field <b>201</b> with content, such as a draft message &#x201c;M<b>1</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once at least the draft collaborator field <b>202</b> has been populated with at least one identifier of a collaborating user B, the first user A can send the collaboration object <b>200</b>.

In this example, the collaboration object <b>200</b> is sent to one or more collaborating users indicated in the draft collaboration field <b>202</b> (other than the first user A).

For example, the collaborating user B may make modifications to the message in the draft message field <b>201</b>, e.g. to add or remove text.

A single &#x201c;round&#x201d; of collaboration was shown, but it is understood that further rounds of collaboration could follow. That is, the first user A, after receiving an edited version of the collaboration object <b>200</b> from the collaborating user B, may make further changes to the values in one or more of the fields and send the collaboration object back to the collaborating user B as described above. The collaborating user B could then make more changes and so on. Eventually, however, the first user A will receive a version of the collaboration object <b>200</b> which is deemed by the first user A to be satisfactory. At this point, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;final&#x201d; collaboration object <b>200</b>.

In other words, the collaboration is performed as part of a separate &#x201c;conversation&#x201d; in which the collaboration object <b>200</b> is electronically passed around the collaborating users, who are all able to make changes until the collaboration object is in a state where at least the instigator (here, user A) is satisfied and optionally all the collaborating users are satisfied.

For example, the fourth user D can immediately see from the identifiers in the fields of the received email <b>400</b> that the message M<b>2</b> was collaborated on by the first user A and the second user B, and that the third user C is copied in on the email but did not collaborate on drafting the message M<b>2</b> (e.g. C is only copied for docketing or informational purposes). This means that, for example, the fourth user D knows that he/she does not need to reply to any other user or otherwise enquire who worked on the message M<b>2</b>. Instead, the fourth user D can easily identify a relevant user to reply to with a follow-up email (e.g. the first user A or the second user B if the follow-up email relates to the content of the message M<b>2</b> itself, or perhaps the third user C if the follow-up email relates to an administrative or bureaucratic issue).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In examples, the collaboration object <b>200</b> may comprise additional fields which the users <b>100</b> can edit during the collaboration phase (as described above).

It is appreciated that this is optional because the collaborators may simply know, or it may be implicit, to whom the email they are collaborating on will be sent.

There is an approval flag for each collaborating user indicated in the draft collaborator field <b>202</b>. Each approval flag indicates whether or not a given collaborator approves of the draft email as specified by the (current version of) the collaboration object <b>200</b>. That is, an asserted approval flag for a given user means that that user approves of that version of the collaboration object <b>200</b>. Here, a user &#x201c;approves&#x201d; of a collaboration object <b>200</b> if they consent to a final email <b>300</b> being generated based on that collaboration object <b>200</b> which will be sent out identifying them as a collaborator.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this example, the collaboration object comprises three approval flags <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>: the first approval flag <b>250</b><i>a </i>indicates whether the first user A approves of the collaboration object <b>200</b>; the second approval flag <b>250</b><i>b </i>indicates whether the second user B approves of the collaboration object <b>200</b>; and the third approval flag <b>250</b><i>c </i>indicates whether the third user C approves of the collaboration object <b>200</b>. Note that in some examples, there is no approval flag included for the first user A as this user is the user who sends the final email <b>300</b> and therefore implicitly approves of the final email <b>300</b> (given that the first user A decided to send the final email <b>300</b>). The approval flags <b>250</b> may be implemented both in examples in which the collaboration object <b>200</b> is implemented centrally (e.g. at one or more servers) and in other examples in which the collaboration object <b>200</b> is sent (e.g. emailed) from one user device to another.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In examples in which the collaboration object <b>200</b> is passed around the collaborators (instead of being implemented centrally), a situation might arise in which more than one collaborator has made changes to the collaboration object <b>200</b>, resulting in two (or more) different versions of the collaboration object <b>200</b>. In such cases, each collaborator has the option to pursue either version of the collaboration object <b>200</b>. The collaboration object <b>200</b> may comprise a timestamp indicating when that version was last edited in order to indicate to the collaborators which version is the most recent. In any case, the approval flags <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>present on each version of the collaboration object <b>200</b> will help the collaborators decide which version to pursue. Hence, in some examples, the state of the approval flags <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is indicated to each collaborator via their user device <b>100</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(e.g. visually on a display screen).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">An example use case is as follows:</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">User A (the &#x201c;Sender&#x201d;) initiates collaboration with a collaboration object <b>200</b> comprise a message &#x201c;one&#x201d;.

User B and user C each send their version of the collaboration object <b>200</b>. User A therefore receives two versions of the collaboration object: one with message &#x201c;onetwo&#x201d; and one with message &#x201c;onethree&#x201d;. User A then has a choice of which version of the collaboration object <b>200</b> he will pursue (e.g. use to generate a final email, further modify, send back to the collaborators, etc.) and which he will ignore. In any case, the approval flags <b>250</b> present on each version of the collaboration object <b>250</b> can help user A in this decision.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, the first user A cannot generate and send the final email <b>300</b> (as described above) until the approval flags <b>250</b> for all collaborating users are asserted.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, the approval flag <b>250</b> for a user may be asserted on a collaboration object <b>200</b> when that user has sent the collaboration object <b>200</b>.
