It is officially called &#x201c;IMT-2020&#x201d; and aims to be released around the world in 2020.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The fifth-generation mobile communication supports multiples numerologies (and/or multiple subcarrier spacings (SCS)) to support various 5G services. For example, if SCS is 15 kHz, wide area can be supported in traditional cellular bands, and if SCS is 30 kHz/60 kHz, dense-urban, lower latency, and wider carrier bandwidth can be supported. If SCS is 60 kHz or higher, bandwidths greater than 24.25 GHz can be supported to overcome phase noise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">NR frequency band is defined as a frequency range of two types, i.e., FR1, FR2. FR1 is 410 MHz-7125 MHz, and FR2 is 24250 MHz-52600 MHz, meaning millimeter wave (mmW).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ITU suggests three usage scenarios, for example, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">URLLC relates to a usage scenario in which high reliability and low delay time are required. For example, services like autonomous driving, automation, and virtual realities requires high reliability and low delay time (e.g., lms or less). A delay time of the current 4G (LTE) is statistically 21-43 ms (best 10%), 33-75 ms (median). Thus, the current 4G (LTE) is not sufficient to support a service requiring a delay time of lms or less.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, the eMBB relates to a usage scenario that requires a mobile ultra-wideband.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These ultra-wideband high-speed services seem to be difficult to accommodate by existing core networks designed for LTE/LTE-A.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the redesign of core networks is urgently needed in so-called fifth-generation mobile communications.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a next-generation mobile communication network.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The 5G core network (5GC) may include various components, part of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, including an access and mobility management function (AMF) <b>41</b>, a session management function (SMF) <b>42</b>, a policy control function (PCF) <b>43</b>, a user plane function (UPF) <b>44</b>, an application function (AF) <b>45</b>, a unified data management (UDM) <b>46</b> and a non-3GPP interworking function (N3IWF) <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A UE <b>10</b> is connected to a data network via the UPF <b>44</b> through a next generation radio access network (NG-RAN).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The UE <b>10</b> may be provided with a data service even through untrusted non-3GPP access, e.g., a wireless local area network (WLAN).

However, this is meaningless when considering the following process.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0254">1) The UE receives a value of the back-off timer (e.g., T<b>3346</b>) set to be greater than a value of the fourth timer, that is, the non-3GPP de-registration timer.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0255">That is, a value of the T<b>3346</b>&#x3e;a value of the non-3GPP de-registration timer</p><p id="p-0242" num="0256">2) The AMF sets a value of the third timer, that is, the non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer, to be greater than a value of the back-off timer (e.g., T<b>3346</b>).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0257">That is, a value of the non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer&#x3e;a value of the T<b>3346</b>&#x3e;a value of the non-3GPP de-registration timer</p><p id="p-0244" num="0258">3) If the back-off timer (e.g., T<b>3346</b>) is running, the UE cannot transmit an MO signal through non-3GPP access.

In particular, in a congestion situation, a problem in that only a load of the AMF is weighted is additionally caused. Furthermore, due to such a problem, service quality of the UE is degraded, and unnecessary signaling (the transmission and reception of signals attributable to a procedure for re-registration) occurs.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">The Disclosure of the Present Specification</heading><p id="p-0248" num="0262">Accordingly, the disclosure of the present specification has an object of proposing a scheme for preventing a UE, registered through non-3GPP access, from being unnecessarily de-registered in a next-generation mobile communication system (i.e., 5G system).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">I.

Scenarios to which the Disclosure of the Present Disclosure is Applicable</heading><p id="p-0321" num="0333">Hereinafter, scenarios to which the present disclosure is applicable are described.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0334">In the present disclosure, an always-on PDU session for URLLC having a low-latency characteristic may be used for artificial intelligence, robots, autonomous driving, extended reality, and the like among the 5G scenarios below.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0335">&#x3c;5G use Scenarios&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0324" num="0336"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates an example of 5G use scenarios.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0337">The 5G usage scenarios illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> are merely exemplary, and the technical features of the present disclosure may also be applied to other 5G usage scenarios that are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0338">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, three major requirement areas of 5G include: (1) an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) area, (2) a massive machine type communication (mMTC) area, and (3) an ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) area. Some examples of usage may require multiple areas for optimization, while other examples of usage may focus only on one key performance indicator (KPI). The 5G supports these various examples of usage in a flexible and reliable way.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0339">The eMBB focuses generally on improvements in data rate, latency, user density, and capacity and coverage of mobile broadband access. The eMBB aims at a throughput of about 10 Gbps. The eMBB makes it possible to far surpass basic mobile Internet access, and covers full-duplex operations, media in cloud or augmented reality, and entertainment applications. Data is one of the key drivers of 5G, and it may not be possible to see dedicated voice services for the first time in the 5G era. In 5G, voice is expected to be processed as an application program simply using data connection provided by a communication system. A main reason for an increased traffic volume is an increase in content size and an increase in the number of applications requiring high data rates. Streaming services (audio and video), interactive video and mobile Internet connections will become more prevalent as more devices are connected to the Internet. Many of these applications require always-on connectivity to push real-time information and notifications to users. Cloud storage and applications are rapidly increasing in mobile communication platforms, which may be applied to both work and entertainment. Cloud storage is a special use case that drives the growth of uplink data rates. 5G is also used for remote work in the cloud and requires much lower end-to-end latency to maintain a good user experience when tactile interfaces are used. In entertainment, for example, cloud gaming and video streaming are another key factor requiring improvement in mobile broadband capabilities. Entertainment is essential on smartphones and tablets anywhere, including in highly mobile environments such as trains, cars and airplanes. Another use case is augmented reality and information retrieval for entertainment. Here, augmented reality requires very low latency and an instantaneous data amount.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0340">The mMTC, which is designed to enable communication between a large number of low-cost devices powered by batteries, is provided to support smart metering, logistics, fields, and applications such as body sensors. The mMTC aims at about 10-year batteries and/or about one million devices per km<sup>2</sup>. The mMTC enables seamless connection of embedded sensors in all fields to form a sensor network and is one of the most anticipated 5G use cases. Potentially, IoT devices are predicted to reach 20.4 billion by 2020. Smart networks utilizing industrial IoT is one of the areas where 5G plays a key role in enabling smart cities, asset tracking, smart utilities, agriculture and security infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0341">The URLLC, which enables devices and machines to communicate with high reliability, very low latency, and high availability, are ideal for vehicle communications, industrial control, factory automation, telesurgery, smart grid, and public safety applications. The URLLC aims at a delay of about 1 ms. The URLLC includes new services that will change the industry through ultra-reliable/low-latency links such as remote control of key infrastructures and autonomous vehicles. Levels of reliability and latency are essential for smart grid control, industrial automation, robotics, and drone control and adjustment.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0342">Next, a plurality of usage examples included in the triangle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> will be described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0343">5G, which is a means of providing streams that are rated as hundreds of megabits per second to a gigabit per second, may complement fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and cable-based broadband (or data over cable service interface specifications (DOCSIS)). Such a high speed may be required to deliver TVs with resolution of 4K or higher (6K, 8K and higher) as well as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). VR and AR applications involve almost immersive sports events. Specific applications may require special network configuration. For example, in the case of VR games, a game company may need to integrate a core server with an edge network server of a network operator to minimize latency.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0344">Automotive is expected to be an important new driver for 5G together with many use cases for mobile communication regarding vehicles. For example, entertainment for passengers require both high capacity and high mobile broadband. The reason is because future users will continue to expect high-quality connections, regardless of their location and speed. Another use case in the automotive sector is an augmented reality dashboard. The augmented reality dashboard allows drivers to identify objects in the dark on top of what they see through a front window. The augmented reality dashboard superimposes information to be provided to the driver regarding a distance and movement of objects. In the future, wireless modules will enable communication between vehicles, exchange of information between a vehicle and a supporting infrastructure, and exchange of information between a vehicle and other connected devices (e.g., devices carried by pedestrians). A safety system may lower the risk of accidents by guiding the driver to alternative courses of action to make driving safer. A next step will be a remotely controlled vehicle or an autonomous vehicle. This requires very reliable and very fast communication between different autonomous vehicles and/or between vehicles and infrastructure. In the future, autonomous vehicles will perform all driving activities and drivers will be forced to focus only on traffic anomalies that the vehicle itself cannot identify. The technical requirements of autonomous vehicles require ultra-low latency and ultra-fast reliability to increase traffic safety to levels that cannot be achieved by humans.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0345">Smart cities and smart homes referred to as smart society will be embedded with high-density wireless sensor networks as an example of smart networks. A distributed network of intelligent sensors will identify the conditions for cost and energy efficient maintenance of a city or home. A similar setup may be done for each household. Temperature sensors, window and heating controllers, burglar alarms, and home appliances are all wirelessly connected. Many of these sensors typically require low data rates, low power, and low cost. However, for example, real-time HD video may be required in certain types of devices for surveillance.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0346">The consumption and distribution of energy including heat or gas is highly decentralized, requiring automated control of distributed sensor networks. A smart grid interconnects these sensors using digital information and communication technologies to collect information and act accordingly. This information may include the behavior of suppliers and consumers, so that the smart grid may improve efficiency, reliability, economical efficiency, sustainability of production, and a distribution of fuels such as electricity in an automated manner. The smart grid may also be considered as another low-latency sensor network.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0347">A health Sector has many Applications that may Benefit from Mobile Communications.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0348">The communication system may support telemedicine providing clinical care from remote locations. This may help reduce barriers to distance and improve access to medical services that are not consistently available in remote rural areas. It is also used to save lives in critical care and emergencies. A wireless sensor network based on mobile communication may provide remote monitoring and sensors for parameters such as a heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0349">Wireless and mobile communications are becoming increasingly important in industrial applications. Wiring is expensive to install and maintain. Thus, a possibility of replacing cables with reconfigurable wireless links is an attractive opportunity for many industries. However, achieving this requires that a wireless connection operates with a delay, reliability and capacity similar to those of a cable and requires simplified management. Low latency and very low error probability are new requirements that need to be connected to 5G.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0350">Logistics and cargo tracking is an important use case for mobile communications that enables tracking of inventory and packages from anywhere using a location-based information system. Logistics and freight tracking use cases typically require low data rates but require a wide range and reliable location information.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0351">&#x3c;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0340" num="0352">Artificial intelligence refers to a field of studying artificial intelligence or a methodology for creating the same, and machine learning refers to a field of defining various problems dealing in an artificial intelligence field and studying methodologies for solving the same.
