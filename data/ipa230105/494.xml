In an anastomosis procedure, ends of two organ sections are joined with the circular stapling device. Typically, a circular stapling device includes a handle assembly, an elongated shaft or adapter assembly, a reload assembly including a staple cartridge, and an anvil assembly that is mountable to the adapter assembly and is movable in relation to the reload assembly between open and clamped positions. In use, opposed tissue end margins of the organ sections are clamped between an anvil head of the anvil assembly and the staple cartridge and the device is fired to drive an annular array of staples from the staple cartridge through the tissue end margins of the organ sections for deformation against the anvil head. An annular knife positioned within the reload assembly is advanced to core or remove organ tissue interior of the staples to clear an internal tubular passage of the organ sections.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Complications during anastomoses procedures may result in a need for further operation and/or permanent ostomy. One complication is anastomotic leakage. The risk of anastomotic leakage is multi-factorial and may be affected by patient comorbidities, chemotherapy, the presence of microbiome pathogens, and stapling technique. One cause of anastomotic leakage may be due to bilateral dog ear formation. Bilateral dog ear formation results when the tissue end margins are not drawn fully into the reload assembly prior to firing of the circular stapling device. Thus, when the circular stapling device is fired to join the end margins of the organ sections, ends of one or both end margins of the organ sections are stapled in a position that resembles dog ears (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A continuing need exists for a circular stapling device that can form an anastomosis without forming dog ears.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure is directed to a circular stapling device that includes a reload assembly having a housing and a staple cartridge that define channels through the reload assembly.
