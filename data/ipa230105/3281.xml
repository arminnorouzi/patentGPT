id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cogged V-belt for frictional power transmission, which is useful for transmitting power by frictional power transmission, and more particularly, to a large-sized cogged V-belt, which is effectively used in a use environment with a large load such as a large-scale agricultural machine.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A power transmission belt used in a power transmission mechanism of a mechanical device or the like is roughly divided into a frictional power transmission belt and a meshing power transmission belt in terms of a power transmission form, and as the frictional power transmission belt, V-belts, V-ribbed belts, flat belts, and the like are known.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, as an example of the V-belt, there is a raw edge-type belt (raw edge V-belt) in which a frictional power transmission surface (V-shaped side surface) is an exposed rubber layer. Examples of the raw edge-type belt include, in addition to raw edge V-belts with no cogs provided, so-called cogged V-belts such as a raw edge cogged V-belt in which bendability is improved by providing cogs only on the inner peripheral surface of the belt, and a raw edge cogged V-belt (raw edge double cogged V-belt) in which bendability is improved by providing cogs on both the inner peripheral surface and the outer peripheral surface of the belt.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, in the V-belt, from the viewpoint of improving the lateral pressure resistance and the transmission force, it is required to increase the thickness of the entire belt (that is, to increase the area of the frictional power transmission surface). On the other hand, from the viewpoint of improving the bending fatigue resistance and the transmission efficiency, it is required to maintain good bendability by, for example, reducing the thickness of the entire belt. The cogs of the cogged V-belt are provided to meet such antinomy requirements. That is, cog ridges ensure a large frictional power transmission surface to improve the lateral pressure resistance and the transmission force, and cog valleys ensure the good bendability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Incidentally, in the cogged V-belt, a series of operations (bending deformation) of bending and releasing the belt before and after winding around the pulley is continuously repeated. Specifically, since the belt wound around the pulley is bent around a cord, the belt distorts in a state where bending stress due to bending deformation is generated on the outer peripheral side of the cord and compression stress due to compression deformation is generated on the inner peripheral side of the cord. Then, the distortion is released as the belt moves away from the pulley with the running. During the running of the belt, the distorted state (curved shape) and the released state (planar shape) are repeated. In this series of operations (bending deformation), the bending of the cog valley is larger than the bending of the cog ridge. Therefore, the fatigue of a compression rubber layer repeatedly bent in the cog valley increases, and cracks are more likely to occur in the compression rubber layer in the cog valley than in the cog ridge. In particular, stress due to bending deformation is likely to be concentrated on the bottom portion of the cog valley (including the deepest portion of the cog valley), and various methods for relaxing the stress on the bottom portion of the cog valley to prevent cracks in the cog valley have been proposed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a cogged belt, in which a curve of a bottom portion of a cog valley is formed by a curve in which arcs having a plurality of curvatures are continuous, a curvature of an arc forming a curve of the deepest portion of the bottom portion of the cog valley among the arcs having the plurality of curvatures is formed to be the smallest (excluding zero curvature), and a curvature of an arc forming a curve close to a side surface of a cog ridge is formed to be large.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, Patent Literature 2 discloses a cogged V-belt, in which a tip portion in a projecting direction of each cog and a bottom portion of each groove portion are formed by a curved surface having an arc-shaped cross section, a curvature radius in the cross-sectional shape of the bottom portion of the groove portion is larger than a curvature radius in the cross-sectional shape of the tip portion of the cog, the cogged V-belt includes a cord embedded portion in which a cord is embedded, and a compression portion provided on the inner peripheral surface side of the cord embedded portion, and the cog and the groove portion are provided in the compression portion.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 3733005</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent No. 6227847</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The cogged V-belt targeted in the present invention is a large-sized cogged V-belt suitable for a power transmission mechanism (in particular, a belt-type variable speed device) of a maximum-scale agricultural machine or the like. The size of the belt is, for example, a belt corresponding to HL to HQ (referred to in &#x201c;ISO 3410: 1989&#x201d;) among standard products of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE). There are standard products having a belt width (upper width) of 44.5 mm to 76.2 mm and a belt thickness of 19.8 mm to 30.5 mm, and also there is, for example, a nonstandard product having a belt thickness of 36 mm.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">The cogged V-belt applied to such a power transmission mechanism of the maximum scale is one applied to a scale larger than the scale assumed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2, and it is necessary to design a unique product according to the use and the use environment. Therefore, simply diverting the design ideas of Patent Literatures 1 and 2 cannot be applied to the use environment of the cogged V-belt targeted in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">That is, in a belt-type variable speed device belonging to a small-sized (small-scale) use environment, it is necessary to ensure high bendability by giving priority to being able to be wound around a pulley having a small diameter. On the other hand, in a belt-type variable speed device belonging to a large-sized (large-scale) use environment, it is necessary to ensure a high level of the lateral pressure resistance and the transmission force in order to withstand the load level of the power transmission mechanism while appropriately ensuring bendability.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">Specifically, in the cogged V-belt applied to the large-sized (large-scale) use environment, since the lateral pressure received from the pulley is enormous, it is necessary to take measures of increasing the belt thickness (the area of the frictional power transmission surface) or increasing the hardness (increasing the elastic modulus) of the rubber layer, in order to secure the sufficient lateral pressure resistance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">Alternatively, since the tension applied to the belt is also enormous, it is necessary to take measures of increasing the elastic modulus of the belt. Since the elastic modulus of the belt is governed by a cord which is a tension member, a cord having high rigidity is used to increase the elastic modulus of the belt. Specifically, in order to increase the rigidity of the cord, for example, a material having a high elastic modulus is used, the diameter is increased, the belt width is increased for increasing the number of turns of the cord, or the cord is densely arranged by narrowing the interval when the width cannot be increased. Therefore, a portion in which the cord is embedded becomes rigid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">Then, in either case, these measures impair the bendability of the belt, and the stress of the cog valley received by the bending deformation is enormous.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">Actually, even if the cog shapes described in Patent Literatures 1 and 2 (for example, an arc R of the deepest portion of the bottom portion of the cog valley, an arc R forming the curve close to the side surface of the tip portion of the cog, and a shape of the tip portion of the cog) are simply enlarged in a homothetic manner and applied to the cogged V-belt having the maximum size of HL to HQ, the effect of preventing cracks cannot be sufficiently obtained in the large-sized (large-scale) use environment targeted in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problems, and an object thereof is to provide a cogged V-belt being capable of ensuring the high lateral pressure resistance and transmission force, relaxing stress at a bottom portion of a cog valley (including the deepest portion of the cog valley) on which the stress due to bending deformation is likely to be concentrated, and preventing the occurrence of cracks in the cog valley, in a cogged V-belt of a large size suitable for a power transmission mechanism (in particular, a belt-type variable speed device) of an agricultural machine or the like of a maximum scale.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0018">The above-described object of the present invention is achieved by the following configurations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">(1) A cogged V-belt,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">including a cog portion in which a large number of cog ridges and cog valleys are alternately provided along a belt longitudinal direction, provided at least on a belt inner peripheral side, and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">having a belt thickness H of 19 to 36 mm and a cog height H<sub>1 </sub>of 14 to 19 mm,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">in which the cog valley has a cross-sectional shape in a cross section in the belt longitudinal direction, including:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023">a bottom portion formed by combining a plurality of continuous arcs; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024">side walls of the cog valley inclined with respect to a belt thickness direction,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">in which the plurality of arcs forming the bottom portion has curvature radius decreasing as a distance from a deepest portion of the cog valley increases, and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">in which the plurality of arcs includes a first arc, and the first arc passes through the deepest portion of the cog valley, has a diameter larger than a virtual circle tangent to three points of the deepest portion and the side walls on both sides of the cog valley, and has a curvature radius R<sub>1 </sub>of 7 to 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">According to this configuration, even in a cogged V-belt having a large size suitable for a power transmission mechanism of an agricultural machine or the like of a maximum scale, it is possible to ensure the high lateral pressure resistance and transmission force, to relax and disperse stress at the bottom portion of the cog valley on which the stress due to bending deformation is likely to be concentrated, and to prevent the occurrence of cracks in the cog valley. In addition, since the bottom portion is formed by the plurality of arcs whose curvature radius decreases as the distance from the deepest portion of the cog valley increases, a length of the cog portion in the belt longitudinal direction (cog width) can be increased as compared with a case where the bottom portion of the cog valley is formed by only the first arc having the curvature radius

In the case where the first rubber component contains the chloroprene rubber, the proportion of the chloroprene rubber is the same as the proportion of the ethylene-&#x3b1;-olefin elastomer.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">(First Short Fiber)</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">The rubber composition forming the compression rubber layer <b>17</b> may further contain first short fibers. Examples of the first short fibers include: synthetic short fibers such as polyamide short fibers (polyamide 6 short fibers, polyamide 66 short fibers, polyamide 46 short fibers, aramid short fibers, or the like), polyalkylene arylate short fibers (for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) short fibers and polyethylene naphthalate short fibers), liquid crystal polyester short fibers, polyarylate short fibers (amorphous wholly aromatic polyester short fibers or the like), vinylon short fibers, polyvinyl alcohol-based short fibers, and polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO) short fibers; natural short fibers such as cotton, hemp, and wool; and inorganic short fibers such as carbon short fibers.

Among these, the aramid short fibers and the PBO short fibers are preferable, and the aramid short fibers are particularly preferable.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0065">The first short fibers may be short fibers obtained by cutting fibers stretched in a fibrous shape into a predetermined length. The first short fibers are preferably oriented in the belt width direction and embedded in the compression rubber layer <b>17</b> in order to prevent compression deformation of the belt due to the lateral pressure from the pulley (that is, in order to enhance the lateral pressure resistance). In addition, since noise (sound generation) can be prevented by reducing the friction coefficient of the surface and wear due to friction with the pulley can be reduced, it is preferable to make the short fibers protrude from the surface of the compression rubber layer <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0066">An average fiber length of the first short fibers may be, for example, about 0.1 to 20 mm, preferably about 0.5 to 15 mm (for example, about 0.5 to 10 mm), and more preferably about 1 to 6 mm (particularly about 2 to 4 mm), from the viewpoint that the lateral pressure resistance and the wear resistance can be improved without reducing the bendability. If the fiber length of the first short fibers is too short, the mechanical characteristics in a grain direction cannot be sufficiently enhanced, and the lateral pressure resistance and the wear resistance may be reduced.

If the single yarn fineness is too large, the lateral pressure resistance and the wear resistance per blending amount may decrease, and if the single yarn fineness is too small, the dispersibility in rubber may decrease and the bendability may decrease.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068">The first short fibers may be subjected to an adhesion treatment (or a surface treatment) by a common method in order to increase the adhesive strength with the first rubber component.

Examples of the surface treatment agent include an RFL liquid containing resorcin (R), formaldehyde (F) and rubber or latex (L) [for example, an RFL liquid containing a condensate (RF condensate) formed by resorcin (R) and formaldehyde (F), and the rubber component such as vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber], an epoxy compound, a polyisocyanate compound, a silane coupling agent, and a vulcanized rubber composition (for example, a vulcanized rubber composition containing wet-process white carbon containing a surface silanol group and containing hydrated silicic acid as a main component, which is advantageous for enhancing the chemical bonding force with rubber).

If the proportion of the first short fibers is too small, the lateral pressure resistance and the wear resistance may decrease, and if the proportion is too large, the processability may decrease, or the bendability of the belt may decrease, such that the durability may decrease.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0070">(Other Components)</p><p id="p-0071" num="0071">Examples of the rubber composition forming the compression rubber layer <b>17</b> include a vulcanizing agent or a cross-linking agent (or a cross-linking agent based additive) (a sulfur-based vulcanizing agent or the like), a co-cross-linking agent (bismaleimides or the like), a vulcanization aid or a vulcanization accelerator (a thiuram accelerator or the like), a vulcanization retarder, a metal oxide (zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, barium oxide, iron oxide, copper oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, or the like), a reinforcing agent (carbon black, or silicon oxide such as hydrous silica), a filler (clay, calcium carbonate, talc, mica, or the like), a softener (oils such as paraffin oil and naphthenic oil), a processing agent or a processing aid (stearic acid, metal stearate, wax, paraffin, fatty acid amide, or the like), an anti-aging agent (an antioxidant, an anti-heat aging agent, a bending-crack inhibitor, an ozone-deterioration inhibitor, or the like), a coloring agent, a tackifier, a plasticizer, a coupling agent (a silane coupling agent or the like), a stabilizer (an ultraviolet absorber, a heat stabilizer, or the like), a flame retardant, and an antistatic agent.

In addition, in a width direction of the belt, since the belt is symmetrical with respect to a width center, only half of the belt in the width direction is modeled, and the plane of symmetry is restrained in the plane.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0116">Then, in the model of the cord layer <b>34</b>, since there is a large difference in rigidity between bending rigidity and tensile rigidity, the rubber portion <b>33</b> and the adhesion rubber layer <b>35</b> are the same solid element, and in addition, a truss element is disposed in a neutral plane in the thickness direction in the cord layer <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the bending rigidity is given to the solid element, and the tensile rigidity is given to the truss element.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, while the one surface <b>1</b> (<b>31</b>) is fixed in the plane and the other surface <b>2</b> (<b>32</b>) is maintained in a planar state, the cogged V-belt <b>10</b> is inclined so as to be bent, and is bent so as to have a predetermined curvature (specifically, such that a pulley pitch diameter during bending (that is, a winding diameter in the cord layer <b>34</b> of the belt) is 300 mm in diameter). Further, a pulley surface <b>36</b> (rigid body) was disposed on a side surface of the cogged V-belt <b>10</b>, and a predetermined lateral pressure (14,000 N as a pressing force of the pulley against the belt) was applied to the pulley surface <b>36</b> to apply a lateral pressure to the cogged V-belt <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">Here, as physical property values used for the analysis, the solid element has material characteristics (C10, C01) of Mooney-Rivlin, which is a superelastic material model. The rubber portion was set to C10=1.82 MPa and C01=0.455 MPa, the adhesion rubber layer <b>35</b> was set to C10=1.26 MPa and C01=0.314 MPa, and the solid element portion of the cord layer <b>34</b> was set to C10=6.67 MPa and C01=1.67 MPa.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">In addition, a truss element portion of the cord layer <b>34</b> was a linear material model, the Young's modulus was set to 28,929 MPa, the Poisson's ratio was set to 0.3, and the cross-sectional area per linear material on the model was set to 3.14 mm<sup>2 </sup>(however, that of the cord at the end was set to a half, 1.57 mm<sup>2</sup>). The FEM analysis was performed, and the stress generated at the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> was evaluated by the von Mises stress.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">In addition, according to the analysis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, it was found that when the bending and the lateral pressure simultaneously act on the cogged V-belt <b>10</b>, the cog ridge <b>11</b> slightly causes buckling deformation. In addition, it was found that the stress generated in the cog valley <b>12</b> is lowest at an end portion of the cogged V-belt <b>10</b> in the width direction, and the von Mises stress exhibits the maximum value at a center portion in the belt width direction. In addition, the cog portion <b>13</b> is also compressed in the belt width direction by the lateral pressure from the pulley being applied to the side surface portion of the cogged V-belt <b>10</b>. As a compression amount of the cog portion <b>13</b> in the belt width direction increases, problems such as wear of the cogged V-belt <b>10</b> and popping out of the cord <b>18</b> tend to occur. In this analysis and evaluation, a belt width reduction rate was used as an index indicating the degree of compression in the belt width direction. The belt width reduction rate is a ratio of the compression amount (which is synonymous with a so-called compression rate) with respect to the upper width W before the lateral pressure from the pulley acts.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0121">(Pass/Fail Determination Criteria of Analysis Result by Finite Element Method)</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">Regarding the cogged V-belt <b>10</b> having various cog shapes verified as Examples and Comparative Examples described below, a three-dimensional finite element model was created and analyzed to calculate a maximum value X of the von Mises stress generated at the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> and a maximum value Y of the width reduction rate.

In the case where the curvature radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the arc (first arc <b>21</b>) of the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> is 7 to 10 mm (7.5 to 9.5 mm in experimental data), and the curvature radius R<sub>2 </sub>of the arc (second arc <b>22</b>) continuously connected to both sides from the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> is smaller than R<sub>1</sub>, preferably is 1.8 to 2.5 mm, the stress generated at the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> during the belt bending is reduced, the lateral pressure resistance is ensured, and the belt width reduction rate is reduced.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0168">In the cogged V-belt <b>10</b> of Comparative Example 5 (R<sub>1</sub>=6.4 mm, R<sub>2</sub>=2.3 mm) in which the contour shape of the cog portion <b>13</b> is maintained as it is and the dimensions of each portion are simply enlarged in a similar shape (proportionally calculated in the thickness direction) with respect to the small-sized cogged V-belt of Patent Literature 1 shown as the reference, the maximum value X of the von Mises stress generated at the deepest portion A of the cog valley <b>12</b> is slightly small at 4.1 MPa, whereas the maximum value Y of the belt width reduction rate is large at 7.6%. That is, although the belt of Comparative Example 5 has the effect of reducing the stress during bending, since the contact area with the pulley cannot be sufficiently ensured, the belt lacks the lateral pressure resistance sufficient to withstand the level of the load of the power transmission mechanism in a large-sized (large-scale) use environment.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0169">Accordingly, by simply applying the cog shape described in Patent Literature 1 or Patent Literature 2, which is not assumed to be applied to a large-sized (large-scale) use environment, to be enlarged in a similar manner, it is not possible to ensure the lateral pressure resistance or the transmission force necessary for the level of the load of the power transmission mechanism in the large-sized (large-scale) use environment.
