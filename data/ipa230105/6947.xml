A response system according to a first embodiment is an FAQ chatbot system that outputs a response sentence to a question sentence received from the user. The FAQ chatbot system is a system that searches a database (DB) consisting of pairs of a question sentence and an answer sentence and presents an appropriate response sentence. A response sentence may include only an answer sentence, or may include both a question sentence and an answer sentence. It is assumed that the pairs of a question sentence and an answer sentence have been created in advance by the administrator or the operator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a response system <b>1000</b> according to the first embodiment. The response system <b>1000</b> includes a terminal <b>100</b> and a server <b>200</b>. The terminal <b>100</b> and the server <b>200</b> are connected to each other via the network N. The network N may be wired or wireless.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The functions of the server <b>200</b>, which will be described later, may be provided on the terminal <b>100</b> side. A system in which the server <b>200</b> is not included and the processing is completed in the terminal <b>100</b> may also be included in the response system according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The terminal <b>100</b> is a terminal operated by a user who uses the response system <b>1000</b>. The terminal <b>100</b> may be a personal computer (PC) or a smartphone. The terminal <b>100</b> may also be a robot such as a communication robot.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The terminal <b>100</b> includes an input device <b>110</b> for a user to input a question sentence, a display device <b>120</b> such as a display, and a control unit <b>130</b>. The input device <b>110</b> may be a device for inputting text (for example, a mouse, a keyboard, a touch panel) or a device for inputting voice (for example, a microphone). The display device <b>120</b> displays a response sentence that is returned in response to a user's question sentence. The terminal <b>100</b> may output a response sentence, corresponding to a user's question sentence, by voice. In such a case, the terminal <b>100</b> does not have to include the display device <b>120</b>. The control unit <b>130</b> includes the components such as a processor and a memory. The control unit <b>130</b> acquires a question sentence entered from the input device <b>110</b>, sends it to the server <b>200</b>, and causes the display device <b>120</b> to display a response sentence output by the server <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The server <b>200</b> includes a storage unit <b>210</b> and a control unit <b>220</b>. The storage unit <b>210</b> is a storage device such as a hard disk and a flash memory. The storage unit <b>210</b> stores a FAQ-DB <b>211</b> that stores a plurality of pairs of a question sentence and an answer sentence. The storage unit <b>210</b> is also referred to as an agent information storage unit. It is assumed that a question sentence and an answer sentence are each represented by a vector in advance. The FAQ-DB <b>211</b> stores, for example, the text of a question sentence, the text of an answer sentence, the word vector of each of the words included in the question sentence, and the word vector of each of the words included in the answer sentence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The storage unit <b>210</b> may further store a word vector dictionary (not shown) used, for example, for analysis of question sentences.

The processor executes the response program to cause the control unit <b>220</b> to operate as an acquisition unit <b>221</b>, an analysis unit <b>222</b>, a response sentence selection unit <b>223</b>, a response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b>, and an output unit <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The acquisition unit <b>221</b> is a module that acquires a user's question sentence entered from the terminal <b>100</b>. The acquisition unit <b>221</b> is also referred to as a speech acquisition unit for acquiring the speech of the user. A user's question sentence is input, for example, via the chat interface. A question sentence may be input by voice or by text. Note that, when inputting a question sentence via the voice interface, it is necessary to recognize the voice and to perform processing to convert the input voice information into text.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The analysis unit <b>222</b> is a module that analyzes the acquired question sentence and calculates the score of each of the question sentences stored in the FAQ-DB <b>211</b>. The calculated score is used when the response sentence selection unit <b>223</b>, which will be described later, selects a response sentence. The detail of the operation of the analysis unit <b>222</b> will be described later.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The response sentence selection unit <b>223</b> selects a response sentence, stored in advance in the FAQ-DB <b>211</b>, according to the acquired question sentence. In other words, the response sentence selection unit <b>223</b> is a module that selects a response sentence to be output by each agent according to the score calculated by the analysis unit <b>222</b>. The response sentence selection unit <b>223</b> may select a question sentence having the maximum score and the corresponding answer sentence as the response sentence based on the score calculated by the analysis unit <b>222</b>. The response sentence selection unit <b>223</b> may also select a plurality of response sentences and determine the priority of each of the response sentences.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> is a module that replaces a word, contained in the response sentence selected by the response sentence selection unit <b>223</b>, with a word contained in the question sentence acquired by the acquisition unit <b>221</b>. The detail of the operation of the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> will be described later.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The output unit <b>225</b> is a unit that outputs the converted response sentence to the terminal <b>100</b>. The output unit <b>225</b> is also called a screen display unit. In other words, the output unit <b>225</b> is a module that displays the response sentence of each agent on the display device <b>120</b> of the terminal <b>100</b>. The output unit <b>225</b> may output the user's question sentence along with the response sentence. As described above, the response sentence may include only the answer sentence, or may include both the question sentence and the answer sentence. The output unit <b>225</b> may display a plurality of response sentences according to priority. Furthermore, the output unit <b>225</b> may cause the speaker (not shown) of the terminal <b>100</b> to output the response sentence by voice.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, a part or all of the functions of the control unit <b>220</b> may be provided on the terminal <b>100</b> side. Furthermore, the storage unit <b>210</b> may also be provided on the terminal <b>100</b> side. Therefore, the response system <b>1000</b> does not have to include the server <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the operation of the analysis unit <b>222</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It is assumed that the analysis unit <b>222</b> has received a question sentence in text form. First, the analysis unit <b>222</b> formats the text of the question sentence (step S<b>101</b>). More specifically, the analysis unit <b>222</b> unifies the character size (full-size/half-size) of the characters included in the question sentence and replaces specific words.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, the analysis unit <b>222</b> divides the formatted question sentence into a plurality of words (step S<b>102</b>). Word division is implemented by a known technique such as the Viterbi algorithm or long short-term memory (LSTM).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the analysis unit <b>222</b> converts each word, generated as the result of word division, into a word vector using a word vector dictionary <b>212</b> created in advance (step S<b>103</b>). Through this conversion, the analysis unit <b>222</b> acquires the word vector of the words included in the question sentence. The word vector dictionary <b>212</b> may be implemented by known techniques such as Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram, or by an extended version of them such as Global Vectors (GloVe). Note that the analysis unit <b>222</b> does not have to convert all parts of speech into vectors. For example, the analysis unit <b>222</b> may convert only nouns and verbs into vectors.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, the analysis unit <b>222</b> calculates the sentence vector of the question sentence from the list of word vectors (step S<b>104</b>). The sentence vector may be calculated by a method of averaging the word vectors or by a method of using deep neural network (DNN) such as LSTM based on the word vectors.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, the analysis unit <b>222</b> calculates the scores each representing the degree of similarity between the sentence vector of a question sentence stored in the FAQ-DB <b>211</b> and the sentence vector of the user's question sentence (step S<b>105</b>). The FAQ-DB <b>211</b> stores the text <b>2111</b><i>a </i>of a question sentence <b>2111</b> and the word vector <b>2111</b><i>b </i>of each of the one or more words included in the question sentence <b>2111</b>. The FAQ-DB <b>211</b> also stores the text <b>2112</b><i>a </i>of an answer sentence <b>2112</b> and the word vector <b>2112</b><i>b </i>of each of the one or more words included in the answer sentence <b>2112</b>. Therefore, the sentence vector of the stored question sentence <b>2111</b> can be calculated based on the word vectors <b>2111</b><i>b </i>in the same manner as the sentence vector of the user's question sentence. The calculated sentence vectors may also be stored in the FAQ-DB <b>211</b> in advance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The score is calculated, for example, by calculating the cosine distance between sentence vectors. The score may also be calculated using a classification model of machine learning such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The score may also be the classification probability used in a machine learning classification model.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After that, the analysis unit <b>222</b> passes the calculated scores and the information on the corresponding response sentences to the next processing. The calculated scores are used by the response sentence selection unit <b>223</b> to select a response sentence.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, the operation of the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> will be described in detail. The response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> uses the word vector of each word, extracted by the analysis unit <b>222</b>, to calculate the degree of similarity between a word included in the user's question sentence and a word included in the response sentence selected by the response sentence selection unit <b>223</b>. More specifically, the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> calculates the degree of similarity between each word included in the response sentence and each word included in the user's question sentence. The degree of similarity between words may be the cosine distance between the word vectors.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, the response sentence may include both a question sentence and an answer sentence. Therefore, the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> may calculate the degree of similarity between a word included in the selected answer sentence and a word included in the user's question sentence and, in addition, may calculate the degree of similarity between a word included in the selected question sentence and a word included in the user's question sentence. The response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> does not have to convert all parts of speech, but may convert only the nouns and verbs. A part of speech such as an adjective may also be converted.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> determines a word that is included in the user's question sentence and that has the maximum degree of similarity with a word included in the response sentence. In other words, the response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> extracts a combination of a word included in the response sentence and a word having the maximum degree of similarity with that word.

It is assumed that a plurality of users uses the response system <b>1000</b> on a daily basis and that the history of question sentences of each user is accumulated (step S<b>201</b>). The response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> creates a list of words (for example, nouns and verbs) extracted from the words included in the history of question sentences (step S<b>202</b>). For example, the list of user A includes many words including &#x201c;operation&#x201d;, &#x201c;manual&#x201d;, &#x201c;where&#x201d;, and &#x201c;URL.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The response system <b>1000</b> can calculate the degree of similarity between each of the words included in the list of user A and each of the words included in the response sentence to be sent to user A and, based on the calculated degree of similarity, convert one or more words included in the response sentence. When there are many words included in the list, the processing may proceed to step S<b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The response sentence conversion unit <b>224</b> generates a vocabulary vector based on the list (step S<b>203</b>). The vocabulary vector is calculated by referring to the word vector dictionary and by calculating the average (for example, simple average) of the word vectors of the plurality of words included in the list.

Note that a word having a high degree of similarity with the vocabulary vector means a word with its word vector having a high degree of similarity with the vocabulary vector. For example, N words including &#x201c;operation&#x201d;, &#x201c;manual&#x201d;, &#x201c;control&#x201d;, and &#x201c;address&#x201d; are extracted from the list of user A.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this way, words around the vocabulary vector are extracted from the list. The vocabulary vector is a vector obtained by taking the average of a plurality of words included in the list. Therefore, the words around the vocabulary vector are considered to be the words that the user usually uses. Words may also be extracted based on the frequency of use of each word. The response system <b>1000</b> can convert the response sentence using the extracted N words.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The response system according to the first embodiment converts a word, included in the response sentence, into a word used in the question sentence. By using the word included in the question sentence, the response system according to the first embodiment can reduce a user's oversight caused due to a difference in expression.

Therefore, the response system eliminates the need for preparing, in advance, the templates of answer sentences each with a different expression and the patterns of question sentences. In addition, the response system according to the first embodiment, which changes the response contents according to the user's question, makes it possible to soften the mechanical impression for realizing a natural dialogue interaction.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the response system according to the first embodiment can use the history of user's question sentences to further convert a word included in a response sentence.
