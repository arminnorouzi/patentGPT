These diseases may occur individually but are usually closely related to each other and occur together with various symptoms in most cases.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Overweight and obesity increase blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which are causes of the onset or exacerbation of various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. In addition, overweight and obesity are major factors that increase the incidence of arteriosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or heart disease in children and adolescents as well as adults.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Obesity is a complex disease involving mechanisms of action of appetite control and energy metabolism, and thus methods of treating abnormal mechanisms of action related to appetite control and energy metabolism are required to be performed simultaneously, and efforts to develop a drug capable of treating the abnormal mechanisms of action are continuously being made. As a result of the efforts, anti-obesity drugs such as rimonabant (Sanofi-Aventis), sibutramine (Abbott), contrave (Takeda), orlistat (Roche) have been developed, but these have the disadvantages of showing fatal side effects or having insufficient effects on the treatment of obesity. For example, it has been reported that rimonabant shows central nervous system side effects, sibutramine and contrave show cardiovascular side effects, and orlistat has a body weight loss effect of only about 4 kg when taken for one year.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, metabolic syndrome including obesity increases the likelihood of causing diseases in the liver. Examples thereof include metabolic liver disease, fatty liver, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis. These liver diseases are increasing along with the increase in the population with obesity and diabetes, and the annual incidence rate in Korea is about 16%. Liver disease has no symptoms at the early stages and is only discovered at a fairly advanced stage, and is thus a leading cause of death not only in Korea but also worldwide, and the development of drugs for liver disease is highly required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, glucagon is produced in the pancreas when blood sugar starts to drop due to causes such as drug treatment or disease, hormone or enzyme deficiency, and the like. Glucagon is responsible for signaling the liver to break down glycogen to release glucose and raising the blood sugar levels to normal levels. However, the use of glucagon as a therapeutic agent has been limited because of its low solubility and precipitation at neutral pH.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a glucagon derivative, is a hormone secreted from the small intestine when stimulated by food intake, and promotes insulin secretion from the pancreas in a blood sugar concentration-dependent manner and inhibits glucagon secretion to help lower blood sugar levels. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) acts as a satiety factor to slow gastrointestinal digestion and delays the gastrointestinal transit time of digested food to diminish food intake.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Together with GLP-1, GIP, one of the gastrointestinal hormones secreted when stimulation due to food intake occurs, is a hormone composed of 42 amino acids secreted from K cells in the small intestine and functions to promote insulin secretion from the pancreas in a blood sugar concentration-dependent manner and to help lower blood sugar levels. The GLP-1 activity increasing effect, anti-inflammatory effect, lipid metabolism improving effect, and the like of GIP have been reported.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, studies to develop a therapeutic agent for diabetes and obesity by using the blood sugar control and body weight loss effects of GLP-1 are being actively conducted. However, GLP-1 alone shows HbA1c reduction of only 0.5% to 1.8%. and is thus considered to be appropriate for patients with HbA1c of 9% or less (<i>Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab. </i>2015 February; 6(1):3-18). In other words, there is a limit to the blood sugar control ability that can be expected due to single administration of GLP-1.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, studies on dual agonists capable of simultaneously activating GLP-1 and GIP receptors have been conducted, and examples of such dual agonists are described in WO 2013164483. WO 2016111971, WO 2014192284, and the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The glucagon and GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonists are generally known to have opposite actions, and have been used as therapeutic agents for different symptoms of disease. In other words, glucagon and GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonists perform opposite roles in the body, and drug treatment by concurrent administration of these has not yet been reported.

In an embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating metabolic syndrome is provided.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">The pharmaceutical composition comprising (i) a substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor; and (ii) a GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist of the present invention may be in a form a) in which (i) the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor; and (ii) the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist may be administered as a mixture; or</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">a form b) in which (i) the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor; and (ii) the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist can be administered may be administered in separate forms, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">For example, the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist may be formulated as one preparation, or separately formulated. When the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor; and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist are in separate forms, the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist may be formulated as separate preparations and administered simultaneously, separately, sequentially, or in reverse order.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">In the present invention, combined administration means not only simultaneous administration but is also understood as a dosage form in which the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist act together on an individual so that each of these may perform a function at a level equal to or higher than its intended function. Accordingly, as used herein, the term &#x201c;combined administration&#x201d; is to be understood as referring to the simultaneous, separate, sequential, or reverse administration of the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist. When the administration is sequential, reversed or separate administration, the order of administration is not particularly limited, but the administration interval of the second component is required to be such that the beneficial effect of the combined administration is not lost.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist, or a composition comprising these of the present invention may be provided in the form of a kit, but is not limited thereto. As used herein, the term &#x201c;kit&#x201d; may include the composition according to the present invention for combined administration of the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist. Specifically, the kit according to the present invention may comprise the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist formulated as one preparation, or separate preparations of the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist, and may additionally comprise a substance necessary for combined administration of the two substances, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor includes various substances exhibiting a significant level of activity with respect to the glucagon receptor, for example, substances in the form of compounds or peptides.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">Although not particularly limited thereto, the substance exhibiting a significant level of activity with respect to the glucagon receptor is not only native glucagon, but may also be one that exhibits in vitro activity with respect to the glucagon receptor to be 0.1% or more, 1% or more, 2% or more, 3% or more, 4% or more, 5% or more, 6% or more, 7% or more, 8% or more, 9% or more, 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 100% or more of that of a native ligand (native glucagon) of the corresponding receptor.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">Examples of the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor include native glucagon, an agonist thereof, or a derivative thereof, but are not particularly limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">The glucagon derivative according to the present invention includes peptides having one or more differences in amino acid sequence compared to native glucagon, peptides in which the native glucagon sequence is modified through modification, native glucagon mimics capable of activating the glucagon receptor like native glucagon. For example, the derivative of native glucagon is one in which one or more amino acids are mutated from the native glucagon, and the mutation may be a mutation selected from the group consisting of substitution, addition, deletion, modification, and any combination thereof, but is not particularly limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">Such a glucagon derivative may have a changed pI with respect to native glucagon to exhibit improved physical properties. The glucagon derivative may exhibit improved solubility while retaining the activity of activating the glucagon receptor, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">The glucagon derivative may be glucagon derivatives which do not occur naturally.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">Native glucagon may have the following amino acid sequence:</p><p id="p-0124" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;1)</entry></row><row><entry>His-Sre-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-</entry></row><row><entry>Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-</entry></row><row><entry>Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">As used herein, the term &#x201c;isoelectric point&#x201d; or &#x201c;pI&#x201d; refers to a pH value at which there is no net charge (0) in a certain molecule such as a polypeptide or peptide. For polypeptides in which various charged functional groups are present, the sum of these charges at pI is zero. The overall net charge of polypeptide will be negative at a pH higher than pI, and the overall net charge of polypeptide will be positive at a pH value lower than pI.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">The pI may be determined by isoelectric point electrophoresis on a fixed pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch or agarose, or by, for example, estimating the pI from the amino acid sequence using the pI/MW tool (http://expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html; Gasteiger et al., 2003) on the ExPASy server.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">As used herein, the term &#x201c;changed pI&#x201d; means that some sequences in the amino acid sequence of native glucagon are substituted with negatively and positively charged amino acid residues to have a pI different from that of native glucagon, namely, a pI decreased or increased from that of native glucagon. Peptides having this changed pI may exhibit improved solubility and/or high stability at neutral pH as glucagon derivatives. However, the peptide is not particularly limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">More specifically, the glucagon derivative may have a changed pI value rather than the pI value (6.8) of native glucagon, still more specifically a pI value of less than 6.8, specifically 6.7 or less, more specifically 6.5 or less, and a pI value of specifically more than 6.8, 7 or more, more specifically 7.5 or more, but is not limited thereto. A glucagon derivative is included in the scope of the present invention as long as it has a pI value different from that of native glucagon. In particular, a glucagon derivative is particularly included in the scope of the present invention as long as it has a pI value different from that of native glucagon, thus exhibits improved solubility compared to the native glucagon at neutral pH, and as a result, the degree of aggregation thereof is low.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">More specifically. the glucagon derivative may have a pI value of 4 to 6.5 and/or 7 to 9.5, more specifically 7.5 to 9.5, still more specifically 8.0 to 9.3, but is not limited thereto. In this case, the glucagon derivative has a pI higher or lower than that of native glucagon, and may thus exhibit improved solubility and higher stability compared to native glucagon at neutral pH. However, the glucagon derivative is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">Specifically, derivatives of native glucagon may be modified through any one method of substitution, addition, deletion or modification of some amino acids in native glucagon or any combination of these methods.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">Examples of glucagon derivatives prepared by a combination of these methods include peptides having one or more amino acid sequences different from those of native glucagon, deamination at the N-terminal amino acid residue, and a function of activating the glucagon receptor, but are not limited thereto. A derivative of native glucagon applied to the present invention may be prepared by combining various methods for preparing derivatives.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">Such modifications for the preparation of derivatives of native glucagon include all of modifications using L-amino acids or D-amino acids, and/or non-natural amino acids; and/or modifications of the native sequence, for example, modification of side chain functional groups and modifications of intramolecular covalent bonds such as inter-chain ring formation, methylation, acylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, aminohexylation, and biotinylation. The modifications include all of substitutions with non-natural compounds.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">The modifications include all those in which one or more amino acids are added to the amino and/or carboxy terminus of native glucagon.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0130">As the amino acids to be substituted or added, not only the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins but also atypical amino acids or those that do not occur naturally may be used. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich, ChemPep and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals.

In an aqueous solution of pH 3 or lower, glucagon is initially dissolved but precipitates within 1 hour due to gel formation. The gelled glucagon mainly consists of &#x3b2;-sheet fibrils, and the glucagon thus precipitated is not suitable for use as an injection since the gel clogs blood vessels when administered intravenously or by needle. In order to delay the precipitation process, it is customary to use an acidic (pH 2 to 4) formulation, and this can keep glucagon in a relatively non-aggregated state for a short period of time. However, since the fibril formation of glucagon occurs remarkably rapidly at low pH, such an acidic formulation is required to be injected immediately after preparation.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">The substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor of the present invention is a glucagon derivative, and includes those developed to have an extended action profile by changing the pI of native glucagon through substitution of negatively and positively charged amino acid residues. These derivatives have a changed pI compared to native glucagon at neutral pH and may thus exhibit improved solubility and/or higher stability.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">As a specific aspect, the glucagon derivative, which is the substance exhibiting activity with respect to the glucagon receptor of the present invention, may be a peptide including an amino acid sequence represented by the following Formula 1.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(Formula&#x2003;1,&#x2003;SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;46)</entry></row><row><entry>X1-X2-QGTF-X7-SD-X10-S-X12-X13-X14-X15-X16-X17-</entry></row><row><entry>X18-X19-X20-X21-F-X23-X24-WL-X27-X28-X29-X30</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0140" num="0135">In Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0141" num="0136">X1 may be tyrosine;</p><p id="p-0142" num="0137">X2 may be &#x3b1;-methyl-glutamic acid, Aib (aminoisobutyric acid), D-alanine, glycine, Sar (N-methylglycine), serine, or D-serine;</p><p id="p-0143" num="0138">X7 may be threonine, valine, or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0144" num="0139">X10 may be tyrosine or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0145" num="0140">X12 may be lysine or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0146" num="0141">X13 may be tyrosine or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0147" num="0142">X14 may be leucine or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0148" num="0143">X15 may be aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine;</p><p id="p-0149" num="0144">X16 may be glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, &#x3b1;-methyl-glutamic acid, or cysteine or absent;</p><p id="p-0150" num="0145">X17 may be aspartic acid, glutamine, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, serine, cysteine, or valine or absent;</p><p id="p-0151" num="0146">X18 may be alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, valine, or cysteine or absent;</p><p id="p-0152" num="0147">X19 may be alanine, arginine, serine, valine, or cysteine or absent;</p><p id="p-0153" num="0148">X20 may be lysine, histidine, glutamine, aspartic acid, arginine, &#x3b1;-methyl-glutamic acid, or cysteine or absent;</p><p id="p-0154" num="0149">X21 may be aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, valine, or cysteine or absent;</p><p id="p-0155" num="0150">X23 may be isoleucine, valine, or arginine or absent;</p><p id="p-0156" num="0151">X24 may be valine, arginine, alanine, cysteine, glutamic acid, lysine, glutamine, &#x3b1;-methyl-glutamic acid, or leucine or absent;</p><p id="p-0157" num="0152">X27 may be isoleucine, valine, alanine, lysine, methionine, glutamine, or arginine or absent;</p><p id="p-0158" num="0153">X28 may be glutamine, lysine, asparagine, or arginine or absent;</p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">X29 may be threonine;

For the increase or decrease or removal of such immunoglobulin Fc sugar chains, conventional methods such as chemical methods, enzymatic methods, and genetic engineering methods using microorganisms may be used. Here, the immunoglobulin Fc region in which sugar chains are removed from Fc does not induce an unnecessary immune response in vivo since its binding affinity to complement (c1q) is significantly reduced and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity is reduced or eliminated.

Fatty liver refers to a phenomenon in which triglycerides are abnormally deposited in liver cells unlike normal cases. A normal liver consists of about 5% adipose tissue, and triglycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesterol esters are the main components of fat. Once fatty liver occurs, most of the components are replaced with triglycerides, and it is diagnosed as fatty liver when the amount of triglycerides is 5% or more of the liver weight. Fatty liver is caused by disorders of fat metabolism in liver cells or defects in the process of transporting excess fat, and is mainly caused by disorders of fat metabolism in the liver.

The chronicity and deepening of liver inflammation is known to be one of the causes. It is known that liver fibrosis is reversible unlike liver cirrhosis, is composed of thin fibrils, and does not have nodule formation, and the liver may be recovered to the normal condition when the cause of liver damage is eliminated. However, when this liver fibrosis process continues repeatedly, crosslinking between the extracellular matrix (ECM) increases and liver fibrosis progresses to irreversible liver cirrhosis with nodules.

Common signs of cholestasis include fatigue, pruritus (itching), jaundice, and xanthomas (deposition of cholesterol-rich substances under the skin). The influence of cholestasis is severe and widespread, leading to exacerbation of liver disease into systemic disease, liver decompensation, and the need for liver transplantation. Causes of cholestasis liver disease include acute hepatitis and bile duct inflammation.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0450">The cholestasis liver disease may include primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), and Alagille syndrome (AS), but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0451">Primary biliary cirrhosis, also known as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), is a chronic cholestasis liver disease of unknown etiology. Progressive bile duct damage due to portal and periportal inflammation may lead to progressive fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis of the liver. Thus far, immunological, genetic and environmental factors are known as potential causes of the disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis is mainly seen in middle-aged women, and the symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis at early stage may also be fatigue, itching, or unexplained hyperlipidemia.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0452">PBC is known so far as an immune-mediated disease of primary biliary sclerosis. Specifically, immunohistochemical staining of T lymphocytes in the portal vein and periportal regions reveals CD4-positive and CD8-negative T cells. Abnormal suppressor T-cell activity has been reported in asymptomatic Grade 1-relatives of affected individuals. It has been reported that interleukins may play a role in the pathogenesis of PBC by contributing to altered immune function and fibrosis (G. J. Webb et al., <i>J.

The mechanism of action of both drugs in PBC is associated with their ability to activate FXR and TGFR-5 to exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, sufficient biochemical responses have not been achieved in about 40% of patients treated with UDCA.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0454">Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive cholestasis liver disease caused by inflammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic/extrahepatic biliary tract of unknown etiology. Specifically, PSC is an inflammatory disease of the bile duct and biliary tract, and fibrosis occurs and the bile duct wall thickens and narrows to cause biliary stricture as the disease progresses. Although the cause of PSC is still unknown, it is estimated that various factors such as genetic factors, environmental factors, and immune responses related thereto are a complex cause.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0455">It is diagnosed as primary sclerosing cholangitis when elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, elevated aminotransferase levels, and gammaglobulinemia are observed in liver function tests using blood.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0456">The treatment method for PSC has not yet been clearly reported, and liver transplantation is the only treatment method that can fundamentally treat PSC.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0457">Accordingly, there is still a need to develop a drug capable of treating PBS and PSC without side effects while securing patient convenience.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0458">&#x201c;Liver cirrhosis&#x201d; of the present invention is a chronic disease that occurs while hepatocyte regeneration and an increase in fibrous tissue repeatedly occur, is pathologically accompanied by necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis, and ultimately leads to cirrhosis complications such as liver decompensation and diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to death. Liver cirrhosis is asymptomatic especially at the early stages and is thus diagnosed only at a fairly advanced stage. It is required to quickly treat liver fibrosis, which is a condition before evolution to liver cirrhosis and the like.
