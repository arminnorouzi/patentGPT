Indeed, many materials, in particular polymeric ones, degrade when they come into contact with such solutions. It is therefore necessary to select and use suitable materials, which often have a high cost.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The need is therefore felt for an electric heater whose heating element is adequately insulated from the liquid to be heated, and which is made of materials compatible with the liquid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The need is also felt to optimize the heating of the substance, in particular when it is frozen, in particular in the solid state.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to produce an electric heater for heating a liquid, or a frozen substance, in particular in the solid state, in a motor vehicle, the heating element of which being adequately insulated from the substance, for example, from the liquid to be heated, and being made of materials compatible with the substance (for example, the liquid), and at the same time allowing an efficient heating, even of a frozen substance, and being also producible at low cost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this context, it is an object of the invention to produce an electric heater which also has a compact size.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention achieves at least one of such objects, and other objects which will be apparent in light of the present description, by means of an electric heater for heating a liquid or frozen substance in a motor vehicle, in particular, for heating the batteries of electric cars or for a HVAC system or for a system for reducing the environmental pollution of the motor vehicle; the electric heater comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a metal sheet adapted to generate heat when it is crossed by an electric current;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">two polymeric layers between which the metal sheet is arranged;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">two metal layers, between which the two polymeric layers are arranged;<br/>wherein the two metal layers are hermetically sealed to each other, defining a casing which prevents the substance to be heated from coming into contact with the two polymeric layers and with the metal sheet, preferably wherein a plurality of metal flaps is provided, extending transversely from an external face of at least one metal layer of said two metal layers, for example, of one of the two metal layers or of both metal layers.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Advantageously, the metal layers sealed to each other prevent the substance, for example the liquid, to be heated from coming into contact with the polymeric layers and with the metal sheet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Therefore, advantageously, it is not necessary to select and use polymeric layers which are compatible with the substance, for example with the liquid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">Advantageously, each metal layer intended to come into contact with the liquid is preferably provided, in all embodiments, with an external coating, or protective coating, or coating layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">The coating confers a better chemical resistance to the metal layer, which is protected from unwanted chemical interactions with the substance, for example, with the liquid, which may be, for example, water, a solution of water and urea or a solution of water and ethylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">The coating allows to expand the range of usable metal materials. The metal layer may, in fact, be coated with the most suitable coating according to the specific substance, for example, the specific liquid, to be heated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Advantageously, the aforesaid flaps allow a better transmission of the heat to the substance to be heated in a motor vehicle. The flaps are particularly useful when the substance is frozen, in particular, in solid form, since they penetrate the frozen mass, i.e., they may be included in the frozen substance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">Therefore, a heater is obtained which allows to optimize the heat transmission, allowing in particular to improve the thawing of a substance, and wherein the polymeric layers and the metal sheet are suitably protected by the substance to be heated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Advantageously, the heating metal sheet, or heating track, may be optionally provided with at least one PTC layer (PTC, Positive Temperature Coefficient) , i.e., the resistivity of which increases with the increase of the temperature. Thereby, it is substantially obtained a self-regulation of the temperature of the metal sheet, and therefore unwanted overheating of the polymeric layers is avoided. Therefore, the range of usable polymeric materials may be expanded.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">It is preferable to weld the metal layers to each other by means of laser welding. Laser welding is particularly advantageous, since it may be performed quickly and may be performed at relatively low temperatures and is therefore compatible with materials such as Aluminum. In particular, laser welding allows not to deform the metal layers which may also be made with thin thickness.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Furthermore, laser welding allows to avoid unwanted overheating of the polymeric layers arranged between the two metal layers.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The invention also relates to a device according to claim <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">The invention also relates to a process according to claim <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">In a particularly advantageous example, the electric heater can be arranged as a divider in the body of the aforesaid device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">Thereby, there is an optimization of the heat transmission between the electric heater and the substance, for example, the liquid, since most of the external surface of the electric heater may come into contact with the substance, for example, the liquid, while only a small part is in contact with the body of the device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The device may advantageously have a small size, for example, it may have an internal volume, in particular for the liquid, from 0.5 to 5 liters. The internal volume may however be, for example, from 0.5 to 30 liters, preferably from 0.5 to 5 liters or from 12 to 24 liters.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">For example, the device may advantageously be used for heating batteries in electric cars or for the HVAC system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">For example, the device may be inserted inside the cooling circuit of the motor vehicle, so as not to have to add an additional heat exchange tank.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">For example, the device may be used for heating a solution of water and urea or of water and ethylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">In the present description, &#x201c;liquid or frozen substance&#x201d; means, in particular, a liquid which may be subject to freezing and thawing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Further features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in light of the detailed description of non-exclusive example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">The dependent claims describe particular embodiments of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0036">In the description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which are provided by way of non-limiting example, in which:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a section of an example of electric heater in accordance with the invention, in which some optional components are not shown;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an enlarged detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a detail of an optional feature of an electric heater in accordance with the invention;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a section of a particular example of an electric heater according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an electric heater according to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a device in accordance with the invention;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a component of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a sectional view of an example of device in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> diagrammatically shows a sectional view of another example of device in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0044" num="0046">The same elements, or functionally equivalent elements, have the same reference numeral in the Figures.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0047">With reference to the Figures, example embodiments of an electric heater <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; in accordance with the invention are described.
