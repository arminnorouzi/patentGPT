The X-ray imaging apparatus is configured for dark-field X-ray (&#x201c;DAX&#x201d;-) imaging and/or phase-contrast (&#x201c;&#x3a6;&#x201d;-) imaging. The imaging apparatus XI includes an X-ray source XR and an X-radiation sensitive detector D. The imager XI may be configured for 2D radiography imaging or for 3D imaging such as a CT scanner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The image processing system IPS may be run as one or more software modules or routines on one or more data processing units PU such as one or more computers, servers, etc. The IPS may be arranged external to and remote of the imager XI, or the IPS is integrated into the imager XI, for instance into a work station associated with the imager XI or into an operator console. The image processing system IPS may be implemented in a distributed architecture to serve a group of imagers suitably connected in a communication network. Some or all components of the IPS may be arranged in hardware such as a suitably programmed FPGA (field-programmable-gate-array) or as hardwired IC chips. The image processing system IPS may be arranged partly in software and partly in hardware.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Broadly, the image processing system IPS includes an image generator IGEN that processes projection imagery &#x3c0;<b>1</b> acquired by the imager XI into dark-field and/or phase-contrast imagery. The image processing system IPS includes a scattering corrector SC to reduce scattering artifacts. The scattering corrected imagery as provided by the scattering corrector SC in cooperation with the image generator IGEN can then be displayed on a display unit DD or can be stored in a memory for later review, or can be otherwise further processed. The scattering corrector SC may be integrated into the image generator IGEN to form one functional unit. Alternatively, image generator IGEN and scattering corrector SC form separate functional units.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the imaging apparatus XI supplies the projection imagery &#x3c0;<b>1</b> directly, via wireless or a wired connection, to the image processing system IPS, this may not be so in all embodiments. For instance, the projection imagery &#x3c0; may be first stored in a memory such as a picture archiving system (PACS) of a hospital information system (HIS) or otherwise, and the imagery is retrieved at a later stage (e.g. upon user request) by the IPS and is then processed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, the imaging apparatus XI includes a DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator structure IFS. In embodiments, the DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator structure includes an interferometer G<b>0</b>,G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b>. The interferometer G<b>0</b>,G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b> includes one, two or three gratings. In embodiments, three gratings are used: two absorber gratings G<b>0</b>,G<b>2</b> and a phase grating G<b>1</b>, to be described more fully below. In general, the DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator structure is a device, or group of devices, that allows translating X-ray beam refraction and/or small angle scattering of the beam into intensity modulations detectable at the X-ray sensitive detector D, thereby facilitating resolving said modulations into dark-field and/or phase-contrast image signals and, if desired, into an attenuation image signal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the following main reference will be made to an interferometric imaging apparatus although this is not at the exclusion of other grating-based or non-interferometric imaging DAX/&#x3a6;-facilitator structures. Other, non-interferometric imaging DAX/&#x3a6;-facilitator structures include coded aperture systems, crystals, or non-grating based structures, with periodic or non-periodic sub-structures.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the dark-field or phase-contrast is obtainable by the DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator structure IFS imparting a periodic wave front modulation on the incoming imaging X-ray beam and by a measuring, with the X-ray detector D, a variation of the resulting wave-front caused be the object OB to be imaged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In more detail, and referring now to the (non-limiting) interferometric embodiment, between the X-ray source XR and the detector D there is defined an imaging region where the object OB (e.g., the chest of the subject) to be imaged resides during imaging. In the imaging region there is arranged the single, two or three (or more) grating structures of the interferometer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With continued reference to the (non-limiting) interferometric embodiment of the image facilitator structure DAX/&#x3a6;-IFS, periodicity, aspect ratio, etc. of the gratings are such that they cause diffraction of the X-ray beam and/or just enough coherence is achieved so that the small-angle scattering can be detected or derived. Absorption and phase gratings may be used. In one embodiment the gratings are formed by photolithography or cutting in silicon wafers to define a periodic pattern of trenches. Interspaces between the trenches of the absorption gratings G<b>0</b>,G<b>1</b> may be filled with lead or gold to form respective sets of absorbing lamellae. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the longitudinal axes of the grating lamella run perpendicular into the plane of the drawing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In yet more detail, and in one embodiment, an absorbing grating structure G<b>2</b> is arranged between the detector D and the object OB whilst the other grating G<b>1</b>, the phase grating, is arranged between the object OB and the X-ray detector D. In some embodiments there is also an additional grating G<b>0</b> arranged at the X-ray source XR, in case the X-ray source is incapable of generating natively coherent radiation. If the X-ray source produces incoherent radiation (which is usually the case), the absorption grating G<b>0</b> at the X-ray source (also referred to as the source grating) transforms the X-radiation corning out of the X-ray source into an, at least partly, coherent radiation beam XB. Inverse geometries where the G<b>1</b> is placed upstream the object OB, i.e. between XR and OB, are also envisaged. The interferometer is in embodiments of the Talbot-Lau type. The interferometer must be precisely adjusted with grating lamellae aligned. The distance between G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> is a suitable Talbot distance. When properly adjusted, fringe patterns can be detected at the detector D when exposed to X-radiation. Based on the fringe pattern, the DAX/&#x3a6; imagery can be generated by the image generator IGEN.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The interferometer G<b>0</b>, G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> is preferably focused. In other words, one, two or all three of the gratings G<b>0</b>, G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> have their lamella focused on the focal spot FS<b>1</b>. In some such focused embodiments, the gratings are curved to form respective lateral surfaces of three imaginary, concentric cylinders. A central axis of these imaginary cylinders passes through the focal spot FS<b>1</b> when properly focused. In particular, the absorption gratings G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are curved and/or focused. If the DAX/&#x3a6;-facilitator structure is not an interferometer, this too may be focused on the focal spot FS<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The at least partly coherent radiation beam XB propagates through the imaging region and interacts with the interferometer gratings G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b> and the patient OB. After said interaction, the radiation is then detected in form of electrical signals at radiation sensitive pixel elements of the detector D. Data acquisition circuitry DAS digitalizes the electrical signals into projection (raw) image data &#x3c0;<b>1</b>, which is then processed by the IPS in a manner explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The imaging apparatus XI may be of the full field-of-view (FoV) type, where the detector is of the flat panel type. In full FoV imaging system, the size of the detector D and the size of the IFS corresponds to the desired FoV. Alternatively, the detector D and the imaging facilitator structure IFS may be smaller than the intended FoV such as in slot-scanning systems as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some of these systems, the detector comprises a discrete series of detector lines. The detector lines are mounted on a scan arm to be scanned across the intended FoV in different slot-positions. The absorber grating G<b>2</b> is generally coextensive with the detector in full field-of-view (FoV) type imagers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Slot-scanning systems as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are more cost effective than full FoV system because they require smaller detectors and smaller gratings IFS. The gratings IFS are mounted on the scan arm above the detector and are equally scanned across the FoV. In alternative slot-scanning systems, although the detector D has the same size as the desired FoV, the gratings are smaller and a collimation SC is used to scan only parts of the FoV (in &#x201c;slots&#x201d;) at any one time as per the collimation. In a full FoV system and slot scanning systems with a non-moving flat panel detector, there is a simple one-to-one relationship between pixel position and imaginary geometrical rays that pass through the imaging region to define the imaging geometry. The rays extend from a focal spot of the X-ray source XR and intersect the detector plane at the respective pixel positions. Each one of the geometrical rays corresponds to a respective, different, single one of the pixels. No such simple relationship exists in some slot-scanning system with smaller detector, where each geometrical ray is seen by many different pixels in different &#x201c;slots&#x201d; during the scanning. Signals from different pixels are then processed together by a suitable logic for any single geometrical ray.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The image generator IGEN outputs the dark-field signals and/or the phase-contrast signals as respective arrays of image values which form the dark-field image and the phase-contrast image, respectively. These image values or pixel values represent respectively the contrast for the dark-field signal and the phase-change experienced by the X-radiation while traveling through the object OB, for the respective geometrical ray.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, when X-radiation interacts with material, it experiences both attenuation and refraction and hence phase change. The attenuation on the other hand can be broken down into attenuation that stems from photo-electric absorption and attenuation that stems from scatter. The scattering contribution in turn can be decomposed into Compton scattering and Rayleigh scattering. For present purposes of dark-field imaging it is the small angle scattering that is of interest, where the qualifier &#x201c;small angle&#x201d; means that the scatter angle is so small that the scattered photon still reaches the same pixel as it would have reached had it not been scattered at all.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The dark-field contribution can be modelled as visibility V=V<sub>0</sub>*e<sup>&#x2212;&#x222b;&#x3b5;(z)dz</sup>, with &#x3b5; is the spatial distribution of the diffusion property of the patient OB and the integration is performed along the X-ray beam path, and V<sub>0 </sub>being the reference visibility without object interaction (recorded in a calibration measurement). The dark-field signal as recorded in the dark-field image is then D=V/V<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Traditional radiography systems are usually incapable of resolving the detected signal into dark-field contribution. But by using the interferometer G<b>0</b>,G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or by using other DAX/&#x3a6; imaging facilitator structures IFS, it is possible to translate these contributions into an intensity pattern of fringes which can be analyzed by the image generator IGEN to obtain the phase-contrast and/or DAX image. The image generator IGEN acts on a series of projection images obtained in a phase stepping operation. Based on this recorded series of projection images &#x3c0;<b>1</b>, the image generator IGEN computationally resolves the detected fringe pattern in the series projection data &#x3c0;<b>1</b> into three contributions or signals, namely the refraction contribution (also referred to as the phase-contrast signal), the dark-field signal component and a remaining attenuation component. Because of these three contrast mechanisms acting together, the signal processing by the IGEN of the detected series of intensities proceeds in three signal channels (phase-contrast, dark-field, and attenuation).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the above described types of imaging system, the capability for dark-field/phase-contrast imaging is achieved as follows: the projection data is acquired at the detector D during the phase stepping operation (where the phase of the fringes is stepped typically over 360&#xb0;) as a series for a given fixed projection direction. The phase stepping operation is typically realized by inducing a motion between X-ray beam and one of the gratings of the image facilitator structure IFS (if an interferometer is used). For instance, in one embodiment the analyzer grating G<b>1</b> is moved (&#x201c;scanned&#x201d;) laterally relative to an optical axis of the X-ray beam. Alternatively, phase stepping can also be achieved by moving the patient OB as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or by moving the X-ray source, etc. This motion causes a change of the fringe pattern which in turn can be recorded in the corresponding series for each step of the motion thus resulting in phase stepping. This series of measurements form, for each geometrical ray, an associated phase curve. The phase curves are in general of sinusoidal shape and it has been found that each encodes the quantities of interest, in particular the dark-field signal, along with attenuation and phase change.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In yet more detail, the phase curves for each pixel/geometrical ray can be respectively analyzed, for instance by fitting to a sinusoidal signal model to effect the image generation. Preferably, there are at least three fitting parameters included in the three-channel sinusoidal model. The three fitting parameters represent, respectively, the three contributions phase-contrast, dark-field signal and attenuation. The sinusoidal model is fitted by image generator IGEN to the phase curves to so compute in particular the DAX and/or &#x3a6; image, and an attenuation (also called &#x201c;transmission&#x201d;) image, although this is of lesser interest herein. Computation of the apparently superfluous transmission image may be required to correctly account for the three contrast effects as otherwise incorrect contributions are incurred in the DAX and/or &#x3a6;-channel.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An optimization procedure is used to fit the measured series of projections to the model. The procedure can be understood in terms of as cost function and the fitting operation can be formulated as an optimization problem. Any suitable optimization scheme such as gradient descent, conjugate gradients, Newton-Raphson, stochastic gradients, Maximum Likelihood approach, other statistical techniques or others are also envisaged. Non analytical methods such as neural networks or other Machine Learning techniques may also be used.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In general, an optimization problem for a signal model S has the following structure:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>argmin<sub>T,D,&#x3c6;</sub><i>F=&#x2225;&#x3c0;&#x2212;S</i><sup>T,D,&#x3c6;</sup>(<i>X</i>)&#x2225;&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">wherein S<sup>T,D,&#x3c6;</sup>(.) is an at least three-channel modulator function that describes how the three contrast mechanism combine to modulate and transform the incoming (undisturbed) radiation X into the measured data &#x3c0;, and &#x2225;.&#x2225; is a suitable similarity measure, a p-norm for instance, (squared) Euclidean distance, etc. Function F, the objective function (in this case a cost function), measures how well the signal model S &#x201c;explains&#x201d;, or &#x201c;fits&#x201d;, the measured data it. The optimization task is how best to choose the parameters (T, D, &#x3d5;) of the model, with the similarity measure &#x2225;.&#x2225; quantifying the goodness of fit. The function F is thus a cost or error function. The task in the optimization is to improve the cost function by adjusting parameters (T, D, &#x3d5;). In this embodiment, the parameters are to be adjusted in the optimization so that the &#x201c;cost&#x201d; returned by the cost function F decreases. More than three channels may be used in signal model S, depending on the number of contrast mechanism one wishes to account for. In (<b>1</b>), F may be a function of residues (terms).

A phase retrieval algorithm is described in Pfeiffer et al in &#x201c;<i>Hard</i>-<i>X</i>-<i>ray dark</i>-<i>field imaging using a grating interferometer</i>&#x201d;, published in Nature Materials 7, pp 134-137 (2008). Other phase retrieval algorithms, Fourier-based or not, are also envisaged in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The DAX/&#x3a6; X-ray imaging system XI as proposed herein is configured to reduce, or to entirely eliminate, unfavorable scattering effects on an imaging operation. In particular, combating effects of large angle scattering, collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;secondary radiation&#x201d;, is advantageous in DAX imaging as preferably envisaged herein although scattering management is also advantageous for &#x3a6;-imaging. Large angle scattering management is advantageous for DAX imaging as in this imaging modality one wishes to exploit small angle scattering as a contrast mechanism. Following up on the definition of &#x201c;small angle&#x201d; scattering given above, &#x201c;large angle&#x201d; scattering as used herein is the complement of small angle. Specifically, large angle relates to scattering angles large enough so that the scattered photon no longer reaches the same pixel as it otherwise would have reached, had it not been scattered at all or had it been scattered by small angle only. In this connection, &#x201c;primary radiation&#x201d; includes only (or predominantly) radiation modulated only by absorption, phase contrast and the desired small angle scattering. Secondary radiation is predominantly modulated by large angle scattering.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">So that these two effects, large angle and small angle scattering, are not confounded, it is envisaged herein to reduce secondary radiation effects on the imagery obtainable by the proposed imaging system IPS. The proposed approach is a two pronged approach in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">In one prong, it is envisaged to provide the imager XI with an anti-scatter grid ASG to separate primary radiation from secondary radiation. In the second prong, the opposite is done, namely secondary radiation is separated from primary radiation to measure the amount of secondary radiation for the given object PAT one wishes to image. This measurement is then used to inform DAX-image generation by generator IGEN to compensate, remove, reduce, or suppress secondary radiation image artifacts.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">Turning now initially to the first prong, the ASG includes a set of lamella made from a high density material such as lead or other high Z-material. A longitudinal direction of the lamella extends into the drawing plane of the schematic drawing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. They preferably run the full length of one spatial dimension of the detector whilst a number of lamella is chosen to essentially cover the other spatial dimension. In other words, the ASG is co-extensive with a detector surface of the detector D. The lamella are preferably, but not necessarily in all embodiments, focused on the focal spot FS of the X-ray source XS. In other words, lamellae are arranged at a larger inclination the further away they are from a center point of the detector ASG.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">When focused or properly adjusted, the ASG lamella in front of the detector D block out unwanted secondary radiation. The best focus pose (that is, position and orientation) of the ASG is when the focal spot FS is situated on the imaginary line formed by a set of imaginary planes that one may pass through the respective lamellae at the given inclination of the respective lamella. The planes intersect in an imaginary line that is the central axis of the imaginary cylinders mentioned above in relation to the focused gratings G<b>0</b>, G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>. However, even in this focused arrangement, the ASG effectively blocks out only a certain fraction of secondary radiation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">In order to yet better account for substantially all, or at least a higher fraction of, secondary radiation effects, the second prong is provided. The second prong is implemented by a computerized control logic CL of the imaging system XI. The control logic causes the imaging system to assume a configuration in which a high fraction, or substantially all, of the incident, patient specific PAT secondary radiation can be measured by the detector D.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Broadly, the control logic CL is configured to allow operating the imaging system in two modes: (object) image acquisition mode and in a scattering measurement mode. The imaging system IS may include a user interface (not shown) to allow switching between scattering measurement mode and image acquisition mode. The user request for this switch may be received through touch screen action on a touch screen display, or by a pointer-device (eg, computer mouse), or any other UI input arrangement preferably provided at an operator console (not shown) of the imaging system IS.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In image acquisition mode, the DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator IFS and the ASG are in a focused arrangement as explained above, focused on a focal spot FS<b>1</b> of the X-ray source. In this arrangement, object imagery &#x3c0;I, in particular projection images, are acquired by operating the X-ray source to emanate an X-ray beam XB<b>1</b> along a primary (mean) radiation direction p<b>1</b> whilst the described components are aligned or focused relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The control logic CL is configured to switch from this object acquisition mode into the scattering measurement mode where an out-of-focus (relative to focal spot FS<b>1</b>) is achieved by effecting a change of the imaging geometry. In this out-of-focus arrangement, again the X-ray source is energized, but preferably at low dose (lower than the dose in image acquisition mode), to acquire a second set of projection data &#x3c0;<b>2</b>, a sample, that measures the fraction of secondary radiation. Multiple embodiments on how this out-of-focus imaging geometry can be achieved are envisaged and will be explored more fully below. The control logic CL is switchable to switch the imaging system IS into each of these modes, one after the other. In this manner, respective sets of measurement data &#x3c0;<b>1</b>, &#x3c0;<b>2</b> are measured at the detector and acquired at the data acquisition circuitry DAS and passed on to the image processing section IPS. The acquisition of the two data sets &#x3c0;<b>1</b>, &#x3c0;<b>2</b> can be done in any order.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Preferably, however, the scattering measuring data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> in the scattering measuring mode is acquired first in a first low dose exposure for a given patient. The measured scattering data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> encode the specific &#x201c;scattering footprint&#x201d; of the given patient that reflects the patient's individual anatomic tissue composition. It is expected that this scattering measurement &#x3c0;<b>2</b> needs to be done only once for the given patient PAT, and can be stored for later reference in a database or other memory such as a PACS in a HIS or similar. The scattering data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> may then be retrieved for follow-up imaging appointments. Alternatively, a new up-to-date scattering measurement &#x3c0;<b>2</b> is acquired more than once, possibly every time, when the patient is imaged, to so account for different posture/position of the patient which may also affect the secondary radiation detectable at the detector D.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The &#x201c;proper&#x201d; image data &#x3c0;<b>1</b> as acquired in object image acquisition mode is received in the image processing system IPS to apply any one of the above described DAX/&#x3a6; imaging processing algorithms, in particular phase retrieval algorithms, to extract the DAX or &#x3a6; information to so produce respectively scattering corrected DAX and/or &#x3a6; imagery of the patient. The scattering correction is achieved by the image generator IGEN interfacing with a scattering corrector component SC of the image processing system IPS. The scattering corrector component SC processes the scattering measurement data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> in coordination with the image generator. A number of different embodiments are envisaged for this which will be described.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">The measurement &#x3c0;<b>2</b> can either be used directly as scattering estimate or may be processed first by low-pass filtering or other pre-processing. The measurement &#x3c0;<b>2</b> (possibly so pre-processed) can serve as calibration input to scattering correction based on simulation computation of scatter. Monte Carlo methods may be used in the simulation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">In embodiments, the scattering corrector component SC and the image generator operate together on both data sets &#x3c0;<b>2</b>, &#x3c0;<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">Specifically, the scattering corrector CS may apply the scattering measurement &#x3c0;<b>2</b>-based correction pre-phase retrieval or post phase retrieval. For instance, the scattering data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> may be subtracted by the corrector SC from the image data &#x3c0;<b>1</b>, and it is the difference values |&#x3c0;<b>1</b>&#x2212;&#x3c0;<b>2</b>| that are then processed in the phase retrieval algorithm by the image generator IGEN. Alternatively, the DAX/&#x3a6; imagery I<sub>DAX </sub>or I<sub>&#x3a6;</sub> are generated first based on &#x3c0;<b>1</b> by the image generator IGEN, and &#x3c0;<b>2</b> is then subtracted from I<sub>DAX </sub>or I<sub>101 </sub> is otherwise combined to obtain scattering corrected imagery. In general, the scattering corrector component SC uses the scattering measurement data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> to correct the DAX and/or &#x3a6; imagery for artifacts due to secondary radiation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">In other embodiments, the scattering measurement data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> is fed by the scattering corrector component SC into the image generator IGEN and both data sets are processed together by the image generator IGEN to obtain scattering-corrected output DAX and/or &#x3a6;-imagery In this and similar embodiments, it may be the retrieval algorithm implemented by the image generator IGEN that is modified to include a further channel or fitting variable for the large-angle-scattering contribution into the optimization procedure of function (1) or (2) when fitting the model to the data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> and &#x3c0;<b>1</b>. In this modified optimization scheme, the large angle scattering as measured by data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> can be accounted for in a bespoke manner for the given patient. The measured scattering data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> may be used in other scattering correction schemes, analytic or machine-learning based, all envisaged herein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, different embodiments for implementing the scattering measure mode will now be explained in more detail.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0000">In a first embodiment, the out-of-focus configuration with respect to the focal spot FS<b>1</b> of the X-ray source is obtained by changing the position of the focal spot itself from one focal spot position FS<b>1</b> to another FS<b>2</b>, relative to the ASG as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The focal spot switch can be controlled by control logic CL through a suitable actuator AC. The actuator AC may be controlled by the control logic CL through an X-ray source XR interface SI.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">In these embodiments, the beam XB<b>1</b> propagates along a standard direction p<b>1</b> when in image acquisition mode. In this configuration, the propagation direction p<b>1</b> follows the focused arrangement. In the out-of-focus arrangement, caused by moving the focal spot FS<b>1</b> to another position FS<b>2</b>, there is a new X-ray beam XB<b>2</b> propagating along a different direction p<b>2</b> which is now out of focus relative to the DAX/&#x3a6;-imaging facilitator structure IFS and/or the ASG.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">By moving the X-ray focal spot FS<b>1</b> out of the focus of the ASG, the scatter fraction can now be measured. In this out-of-focus imaging geometry, it is now primary, non-scattered radiation, that will be blocked by the ASG as the ASG is now misaligned with respect to the radiation XB<b>2</b> emanating from the new focal spot FS<b>2</b>. The only (or at least a high fraction of) radiation left to reach the detector D is secondary radiation that is now not blocked by the ASG. Said differently, the radiation now detected will mainly consist of X-ray scattering not blocked by the ASG. This radiation, if measured with the patient in position, will thus provide an accurate estimate of the amount of non-suppressed scatter.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">There are a number of different embodiments envisaged for the focal spot change. For instance, the anode and/or cathode may be shifted or otherwise have their pose changed by the actuator AC so that the X-ray beam is directed to a different direction. Alternatively, the actuator AC includes an electronic focal spot selector such an electrostatic deflection device. The electrostatic deflection device AC changes a direction of an electron beam inside the tube so that the focal spot is moved and hence the direction of the X-ray beam.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">Instead of, or in addition to, changing the focal spot position in the X-ray source, other embodiments are envisaged for bringing about the out-off-ASG-focus configuration for scattering measurement mode. In these embodiments, there is a scattering measurement facilitator SMF integrated into the imaging system XI. The scattering measurement facilitator SMF is in embodiments a hardware structure arrangeable between the X-ray source XS and detector D to facilitate scattering measurements. The control logic CL disturbs or changes a pose of the scattering measurement facilitator SMF, by imparting a translation or rotation on the SMF, to so make the imaging system enter into scattering measurement mode. The scattering measurement facilitator SMF as envisaged may be able to serve different functions: in one function the SMF facilitates in scattering measurement when the system IS is in scattering measurement mode. In embodiments, the scattering measurement facilitator SMF may be switched into a configuration where it serves another imaging supporting function when the system is in image acquisition mode. In alternative embodiments, the SMF is dedicated and serves no other imaging function and is completely retired by the control logic CL when the system IS is in image acquisition mode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">In some embodiments where the scattering measurement facilitator SMF has a dual or multi-function, it is assumed that it is arranged-in-focus relative to the focal spot when the system is in image acquisition mode. But for use in scattering measurement mode, the scattering measurement facilitator SMF is moved out of focus relative to the focal spot FS<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">An actuator AC may be used to move the scattering measurement facilitator SMF out of focus. In general, the actuator setup for moving the scattering measurement facilitator SMF out of focus can be done in a number of different ways. The scattering measurement facilitator SMF may be held in a frame or other fixture movable mounted, either translatably or rotatably or both. The actuator AC, such as a gearing or screw mechanism, powered by a power source, may be used to engage with the frame to push or pull or rotate the frame, and with it the SMF, to realize the out of focus configuration. Hydraulic or piezoelectric actuators AC are also envisaged in embodiments. The actuator AC responds to control signals issued by the control logic CL through suitable device interfaces. The control logic CL in turn may answer to request signals issued by the user interface UI.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">In some embodiments, the scattering measurement facilitator SMF is part of the DAX/&#x3a6; imaging facilitator discussed above. For instance, in embodiments scattering measurement facilitator SMF is either one or both of the two absorption gratings G<b>0</b>, G<b>2</b> of an interferometer, assuming the DAX/&#x3a6; imaging facilitator includes such an interferometer. In this embodiment, the pose of either G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> are changed by the actuator AC. For instance, either one is rotated or shifted. Preferably, in embodiments the G<b>2</b> grating is rotated by 90&#xb0; around the optical axis that passes through the center of the said grating G<b>2</b>, the axis passing through the focal spot FS<b>1</b> of the X-ray source XS. It is not required that the focal spot is changeable. Rotations by angular amounts other 90&#xb0; are also envisaged. In addition or instead of rotating the analyzer grating G<b>2</b>, the source G<b>0</b> grating may be rotated by 90&#xb0; (or by any other angular amounts) in either direction.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">It has been observed that some residual primary radiation still reaches the detector even when either one or both of the gratings G<b>0</b>, G<b>2</b> are moved in the above described embodiments. In this case, it may be desirable to ensure that there is no remaining fringe pattern in the data. In order to ensure this, G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> can be moved or rotated. In an exemplary embodiment, the movement of G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> to reduce the fringe pattern may be done in a feedback loop arrangement that includes the control logic CL, the actuator AC, and the detector D. The control logic CL senses, via the detector D, the fringe pattern. The control logic CL instructs the actuator AC to move G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> so as to reduce the intensity of the fringe pattern as detected at the detector D with a goal to remove or at least reduce an intensity of the fringe pattern based on suitably defined negligibility threshold. In this embodiment the CL control logic may include a machine learning component configured to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm. In this embodiment, the control logic operates the actuator to change the pose of G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b>. This action is driven by optimizing a reward function R that measures the intensity of the fringe pattern as detected. The readjustment of the pose of G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> is done under exposure of a preferably low x-radiation. The goal in this machine learning algorithm is to make the fringe pattern vanish as measured by the reward function. The visibility or related quantities may be used to formulate the reward function such as R=(I<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;I<sub>min</sub>)/(I<sub>max</sub>+I<sub>min</sub>), where I<sub>min </sub>and I<sub>max </sub>are the respective maximum and minimum intensities.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">Although in the above embodiments it was assumed that the DAX/&#x3a6; imaging facilitator is an interferometer, this is not necessarily so in all embodiments and the above described scattering measurement mode can be practiced equally in non-interferometric DAX/&#x3a6; imaging setups. For example, the DAX/&#x3a6; imaging facilitator may be a coded aperture plate or other and this is moved by the control logic CL and the actuator AC.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">In another embodiment, the scattering measurement facilitator SMF includes the ASG itself. The actuator AC is controlled by the control logic to change a pose of the AGS. For instance, the ASG may be rotated by a certain angle, so that the longitudinal axes of its lamella point now to a different direction and no longer extended into the drawing plane as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, a 90&#xb0; rotation in either direction is envisaged with the rotation axis passing through a center point of the ASG and the (possibly single) fixed focal spot FS<b>1</b> of the X-ray source. Instead or in addition to a rotation, the ASG may be tilted by a certain angle that may be measured relative to the optical axis that passes through the center point of the ASG and the focal spot FS<b>1</b>. Instead or in addition of moving G<b>0</b> or G<b>2</b> to reduce the fringe pattern as discussed in the previous embodiment, it is the ASG that may be so moved.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">For DAX/&#x3a6; imaging, the mutual alignment of, in particular, the gratings G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, G<b>0</b> and the ASG, are essential for good object image acquisition quality. The proper alignment and focusing of these components may be cumbersome, time-consuming and not always easily achievable. Against this backdrop, having the control logic CL disturb either one of these components may be undesirable because the delicate refocusing or readjustment work may need to be re-done when switching back into image acquisition mode.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">To address this problem, it is proposed in the alternative to have, over and above the described components, the facilitator SMF arranged as a separate, dedicated component arrangeable on demand in the beam between the patient and the detector or between source XS and patient. That is, rather than using as a scattering measurement facilitator existing hardware in a DAX/&#x3a6; imaging setup, it is proposed to introduce a dedicated further component shown as component B into the beam when operating in scattering measurement mode. This component B is arranged to partially block out the x-radiation and can be manufactured similar to the gratings or the ASG with radiation blocking lamella or a plate with apertures, or other. The partial radiation blocking body B may be completely removed by an actuator eg, by sliding out of the beam for object acquisition mode and is slid back into the beam when the image system operates in scattering measuring mode.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">In general, the control logic CL may be implemented by one or more computing units PU. The control logic may be fully integrated into the imaging system or may be arranged as one or more micro controllers but may also be arranged remotely at a remote one or more computing systems PU. The control logic CL may interact with the imaging system but components of the imaging system wirelessly or in a wired connection. The control logic CL may be arranged in software or hardware or partly in both. The control logic may be implemented as one or more microcontrollers, integrated into the imaging system IS.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">Each one of the above described scattering measurement embodiments can be used singly on its own, or in combination or in any sub-combination.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">It has been observed that the scattering management principles described herein yield very good contrast in DAX imagery. It is believed that is at least partly due to the fact that the proposed scattering reduction mechanism provides just the right amount of tolerance that is needed for DAX imaging. Too effective a scattering removal may actually hinder DAX imaging objectives as the rigorous removal of all scattering may run the risk of removing DAX effects altogether which then results in low DAX contrast. The proposed scattering management schemes described herein strike the right balance. Because of the switching between the two modes, two separate and/or dedicated measurement procedures are defined. In each procedure, the whole detector sensitive surface of the detector is at disposable for the respective measurement in embodiments. Operating in such dedicated/separate modes may also facilitate achieving the right scattering correction, particularly suited for the purpose of DAX imaging as mainly envisaged herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0084">Reference is now made to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in which steps of a computer-implemented method for DAX/&#x3a6; with scattering management is illustrated. It will be understood however that the method steps described in the following constitute a teaching in their own right and are not necessarily tied to the specific architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0085">At step S<b>210</b>, an X-ray imaging apparatus XI is operated in two modes in sequence, first in one mode then in the other mode. The two modes are referred to herein as image acquisition mode and scattering measurement mode. The x-radiation receivable at the detector of the imaging system comprises a higher proportion of scattering when in scattering measurement mode as compared to scattering radiation receivable when in object acquisition mode. Step S<b>210</b> results in two sets of measurement data &#x3c0;<b>1</b> and &#x3c0;<b>2</b>, with &#x3c0;<b>2</b> encoding a higher proportion of scattering radiation. In particular, only, or predominantly, scattering radiation is measured in this second data set &#x3c0;<b>2</b>, whilst set &#x3c0;<b>1</b> encodes primary radiation, with no or a lower fraction of secondary radiation.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0086">In step S<b>220</b>, the scattering measurement data &#x3c0;<b>2</b> obtained in scattering measurement mode and the data &#x3c0;<b>1</b> obtained in image acquisition mode are used to generate scattering corrected imagery.

Alternatively, a phase retrieval is performed first based on the data &#x3c0;<b>1</b> obtained in image acquisition mode to obtain preliminary DAX- or &#x3a6;-imagery.
