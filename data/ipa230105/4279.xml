For example, example embodiments allow a user to create a custom media overlay for his or her home that can be used by designated friends (e.g., to augment images or videos captured by the friends) when they are visiting the user's home. The custom media overlay is customizable with templates and creative tools and can be updated as often as the user wants. In some examples, templates, stickers, and other creative content can be updated seasonally (e.g., snowy home illustrations in winter, sunny themes in the summer, American flags on the lawn in July, etc.). Users can also use the custom media overlay for one-off events they host like a party or game night. Since a home is a private space, designated users that have permission to access such custom media overlays can be limited to users (e.g., friends) that have a bi-directional connection with the first user in a social networking system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, a server system (e.g., a server system in a messaging system) receives a request to generate a media overlay corresponding to a home of a first user. The request may comprise media content to be included in a custom media overlay. For example, the media content may include creative content that will be included in the custom media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user. The server system generates the media overlay, using the received content, and associates a location of the home of the first user and a selection of users to grant permission to access the custom media overlay, with the custom media overlay. The server system stores the custom media overlay and allows it to be accessed by the selection of users when they are located in or near the home of the first user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the server system receives location information corresponding to a second computing device, determines a second user corresponding to the second computing device, and determines whether the second user and the location information of the second computing device trigger access to the stored custom media overlay. If so, the server system provides the custom media overlay to the second computing device. The second user can then use the custom media overlay to augment images or video captured in the first user's home and send the augmented images or video to other users.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a networked system <b>100</b> (e.g., a content sharing platform or messaging system) for exchanging data (e.g., messages and associated content) over a network. The networked system <b>100</b> includes multiple client devices <b>110</b>, each of which hosts a number of client applications <b>114</b>. Each client application <b>114</b> is communicatively coupled to other instances of the client application <b>114</b> and a server system <b>108</b> via a network <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The client device <b>110</b> may comprise, but is not limited to, a mobile phone, desktop computer, laptop, portable digital assistant (PDA), smart phone, tablet, ultrabook, netbook, laptop, multi-processor system, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronic system, game console, set-top box, computer in a vehicle, wearable device, or any other communication device that a user may utilize to access the networked system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the client device <b>110</b> may comprise a display module (not shown) to display information (e.g., in the form of user interfaces). In further embodiments, the client device <b>110</b> may comprise one or more of touch screens, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The client device <b>110</b> may be a device of a user that is used to create media content items such as video, images (e.g., photographs), audio, and media overlays and to send and receive messages containing such media content items, text, media overlays, and so forth, to and from other users. The client device <b>110</b> may be a device of a user that is used to create and edit media overlays, view and generate interactive messages, view other users on a map, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">One or more users may be a person, a machine, or other means of interacting with the client device <b>110</b>. In example embodiments, the user may not be part of the system <b>100</b> but may interact with the system <b>100</b> via the client device <b>110</b> or other means. For instance, the user may provide input (e.g., touch screen input or alphanumeric input) to the client device <b>110</b>, and the input may be communicated to other entities in the system <b>100</b> (e.g., third-party servers, the server system <b>108</b>, etc.) via the network <b>104</b>. In this instance, the other entities in the system <b>100</b>, in response to receiving the input from the user, may communicate information to the client device <b>110</b> via the network <b>104</b> to be presented to the user. In this way, the user may interact with the various entities in the system <b>100</b> using the client device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system <b>100</b> may further include the network <b>104</b>. One or more portions of the network <b>104</b> may be an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, a wireless network, a WI-FI network, a WiMax network, another type of network, or a combination of two or more such networks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The client device <b>110</b> may access the various data and applications provided by other entities in the system <b>100</b> via a web client (e.g., a browser, such as the Internet Explorer&#xae; browser developed by Microsoft&#xae; Corporation of Redmond, Wash. State) or one or more client applications <b>114</b>. The client device <b>110</b> may include one or more client applications <b>114</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;apps&#x201d;) such as, but not limited to, a web browser, a messaging application, an electronic mail (email) application, an e-commerce site application, a mapping or location application, a media overlay application, an interactive messaging application, and the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, one or more client applications <b>114</b> may be included in a given one of the client devices <b>110</b>, and configured to locally provide a user interface and at least some of the functionalities of the application, with the client application <b>114</b> configured to communicate with other entities in the system <b>100</b> (e.g., third-party servers, the server system <b>108</b>, etc.), on an as-needed basis, for data and/or processing capabilities not locally available (e.g., to process user queries, to authenticate a user, to verify a method of payment, etc.). Conversely, one or more client applications <b>114</b> may not be included in the client device <b>110</b>, and then the client device <b>110</b> may use its web browser to access the one or more applications hosted on other entities in the system <b>100</b> (e.g., third-party servers, the server system <b>108</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example, a client application <b>114</b> may be a messaging application that allows a user to take a photograph or video, add a caption or otherwise edit the photograph or video, and then send the photograph or video to another user. In one example, the message may be ephemeral and be removed from a receiving user device after viewing or after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds, 24 hours, etc.). An ephemeral message refers to a message that is accessible for a time-limited duration. An ephemeral message may be a text, an image, a video, and other such content that may be stitched or joined together in accordance with embodiments described herein. The access time for the ephemeral message may be set by the message sender. Alternatively, the access time may be a default setting or a setting specified by the recipient. Regardless of the setting technique, the message is transitory.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The messaging application may further allow a user to create a gallery or message collection. A gallery may be a collection of photos and videos which may be viewed by other users &#x201c;following&#x201d; the user's gallery (e.g., subscribed to view and receive updates in the user's gallery). In one example, the gallery may also be ephemeral (e.g., lasting 24 hours, lasting for a duration of an event (e.g., during a music concert, sporting event, etc.), or lasting another predetermined time).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An ephemeral message may be associated with a message duration parameter, the value of which determines an amount of time that the ephemeral message will be displayed to a receiving user of the ephemeral message by the client application <b>114</b>. The ephemeral message may be further associated with a message receiver identifier and a message timer. The message timer may be responsible for determining the amount of time the ephemeral message is shown to a particular receiving user identified by the message receiver identifier. For example, the ephemeral message may only be shown to the relevant receiving user for a time period determined by the value of the message duration parameter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another example, the messaging application may allow a user to store photographs and videos and create a gallery that is not ephemeral and that can be sent to other users. For example, a user may assemble photographs and videos from a recent vacation to share with friends and family.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another example, the messaging application may allow a first user to create a media overlay corresponding to a home of the first user. The media overlay is associated with a location of the home of the first user and a selection of users to grant permission to access the media overlay. When a second user, who has permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user, is in the home of the first user, the second user can access the media overlay to augment images (e.g., photographs) or video captured by a computing device of the second user. The second user can send the images or video augmented by the media overlay to one or more other users.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The server system <b>108</b> may provide server-side functionality via the network <b>104</b> (e.g., the Internet or a wide area network (WAN)) to one or more client devices <b>110</b> and/or one or more third-party servers (not shown). The server system <b>108</b> may include an application programming interface (API) server <b>102</b>, an application server <b>112</b>, a messaging application server <b>116</b>, a media content processing system <b>118</b>, and a social network system <b>122</b>, which may be communicatively coupled with each other and with one or more data storages, such as one or more databases <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The server system <b>108</b> may be a cloud computing environment, according to some example embodiments. The server system <b>108</b>, and any servers associated with the server system <b>108</b>, may be associated with a cloud-based application, in one example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The one or more databases <b>120</b> may be storage devices that store information such as untreated media content, original media content from users (e.g., high-quality media content), processed media content (e.g., media content that is formatted for sharing with client devices <b>110</b> and viewing on client devices <b>110</b>), context data related to a media content item, context data related to a user device (e.g., a computing or client device <b>110</b>), media overlays, media overlay smart widgets or smart elements, user data, user device information, media content (e.g., video and images), media content data (e.g., data associated with video and images), computing device context data, serialized data, session data items, user device location data, mapping information, chance mode data, interactive message usage data, interactive message metrics data, and so forth. The one or more databases <b>120</b> may further store information related to third-party servers, third-party applications, client devices <b>110</b>, client applications <b>114</b>, users, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The one or more databases <b>120</b> may include cloud-based storage external to the server system <b>108</b> (e.g., hosted by one or more third-party entities external to the server system <b>108</b>). While the storage devices are shown as database(s) <b>120</b>, it is to be understood that the system <b>100</b> may access and store data in storage devices such as databases <b>120</b>, blob storages, and other types of storage methods.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system <b>100</b> may further include one or more third-party servers (not shown). The one or more third-party servers may include one or more third-party applications. The one or more third-party applications, executing on the third-party server(s), may interact with the server system <b>108</b> via the API server <b>102</b> via a programmatic interface provided by the API server <b>102</b>. For example, one or more of the third-party applications may request and utilize information from the server system <b>108</b> via the API server <b>102</b> to support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by a third party or an application hosted by the third party. The third-party website or application, for example, may provide functionality that is supported by relevant functionality and data in the server system <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accordingly, each client application <b>114</b> is able to communicate and exchange data with other client applications <b>114</b> and with the server system <b>108</b> via the network <b>104</b>. The data exchanged between client applications <b>114</b>, and between a client application <b>114</b> and the server system <b>108</b>, includes functions (e.g., commands to invoke functions) as well as payload data (e.g., text, audio, video, or other multimedia data).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The server system <b>108</b> provides server-side functionality via the network <b>104</b> to a particular client application <b>114</b>. While certain functions of the system <b>100</b> are described herein as being performed either by a client application <b>114</b> or by the server system <b>108</b>, it will be appreciated that the location of certain functionality either within the client application <b>114</b> or within the server system <b>108</b> is a design choice. For example, it may be technically preferable to initially deploy certain technology and functionality within the server system <b>108</b>, but to later migrate this technology and functionality to the client application <b>114</b> where a client device <b>110</b> has a sufficient processing capacity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The server system <b>108</b> supports various services and operations that are provided to the client application <b>114</b>. Such operations include transmitting data to, receiving data from, and processing data generated by the client application <b>114</b>. This data may include message content, client device information, geolocation information, media annotation and overlays, message content persistence conditions, social network information, live event information, date and time stamps, media content (e.g., video and images), media content data (e.g., data associated with video and images), interactive message usage data, and chance mode data, as examples. Data exchanges within the networked system <b>100</b> are invoked and controlled through functions available via user interfaces (UIs) of the client application <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the server system <b>108</b>, the API server <b>102</b> is coupled to, and provides a programmatic interface to, the application server <b>112</b>. The application server <b>112</b> is communicatively coupled to a database server <b>124</b>, which facilitates access to the one or more databases <b>120</b> in which is stored data associated with messages processed by the application server <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The API server <b>102</b> receives and transmits message data (e.g., commands and message payloads) between the client device <b>110</b> and the application server <b>112</b>. Specifically, the API server <b>102</b> provides a set of interfaces (e.g., routines and protocols) that can be called or queried by the client application <b>114</b> in order to invoke functionality of the application server <b>112</b>. The API server <b>102</b> exposes various functions supported by the application server <b>112</b>, including account registration; login functionality; the sending of messages, via the application server <b>112</b>, from a particular client application <b>114</b> to another client application <b>114</b>; the sending of media files (e.g., images or video) from a client application <b>114</b> to the messaging application server <b>116</b>, for possible access by another client application <b>114</b>; the setting of a collection of media data (e.g., a gallery, story, message collection, or media collection); the retrieval of such collections; the retrieval of a list of friends of a user of a client device <b>110</b>; the retrieval of messages and content; the adding of friends to and deletion of friends from a social graph; the location of friends within a social graph; opening an application event (e.g., relating to the client application <b>114</b>); mapping data; the creation and generation of a media overlay, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The application server <b>112</b> hosts a number of applications and subsystems, including the messaging application server <b>116</b>, the media content processing system <b>118</b>, and the social network system <b>122</b>. The messaging application server <b>116</b> implements a number of message processing technologies and functions, particularly related to the aggregation and other processing of content (e.g., textual and multimedia content) included in messages received from multiple instances of the client application <b>114</b>. The text and media content from multiple sources may be aggregated into collections of content (e.g., called stories, galleries, or media collections). These collections are then made available, by the messaging application server <b>116</b>, to the client application <b>114</b>. Other processor- and memory-intensive processing of data may also be performed server-side by the messaging application server <b>116</b>, in view of the hardware requirements for such processing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The application server <b>112</b> also includes the media content processing system <b>118</b>, which is dedicated to performing various media content processing operations, typically with respect to images or video received within the payload of a message at the messaging application server <b>116</b>. The media content processing system <b>118</b> may access one or more data storages (e.g., the database(s) <b>120</b>) to retrieve stored data to use in processing media content and to store results of processed media content.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The social network system <b>122</b> supports various social networking functions and services, and makes these functions and services available to the messaging application server <b>116</b>. To this end, the social network system <b>122</b> maintains and accesses an entity graph <b>304</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) within the database(s) <b>120</b>. Examples of functions and services supported by the social network system <b>122</b> include the identification of other users of the networked system <b>100</b> with whom a particular user has relationships or whom the particular user is &#x201c;following,&#x201d; and also the identification of other entities and interests of a particular user. The social network system <b>122</b> also maintains chance mode geofences and indexes of user locations related to chance mode.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The messaging application server <b>116</b> may be responsible for generation and delivery of messages between users of client devices <b>110</b>. The messaging application server <b>116</b> may utilize any one of a number of message delivery networks and platforms to deliver messages to users. For example, the messaging application server <b>116</b> may deliver messages using electronic mail (email), instant messaging (IM), Short Message Service (SMS), text, facsimile, or voice (e.g., Voice over IP (VoIP)) messages via wired networks (e.g., the Internet), plain old telephone service (POTS), or wireless networks (e.g., mobile, cellular, WIFI, Long Term Evolution (LTE), or Bluetooth).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram <b>200</b> illustrating further details regarding the system <b>100</b>, according to example embodiments. Specifically, the system <b>200</b> is shown to comprise the messaging client application <b>114</b> and the application server <b>112</b>, which in turn embody a number of subsystems, namely an ephemeral timer system <b>202</b>, a collection management system <b>204</b>, and an annotation system <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The ephemeral timer system <b>202</b> is responsible for enforcing the temporary access to content permitted by the messaging client application <b>114</b> and the messaging application server <b>116</b>. To this end, the ephemeral timer system <b>202</b> incorporates a number of timers that, based on duration and display parameters associated with a message, a collection of messages (e.g., otherwise referred to herein as &#x201c;media collections,&#x201d; &#x201c;galleries,&#x201d; &#x201c;message collections,&#x201d; &#x201c;stories,&#x201d; and the like), or a chat in chance mode, selectively display and enable access to messages and associated content via the messaging client application <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The collection management system <b>204</b> is responsible for managing collections of media (e.g., collections of text, image, video, and audio data). In some examples, a collection of content (e.g., messages, including images, video, text, and audio) may be organized into an &#x201c;event gallery&#x201d; or an &#x201c;event story.&#x201d; Such a collection may be made available for a specified time period, such as the duration of an event to which the content relates. For example, content relating to a music concert may be made available as a &#x201c;story&#x201d; for the duration of that music concert. The collection management system <b>204</b> may also be responsible for publishing an icon that provides notification of the existence of a particular collection to the user interface of the messaging client application <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The collection management system <b>204</b> furthermore includes a curation interface <b>208</b> that allows a collection manager to manage and curate a particular collection of content. For example, the curation interface <b>208</b> enables an event organizer to curate a collection of content relating to a specific event (e.g., delete inappropriate content or redundant messages). Additionally, the collection management system <b>204</b> employs machine vision (or image recognition technology) and content rules to automatically curate a content collection. In certain embodiments, compensation (e.g., money, non-money credits or points associated with the messaging system or a third-party reward system, travel miles, access to artwork or specialized lenses, etc.) may be paid to a user for inclusion of user-generated content into a collection. In such cases, the curation interface <b>208</b> operates to automatically make payments to such users for the use of their content.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The annotation system <b>206</b> provides various functions that enable a user to annotate or otherwise modify or edit media content associated with a message. For example, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides functions related to the generation and publishing of media overlays for messages processed by the networked system <b>100</b>. In one example, the annotation system <b>206</b> operatively supplies a media overlay (e.g., a filter or media augmentation) to the messaging client application <b>114</b> based on a geolocation of the client device <b>110</b>. In another example, the annotation system <b>206</b> operatively supplies a media overlay to the messaging client application <b>114</b> based on other information, such as social network information of the user of the client device <b>110</b>. A media overlay may include audio and visual content and visual effects. Examples of audio and visual content include pictures, texts, logos, animations, and sound effects. An example of a visual effect includes color overlaying. The audio and visual content or the visual effects can be applied to a media content item (e.g., a photo) at the client device <b>110</b>. For example, the media overlay includes text that can be overlaid on top of a photograph taken by the client device <b>110</b>. In another example, the media overlay includes an identification of a location overlay (e.g., Venice Beach), a name of a live event, a name of a merchant overlay (e.g., Beach Coffee House), or of a home of a user. In another example, the annotation system <b>206</b> uses the geolocation of the client device <b>110</b> to identify a media overlay that includes the name of a merchant at the geolocation of the client device <b>110</b>. The media overlay may include other indicia associated with the merchant. The media overlays may be stored in the database(s) <b>120</b> and accessed through the database server <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The annotation system <b>206</b> may further enable a user to interact with an interactive message, such as by adding one or more media content items to the interactive message, as described in further detail below. In one example embodiment, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides a publication platform that allows a user or merchant to create an interactive message with a plurality of objects associated with the interactive message for which users may add personal content. For example, a designer may create a video of a rock band with various interactive objects for different members of the band (a drummer, a keyboard player, a guitarist, etc.). The video of the rock band may be made available to users as an interactive message.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one example embodiment, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides a user-based publication platform that enables users to select a geolocation on a map, and upload content associated with the selected geolocation. The user may also specify circumstances under which a particular media overlay is to be offered to other users. The annotation system <b>206</b> generates a media overlay that includes the uploaded content and associates the uploaded content with the selected geolocation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example embodiment, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides a merchant-based publication platform that enables merchants to select a particular media overlay associated with a geolocation via a bidding process. For example, the annotation system <b>206</b> associates the media overlay of a highest-bidding merchant with a corresponding geolocation for a predefined amount of time.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram <b>300</b> illustrating data which may be stored in the database(s) <b>120</b> of the server system <b>108</b>, according to certain example embodiments. While the content of the database(s) <b>120</b> is shown to comprise a number of tables, it will be appreciated that the data could be stored in other types of data structures (e.g., as an object-oriented database).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The database <b>120</b> includes message data stored within a message table <b>314</b>. An entity table <b>302</b> stores entity data, including an entity graph <b>304</b>. Entities for which records are maintained within the entity table <b>302</b> may include individuals, corporate entities, organizations, objects, places, events, and so forth. Regardless of type, any entity regarding which the server system <b>108</b> stores data may be a recognized entity. Each entity is provided with a unique identifier, as well as an entity type identifier (not shown).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The entity graph <b>304</b> furthermore stores information regarding relationships and associations between entities. Such relationships may be social, professional (e.g., work at a common corporation or organization), interested-based, or activity-based, merely for example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The database <b>120</b> also stores annotation data, in the example form of media overlays or filters, in an annotation table <b>312</b>. Annotation data may also be referred to herein as &#x201c;creative tools&#x201d; or &#x201c;interactive features.&#x201d; Annotation data may comprise predefined interactive messages to be provided to users.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Media overlays or filters, for which data is stored within the annotation table <b>312</b>, are associated with and applied to videos (for which data is stored in a video table <b>310</b>) and/or images (for which data is stored in an image table <b>308</b>). Filters, in one example, are overlays that are displayed as overlaid on an image or video during presentation to a recipient user. Filters may be of various types, including user-selected filters from a gallery of filters presented to a sending user by the messaging client application <b>114</b> when the sending user is composing a message. Other types of filters include geolocation filters (also known as &#x201c;geo-filters&#x201d;), which may be presented to a sending user based on geographic location. For example, geolocation filters specific to a neighborhood or special location may be presented within a user interface by the messaging client application <b>114</b>, based on geolocation information determined by a GPS unit of the client device <b>110</b>. Another type of filter is a data filter, which may be selectively presented to a sending user by the messaging client application <b>114</b>, based on other inputs or information gathered by the client device <b>110</b> during the message creation process. Examples of data filters include a current temperature at a specific location, a current speed at which a sending user is traveling, a battery life for a client device <b>110</b>, or the current time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Other annotation data that may be stored within the annotation table <b>312</b> is so-called &#x201c;lens&#x201d; data. A &#x201c;lens&#x201d; may be a real-time special effect and sound that may be added to an image or a video.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As mentioned above, the video table <b>310</b> stores video data which, in one embodiment, is associated with messages for which records are maintained within the message table <b>314</b>. Similarly, the image table <b>308</b> stores image data associated with messages for which message data is stored in the message table <b>314</b>. The entity table <b>302</b> may associate various annotations from the annotation table <b>312</b> with various images and videos stored in the image table <b>308</b> and the video table <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A story table <b>306</b> stores data regarding collections of messages and associated image, video, or audio data, which are compiled into a collection (e.g., a story, gallery, or media collection). The creation of a particular collection may be initiated by a particular user (e.g., any user for whom a record is maintained in the entity table <b>302</b>). A user may create a &#x201c;personal story&#x201d; in the form of a collection of content that has been created and sent/broadcast by that user. To this end, the user interface of the messaging client application <b>114</b> may include an icon that is user-selectable to enable a sending user to add specific content to his or her personal story.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A media or message collection may also constitute a &#x201c;live story,&#x201d; which is a collection of content from multiple users that is created manually, automatically, or using a combination of manual and automatic techniques. For example, a &#x201c;live story&#x201d; may constitute a curated stream of user-submitted content from various locations and events. Users whose client devices <b>110</b> have location services enabled and are at a common event location at a particular time may, for example, be presented with an option, via a user interface of the messaging client application <b>114</b>, to contribute content to a particular live story. The live story may be identified to the user by the messaging client application <b>114</b>, based on his or her location. The end result is a &#x201c;live story&#x201d; told from a community perspective.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A further type of content collection is known as a &#x201c;location story,&#x201d; which enables a user whose client device <b>110</b> is located within a specific geographic location (e.g., on a college or university campus) to contribute to a particular collection. In some embodiments, a contribution to a location story may require a second degree of authentication to verify that the end user belongs to a specific organization or other entity (e.g., is a student on the university campus).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a structure of a message <b>400</b>, according to some embodiments, generated by a client application <b>114</b> for communication to a further client application <b>114</b> or the messaging application server <b>116</b>. The content of a particular message <b>400</b> is used to populate the message table <b>314</b> stored within the database(s) <b>120</b>, accessible by the messaging application server <b>116</b>.

For illustrative purposes, the method <b>500</b> is described with respect to the networked system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It is to be understood that the method <b>500</b> may be practiced with other system configurations in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">In operation <b>502</b>, a server system (e.g., server system <b>108</b>, application server <b>112</b>, media content processing system <b>118</b>, etc.) receives, from a first computing device, a request to generate a media overlay corresponding to a home of a first user (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;home media overlay&#x201d; or a &#x201c;custom media overlay&#x201d;). In one example, the request comprises media content to be included in the media overlay. For example, media content may comprise a creative with graphics related to the home of the first user, a bitmoji or avatar corresponding to the user, a bitmoji or avatar corresponding to another user currently located in the home of the first user, a graphic corresponding to a pet of the first user, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">For example, the first user may be using a messaging application on a first computing device and may wish to create a media overlay for his home so that whenever any of his friends or family come to visit, the friends or family can access the media overlay for his home to use to augment images or video generated by their own personal computing devices. For example, the friends or family may wish to send a message to one or more other users indicating that they are hanging out in &#x201c;Zach's house.&#x201d; The message may comprise an image or video augmented by the first user's (Zach's) home media overlay.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">In one example, the first user accesses the messaging application via the first computing device to choose to create a home media overlay (e.g., filter). For example, the first computing device provides and displays one or more graphical user interfaces to allow the first user to create a home media overlay, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>600</b> displayed on a computing device that allows a user to create a media overlay via a &#x201c;create home media overlay&#x201d; button <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0079">Upon selection of the button <b>602</b>, the first user accesses further functionality related to creating a home media overlay, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates several GUIs <b>702</b>-<b>706</b> that can be provided to and displayed by a computing device to access functionality related to creating a home media overlay. For example, GUI <b>702</b> allows a user to generate a home media overlay, GUI <b>704</b> allows the user to share the home media overlay with friends, and GUI <b>706</b> allows the user to change the media overlay and related settings.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">Upon selection in the GUI <b>702</b> to create a home media overlay, the computing device displays a plurality of templates for the user to choose from to start creating the home media overlay, or an option to start creating the home media overlay from scratch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>800</b> that can be provided to and displayed by a computing device to allow a user to select a template from a plurality of templates <b>804</b>-<b>808</b> or to select an option <b>802</b> to start from scratch to create a home media overlay. If the user chooses one of the templates <b>804</b>-<b>808</b>, the computing device (or server system) receives the selection of the one template of the plurality of templates and causes display of the one template and optionally creative tools for editing the one template.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>900</b> that can be provided and displayed by a computing device to allow a user to create the home media overlay. For example, the GUI <b>900</b> shows the home media overlay portion <b>902</b> (which may comprise a template in one example), and an example background image <b>904</b> to illustrate how the home media overlay will appear when augmenting an image (or video). The GUI <b>900</b> also comprises a set of creative tools <b>906</b> for creating the media overlay. In one example creative tools include a text tool to add or edit text in the media overlay, an eraser tool to erase or remove portions of the media overlay, a sticker tool to add one or more stickers to the media overlay, a color tool to change the color scheme of the media overlay, a bitmoji or avatar tool to create or add a bitmoji or avatar to the media overlay, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0082">Once a user has finished creating the home media overlay, he can save and publish the media overlay. The computing device sends the media content for the media overlay to the server system. As explained above, the media content may comprise a creative with graphics related to the home of the first user, a bitmoji or avatar corresponding to the user, a bitmoji or avatar corresponding to another user currently located in the home of the first user, a graphic corresponding to a pet of the first user, and so forth. In one example, the media content comprises the template with any edits made using the creative tools.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0083">The server system receives the media content from the computing device (e.g., as part of a request to generate a media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user as explained above) and generates the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user using the received media content, as shown in operation <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In one example, the server system flattens layers of the media overlay into a single image file and stores in one or more datastores (e.g., database(s) <b>120</b>) for serving or providing to clients (e.g., client devices <b>110</b>). For example, a user may have chosen a template and added one or more stickers and text to the template. The client device <b>110</b> sends the identifiers for the graphics (e.g., template identifier, stickers identifiers, etc.), the location of the stickers on the template, the style of text, and so forth, to the server system. The server system takes all of that information and renders a single image out of everything collapsed together. In one example, the rendering or flattening into a single image is performed by the client device <b>110</b> and the client device <b>110</b> sends the flattened or rendered image to the server system to be stored and served from the server system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">In operation <b>506</b>, the server system determines a location of the home of the first user. In one example, the server system determines the location of the home of the first user based on location information corresponding to the first computing device. For example, the server system may receive location information (e.g., geographic coordinates determined via global positioning system (GPS) or similar technology) from the first computing device (e.g., as part of or separately from the request to generate the media overlay). The location of the home is used to trigger access to the home media overlay when an authorized user is in or around the location of the home.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0085">In another example, the server system determines the location of the home of the first user based on location data indicating a most common location of the user (e.g., of the computing device of the user) overnight or during other times of the day when people are typically at home. The server system can cause this location to display to the user for selection of the location of the home by the user.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0086">In one example, a confidence score can be assigned to a location chosen by a user for his home based on location data indicating that the location chosen is actually the user's home. Data indicating that the location chosen is actually the user's home may include hours a day spent in the chosen location, times of day spent in the chosen location (e.g., overnight), mapping data, and so forth. For example, if a user does not spend a threshold number of nights in the chosen location, the confidence score may be lower than if a user spends at least the threshold number of nights in the chosen location.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">The confidence score can be used in various scenarios. For example, if a second user reports abuse indicating that the location is actually a second user's home (and not the first user's home), the server system can determine the need to escalate such a report. In another example, the confidence score can be used in other functionality in the messaging to determine whether to automatically populate home address or location details for the user.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>1000</b> where a user can set the location for his home media overlay. In one example, the computing device automatically detects the location of the user based on GPS or similar technology and displays an indicator <b>1002</b> of the user's (e.g., computing device's) current location (or based on location data as explained above). This location can be used by the user to set as the home location, or the user can move the indicator <b>1002</b> to a different location (or move the map below the indicator until the indicator is displayed in the correct location), or search for a different location using the search box <b>1004</b>. The user can save the location by, for example, selecting the continue button <b>1006</b></p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">In one example, the location for the home of the user may only be changed after a specified time period (e.g., 15 days, 30 days, 2 months). For example, the specified time period may be 30 days and a GUI <b>1100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may be displayed to the user to alert the user of the specified time period. If the user attempts to change the location of his home before the specified time period has passed, a message such as the one shown in the GUI <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is displayed to the user. The amount of days remaining until the home location can be updated can be calculated based on the last change date. For example, if the last time the home location was changed was on March 1, the location cannot be updated until March 30.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0090">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in operation <b>508</b>, the server system receives a selection of users to grant permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user. In one example, the selection of users to grant permission to access the media overlay comprises users with a bi-directional connection with the first user in a social networking system.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>1300</b> for home media overlay settings. In the GUI <b>1300</b>, a thumbnail <b>1302</b> of the home media overlay that has been created by the user is displayed. A user may select the thumbnail to edit or change the home media overlay. The location <b>1304</b> for the home media overlay is also displayed in the GUI <b>1300</b>. The user may select the location <b>1304</b> to change the location for the home media overlay. The GUI <b>1300</b> further allows an option <b>1308</b> for the user to enable his home media overlay. The user can also choose who can access the user's home media overlay by selecting one or more options <b>1306</b>. The user selection of one or more of the options <b>1306</b> indicates the selection of users to grant permission to access the media overlay. As explained above, in one example this may only include users with a bi-directional connection with the user in a social networking system (e.g., where the user and the other user have each designated each other as friends).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0092">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the user can select &#x201c;My Friends&#x201d; to select all friends of the user. In this example, the user can also select &#x201c;My Friends, Except . . . &#x201d; which will allow the user to generate a list of friends that will not be allowed access to the home media overlay (e.g., a blacklist). The user can also select &#x201c;Only Me&#x201d; to make the home media overlay private so that no one else but the user can access or use the home media overlay. The user can also choose specific friends (e.g., &#x201c;Only These Friends . . . &#x201d;) which will allow the user to select specific friends, as shown in the GUI <b>1400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Once the user has selected the users to whom to grant permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user, the computing device receives the selection and sends the selection to the server system.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">In another example, the server system uses a default selection of users with a bi-directional connection with the first user in a social networking system. In this example, the user does not need to make any selection, the server system will automatically determine users to whom to grant permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user based on those users having a bi-directional connection with the first user in a social networking system. The server system will associate the users having a bi-directional connection with the first user in a social networking system with the media overlay and store the association with the media overlay (e.g., as triggers for the media overlay as described below).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in operation <b>510</b>, the server system associates the location of the home of the first user and the selection of the users to grant permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user, with the media overlay. In operation <b>512</b>, the server system stores the media overlay and associated location of the home of the first user and the selection of users (e.g., in one or more databases <b>120</b>). For example, the location of the home of the first user and the selection of users are stored as triggers for when the media overlay can be accessed or made available to a computing device (e.g., when a selected user is located in the home of the first user). Once the media overlay is enabled, the media overlay can be provided to a computing device when the location of the computing device and the user associated with the computing device match the triggers for the media overlay.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating aspects of a method <b>1500</b>, for a custom media overlay system, according to some example embodiments.

It is to be understood that the method <b>1500</b> may be practiced with other system configurations in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0096">In operation <b>1502</b>, a server system (e.g., server system <b>108</b>, application server <b>112</b>, media content processing system <b>118</b>, etc.) receives location information corresponding to a location of a second computing device. For example, a second user may be visiting the home of the first user and be using the second computing device. The second computing device determines the location (e.g., via GPS or other technology) and sends the location information to the server system.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0097">In operation <b>1504</b>, the server system determines the second user corresponding to the second computing device. For example, the second computing device may send a user name or other information identifying the user (e.g., via computing device identifier, login information, etc.). The server system receives the information identifying the user to determine the second user.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0098">In operation <b>1506</b>, the server system determines whether the second user and the location information corresponding to the second computing device trigger access to the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user. For example, the server system determines whether the location information matches the location of the home of the first user. For example, the server system determines whether the location information matches an address of the home of the first user or the location information falls within a predefined radius of the location of the home of the first user (e.g., a 10 meter radius, a 50 meter radius, etc.). The server system determines whether the second user (e.g., name or unique identifier of the second user) matches one of the users in the selection of users to grant permission to access the media overlay corresponding to the home of the user. If the second user and the location information do not trigger the media overlay (e.g., the second user does not match a user in the selection of users and the location information does not fall within the location of the home of the first user) the method <b>1500</b> ends at operation <b>610</b>. If the second user and the location information do trigger the media overlay (e.g., the second user does match a user in the selection of users and the location information does fall within the location of the home of the first user), the method <b>1500</b> continues to operation <b>1508</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0099">In operation <b>1508</b>, the server system provides the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first users to the second computing device, based on determining that the second user and location information corresponding to the second computing device trigger access to the media overlay. For example, the server system retrieves the stored media overlay and sends the media overlay to the second computing device. The second computing device receives the media overlay and displays the media overlay or an option to select the media overlay in a GUI on the second computing device.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0100">In one example, the computing device or server system detects when a selected user is near the first user's home (e.g., within a predefined distance, such as a hundred meters, a few hundred meters, etc.) and can pre-load (e.g., download) the home media overlay for the first user's home on the selected user's computing device in advance so that it is available when the selected user arrives to the first user's home.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0101">The media overlay provided to the second computing device is used to augment an image or video captured by the second computing device. For example, the second user may be using a camera of the second computing device to capture an image (e.g., photograph) or video on the second computing device. The second user selects the media overlay provided by the server system. The second computing device receives the selection of the media overlay and displays the media overlay on top of the image or video being captured or captured by the camera of the computing device. The second user can then send the image or video augmented by the media overlay to another user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>1600</b> with an image <b>1602</b> augmented by the media overlay <b>1604</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0102">The second computing device sends the image or video augmented by the media overlay to the server system. The server system receives the image or video augmented by the media overlay and sends the image or video augmented by the media overlay (e.g., as a message) to at least a third computing device. In this way authorized users located in the first user's home can access and use the media overlay corresponding to the home of the first user.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0103">In one example, a media overlay corresponding to the home of a user can be automatically updated based on context related to the user or the location of the home of the user. The context may correspond to a time of day, a time of year, weather conditions for the home location, behaviors or activities of the user, presence of other users in the home, events in the home, and so forth. For example, the stored media overlay may be in the context of daytime in the summer with only the user represented in the media overlay (e.g., as a bitmoji or avatar). In one example the server system detects a change from a first context to a second context. For example, the server system may determine that it is now nighttime instead of day time. The server system may automatically revise the media overlay to reflect that it is nighttime at the location of the user's home. For example, the media overlay could be revised to show stars or a moon, or that lights are on in the home. In another example, the media overlay could be revised to show the user's avatar in pajamas. The server system stores the revised media overlay and provides the revised media overlay to a computing device of a selected user when a selected user is in the user's home, as described above. In one example, the context corresponds to an activity corresponding to the first user (e.g., waking up, eating breakfast, getting ready for school or work, eating lunch, eating dinner, going to bed, etc.), weather conditions for the location of the home of the first user (e.g., sun, snow, wind, rain, clouds, etc.), an event (e.g., party or game night), a number of users located in the home (e.g., an avatar to represent a brother, friend, mother, daughter, etc.), and so forth. In this way the home overlay can be automatically updated based on context corresponding to the user or home.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0104">In one example, the computing system allows users to flag or report a media overlay corresponding to a user's home for inappropriate content. For example, a user can report that the media overlay contains nudity or sexual content; harassment or hate speech; threatening, violent, or concerning content; content indicating the user is someone other than his/herself; or other reasons.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a block diagram <b>1700</b> illustrating a software architecture <b>1702</b>, which can be installed on any one or more of the devices described above.
