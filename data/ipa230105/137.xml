Hand-rolling cigarettes requires a number of materials such as, but not limited to, wrapping papers, tobacco, a tobacco shredder, etc., and can be fairly messy. As such, there exists a need to keep the materials in a centralized location that also allows for simplified cleaning of the area in which cigarettes are rolled.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One embodiment of the present invention provides a cigarette valet including a base portion having a pair of opposed side walls, a pair of opposed end walls extending therebetween, a top wall, and an opposed bottom wall, wherein the base portion defines an interior compartment, one of the side walls includes a first flange defining a first recess between the first flange and the top wall, and one of the end walls includes a second flange defining a second recess between the second flange and the top wall, a substantially-triangular receptacle including a first flange and a second flange, the first flange and the second flange of the receptacle being slidably received in the first recess and the second recess, respectively, of the base portion so that the receptacle is selectably attachable to the base portion, and a drawer including at least one bin, the drawer being slidably disposed within the interior compartment of the base portion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a cigarette valet including a base portion having a pair of opposed side walls, a pair of opposed end walls extending therebetween, a top wall, an opposed bottom wall, and an upwardly-extending lip disposed along an outer perimeter of the top wall of the base portion, wherein the base portion defines an interior compartment, a scraper tool including a substantially-rectangular blade portion and a gripper portion extending along an edge thereof, and a drawer including at least one bin, the drawer being slidably disposed within the interior compartment of the base portion, wherein the top wall of the base portion defines a slot disposed adjacent the outer perimeter thereof, and the scraper tool is slidably received in the slot so that the gripper portion of the scraper tool is contiguous with the lip of the base portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not, all embodiments of the invention are shown.

Indeed, this invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d;, include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a cigarette valet <b>10</b> that facilitates both storing the required materials for hand-rolling cigarettes and rolling the cigarettes in a centralized location is shown. The cigarette valet <b>10</b> includes a base portion <b>12</b>, a drawer <b>30</b> for storing the required materials, a scraper tool <b>36</b>, a receptacle <b>42</b>, and a lid <b>50</b> that is removably attached to the base portion <b>12</b>. As shown, the cigarette valet <b>10</b> is substantially-rectangular in shape and is preferably produced by way of injection molding plastics. The base portion <b>12</b> includes a pair of side walls <b>14</b>, a pair of opposed end walls <b>16</b> extending therebetween, a bottom wall (not shown), and a top wall <b>18</b> that functions as a cigarette preparation surface. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one side wall <b>14</b> of the base portion <b>12</b> includes a flange <b>14</b><i>a </i>that defines a recess <b>14</b><i>b </i>between the flange <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the base portion <b>12</b>. Similarly, the adjacent end wall <b>16</b> includes a flange <b>16</b><i>a </i>that defines a recess <b>16</b><i>b </i>between the flange <b>16</b><i>a </i>and base portion <b>12</b>. Recesses <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are each configured to slidably receive a corresponding flange <b>44</b> of receptacle <b>42</b>. As shown, the receptacle <b>42</b> is substantially triangularly-shaped so that when the receptacle <b>42</b> is removably secured to the base portion <b>12</b> it forms one of the corners thereof. The position of the receptacle on the base portion <b>12</b> allows the scraper tool <b>36</b> to be used to scrape any remaining tobacco into the receptacle <b>42</b>, which may then be detached from the base portion <b>12</b> so that the loose tobacco may be returned to the drawer <b>30</b> for later use.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the cigarette valet <b>10</b> includes the scraper tool <b>36</b> that has a substantially rectangular blade portion <b>40</b> and a grip portion <b>38</b> extending along an edge thereof. The scraper tool <b>36</b> is slidably received in a slot <b>37</b> that is defined in the end wall <b>16</b> of the base portion <b>12</b> adjacent the outer perimeter of the base portion's top wall <b>18</b>. When the blade portion <b>40</b> is slidably disposed in the slot <b>37</b>, the gripper portion <b>38</b> of the scraper tool <b>36</b> forms a portion of an upwardly extending lip <b>20</b> that is disposed along the outer perimeter of the top wall <b>18</b>. The lip <b>20</b> that surrounds the top wall <b>18</b> helps to maintain the loose tobacco on the base portion <b>12</b> when preparing cigarettes. The lip <b>20</b> also defines a pair of recesses <b>22</b>, each recess <b>22</b> being configured to receive a corresponding magnet <b>24</b> therein. Similarly, the lid <b>50</b> of the cigarette valet <b>10</b> includes a correspondingly positioned pair of magnets (not shown) that are arranged to have the opposite polarity of the magnets <b>24</b> of the base portion <b>12</b>. As such, when not in use, the lid <b>50</b> is held in place by the magnets to enclose the cigarette valet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drawer <b>30</b> is slidably received in an interior compartment (not shown) that is defined within the base portion <b>12</b>. The drawer <b>30</b> includes one or more bins <b>32</b> that are configured to store the materials required to roll cigarettes, such as, but not limited to, loose tobacco, rolling papers, filters, etc. The drawer <b>30</b> also includes a detent <b>34</b> that is disposed on an upper surface of the drawer <b>30</b> and is configured to be received in a first aperture <b>33</b> that is defined in the top wall <b>18</b> of the base portion <b>12</b>. The detent <b>34</b> helps ensure the drawer <b>30</b> is securely held within the base portion <b>12</b> until the detent <b>34</b> is depressed by a user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the top wall <b>18</b> also defines a second aperture <b>28</b> that is configured to receive a tobacco grinder (not shown), such as those that are commonly known in the art, and an elongated groove <b>26</b> that is configured to receive one or more rolled cigarettes therein as others are prepared on the top wall <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the scraper tool <b>36</b> and the receptacle <b>42</b> are secured to the base portion <b>12</b>, the lid <b>50</b> totally encloses the cigarette preparation area when it is positioned on the base portion <b>12</b> of the cigarette valet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other modifications and variations to the invention may be practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is more particularly set forth in the appended claims. In addition, it should be understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be interchanged in whole or in part. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing description is by way of example only, and it is not intended to limit the invention as further described in such appended claims.
