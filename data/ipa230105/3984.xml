id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus comprising a plurality of addressable light-emitting elements aligned to a plurality of optical elements arranged as a solid layer. Such an apparatus may be used for switchable environmental lighting, for switchable indoor or outdoor electronic display screens, or for a switchable backlight to an LCD display.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Displays with wide directional light output distributions are typically used to achieve comfortable display viewing from many different viewing angles. Such displays are desirable for multiple users to share image content, and for displays where the viewing position is not substantially fixed in relation to the display centreline.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of comparison displays with narrow directional light output distributions are typically used to provide image data for the eyes of users over reduced viewing angles. Such displays are typically used to achieve privacy display (where images that may be seen by snoopers are suppressed), night time display (where ambient illumination is suppressed&#x2014;for example to reduce reflections from windscreens or to reduce unsociable stray light), low power viewing (where illumination is not supplied to regions away from the eyes of users) and outdoors viewing (where high luminance is provided to a narrow range of viewing positions for no or small increases in backlight power).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a known method, narrow directional light output distributions can be achieved by the addition of a micro louvered film. Such films can be permanently fixed on display such as for ATM cash machines for privacy viewing or automotive displays for night time operation. Alternatively, such films may be manually placed on the surface of a conventional wide directional light output distribution display by the user for private display use and removed and stored to restore a normal wide-angle viewing. Micro louver films are inefficient because they work by absorbing light from the backlight in the unwanted display angular directions. As a side effect of construction, they also significantly attenuate of the light in the wanted direction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The viewing angle of a transmissive spatial light modulator such as an LCD (liquid crystal display) is controlled by the output light distribution of a backlight and the angular transmission properties of the LCD panel used. Typically, the backlight incorporates a light guide plate (LGP) that accepts light from sources such as LEDs (light emitting diodes) arranged at an input edge of the LGP A structured pattern on the LGP output face provides a defined leakage of light across its face as the light propagates through the LGP.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other known backlights incorporate an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in a matrix behind the LCD. The light from the LEDs is strongly diffused to create a largely uniform backlight illumination. The directional light output distribution of light from the backlight, or directional light output distribution, can be altered by the addition of fixed layers such as prismatic films and diffusers within the backlight assembly. The backlight and therefore the display angular light directional light output distribution is fixed by design at the time of manufacture.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Illumination systems for environmental lighting such as automobile headlights, architectural, commercial or domestic lighting may provide a narrow directional light output distribution, for example by means of focusing optics to provide spotlighting effects, or can achieve a wide directional light output distribution for example by means of diffusing optics to achieve broad area illumination effects.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Inorganic LEDs formed using semiconductor growth onto monolithic wafers demonstrate high levels of luminous efficiency (lm/W) and high luminous emittance (lm/m<sup>2</sup>). In cooperation with light conversion layers, LEDs may provide acceptable CIE Colour Rendering Indices (CRI) or colour space coverage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can be formed on arbitrarily large substrates; however luminous emittance may be more than 1000 times lower than may be achieved by inorganic LEDs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this specification LED refers to (i) an unpackaged inorganic LED die chip extracted directly from a monolithic wafer, i.e. a semiconductor element&#x2014;this is different from packaged LEDs which have been attached to a lead frame in order to provide electrodes and may be assembled into a plastic package to facilitate subsequent assembly; or (ii) OLED elements that are formed by patterned deposition methods including ink-jet printing, contact printing, evaporation through fine metal mask or vertical plane sources and may comprise quantum dot materials.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Packaged LEDs are typically of dimension greater than 1 mm, and more typically of dimension greater than 3 mm and can be assembled by conventional Printed Circuit Board assembly techniques including pick and place methods. The accuracy of components placed by such assembly machines may typically be about plus or minus 30 microns. Such sizes and tolerances prevent application to very high-resolution displays.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Micro-LEDs may be formed by array extraction methods in which multiple LEDs are removed from a monolithic wafer in parallel and may be arranged with positional tolerances that are less than 5 microns. Micro-LEDs may also or alternatively comprise OLED elements.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">White LED lighting sources can be comprised of separate spectral bands such as red, green, blue and yellow, each created by a separate LED element. Such sources enable users to resolve the separate colours, and as a result of the separation of the sources in the lamp, can create coloured illumination patches. It would be desirable if the sources were homogenized so that their separation was less than the visual resolution limit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Directional LED elements can use reflective optics (including total internal reflective optics) or more typically catadioptric optic type reflectors, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,547,423.
