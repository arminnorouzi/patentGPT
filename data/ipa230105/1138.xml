When handling such a catheter having the relatively long length in the longitudinal direction, a surgeon takes a measure by winding the catheter and bundling the catheter with a clip or the like in order to prevent the catheter from being in contact with an unclean surface such as a floor, for example. In this manner, the surgeon needs to pay attention such that the catheter is not brought into contact with an unclean surface when using a catheter whose length in the longitudinal direction is relatively long.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A catheter and a catheter assembly are disclosed, which are relatively easy to handle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A catheter is disclosed, which includes: an elongated shaft configured to be inserted into a body lumen; and a hub connected to a proximal end side of the shaft. The shaft forms a first shape at least a part of which is wound in a state where the shaft is suspended in a gravity direction by holding the hub, and forms a second shape at least a part of which is wound and in which a length of the shaft along the gravity direction is shorter than a length of the shaft along the gravity direction in the first shape in a state where the hub and the shaft are placed on a flat reference plane perpendicular to the gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A catheter assembly is disclosed having an outer catheter and an inner catheter insertable into the outer catheter, each of the outer catheter and the inner catheter including an elongated shaft and a hub connected to a proximal end side of the shaft.

Thus, a risk of the catheter being in contact with an unclean surface such as a floor can be reduced, and it becomes unnecessary or easier for the surgeon to perform work of bundling the catheter with a clip or the like so as to prevent the contact with the unclean surface, for example, such as the floor. In addition, when the surgeon places the catheter on a medical tray, a table, or the like, at least a part of the shaft forms the second shape and becomes more compact than in the suspended state. In this manner, it is possible to provide a catheter which is relatively easy to handle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the catheter assembly configured as described above, when a surgeon holds and manipulates a proximal end side of the catheter assembly in a state where the inner catheter is inserted into the outer catheter, at least a part of the shaft of the catheter assembly is wound to form the third shape and becomes relatively compact. Thus, a risk of the catheter assembly being in contact with an unclean surface such as a floor can be reduced, and it becomes unnecessary or relatively easy for the surgeon to perform work of bundling the catheter with a clip or the like so as to help prevent contact with an unclean surface such as the floor.

That is, an external force does not act on the inner catheter <b>200</b> except for gravity and a force caused by the contact with the reference plane T (a frictional force against the reference plane T and a resistance from reference plane T) in this state. In this manner, the wound portion A forms the second shape in the placed state without being wound by the surgeon. In addition, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> also forms a fourth shape in which the outer shaft <b>110</b> and a part of the inner shaft <b>210</b> are wound with the smaller number of turns than the second shape by combining the outer catheter <b>100</b> without the wound shape and the inner catheter <b>200</b> with the second shape in the placed state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. Before inserting the catheter assembly <b>10</b> into the blood vessel of the patient, the surgeon fills a medical tray or the like with a priming solution, and performs priming work of immersing the inner catheter <b>200</b> and the catheter assembly <b>10</b> in the priming solution. In addition, there is a case where the inner catheter <b>200</b> or the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is temporarily placed on a table, the medical tray, or the like during a procedure. In such a case, the inner catheter <b>200</b> or the catheter assembly <b>10</b> forms a wound shape on the table or the medical tray without being wound by the surgeon, and becomes compact in the gravity direction G. In this manner, the surgeon does not need to wind the inner catheter <b>200</b> or the catheter assembly <b>10</b> such that the inner catheter <b>200</b> or the catheter assembly <b>10</b> does not become a hindrance or fits in the medical tray.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0077">The second shape is not particularly limited as long as the catheter is wound and the length L<b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the inner shaft <b>210</b> along the gravity direction G is shorter than the length L<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) of the inner shaft <b>210</b> along the gravity direction G in the suspended state. Thus, examples of the first shape include a &#x201c;two-dimensional spiral&#x201d;, an &#x201c;a shape&#x201d; of being wound by one turn when the reference plane T is viewed from above, and a &#x201c;C shape&#x201d; of being bent so as to surround the axis X<b>1</b> when the reference plane T is viewed from above, and the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0078">In the present embodiment, the second shape is a shape obtained by winding the catheter around the axis X<b>1</b> about two and a quarter turns when the reference plane T is viewed from above as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. In addition, in the second shape, the inner shaft <b>210</b> has overlapping portions B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> in which wound portions C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> overlap each other when the reference plane T is viewed from above.

In this manner, since the adjacent portions C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> abut on each other in the overlapping portions B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>, the inner catheter <b>200</b> becomes even more compact in the gravity direction G. Incidentally, the inner catheter <b>200</b> may be configured such that the length L<b>4</b> of the inner shaft <b>210</b> along the gravity direction G in the placed state is shorter than the length L<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) along the gravity direction G of the inner shaft <b>210</b> in the suspended state, and the adjacent portions C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> may be slightly separated from each other without abutting on each other.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0079">Although a method of imparting the curl to the inner shaft <b>210</b> to form the first shape and the second shape is not particularly limited, it is possible to use, for example, a method of winding the inner shaft <b>210</b> along an annular jig or a columnar jig and maintaining the state for a predetermined time, or the like. Incidentally, when the inner shaft <b>210</b> is inserted into the outer shaft <b>110</b> to which no curl is imparted, it is preferable that the catheter assembly <b>10</b> has a strong curl (shape retention property) to the extent that a wound shape (the above-described third or fourth shape) can be formed in the suspended state or placed state while being loosened due to the shape of the outer shaft <b>110</b> to which no curl is imparted.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">The inner shaft <b>210</b> is preferably made of a resin material.

The catheter assembly <b>10</b> can be evaluated with a three-point bending value obtained by the same method as the outer shaft <b>110</b> and the inner shaft <b>210</b>. In the case of an outer diameter of 2.4 mm and an inner diameter of 1.1 mm, the three-point bending value of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is 150 gf to 1000 gf, more preferably 300 gf to 800 gf, more preferably 350 gf to 650 gf. If the three-point bending value of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is 150 gf or less, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> hangs down and does not form a helix, and when the three-point bending value of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> exceeds 1000 gf, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> does not drip in a rolled state and does not have a three-dimensional helical structure. When the three-point bending value of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is 300 gf to 700 gf, when the inner shaft <b>210</b> is inserted into a lumen of the outer shaft <b>110</b> which is not a three-dimensional helical structure as a single body, the inner shaft <b>210</b> is three-dimensionally it is preferable because it has a spiral shape. Alternatively, it may be determined by the flexural modulus measured by the same method, and it is preferable that the apparent flexural modulus when the outer diameter is 2.4 mm and the inner diameter is 1.1 mm is preferably 40 MPa to 320 MPa, more preferably 90 MPa to 250 MPa, and most preferably 100 MPa to 210 MPa.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0087">First, the surgeon places the outer catheter <b>100</b> and the inner catheter <b>200</b> on a medical tray, and performs the priming work of immerging the outer catheter <b>100</b> and the inner catheter <b>200</b> in the priming solution.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0088">Next, the surgeon inserts the inner catheter <b>200</b> into the outer catheter <b>100</b> and screws the protrusion <b>124</b> of the outer catheter <b>100</b> into the helical groove <b>222</b> of the inner catheter. As a result, when the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is inserted into the blood vessel of the patient, the surgeon can integrally operate the outer catheter <b>100</b> and the inner catheter <b>200</b>, thereby facilitating the operation. The surgeon can temporarily place the assembled catheter assembly <b>10</b> on the medical tray or the like until the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is used again.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0089">Next, the surgeon punctures the radial artery R<b>1</b> of the right arm with the introducer sheath S and causes the introducer sheath S to remain in the radial artery R<b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As a result, the surgeon can secure an introduction path for introducing the catheter assembly <b>10</b> into the radial artery R<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">Next, the surgeon inserts the catheter assembly <b>10</b> into the introducer sheath S in a state where the guide wire GW has been inserted into the lumen of the catheter assembly <b>10</b>. Then, the surgeon introduces the catheter assembly <b>10</b> into the radial artery R<b>1</b> along the guide wire GW.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0091">Next, the surgeon pushes the catheter assembly <b>10</b> to proceed along the preceding guide wire GW to a target site (for example, the vicinity of the upper part of the left superficial femoral artery (SFA) R<b>7</b>) in front of the stenosis N. Since the catheter assembly <b>10</b> has the wound shape, the surgeon can easily move the catheter assembly <b>10</b> to proceed along a curved artery such as a right subclavian artery R<b>2</b>, a brachiocephalic artery R<b>3</b>, and an aortic arch R<b>4</b>, or the like. In addition, the surgeon can push the catheter assembly <b>10</b> forward such that the outer catheter <b>100</b> draws a helix while abutting on wall surfaces of a thoracic aorta R<b>5</b> and an abdominal aorta R<b>6</b> since the catheter assembly <b>10</b> has the wound shape.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0092">Next, after the distal end of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> reaches the target site, the surgeon releases the screwing between the helical groove <b>222</b> of the inner catheter <b>200</b> and the protrusion <b>124</b> of the outer catheter <b>100</b>. Then, the surgeon removes the inner catheter <b>200</b> out of the body while leaving the outer catheter <b>100</b> and the guide wire GW in the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0093">Next, the surgeon inserts a balloon catheter (not illustrated) having an expanded portion, which is expandable and contractible, at a distal end of the balloon catheter into the lumens <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the outer catheter <b>100</b> along the guide wire GW. Further, the surgeon pushes the balloon catheter into the lumens <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the outer catheter <b>100</b> such that the expanded portion protrudes from the distal end of the outer catheter <b>100</b> and the expanded portion is arranged at the stenosis N. Incidentally, since the catheter assembly <b>10</b> abuts on the wall surfaces of the thoracic aorta R<b>5</b> and the abdominal aorta R<b>6</b> while drawing the helix as described above, a contact area between the outer catheter <b>100</b> and a blood vessel wall is wide. Thus, even if a reaction force caused by pushing the balloon catheter forward is transmitted to the outer catheter <b>100</b>, it is possible to suitably suppress the movement of the outer catheter in a direction of being removed out of the body due to a frictional force between the outer catheter <b>100</b> and each wall surface of the thoracic aorta R<b>5</b> and the abdominal aorta R<b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0094">Next, the surgeon expands the expanded portion of the balloon catheter to push and dilate the stenosis N. Next, the surgeon contracts the expanded portion of the balloon catheter and removes the balloon catheter and the guide wire GW out of the body.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0095">Next, the surgeon removes the outer catheter <b>100</b> out of the body. Next, the surgeon removes the introducer sheath S out of the body and stops bleeding of a puncture site.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0096">Although the use example of the catheter assembly <b>10</b> has been described above, the procedure to which the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is applied is not limited to the above-described procedure.

In addition, the lesion is not limited to one generated in the left superficial femoral artery R<b>7</b>, but may be those generated in, for example, a right superficial femoral artery, right and left iliac arteries, and right and left popliteal arteries. In addition, the treatment to be performed via the outer catheter <b>100</b> is not limited to the treatment using only the balloon catheter. For example, a stent may be arranged on an outer surface of a balloon. In addition, a long object such as a catheter other than the balloon catheter, an endoscope, an ultrasonic probe, and a temperature sensor may be inserted or removed via the outer catheter <b>100</b>, and various liquids such as a contrast agent (X-ray contrast agent), a medical solution, and saline may be injected.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0097">The above-described inner catheter <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment includes the elongated inner shaft <b>210</b> to be inserted into the blood vessel and the hub <b>220</b> to be connected to the proximal end side of the inner shaft <b>210</b>.
