invention relates, generally, to systems and methods for ultrasound focusing and, more particularly, to aufocusing using microbubbles and adjusting acoustic power of the ultrasound beam after focusing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Focused ultrasound (i.e., acoustic waves having a frequency greater than about 20 kiloHertz) can be used to image or therapeutically treat internal body tissues within a patient. For example, ultrasound waves may be used in applications involving ablation of tumors, thereby eliminating the need for invasive surgery, targeted drug delivery, control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), lysing of clots, and other surgical procedures. During tumor ablation, a piezoceramic transducer is placed externally to the patient, but in close proximity to the tissue to be ablated (i.e., the target). The transducer converts an electronic drive signal into mechanical vibrations, resulting in the emission of acoustic waves. The transducer may be geometrically shaped and positioned along with other such transducers so that the ultrasound energy they emit collectively forms a focused beam at a &#x201c;focal zone&#x201d; corresponding to (or within) the target tissue region. Alternatively or additionally, a single transducer may be formed of a plurality of individually driven transducer elements whose phases can each be controlled independently. Such a &#x201c;phased-array&#x201d; transducer facilitates steering the focal zone to different locations by adjusting the relative phases among the transducers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;element&#x201d; means either an individual transducer in an array or an independently drivable portion of a single transducer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to visualize the patient and target, and thereby to guide the ultrasound beam.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During a focused ultrasound procedure, a series of sonications is applied to cause coagulation necrosis of the target tissue (such as a tumor) without damaging surrounding tissue. If utilized in the central nervous system, the sonications may cause cavitation of microbubbles, which may disrupt blood vessels, thereby inducing &#x201c;opening&#x201d; of the BBB for enhancing targeted drug delivery. To achieve these goals, ultrasonic energy emitted from the transducer must be accurately and reliably shaped and focused onto the desired target location. Transducer elements that are not properly configured can lead to improper or suboptimal focal qualities, thereby causing ineffective treatment and/or undesired damage to the non-target tissue. In addition, improperly shaped ultrasound beams may generate unexpected, secondary hot spots at locations other than the intended focal zone; such hot spots may lead to undesired heating, pain for the patient, and/or possibly necrosis of non-targeted tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One source of transducer output errors is inhomogeneity of the intervening tissue (e.g., human skull) through which the ultrasound waves travel prior to reaching the focal zone. The ultrasound waves may interact with the intervening tissue through multiple processes, including propagation, scattering, absorption, reflection, and refraction. For example, tissue inhomogeneity may cause refraction of acoustic energy at the boundaries of regions that have different speeds of sound. Refraction may decrease constructive interference, and hence, the intensity of the acoustic energy at the focal zone. Thus, inhomogeneous tissue may generate beam aberrations and refractions that distort the focus and reduce its intensity, thereby affecting treatment efficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various approaches have been proposed for calibrating to account for beam aberrations resulting from the intervening tissue. For example, one conventional approach measures phase shifts resulting from travel of an ultrasound beam through the intervening tissue and subsequently adjusts ultrasound parameters to account for the aberrations caused at least in part by the tissue. Typically, this approach uses receiving probes designed for catheter insertion into the brain to measure the amplitude and phase distortion caused by the human skull. Catheter insertions, however, still require surgery, which can be painful and can create a risk of infection.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative, completely noninvasive approach uses X-ray computed tomography (CT) images, rather than receiving probes, to predict the wave distortion caused by the skull. In practice, however, computations of the relative phases alone may too be imprecise to enable high-quality focusing. For example, when ultrasound is focused into the brain to treat a tumor, the skull in the acoustic path may cause aberrations that are not readily ascertainable. In such situations, treatment is typically preceded by a focusing procedure in which an ultrasound focus is generated at or near the target, the quality of the focus is measured (using, e.g., thermal imaging or acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI)), and experimental feedback is used to adjust the phases of the transducer elements to achieve sufficient focus quality.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The preceding focusing procedure, however, may take a substantial amount of time, which may render it impracticable or, at the least, inconvenient for a patient. In addition, ultrasound energy is inevitably deposited into the tissue surrounding the target during the procedure, thereby potentially damaging healthy tissue. While the effect of pre-therapeutic sonications may be minimized by employing an imaging technique that requires only low acoustic intensity (e.g., ARFI), it is generally desirable to limit the number of sonications prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another approach to estimating the wave aberrations resulting from the intervening tissue involves use of an acoustic reflector (e.g., a small cloud of microbubbles) in the focus zone. By transmitting the ultrasound waves to the microbubbles and receiving reflections therefrom, the amplitudes and/or phases associated with the reflected ultrasound can be determined; based thereon, aberrations resulting from the intervening tissue can be learned and the transducer parameters (e.g., phase shifts and/or amplitudes) can be adjusted to compensate for the aberrations caused at least in part by the intervening tissue. While this approach may effectively improve the focusing properties at the target, various challenges exists. For example, the microbubble concentration at the target should be in a range that provides significant interaction with the ultrasound waves yet produces reflections signals that are straightforwardly analyzed. In addition, the acoustic power of the ultrasound waves has to be sufficiently large to cause interaction with the microbubbles without, once again, generating undesired artifacts in the reflection signals. Further, because the anatomic properties of the intervening tissue and/or the pharmacokinetics of each patient differ, different microbubble concentrations and different acoustic power may be required for performing the autofocusing procedure on different patients. Accordingly, there is a need for approaches that determine an optimal patient-specific microbubble concentration and acoustic power for performing ultrasound autofocusing in order to achieve a high-quality ultrasound focus at the target.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some circumstances, the microbubbles may cause undesired damage to the target and/or non-target tissue. For example, the maximal acoustic energy deposited in the focal zone may significantly increase after the transducer parameters are adjusted to improve the focusing properties improve, thereby risking permanent damage to the BBB tissue. When damage to the target/non-target tissue due to energy overexposure is detected during the actual ultrasound procedure, it is, of course, too late to avoid the problem. Accordingly, a need also exists for approaches that create a high-quality ultrasound focus at the target region while avoiding overexposure of the target/non-target region to the acoustic energy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to approaches for automatically focusing ultrasound beams, through an inhomogeneous medium, at a target region utilizing one or more transient reflectors (e.g., one or more microbubbles). The transient reflector(s) may be generated and/or introduced in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) or at the target region. In addition, an optimization approach is implemented to determine one or more optimal values of one or more parameters (e.g., the acoustic power, microbubble concentration, etc.) associated with an ultrasound transducer and/or the acoustic reflector for facilitating the autofocusing procedure. Because optimization can be performed for each patient, the obtained optimal values are patient-specific; as a result, adjustment of the ultrasound parameters (e.g., amplitudes, phases, etc.) using the autofocusing procedure may be more accurate, thereby advantageously improving the focusing properties and treatment efficiency at the target region. It should be understood that the approach of the present invention is useful with any type of transient acoustic reflector, i.e., an acoustic reflector that moves, evolves, and/or dissipates during the period between two measurements. Although the description herein focuses on microbubbles, this is for exemplary purposes only, and references to microbubbles should be understood as interchangeable with other forms of transient acoustic reflector (such as phase-shifting droplets, red blood cells, etc.).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In various embodiments, the optimization approach is commenced by generating and/or introducing an initial concentration of microbubbles to the sonication location(s) in proximity to or at target region. Preferably, the initial microbubble concentration is sufficiently high to cause significant interaction between the microbubbles and the ultrasound waves but also sufficiently low that the acoustic reflections appear to originate from a point target (e.g., having a size less than that of a quarter of the sonication wavelength) such as a single microbubble (as opposed to a cloud of microbubbles). The initial microbubble concentration may be determined based on, for example, a pre-clinical study, a pre-treatment procedure, and/or from known literature.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thereafter, at least some of the transducer elements may be activated to transmit a series of low-power (e.g., 7 Watts) sonications to the microbubbles; reflection signals from the microbubbles can be measured. In one embodiment, a signal-selection approach is implemented to select reflection signals from single microbubbles based on consistency among the reflection signals. In one embodiment, a consistency function of the travel times and/or phase delays associated with the reflection signals is defined, and the reflection signals are considered to have sufficient consistency only when the value of the consistency function is maximized or exceeds a predetermined threshold. In various embodiments, the acoustic power of the transmitted sonications is gradually increased until there is a significant (e.g., more than 50% or 100%) change in the parameters (e.g., amplitudes, phases, etc.) associated with the selected reflection signals between two measurements; such reflection signals are referred to as &#x201c;focusing events.&#x201d; In addition, the acoustic power of the transmitted sonications is continuously increased until a sufficient number (e.g., 10, or in some embodiments, more than 30) of the focusing events is measured. The power for generating the sufficient number of focusing events is referred to as an optimal power and can be utilized during the autofocusing procedure. In some embodiments, an occurrence rate of the focusing events (e.g., the number of focusing events detected in the most recently measured second of time) is calculated, and the power level is adjusted based on the occurrence rate. For example, the power level may be increased when the occurrence rate is too low (e.g., more than 50% or 100% below the target occurrence rate) and decreased when the occurrence rate is too high (e.g., more than 50% or 100% in excess of the target occurrence rate). The target occurrence rate may be one event per second, or in some embodiments, more than 10 events per second.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some situations, however, prior to a sufficient number (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of the focusing events being detected, the acoustic power of the sonications may have reached a threshold value, where the non-linear responses of the microbubbles (and thereby artifacts in the reflection signals) are detected. Accordingly, in various embodiments, upon determining that the artifacts are present in the reflection signals or that the number of reflection signals having the artifacts is unacceptably high relative to the number of focusing events (e.g., by a factor of two, five or 10), the optimization approach may adjust another parameter such as the microbubble concentration for determining the optimal configurations for facilitating the autofocusing procedure. For example, the microbubble concentration may be increased by 10% or, in some embodiments, 20%; and the applied sonications may then start with the low power again and gradually increase until the optimal power is reached. Again, if the acoustic power reaches the threshold value that causes artifacts in the reflection signals before a sufficient number of focusing events is detected, the microbubble concentration may be further increased. The acoustic power at which a sufficient number of the focusing events are detected indicates the ultrasound power level required to create a therapeutically sufficient acoustic field in the target area. Thus, the acoustic power value corresponding to a sufficient number (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of the focusing events can be used to adjust and/or scale the power level during the ultrasound therapy (or diagnostic) procedure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Conversely, in other situations, the initial or adjusted microbubble concentration may result in too many focusing events (e.g., larger than 50, or in some embodiments, larger than 80) when the acoustic power is still low (e.g., less than 8 Watts). To save the microbubbles and to reduce the computational complexity of analyzing the reflection signals, in some embodiments, the microbubble concentration is reduced (e.g., by 5%, or in some embodiments, 10%). Again, the sonications may be transmitted at low power, which is gradually increased until the optimal acoustic power is reached. These steps may also be iteratively performed until an optimal microbubble concentration and an optimal acoustic power are obtained. Thereafter, the autofocusing procedure can be commenced using the determined optimal acoustic power and optimal microbubble concentration. Based on the focusing events measured during the autofocusing procedure, the ultrasound parameters (e.g., amplitude and/or phases) can then be adjusted in order to compensate for tissue aberrations, thereby optimizing focusing properties at each sonication location that are in proximity to or at the target region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, various embodiments provide an approach to determining optimal value(s) of one or more parameters (e.g., the acoustic power, microbubble concentration, etc.) associated with the ultrasound transducer and/or the acoustic reflector for performing an accurate and reliable ultrasound autofocusing procedure. Because optimization can be performed for each patient, the obtained optimal values may be patient-specific. As a result, the autofocusing procedure may be used to compensate for aberrations resulting from patient-specific intervening tissue and thereby obtain optimal steering parameters (e.g., ultrasound amplitudes, phases) to focus acoustic energy at the target region.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, various embodiments predict a change in a temperature or a peak power of an ultrasound focus that results from optimization (or at least improvement) of the focusing properties (due to a change in transducer parameters) and, based on the prediction, adjust the transmitted acoustic power level so as to avoid overheating of the target and/or non-target tissue during the ultrasound procedure. In one embodiment, prediction of the peak power/temperature change at each sonication location is based on the phase adjustments determined using reflection signals having sufficient consistency. For example, a physical model and/or an imager (e.g., an MRI apparatus) or other suitable device may be first implemented to predict and/or measure the peak power/temperature change in the first sonication location that results from the amplitude/phase adjustments determined using the sufficiently consistent reflection signals from the reflector(s). Subsequently, based on the measured peak power/temperature change in the first sonication location and comparison of the phase adjustments associated with the reflection signals from the first sonication location against the phase adjustments associated with the reflection signals from other sonication locations (which are determined using the sufficiently consistent reflection signals from the other reflector(s) in the other sonication locations), the peak power/temperature changes in the other sonication locations can be estimated. The discussion herein focuses on temperature change as an exemplary therapeutic and/or acoustic effect, but it should be understood that other such effects may be predicted using the techniques described herein and are within the scope of the invention. Such other effects may include a pressure change, a mechanical index change, a cavitation activity change, a tissue sensitization change, a blood brain barrier disruption change, an acoustic radiation force change and/or a spot shape change.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally or alternatively, the peak power/temperature changes in the other sonication locations may be estimated based on the measured peak power/temperature change in the first sonication location and the phase adjustments associated with the reflection signals from the first sonication and the other sonication locations using the consistency function.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In various embodiments, all (or at least some) transient acoustic reflectors whose reflections are determined to have sufficient consistency may be computationally shifted to coincide at a single location, and the phases associated with the shifted reflection signals and/or the unshifted reflection signal at the coincident location can be determined. In addition, the acoustic power/temperature increase at the coincident location resulting from each of the shifted and/or unshifted reflection signals can be determined (e.g., using the consistency function). Based thereon, the phase associated with the transducer element measuring the reflection signals can be computed as an average or a weighted average of the phases associated with the shifted reflection signals and/or the unshifted reflection signal at the coincident location; and the temperature increase at the coincident location can be estimated as an average or a weighted average of the temperature increases resulting from phase adjustments to the shifted reflection signals and/or the unshifted reflection signal at the coincident location.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various embodiments, a relationship between one or more ultrasound parameter values (e.g., an acoustic power level, an ultrasound frequency, or an acoustic energy level) and the resulting peak power/temperature change at the target is computationally established using the physical model or empirically determined prior to the ultrasound procedure.

One of ordinary skill in the art, however, will understand that the ultrasound system <b>100</b> described herein may be applied to any part of the human body. In various embodiments, the system <b>100</b> includes a phased array <b>102</b> of transducer elements <b>104</b>, a beamformer <b>106</b> driving the phased array <b>102</b>, a controller <b>108</b> in communication with the beamformer <b>106</b>, and a frequency generator <b>110</b> providing an input electronic signal to the beamformer <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The array <b>102</b> may have a curved (e.g., spherical or parabolic) shape suitable for placement on the surface of the skull or a body part other than the skull, or may include one or more planar or otherwise shaped sections. Its dimensions may vary, depending on the application, between millimeters and tens of centimeters. The transducer elements <b>104</b> of the array <b>102</b> may be piezoelectric ceramic elements, and may be mounted in silicone rubber or any other material suitable for damping the mechanical coupling between the elements <b>104</b>. Piezo-composite materials, or generally any materials capable of converting electrical energy to acoustic energy, may also be used. To assure maximum power transfer to the transducer elements <b>104</b>, the elements <b>104</b> may be configured for electrical resonance at 50&#x3a9;, matching input connector impedance.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The transducer array <b>102</b> is coupled to the beamformer <b>106</b>, which drives the individual transducer elements <b>104</b> so that they collectively produce a focused ultrasonic beam or field. For n transducer elements, the beamformer <b>106</b> may contain n driver circuits, each circuit including or consisting of an amplifier <b>118</b> and a phase delay circuit <b>120</b>; each drive circuit drives one of the transducer elements <b>104</b>. The beamformer <b>106</b> receives a radio frequency (RF) input signal, typically in the range from 0.1 MHz to 1.0 MHz, from the frequency generator <b>110</b>, which may, for example, be a Model DS345 generator available from Stanford Research Systems. The input signal may be split into n channels for the n amplifiers <b>118</b> and delay circuits <b>120</b> of the beamformer <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the frequency generator <b>110</b> is integrated with the beamformer <b>106</b>. The radio frequency generator <b>110</b> and the beamformer <b>106</b> are configured to drive the individual transducer elements <b>104</b> of the transducer array <b>102</b> at the same frequency, but at different phases and/or different amplitudes.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The amplification or attenuation factors &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>-&#x3b1;<sub>n </sub>and the phase shifts a<sub>1</sub>-a<sub>n </sub>imposed by the beamformer <b>106</b> serve to transmit and focus ultrasonic energy through inhomogeneous tissue (e.g., the patient's skull) onto the target region (e.g., a region in the patient's brain). Via adjustments of the amplification factors and/or the phase shifts, a desired shape and intensity of a focal zone may be created at the target region.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The amplification factors and phase shifts may be computed using the controller <b>108</b>, which may provide the computational functions through software, hardware, firmware, hardwiring, or any combination thereof. For example, the controller <b>108</b> may utilize a general-purpose or special-purpose digital data processor programmed with software in a conventional manner, and without undue experimentation, to determine the frequency, phase shifts and/or amplification factors of the transducer elements <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller computation is based on information about the characteristics (e.g., structure, thickness, density, etc.) of the skull and their effects on propagation of acoustic energy. In various embodiments, such information is obtained from an imager <b>122</b>, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device, a computer tomography (CT) device, a positron emission tomography (PET) device, a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) device, or an ultrasonography device. The imager <b>122</b> may provide a set of two-dimensional images suitable for reconstructing a three-dimensional image of the skull from which thicknesses and densities can be inferred; alternatively, image acquisition may be three-dimensional. In addition, image-manipulation functionality may be implemented in the imager <b>122</b>, in the controller <b>108</b>, or in a separate device.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The system <b>100</b> may be modified in various ways within the scope of the invention. For example, the system may further include an acoustic-signal detector (e.g., a hydrophone) <b>124</b> that measures transmitted or reflected ultrasound, and which may provide the signals it receives to the controller <b>108</b> for further processing. The reflection and transmission signals may also provide an alternative or additional source for determining the phase shifts and/or amplification factors or feedback for the phase and amplitude adjustments of the beamformer <b>106</b> as further described below. The system <b>100</b> may contain a positioner for arranging the array <b>102</b> of transducer elements <b>104</b> with respect to the patient's skull. In order to apply ultrasound therapy to body parts other than the brain, the transducer array <b>102</b> may take a different (e.g., cylindrical) shape. In some embodiments, the transducer elements <b>104</b> are mounted movably and rotatably, providing mechanical degrees of freedom that can be exploited to improve focusing properties. Such movable transducers may be adjusted by conventional actuators, which may be driven by a component of controller <b>108</b> or by a separate mechanical controller.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in various embodiments, one or more transient reflectors <b>202</b> are introduced in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region <b>101</b> for facilitating autofocusing of the ultrasound waves. The microbubbles <b>202</b> may be generated by applying acoustic energy from the transducer elements <b>104</b> to the target <b>101</b>. The microbubbles <b>202</b> can be formed due to the negative pressure produced by the propagating ultrasonic waves or when the heated liquid ruptures and is filled with gas/vapor. Because of their encapsulation of gas, the microbubble(s) <b>202</b> may act as reflectors of the ultrasound waves and transmit coherent omnidirectional signals <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> to the transducer <b>102</b>; the reflection signals <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> can be substantially concurrently detected by the transducer elements <b>104</b> and/or acoustic signal detector <b>124</b> associated therewith as further described below. Based on analysis of the reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may obtain information of the focusing properties at the target region <b>101</b> and subsequently adjust the transducer configurations (e.g., phase shifts and/or amplitudes) so as to compensate for the aberrations caused by the intervening tissue <b>210</b> located between the transducer elements <b>104</b> and target <b>101</b>, thereby optimizing (or at least improving) the focusing properties at the target region. Approaches to generating microbubbles utilizing ultrasound waves are provided, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2019/0308038, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference; and approaches to utilizing the microbubbles to optimize/improve focusing properties of the acoustic beams are provided, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2020/128615, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally or alternatively, the acoustic reflector <b>202</b> may be introduced into the patient's body intravenously; the transient reflector may either be injected systemically into the patient or locally into the target region <b>101</b> using an administration system <b>126</b>. For example, the transient reflector <b>202</b> may include or consist of one or more microbubbles introduced into the patient's brain in the form of liquid droplets that subsequently vaporize to form the microbubbles; or as gas-filled bubbles entrained within a liquid carrier, e.g., a conventional ultrasound contrast agent. Alternatively, other substances suitable for cavitation nucleation can be administered instead of bubbles (see, e.g., https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642153426-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-998046-p174031757).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Typically, an automated administration system may be operated by the controller <b>108</b> or a dedicated controller associated with the administration system. For example, analysis of the reflection signals may cause the controller <b>108</b> to operate the administration device <b>126</b> so as to increase or decrease the amount of acoustic reflectors introduced intravenously and/or adjust the type of microbubbles. Alternatively or additionally, analysis of the reflection signals may cause the controller <b>108</b> to operate the transducer <b>102</b> so as to increase or decrease, via induced cavitation, the amount of circulating or localized microbubbles; an increased acoustic power, for example, may reduce the number of microbubbles by causing their collapse. Alternatively, the administration system <b>126</b> may be manual, such as a simple syringe. In the case of manual administration, analysis of the reflection signals may cause the controller <b>108</b> to determine an adjustment to the amount of acoustic reflectors introduced intravenously and/or the type of microbubbles, and to operate the transducer <b>102</b> based on this determination. Approaches for providing acoustic reflectors to the target region using suitable administration systems are described, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2019/116095, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, the administration system <b>126</b> introduces a relatively low concentration (e.g., 5% of the concentration used for standard imaging) of microbubbles into the target <b>101</b> such that the acoustic reflections appear to originate from a point target (e.g., having a size less than that of a quarter of the sonication wavelength) such as a single microbubble (as opposed to a cloud of microbubbles). This is because reflection signals from a cloud of microbubbles may be incoherent and/or exhibit artifacts due to low SNRs and/or vibrations from the multiple microbubbles; as a result, analysis of the reflection signals from the cloud of microbubbles may be inaccurate and adjustment of the transducer parameters based thereon may be insufficient to account for the aberrations caused by the intervening tissue. In addition, analysis of the reflection signals from the cloud of microbubbles may be computationally expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the microbubble concentration is preferred to be sufficiently high to cause significant interaction with the ultrasound waves, thereby providing detectable reflections for performing the autofocusing procedure. Thus, in one embodiment, prior to the autofocusing procedure, an initial microbubble concentration introduced to the target region is first empirically predetermined based on a pre-clinical study, a pre-treatment procedure, and/or from known literature. Thereafter, an optimization approach is performed to determine the optimal microbubble concentration, acoustic power and/or other parameters associated with the ultrasound transducer and/or microbubbles for facilitating the autofocusing procedure as further described below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an exemplary case, the initial microbubble concentration contains 1.3 milliliter (mL) of a microbubble suspension (acquired from, for example, DEFINITY) diluted in 500 mL of water; the infusion is then introduced into the patient's body with a drip rate of 1 mL/minute. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, after introduction of the microbubbles <b>202</b>, the controller <b>108</b> may activate at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> to sequentially generate multiple foci at various sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> that are in proximity to the target region <b>101</b> (e.g., less than 5 mm away) or at the target region <b>101</b>, and each location may have one or more transient reflectors <b>202</b> associated therewith. For example, the transducer elements <b>104</b> may generate one or more series of sonications to the first sonication location <b>222</b> and measure the reflections from the transient reflector <b>232</b> located in proximity thereto. Subsequently, the transducer elements <b>104</b> may generate another one or more series of sonications to the second sonication location <b>224</b> and measure the reflections from the transient reflector <b>234</b> associated therewith. This process may continue until a desired number of reflection signals (e.g., at least 10) from all (or at least some) of the sonication locations in proximity to the target <b>101</b> are measured.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various embodiments, the sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> are determined based on the image(s) acquired by the imager <b>122</b> and/or the ultrasound transducer <b>102</b>. For example, the imager <b>122</b> may acquire images of the target and/or non-target regions; and the ultrasound transducer <b>102</b> may acquire images of the transient reflector(s) <b>202</b> in the target/non-target regions based on the reflection signals therefrom. Based on the acquired images of the target/non-target regions and the transient reflectors associated therewith, the controller <b>108</b> may select the sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> that are near (e.g., less than 5 mm away) and/or at the target region and having one or more transient reflectors in proximity to thereto (e.g., less than 5 mm away). Approaches to acquiring images of the transient reflector(s) using the reflection signals therefrom are provided, for example, in a U.S. Patent Application No. 62/949,597 (filed on Dec. 18, 2019), the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In various embodiments, the sonications are first transmitted at a low acoustic power (e.g., in the range of 2 to 50 Watts); reflections from the tissue and microbubbles are then measured and analyzed as further described below. Typically, the reflection signals resulting from the low-power transmission may not differ significantly from each other. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the acoustic power of the transmitted sonications is gradually increased until there is a significant change in the parameters (e.g., amplitudes, phases, etc.) associated with the reflection signals between two consecutive measurements. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates five reflection signals <b>312</b>-<b>320</b> from the first sonication location <b>222</b> measured by a transducer element E. Upon receiving the reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may implement an initial signal-processing approach to obtain reflection signals from the transient acoustic reflector <b>232</b> (as opposed to the background reflectors). In one embodiment, the controller <b>108</b> first computes a differential signal <b>322</b> representing the difference between the reflection signals <b>314</b>, <b>312</b> (obtained, e.g., by subtracting the signal <b>312</b> from the signal <b>314</b>), a differential signal <b>324</b> representing the difference between the reflection signals <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, a differential signal <b>326</b> representing the difference between the reflection signals <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, and a differential signal <b>328</b> representing the difference between the reflection signals <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>. In this example, signals <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> are essentially background signals and signal <b>316</b> is a combination of reflection from transient signals and background signals. Therefore, the differential signals <b>324</b> and <b>326</b> are approximately clean reflection signals from the transient reflector <b>232</b>. It should be understood that reflection signals may be analyzed as they are received, i.e., without waiting for subsequent signals or sets of signals.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, subsequently, the controller <b>108</b> may compare the values of the maximal amplitudes associated with the differential signals <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>. As depicted, because there is a significant change in the amplitudes (e.g., by more than 50% or 100%) between the signals <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, the signal <b>324</b> can be selected to determine the focusing properties at the first sonication location <b>222</b>. As used herein, the signal <b>324</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;focusing event,&#x201d; and the acoustic power of the transmitted waves that starts to generate the focusing event is referred to as the first threshold power, P<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the focusing event is identified or selected based on the acoustic field at the sonication location. For example, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the controller may computationally reconstruct the acoustic field at sonication location <b>222</b> based on the measured reflection signals from the transient reflector <b>232</b> in proximity thereto. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, in one embodiment, when the reconstructed acoustic field is confined (e.g., spanning a volume of less than 10 mm<sup>3 </sup>or, in some embodiments, 20 mm<sup>3</sup>), the reflection signal that the confined acoustic field is reconstructed based on is identified as the focusing event. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, when the reconstructed acoustic field is unconfined (e.g., spanning a volume of less than 50 mm<sup>3 </sup>or, in some embodiments, 80 mm<sup>3</sup>), the measured signal may be discarded. Alternatively or additionally, the controller <b>108</b> may computationally reconstruct the acoustic field based on information of the tissue aberrations at the target/non-target region. Approaches for computationally reconstructing the acoustic field based on tissue aberrations are provided, for example, in U.S. Patent Application No. 62/949,597 (filed on Dec. 18, 2019) and PCT Patent Application entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Providing Tissue Information in an Anatomic Target Region Using Acoustic Reflectors&#x201d; filed on even date herewith, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Identification and selection of the focusing events may advantageously allow the reflection signals from the transient reflectors (e.g., microbubbles), as opposed to the background reflectors, to be selected for further analysis. This is because typically, reflection signals from the background reflectors are relatively invariant between two consecutive measurements, whereas reflection signals from the transient reflectors <b>202</b> may exhibit a relatively significant change between two consecutive measurements as the transient reflector moves, evolves or dissipates during the measurement interval. Thus, the differential signals with relatively small amplitude changes likely originate with the background reflectors; in contrast, reflection signals that have relatively large amplitude changes may be more likely from the transient reflectors. As used herein, the term &#x201c;transient reflector&#x201d; refers to an acoustic reflector that dissipates or evolves with time during sonications (e.g., microbubbles) and the term &#x201c;background reflector&#x201d; refers to an acoustic reflector that does not dissipate or evolve significantly during sonication (e.g., the skull).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, a signal-selection approach may be implemented to select the reflection signals that are from single microbubbles. In one embodiment, the signal-selection approach selects the reflection signals based on the consistency therebetween. For example, the reflection signals are considered to have sufficient consistency when the value of a consistency function of the phase delays (or travel times) associated with the reflection signals is maximized or exceeds a predetermined threshold&#x2014;e.g., 40%). By using the reflection signals having sufficient consistency, artifacts exhibited in the signals due to low SNRs and/or vibrations from the multiple microbubbles may advantageously be eliminated (or at least reduced); this thereby provides more accurate information about the focusing properties at the target region. In addition, the computational complexity of analyzing the reflection signals can be significantly reduced. Further details regarding signal selection are provided, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2020/128615, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Generally, the larger the acoustic power of the applied sonications, the larger the number of generated focusing events at the target region will be. Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in various embodiments, the optimization approach commences by gradually increasing the acoustic power of sonications to cause more focusing events until a sufficient number (e.g., 10, or in some embodiments, more than 30) or a sufficient occurrence rate (e.g., one event per second, or in some embodiments, more than 10 events per second) of the focusing events is measured for determining the focusing properties at the sonication location(s) with a desired degree of accuracy and reliability; up to a point (e.g., before non-linear responses of the microbubbles occur), more measurements produce greater accuracy. The power for generating the sufficient number (or sufficient occurrence rate) of focusing events is referred to as an optimal power, P<sub>F</sub>, and can be utilized during the autofocusing procedure&#x2014;i.e., the ultrasound waves are transmitted with the determined power level, P<sub>F</sub>, thereby causing sufficient interaction with the microbubbles at the sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region. In some situations, however, prior to a sufficient number or a sufficient occurrence rate of the focusing events being detected, the acoustic power may have reached the second threshold value, P<sub>2</sub>, where the non-linear responses of the microbubbles (and thereby artifacts in the reflection signals) are detected. Artifacts may significantly reduce the consistency between the reflection signals and thereby cause inaccurate determination of the focusing properties at the target region. Accordingly, upon determining that artifacts are present in the reflection signals or that the number of reflection signals having artifacts exceeds the number of focusing events (i.e., the non-consistent reflection signals exceed the sufficiently consistent reflection signals in number), the optimization approach may adjust another parameter, different from the acoustic power of the transmitted waves, to improve autofocusing performance.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, the microbubble concentration introduced to the patient's body may be adjusted (e.g., increasing it by 10% or, in some embodiments, by 20%). The applied sonications may then start with a low power (e.g., 7 Watts) again, and the power may be gradually increased until the optimal power P<sub>F </sub>is reached. Again, if the acoustic power reaches the second threshold value P<sub>2 </sub>before a sufficient number of focusing events is detected, the microbubble concentration may be further increased. These processes may be alternately and iteratively performed until a sufficient number of the focusing events is detected before the acoustic power reaches the second threshold P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Conversely, in other situations, the initial or adjusted microbubble concentration may result in too many focusing events (e.g., larger than 50, or in some embodiments, larger than 80) when the acoustic power is still low (e.g., less than 8 Watts); this indicates that too many microbubbles are present at the sonication location(s), increasing the computational complexity of analyzing the reflection signals and/or wasting the microbubbles. Accordingly, the microbubble concentration may be reduced (e.g., by 5%, or in some embodiments, 10%) and the sonications may, again, be transmitted at low power (e.g., 7 Watts), with power gradually increased until the optimal acoustic power P<sub>F </sub>is reached for performing autofocusing. These processes may also be alternately and iteratively performed until an optimal concentration of the microbubbles is introduced for providing a sufficient amount (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of detectable focusing events at a sufficiently large (e.g., 10 Watts) acoustic power P<sub>F</sub>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be noted that the above-described optimization approach for determining optimal acoustic power and/or microbubble concentration to facilitate the ultrasound focusing procedure is exemplary only; any suitable approach to optimizing the values of any parameters associated with the ultrasound wave and microbubbles for performing the autofocusing procedure may be used and all such approaches are thus within the scope of the invention. For example, the optimization approach may adjust the transmission pattern of the sonications, the agent type and/or the size of the microbubbles in order to generate a sufficient amount (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of focusing events for determining the focusing properties at the target region.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">After the optimal acoustic power and/or the optimal microbubble concentration are determined, in various embodiments, the ultrasound autofocusing procedure can be commenced by introducing the microbubbles at the determined concentration and activating the transducer <b>102</b> to transmit sonications having the determined optimal acoustic power, P<sub>F</sub>, to the microbubbles at the sonication location(s) in proximity to or at the target region. Reflections from the microbubbles can then be measured using, for example, the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the transducer elements <b>104</b> may possess both transmit and detect capabilities. Thus, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> may be configured to measure acoustic signals reflected from the target region. Approaches to configuring the transducer elements <b>104</b> for detecting reflected signals are provided, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2019/234497, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The measured signals may be provided to the controller <b>108</b> to obtain information, such as the amplitudes and/or phases, associated with the reflections; these may be compared to the amplitudes and/or phases associated with the transmitted ultrasound waves from the transducer elements <b>104</b>. Based on the deviations therebetween, the controller <b>108</b> may adjust the transducer parameters (e.g., phase shifts and/or amplitudes) so as to compensate for the aberrations caused by the intervening tissue <b>206</b> located between the transducer elements <b>104</b> and target <b>101</b>, thereby improving the focusing properties at the target. In one embodiment, adjustments of the ultrasound parameters to compensate for the tissue aberrations are determined based only on focusing events (e.g., reflection signals having sufficient consistency or corresponding to a confined acoustic field at the target) so as to reduce computational complexity and increase measurement accuracy of the focusing properties at the target region. Approaches for autofocusing an ultrasound beam at the target region are provided, for example, in PCT Publication Nos.

The initial microbubble concentration can be determined based on, for example, a pre-clinical study, a pre-treatment procedure, and/or from known literature. In a second step <b>604</b>, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> are activated to transmit a series of low-power (e.g., 7 Watts) sonications to the transient reflector(s), and reflection signals from the tissue and/or transient reflector(s) are measured using, for example, the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b> and/or the transducer elements <b>104</b>. In a third step <b>606</b>, the controller <b>108</b> may implement an initial signal-processing approach to obtain reflection signals from the transient acoustic reflector(s) (as opposed to the background reflector(s)). In one embodiment, reflection signals from the transient acoustic reflector(s) are determined based on the difference between the amplitudes and/or phases associated with the reflection signals in two consecutive measurements. Additionally or alternatively, a signal-selection approach may be implemented to select reflection signals from single microbubbles based on the consistency between the reflection signals (step <b>608</b>). For example, a consistency function of the travel times and/or phase delays associated with the reflection signals is defined, and the reflection signals are considered to have sufficient consistency only when the value of the consistency function is maximized or exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 40%). Subsequently, the controller <b>108</b> may, based on the selected reflection signals, determine whether a sufficient number (e.g., 10, or in some embodiments, more than 30) or a sufficient occurrence rate (one event per second, or in some embodiments, more than 10 events per second) of the focusing events is detected (step <b>610</b>). In one embodiment, the focusing event is identified based on a comparison of the parameter values (e.g., amplitudes, phases, etc.) associated with the selected reflection signals between two measurements. The focusing event occurs only when there is a significant (e.g., more than 50% or 100%) change in the parameter values. Alternatively, the focusing event may be identified based on a computationally reconstructed acoustic field at the sonication location. The acoustic field reconstruction may be based on the measured reflection signals from the transient reflector(s) and/or the information of tissue aberrations at the target/non-target region. In some embodiments, when the controller <b>108</b> determines that a sufficient number or sufficient occurrence rate of the focusing events has not yet been reached, the controller determines whether a threshold power corresponding to the non-linear responses of the acoustic reflectors has been reached (step <b>612</b>). For example, the non-linear responses may be determined based on the artifacts present in the reflection signals or the ratio of the number of reflection signals having artifacts to the number of focusing events. If the acoustic power of the sonications has reached the threshold value, the microbubble concentration may be increased (e.g., by 5%, or in some embodiments, 10%) (step <b>614</b>). Otherwise, the power of the applied sonications may be increased (step <b>616</b>). In various embodiments, when a sufficient number (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of the focusing events is measured, the controller <b>108</b> determines whether too many focusing events (e.g., larger than 50, or in some embodiments, larger than 80) have occurred (or too high of an event occurrence rate is detected) when the acoustic power is still low (e.g., less than 8 Watts) (step <b>618</b>). If so, the concentration of the acoustic reflectors may be reduced (e.g., by 5%, or in some embodiments, 10%) (step <b>620</b>). Otherwise, the power of the applied sonications may be gradually increased until the optimal power P<sub>F </sub>is reached (step <b>622</b>). Steps <b>602</b>-<b>622</b> may be iteratively performed until the optimal concentration of the microbubbles and the optimal acoustic power are obtained. Thereafter, the autofocusing procedure can be commenced using the determined optimal acoustic power and optimal concentration of the acoustic reflectors (step <b>624</b>). In addition, based on the focusing events measured during the autofocusing procedure, the ultrasound parameters (e.g., amplitude and/or phases) can be adjusted in order to compensate for tissue aberrations, thereby optimizing focusing properties at each sonication location that are in proximity to or at the target region (step <b>626</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, various embodiments provide an approach for determining optimal value(s) of one or more parameters (e.g., the acoustic power, microbubble concentration, etc.) associated with the ultrasound transducer and/or the acoustic reflector <b>202</b> for performing an accurate and reliable ultrasound autofocusing procedure. Because optimization can be performed for each patient, the obtained optimal values may be patient-specific. As a result, the autofocusing procedure may be used to compensate for aberrations resulting from patient-specific intervening tissue and thereby obtain optimal steering parameters (e.g., ultrasound amplitudes, phases) to focus acoustic energy at the target region.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In various embodiments, after an optimal focus is created at the target region, the peak power or deposited acoustic energy at the target increases, thereby causing undesired damage to the target and/or non-target tissue. Thus, it may be desired to estimate the peak power/energy increase at the target due to improvement of the focusing properties and adjust an ultrasound parameter (e.g., the acoustic power level applied by the transducer elements) to compensate for the peak power/energy increase. In various embodiments, estimation of the peak power/energy increase at the target <b>101</b> is based on the sufficiently consistent reflection signals received from various sonication locations that are in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) or at the target <b>101</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates four sufficiently consistent reflection signals <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> received from the transient reflectors <b>712</b>-<b>718</b> located in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) sonication locations R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>4</sub>, respectively, which are in proximity to or at the target <b>101</b>. Typically, the sonication locations are sufficiently proximate spatially (e.g., 2 mm apart) that differences in aberrations resulting from, for example, the movements and/or changes in the intervening tissue located between the transducer elements and the sonication locations R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>4 </sub>can be ignored. In one embodiment, a physical model and/or the imager <b>122</b> (or other suitable device) is implemented to predict and/or measure the temperature increase &#x394;T<sub>1 </sub>at the sonication location R<sub>1 </sub>that results from the phase adjustment, &#x3c6;<sub>i</sub>, associated with the transducer element E for generating an optimal focus at the first sonication location R<sub>1</sub>.

Based on the images, one or more treatment parameters (e.g., tissue characteristics associated with the target tissue and/or intervening tissue and the geometry of the location and orientation of the target relative to the transducer elements) associated with the current patient can be determined (step <b>956</b>). The controller <b>108</b> may then look up the treatment profile to identify the treatment parameters that most closely match the treatment parameters of the current patient (step <b>958</b>), and based thereon determine the required phase adjustments for generating an optimal focus at the target <b>101</b> as well as the required power level/frequency/energy level adjustments to compensate for the peak power/temperature increase resulting from optimization/improvement of the focusing properties at the focus (due to adjustments of the phases) (step <b>960</b>). Subsequently, the transducer elements can be operated based on the determined adjustments of the phases, power levels, frequencies, and/or energy levels (step <b>962</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">In some embodiments, the ultrasound parameter adjustment approaches <b>900</b>, <b>930</b>, <b>950</b> described above are implemented when properties of the intervening tissue change during the ultrasound procedure. For example, during a long sonication procedure for ablating a brain tumor, the properties of the skull through which the ultrasound waves travel before reaching the target tumor may change due to the heat accumulated therein. To compensate for the change in the properties of the skull and maintain the focusing properties at the target, the configuration (e.g., amplitudes and/or phases) associated with the transducer elements may have to be adjusted (because, again, after the phase adjustments, the energy deposited at the focal zone may significantly increase and can cause adverse effects at the target/non-target tissue). Accordingly, the acoustic-power adjustment approach described above may be implemented to reduce the acoustic power levels applied by the transducer elements <b>104</b>, thereby compensating for the peak power/energy increase at the focal zone.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;optimal&#x201d; and &#x201c;optimizing&#x201d; generally involve a substantial improvement (e.g., by more than 10%, more than 20%, or more than 30%) over the prior art, but do not necessarily imply achievement of the best theoretically possible energy absorption. In addition, functionality for performing autofocusing of ultrasound beams and adjusting the ultrasound parameters (e.g., phases, acoustic power levels, frequencies, acoustic energy levels, etc.), such as selecting reflection signals from the acoustic reflectors based on the difference between the amplitudes and/or phases associated with the reflection signals in two consecutive measurements, computationally reconstructing acoustic fields at the sonication locations, selecting reflection signals from single acoustic reflectors based on the consistency between the reflection signals and/or the reconstructed acoustic fields, determining whether a sufficient number (or a sufficient occurrence rate) of the focusing events is detected, determining whether a threshold power corresponding to the non-linear responses of the acoustic reflectors has been reached, causing the acoustic power of the applied sonications to be increased or reduced, causing the concentration of the acoustic reflectors to be increased or reduced, determining whether too many focusing events have occurred when the acoustic power is still low, commencing the autofocusing procedure based on the determined optimal acoustic power and optimal concentration of the acoustic reflectors, adjusting the ultrasound parameters based on the focusing events measured during the autofocusing procedure, establishing a relationship between the ultrasound parameters and the resulting temperature changes at the target either empirically or using a physical model, predicting the peak power/temperature change in the first sonication location, estimating the peak power/temperature changes in the other sonication locations based at least in part on the predicted/measured peak power/temperature change in the first sonication location, determining whether the predicted/measured change in the peak power/temperature at each sonication location exceeds a maximum allowable change or causes the peak power/temperature at the target to exceed a target value, adjusting the ultrasound parameter value(s) so as to reduce the predicted peak power/temperature change at the sonication locations, computationally shifting all (or at least some) transient acoustic reflectors to coincide at a single location, computationally determining the phases associated with the shifted reflection signals and/or the unshifted reflection signal at the coincident location, determining the phase associated with each transducer element based on the phases associated with the shifted reflection signals and/or the unshifted reflection signal, determining the acoustic power/temperature increase resulting from each of the shifted and/or unshifted reflection signals, determining the acoustic power/temperature increase at the coincident location based on the acoustic power/temperature increases resulting from the shifted and/or unshifted reflection signals, establishing a treatment profile of patients who previously experienced the ultrasound procedure, acquiring images associated with the target region of the current patient, determining one or more treatment parameters associated with the target of the current patient based on the acquired images, identifying the treatment parameters in the treatment profile that most closely match the treatment parameters of the current patient, and determining the required phase adjustments for generating an optimal focus at the target of the current patient as well as the required adjustments of the power level/frequency/energy level associated with the transducer for reducing the acoustic power/temperature change, as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, whether integrated within a controller of the imager, the administration system, and/or an ultrasound system, or provided by a separate external controller, may be structured in one or more modules implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.
