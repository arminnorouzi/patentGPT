Call collision occurs when two users call each other at the same time (or within a processing time for a call) and the calls get dropped at both ends due to the fact that both users are busy. For example, in legacy UE technology, a UE may attempt to initiate a phone call to a second UE and may receive an indication that the second UE is busy if the second UE is already on a call with another UE or is in the process of attempting to connect with another UE. In response to receiving the indication that the second UE is busy, the UE may drop the call. When two UEs are calling each other, both UEs may indicate that they are busy and both UE may drop the call. Accordingly, the call may not be completed between the two UEs due to each of the UEs detecting the indication of being busy received the other UE. As per legacy specification or state-of-art implementation, there is no method to resolve the conflict even if both the calls intends to call same destinations. This will cause a bad user experience.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example network arrangement <b>100</b> in accordance with some embodiments.

The CN <b>110</b> may be connected to the NodeBs, such as the first NodeB <b>106</b> and the second NodeB <b>108</b> in the illustrated embodiment. For example, the CN <b>110</b> may be wiredly connected to the NodeBs (such as via a fiber optic backhaul), wirelessly connected to the NodeBs (such as via a wireless backhaul), or some combination thereof. The CN <b>110</b> may include CN interface circuitry (such as the CN interface circuitry <b>1112</b> (FIG. XX)) that facilitates communication between the CN <b>110</b> and the NodeBs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The network illustrated in the network arrangement <b>100</b> may facilitate a call between the first UE <b>102</b> and the second UE <b>104</b>. In particular, one of the UEs may operate as an originator of the call (where the originator initiates the call) and the other of the UEs may operate as a termination of the call (where the termination accepts or rejects the call initiated by the originator). For clarity, the following description will describe the first UE <b>102</b> as the originator of a call and the second UE <b>104</b> as the termination of the call.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first UE <b>102</b> may initiate a call with the second UE <b>104</b> in response to a user of the first UE <b>102</b> indicating that the first UE <b>102</b> is to call the second UE <b>104</b>. The user of the first UE <b>102</b> may indicate that the first UE <b>102</b> is to call the second UE <b>104</b> by providing an identifier associated with the second UE <b>104</b> (such as entering a phone number, or selecting a stored phone number or contact) at the first UE <b>102</b> and interacting with first UE <b>102</b> (such as selecting button that initiates a call or providing a command to initiate a call) to indicate a call is to be initiated. The first UE <b>102</b> may establish a connection with the first NodeB <b>106</b> for the call. For example, a radio resource control (RRC) connection setup may be performed to establish a connection between the first UE <b>102</b> and the first NodeB <b>106</b>. Further, the CN <b>110</b> may set up a quality of service (QoS) flow for the first UE <b>102</b> to carry session initiation protocol (SIP) signaling and the first NodeB <b>106</b> may set up a data radio bearer (DRB) for the first UE <b>102</b> for the call.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Based on the initiation of the call by the first UE <b>102</b>, a connection may be established between the second UE <b>104</b> and the second NodeB <b>108</b>. For example, an RRC connection setup may be performed to establish a connection between the second UE <b>104</b> and the second NodeB <b>108</b>. Further, the CN <b>110</b> may set up a QoS flow for the second UE <b>104</b> to carry SIP signaling and the second NodeB <b>108</b> may set up a DRB for the second UE <b>104</b> for the call.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once SIP negotiation is successful, the CN <b>110</b> may set up a QoS flow for the first UE <b>102</b> to carry real-time transport protocol (RTP) and real-time control protocol (RTCP) data flows for the first UE <b>102</b>. Further, the CN <b>110</b> may set up a QoS flow for the second UE <b>104</b> to carry RTP and RTCP data flows once the SIP negotiation is successful. The CN <b>110</b> may further set up DRBs for the first UE <b>102</b> and the second UE <b>104</b> for the call.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first UE <b>102</b> and the second UE <b>104</b> may then exchange information related to the call. For example, the second UE <b>104</b> may provide an alert to the first UE <b>102</b> indicating that the second UE <b>104</b> has received the call request from the first UE <b>102</b>. The second UE <b>104</b> may provide an acceptance of the call (for example, establish the call between the first UE <b>102</b> and the second UE <b>104</b>) or a rejection of the call (for example, a busy message due to the second UE <b>104</b> being unable to connect the call). If the call is accepted, the first UE <b>102</b> and the second UE <b>104</b> may exchange voice frames via the connections with the NodeBs and the CN <b>110</b> for the call.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The call may be terminated at some point and the resources for the call may be released. For example, the call may be terminated based on a user of the first UE <b>102</b> indicating that the call is to be terminated, a user of the second UE <b>104</b> indicating that the call is to be terminated, the network (including the first NodeB <b>106</b>, the second NodeB <b>108</b> and the CN <b>110</b>) terminating the call, or some combination thereof. In some embodiments, the call may be terminated due to the first UE <b>102</b> losing connection with the first NodeB <b>106</b> and/or the second UE <b>104</b> losing connection with the second NodeB <b>108</b>. The UEs may release the QoS flows for the call and the NodeBs may release the DRBs based on the termination of the call.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While a particular network and particular procedure for a call is described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that embodiments described herein are not limited to the particular network and/or the particular procedure described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, the first call <b>206</b> may include the first UE <b>202</b> dialing the second UE <b>204</b> as part of an outgoing call in <b>208</b>. The dialing by the first UE <b>202</b> in <b>208</b> may include one or more messages transmitted between the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> that indicate the first UE <b>202</b> has initiated the first call <b>206</b> to the second UE <b>204</b> and/or the second UE <b>204</b> has received one or more signals related to the first call <b>206</b>. In response to the dialing in <b>208</b> being received by the second UE <b>204</b>, the second UE <b>204</b> may accept the first call <b>206</b> initiated by the first UE <b>202</b> in <b>210</b>. The acceptance in <b>210</b> of the call by the second UE <b>204</b> may establish the first call <b>206</b> between the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the call flow <b>200</b>, the first call <b>206</b> may be dropped in <b>212</b>. In particular, the first call <b>206</b> may be terminated in <b>212</b> that was not initiated by the user of the first UE <b>202</b> nor the user of the second UE <b>204</b>. For example, the first call <b>206</b> between the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> may be terminated by a network servicing the first call <b>206</b> and/or one or both of the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> losing connection with the network.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Based on the first call <b>206</b> being dropped in <b>212</b>, the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> may attempt to initiate a call with each other. For example, suppose there was a call-drop, then the first action that may be done by both caller and callee is to dial each other, but often it lands to unsuccessful call attempts by both side due to fact that each other is busy calling (in fact same peers). This may lead to major frustration and bad user experience. In particular, the first UE <b>202</b> may dial the second UE <b>204</b> as part of an outgoing call from the first UE <b>202</b> in <b>214</b> at approximately the same time the second UE <b>204</b> may dial the first UE <b>202</b> as part of an outgoing call from the second UE <b>204</b> in <b>216</b>. For example, the dialing by the first UE <b>202</b> in <b>214</b> may occur prior to a time that the first UE <b>202</b> detects the dialing of <b>216</b> and the dialing by the second UE <b>204</b> in <b>216</b> may occur prior to a time that the second UE <b>204</b> detects the dialing of <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The dialing by a UE may initiate a connection process for establishing a call between the UEs. The UE may be unable to accept an incoming call during the connection process. In some embodiments, the connection process may extend from a time when the UE initiates the dialing to a time when the call causes the other UE to ring. For example, the first UE <b>202</b> may detect the dialing of <b>216</b> during a connection process initiated by the dialing of <b>214</b>. Due to the first UE <b>202</b> detecting the dialing of <b>216</b> during the connection process, the first UE <b>202</b> may reject the incoming call and provide an indication of the rejection to the second UE <b>204</b> in <b>218</b>. The second UE <b>204</b> may detect the dialing of <b>214</b> during a connection process initiated by the dialing of <b>216</b>. Due to the second UE <b>204</b> detecting the dialing of <b>214</b> during the connection process, the second UE <b>204</b> may reject the incoming call and provide an indication of the rejection to the first UE <b>202</b> in <b>220</b>.

The procedure associated with the third call <b>226</b> may include one or more of the features of the procedure associated with the second call <b>224</b>. In particular, the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> may perform the procedures of the second call <b>224</b> in the third call <b>226</b>. The third call <b>226</b> may fail based on the first UE <b>202</b> and the second UE <b>204</b> attempting to initiate the third call <b>226</b> at approximately the same time.

The second UE <b>404</b> may detect an interaction from the user of the second UE <b>404</b> indicating that the user accepts the call. The second UE <b>404</b> may transmit an acceptance message to the first UE <b>402</b> in <b>410</b> indicating that the second UE <b>404</b> accepts establishment of the first call <b>406</b>. The first call <b>406</b> may be established between the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> based on the acceptance message of <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the embodiment above described the second UE <b>404</b> terminating the outgoing call based on the second UE <b>404</b> being the terminator of the first call <b>406</b>, it should be understood that the UE that terminates the outgoing call may be the originator of the previous call in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the call flow <b>400</b>, the first call <b>406</b> may be dropped in <b>412</b>. For example, the first UE <b>402</b> (which may be referred to as UE-A) may call the second UE <b>404</b> (which may be referred to as UE-B) and, after picking call, call got dropped. In particular, the first call <b>406</b> may be terminated in <b>412</b>, where the termination was not initiated by the user of the first UE <b>402</b> nor the user of the second UE <b>404</b>. For example, the first call <b>406</b> between the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may be terminated by a network servicing the first call <b>406</b> and/or one or both of the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> losing connection with the network.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Based on the first call <b>406</b> being dropped in <b>412</b>, the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may attempt to initiate another call with each other. The first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may attempt to initiate a second call <b>414</b> to each other based on a user of the first UE <b>402</b> requesting a call being initiated to the second UE <b>404</b> and a user of the second UE <b>404</b> requesting a call being initiated to the first UE <b>402</b>. For example, now the first UE <b>402</b> (which may be referred to as UE-A) may dial the second UE <b>404</b> (which may be referred to as UE-B), and the second UE <b>404</b> (UE-B) may dial the first UE <b>402</b> (UE-A) (for example, call collision may occur).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first UE <b>402</b> may dial the second UE <b>404</b> as part of an outgoing call from the first UE <b>402</b> in <b>416</b> based on the request of the user of the first UE <b>402</b> to establish the second call <b>414</b> with the second UE <b>404</b>. At approximately the same time, the second UE <b>404</b> may dial the first UE <b>402</b> as part of an outgoing call from the second UE <b>404</b> in <b>418</b> based on the request of the user of the second UE <b>404</b> to establish the second call <b>414</b> with the first UE <b>402</b>. A delay may exist between a time that the first UE <b>402</b> dials the second UE <b>404</b> and a time that the second UE <b>404</b> detects and/or processes the dialing from the first UE <b>402</b>. The delay may correspond to a connection process for the dialing by the first UE <b>402</b> in <b>416</b>. Further, a delay may exist between a time that the second UE <b>404</b> dials the first UE <b>402</b> and a time that the first UE <b>402</b> detects and/or processes the dialing from the second UE <b>404</b>. The delay may correspond to a connection process for the dialing by the second UE <b>404</b> in <b>418</b>. The dialing by the first UE <b>402</b> and the dialing by the second UE <b>404</b> being at approximately the same time may refer to the dialing by the first UE <b>402</b> being detected by the second UE <b>404</b> during the connection process for the dialing by the second UE <b>404</b> and the dialing by the second UE <b>404</b> being detected by the first UE <b>402</b> during the connection process for the dialing by the first UE <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may be unable to accept incoming calls received during the connection process for outgoing calls. Accordingly, the first UE <b>402</b> may be unable to accept the call from the second UE <b>404</b> corresponding to the dialing in <b>418</b> within the connection process for the dialing in <b>416</b>. Further, the second UE <b>404</b> may be unable to accept the call from the first UE <b>402</b> corresponding to the dialing in <b>416</b> within the connection process for the dialing in <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">However, on a call, UE may not voluntarily reject call without considering source(number) of incoming call and outgoing call which is in progress in the illustrated embodiment. Instead devices can have more intelligence and resolve conflict with solutions provided as below. In particular, rather than the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> rejecting the incoming calls corresponding to the dialing in <b>416</b> and the dialing in <b>418</b>, one or both of the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may consider the source of the incoming calls corresponding to the dialing in <b>416</b> and/or the dialing in <b>418</b> prior to rejecting the incoming calls. For example, the dialing in <b>416</b> and the dialing in <b>418</b> may include an identifier of the source of the dialing. In some embodiments, the identifier may comprise a phone number corresponding to the source of the dialing. For example, the dialing in <b>416</b> may include an identifier of the first UE <b>402</b> that initiated the dialing in <b>416</b>. The dialing in <b>418</b> may include an identifier of the second UE <b>404</b> that initiated the dialing in <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the first UE <b>402</b> receives the dialing from the second UE <b>404</b>, the first UE <b>402</b> may extract the identifier of the second UE <b>404</b> from the dialing in <b>418</b>. Further, when the second UE <b>404</b> receives the dialing from the first UE <b>402</b>, the second UE <b>404</b> may extract the identifier of the first UE <b>402</b> from the dialing in <b>416</b>. One or both of the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> may utilize the corresponding identifier to determine whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or whether to reject or accept the incoming call. In some embodiments, the first UE <b>402</b> and/or the second UE <b>404</b> may further utilize information related to a previous call (such as the first call <b>406</b>) to determine whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or whether to reject or accept the incoming call. If UE is in dialing state and simultaneously receives an incoming call, incoming call source matches with destination of outgoing call, and incoming call source matches with previously stored caller identifier, UE may terminate outgoing call procedure and proceed with incoming call procedures, thus giving priority to previous call originator.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In embodiments where one of the first UE <b>402</b> or the second UE <b>404</b> determines whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or whether to reject or accept the incoming call, the UE that performs the determination may determine whether to terminate the outgoing call based on the identifier of the source and/or information of the previous call. For clarity, the following discussion will treat the second UE <b>404</b> as the UE that performs the determination whether to reject the incoming call and the first UE <b>402</b> will not perform a determination. In some embodiments, the UEs may indicate whether each of the UEs may be able to perform the determination. For example, the dialing by each of the UE may include an indication of whether the UE initiating the dialing can perform the determination. A UE that receives the dialing may utilize the indication to determine a procedure for determining whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or accept the incoming call.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In these embodiments, the first UE <b>402</b> (which may be referred to as UE-A device) which is in dialing state may reject incoming call (no additional steps required from legacy behavior). The second UE <b>404</b> (which may be referred to as UE-B device), which may have more intelligence, may know call in progress is to same number, previous call was with UE-A, and was initiated by UE-A. Hence UE-B can allow incoming call and abort outgoing call procedure. The second UE <b>404</b> may determine whether to terminate the outgoing call corresponding to the dialing <b>418</b> and/or accept the incoming call corresponding to the dialing <b>416</b> based on the identifier of the source of the incoming call. For example, the second UE <b>404</b> may extract identifier of the source from the dialing <b>416</b>, which may be an identifier of the first UE <b>402</b> in the illustrated embodiment. The second UE <b>404</b> may compare the identifier of the source with an identifier of a target for the outgoing call corresponding to the dialing <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the second UE <b>404</b> determines that the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target correspond to the same device (for example, the first UE <b>402</b> in the illustrated embodiment), the second UE <b>404</b> may determine that call collision exists between the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b>, and may terminate the outgoing call corresponding to the dialing of <b>418</b> and/or accept the incoming call corresponding to the dialing of <b>416</b>. In particular, the second UE <b>404</b> may terminate the outgoing call initiated by the second UE <b>404</b> in <b>420</b>. Based on the termination of the outgoing call, the second UE <b>404</b> may process the dialing from <b>416</b> and cause the second UE <b>404</b> to ring to indicate to the user of the second UE <b>404</b> that the first UE <b>402</b> is attempting to establish a call with the second UE <b>404</b>. The second UE <b>404</b> may further transmit an acceptance message to the first UE in <b>422</b> to indicate that the second UE <b>404</b> accepts the call initiated by the first UE <b>402</b> based on a user of the second UE <b>404</b> indicating the call is to be accepted. The second call <b>414</b> may be established in <b>424</b> based on the acceptance of <b>422</b>. If the second UE <b>404</b> determines that the identifier of the source corresponds to a different device than the identifier of the target, the second UE <b>404</b> may reject the incoming call from the first UE <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, the second UE <b>404</b> may determine that the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target correspond to the same device based on the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target matching, and may determine that the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target correspond to different devices based on the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target not matching.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In embodiments where both the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b> determine whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or whether to accept or reject the incoming call, the determinations by the first UE <b>402</b> and/or the second UE <b>404</b> may be based on the identification of the source of the incoming and/or the information related to a previous call. Each of the UEs may determine whether the identifier of the source for the incoming call and the identifier of the target for the outgoing call correspond to the same device. For example, the first UE <b>402</b> may compare the identifier of the source of the incoming call corresponding to the ringing of <b>418</b> to the identifier of the target of the outgoing call corresponding to the ringing of <b>416</b>. If the first UE <b>402</b> determines that the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target correspond to the same device, the first UE <b>402</b> may determine that a call collision exists between the first UE <b>402</b> and the second UE <b>404</b>, and may continue with determining whether to terminate the outgoing call and/or whether to accept or reject the incoming call. If the first UE <b>402</b> determines that the identifier of the source and the identifier of the target correspond to different devices, the first UE <b>402</b> may determine to reject the incoming call. In the illustrated embodiment, the first UE <b>402</b> may determine that the identifier of the source of the incoming call and the identifier of the target of the outgoing call correspond to the second UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second UE <b>404</b> may compare the identifier of the source of the incoming call corresponding to the ringing of <b>416</b> to the identifier of the target of the outgoing call corresponding to the ringing of <b>418</b>.

For example, the first UE <b>402</b> and/or the second UE <b>404</b> may store identifiers of one or more previous calls, and may indicate which of the identifiers correspond to originators of the previous calls and/or terminators of the previous calls.
