Definitions of the directions described above are the same in all drawings hereinafter. In the drawings of this specification, only a portion may be shown for convenience of illustration. When describing with reference to the drawings, the same or corresponding components are given the same reference numerals, and overlapping descriptions thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an integrated circuit according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an integrated circuit <b>10</b> may receive a command CMD, an address ADDR, a clock signal CLK, and write data DATA_IN, and output a read data DATA_OUT. For example, the integrated circuit <b>10</b> may receive a command CMD (which may be referred to as a write command) instructing a write, an address ADDR (which may be referred to as a write address), and write data DATA_IN and may store the write data DATA_IN in an area of a memory cell block <b>11</b> corresponding to the address. In addition, the integrated circuit <b>10</b> may receive a command CMD (which may be referred to as a read command) and an address ADDR (which may be referred to as a read address) instructing a read, and may output to the outside the read data DATA_OUT stored in the area of the memory cell block <b>11</b> corresponding to the address.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The memory cell block <b>11</b> may include a plurality of bit cells <b>12</b>. The plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be arranged at regular intervals. The plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be provided at intersections of the word lines WLs and the bit lines BLs. That is, each of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be connected to at least one of the plurality of word lines WLs and may be connected to at least one of the plurality of bit lines BLs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be a memory cell. For example, each of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be static random access memory (SRAM), or a volatile memory cell such as, for example, dynamic random access memory (DRAM). In particular, each of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be a dual port SRAM (DPSRAM) cell capable of simultaneously performing a write operation and a read operation. According to an example embodiment, the bit cell <b>12</b> may be a non-volatile memory cell, such as flash memory, resistive random access memory (RRAM), or the like. Example embodiments of the present disclosure will be mainly described with reference to a DPSRAM cell, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an example embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>10</b> may include a column driver <b>13</b>, a row driver <b>14</b> and a control block <b>15</b>. The column driver <b>13</b> may be connected to the memory cell block <b>11</b> through a plurality of bit lines BLs. The column driver <b>13</b> may select at least one bit line from among the plurality of bit lines BLs based on the column address COL. For example, the column driver <b>13</b> may select a first bit line BLA of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and a first complementary bit line BLAb of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is complementary to the first bit line BLA of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The first bit line BLA and the first complementary bit line BLAb may be connected to any one of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b>. Accordingly, as the column driver <b>13</b> selects the first bit line BLA and the first complementary bit line BLAb, a plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> connected to the first bit line BLA and the first complementary bit line BLAb may be selected.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The column driver <b>13</b> may perform a read operation or a write operation based on the control signal CTR. The column driver <b>13</b> may identify values stored in a bit cell connected to an activated word line among a plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> by sensing a current and/or a voltage received through the plurality of bit lines BLs, and may output the read data DATA_OUT based on the identified values. The column driver <b>13</b> may apply a current and/or a voltage to the plurality of bit lines BLs based on the write data DATA_IN, and may write values to one of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> connected to the activated word line. According to an example embodiment, the column driver <b>13</b> may include a read circuit that performs a read operation and a write circuit that performs a write operation. According to an example embodiment, the column driver <b>13</b> may include a bit line precharge circuit for precharging the plurality of bit lines BLs.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The row driver <b>14</b> may be connected to the memory cell block <b>11</b> through a plurality of word lines WLs. The row driver <b>14</b> may activate at least one word line among the plurality of word lines WLs based on the row address ROW. That is, the row driver <b>14</b> may select at least one word line from among the plurality of word lines WLs. Accordingly, bit cells connected to the activated word line may be selected from among the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The control block <b>15</b> may receive a command CMD, an address ADDR, and a clock signal CLK, and may generate a row address ROW, a column address COL, and a control signal CTR. For example, the controller <b>15</b> may identify the read command by decoding the command CMD, and may generate a row address ROW, a column address COL, and a control signal CTR to read the read data DATA_OUT from the memory cell block <b>11</b>. Also, the control block <b>15</b> may identify the write command by decoding the command CMD, and may generate a row address ROW, a column address COL, and a control signal CTR to write data DATA_IN to the memory cell block <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Example embodiments of the present disclosure are described primarily with reference to a DPSRAM cell, so that each of the plurality of bit cells <b>12</b> may be connected to two word lines, two bit lines, and two complementary bit lines.
