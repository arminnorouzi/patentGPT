In recent years, development has been in progress also for a driver abnormality response system (EDSS; Emergency Driving Stop System) which automatically decelerates and then stops a vehicle when an abnormality such as fainting of a driver is detected (see Patent Document 1 for example).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-331652</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the activation of the driver abnormality response system described above, since the driver has a high risk of not being able to drive, it is important to activate the collision damage mitigation brake more appropriately to avoid collision of the vehicle. However, since in general, the collision damage mitigation brake is based on the premise that the driver has no abnormality, and also has a risk when having caused unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to erroneous activation, the situations for activating the collision damage mitigation brake are limited. Thus, there has been a demand for a technique that more reliably avoids collision when a driver has an abnormality.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been devised in view of such problems, and an object thereof is to more reliably reduce a risk of collision when an abnormality of a driver is detected.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means to solve the Problem to The present disclosure has been made to solve at least a part of the above-mentioned problems, and can be realized as following aspects or application examples.</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(1) A vehicle control device according to this present application example includes: a first control unit that executes, when an abnormality of a driver of a vehicle is detected, stop control which automatically decelerates and then stops the vehicle; a second control unit that executes, when the vehicle is determined to have a risk of collision, deceleration control which automatically decelerates the vehicle; a determination unit that identifies an object around the vehicle as a target candidate of the collision and determines whether or not there is the risk of the collision with the identified target candidate; and a setting unit that sets, when the abnormality is detected, an operation mode of the deceleration control to a special mode from a normal mode. The normal mode is provided for cases in which the abnormality is undetected. In the vehicle control device, the determination unit expands a range for identifying the object around the vehicle as the target candidate of the collision in the special mode as compared with the range in the normal mode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, in the special mode, the range of the target candidate is expanded to result in a higher probability of determining that there is the risk of the collision with the target candidate as compared with the probability in the normal mode, so that the opportunity to execute the deceleration control increases. Therefore, when the abnormality of the driver is detected, the deceleration control is more likely to be executed as compared with cases where the abnormality of the deriver is undetected. Hence, even if the driver is in a state unable to drive, the collision can be easily avoided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, when the abnormality of the driver is undetected, the target candidate is narrowed to result in a lower probability of determining that there is the risk of the collision as compared with the case where the abnormality of the driver is detected. Accordingly, when the driver has no abnormality and has a high possibility of being able to avoid the collision by one's driving operation, erroneous activation of the deceleration control (unnecessary execution of the deceleration control) are reduced, so that unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to the deceleration control can be easily avoided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the determination unit may identify the object that has been continuously detected for a predetermined first period or longer as the target candidate in the normal mode, and may identify the object that has been continuously detected for a predetermined second period or longer as the target candidate in the special mode. The predetermined second period may be shorter than the predetermined first period.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the special mode, by regarding the object which has been continuously detected for a shorter duration (detection period) as the target candidate, the target candidate is identified earlier than in the normal mode. As a result, in the special mode, even if the target is detected late, the deceleration control is started at an earlier timing as compared with the timing in the normal mode, so that the collision of the vehicle is easily avoided at a higher probability.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by regarding the object which has been continuously detected for a longer duration (detection period) as the target candidate, the target candidate is identified more accurately than in the special mode. As a result, in the normal mode, the accuracy of determining presence or absence of a collision risk is enhanced, which further reduces erroneous activation of the deceleration control.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(3) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the determination unit may preferentially regard the object of a predetermined type as the target candidate in the normal mode, and may identify the target candidate regardless of the predetermined type in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the special mode, by allowing any types of objects to be the target candidate, the deceleration control is executed when there is the risk of the collision with any types of objects. Accordingly, the collision of the vehicle is more easily avoided in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by preferentially regarding the object of the predetermined type as the target candidate, the execution of the deceleration control is avoided for the object such as the one detected based on unreliable information or the one with a structure (shape) that is less likely to cause damage even in collision. Therefore, in the normal mode, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to the deceleration control is further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(4) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the determination unit may exclude the object within a predetermined range from the target candidate in the normal mode, and may identify the target candidate regardless of the predetermined range in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the special mode, by allowing the object located in any directions to be the target candidate, the deceleration control is executed when there is the risk of the collision with the object located in any directions. Accordingly, the collision of the vehicle is more easily avoided in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by excluding the object within the predetermined range from the target candidate, the execution of the deceleration control is avoided for the object beside or behind the vehicle, for example. Therefore, in the normal mode, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to the deceleration control is further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(5) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the determination unit may exclude the object outside a traveling lane of the vehicle from the target candidate in the normal mode, and may identify the target candidate based on a traveling direction of the vehicle regardless of the traveling lane in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the special mode, by allowing the object outside the traveling lane but in the forward direction to be the target candidate, the deceleration control is executed when there is the risk of the collision with the object in the forward direction. Accordingly, the collision of the vehicle is more easily avoided in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by excluding the object outside the traveling lane of the vehicle from the target candidate, the execution of the deceleration control is avoided for another vehicle traveling in an adjacent lane, for example. Therefore, in the normal mode, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to the deceleration control is further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(6) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the second control unit may interrupt the executed deceleration control when the vehicle is determined to have no risk of the collision in the normal mode, and may continue the executed deceleration control even when the vehicle is determined to have no risk of the collision in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the special mode, even if it is determined that there is no risk of the collision, by continuing the ongoing deceleration control, the collision of the vehicle is more easily avoided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by interrupting the ongoing deceleration control when it is determined that there is no risk of the collision, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle due to the deceleration control is further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">(7) In the vehicle control device according to the present application example, the second control unit may discontinue the deceleration control when a predetermined cancel operation by the driver is performed at least once in the normal mode, and may discontinue the deceleration control when the cancel operation is performed a plurality of times in the special mode.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As such, by setting the number of the cancel operations required for discontinuing the deceleration control larger in the special mode than in the normal mode, discontinuation of the deceleration control due to an unintended cancel operation is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by discontinuing the deceleration control even with a single cancel operation, the deceleration control can be easily discontinued when the driver determines that the deceleration control is unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">(8) A vehicle control method according to this application example includes: a first control step that executes, when an abnormality of a driver of a vehicle is detected, stop control which automatically decelerates and then stops the vehicle; a second control step that executes, when the vehicle is determined to have a risk of collision, deceleration control which automatically decelerates the vehicle; a determination step that identifies an object around the vehicle as a target candidate of the collision and determines whether or not there is the risk of the collision with the identified target candidate; and a setting step that sets, when the abnormality is detected, an operation mode of the deceleration control to a special mode from a normal mode. The normal mode is provided for cases in which the abnormality is undetected. In the vehicle control method, the determination step expands a range for identifying the object around the vehicle as the target candidate of the collision in the special mode as compared with the range in the normal mode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">This yields the same actions and effects as those of the above (1).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">(9) A vehicle control program according to this application example is for causing a computer to execute a process including: a first control step that executes, when an abnormality of a driver of a vehicle is detected, stop control which automatically decelerates and then stops the vehicle; a second control step that executes, when the vehicle is determined to have a risk of collision, deceleration control which automatically decelerates the vehicle; a determination step that identifies an object around the vehicle as a target candidate of the collision and determines whether or not there is the risk of the collision with the identified target candidate; and a setting step that sets, when the abnormality is detected, an operation mode of the deceleration control to a special mode from a normal mode. The normal mode is provided for cases in which the abnormality is undetected. In the process, the determination step expands a range for identifying the object around the vehicle as the target candidate of the collision in the special mode as compared with the range in the normal mode.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">This yields the same actions and effects as those of the above (1).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the present disclosure, when an abnormality of a driver is detected, a risk of collision can be more reliably reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a vehicle to which a vehicle control device according to an embodiment is applied.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of the vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram explaining a first process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram explaining a second process.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating a third process.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process executed by a setting unit.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process executed by a determination unit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart (subprocess flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) illustrating the first process.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart (subprocess flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) illustrating the second process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart (subprocess flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) illustrating the third process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process executed by a second control unit.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process executed by a first control unit.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A vehicle control device, a vehicle control method, and a vehicle control program according to an embodiment will now be described with reference to the drawings.

The identifying condition (condition for the object to be identified as the target candidate) is set looser (easily satisfiable) in the special mode than in the normal mode. This means that the determination unit <b>1</b>C expands a range for identifying the object around the vehicle <b>10</b> as the target candidate in the special mode as compared with the range in the normal mode. That is, the determination unit <b>1</b>C expands the range of the object that will possibly be the target candidate (loosens the limitation of the target candidate) in the special mode as compared with the range in the normal mode.

In the normal mode, another vehicle <b>20</b> is excluded from the target candidate until the detection period T of another vehicle <b>20</b> detected by the front sensor <b>4</b>F becomes the first period T<b>1</b> or longer. Thus, in the normal mode, the presence or absence of the collision risk with respect to another vehicle <b>20</b> is determined after the detection period T has become the first period T<b>1</b> or longer.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, in the special mode, as long as the detection period T of another vehicle <b>20</b> detected by the front sensor <b>4</b>F is the second period T<b>2</b>, which is shorter than the first period T<b>1</b>, or longer, another vehicle <b>20</b> is identified as the target candidate. Thus, in the special mode, the presence or absence of the collision risk with respect to another vehicle <b>20</b> is determined earlier than that in the normal mode.

In contrast, a stationary object (for example, a guardrail or a sound insulating wall) is set to be less preferential for the target candidate. In general, as compared with moving objects, stationary objects have less reliability in the information acquired by a camera or radar. Therefore, in cases where a stationary object is identified as the target candidate, the accuracy of determining the presence or absence of the collision risk may be lower as compared with cases where a moving object is identified as the target candidate.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In view of this, in the normal mode, the determination unit <b>1</b>C regards that even if a stationary object is detected, the reliability of the information on this object is low, and prioritizes a moving object over the stationary object in identifying the target candidate. Therefore, in the normal mode, even if a stationary object is in the shortest distance D from the vehicle <b>10</b> (even if a stationary object locates the closest to the vehicle <b>10</b>), since the stationary object is less prioritized as the target candidate, the determination unit <b>1</b>C identifies the target candidate from moving objects. As such, in the normal mode, the determination unit <b>1</b>C of the present embodiment identifies the target candidate with priority in the reliability of the information over the distance D from the vehicle <b>10</b>.

As such, in the special mode, the determination unit <b>1</b>C of the present embodiment identifies the target candidate with priority in the distance D from the vehicle <b>10</b> over the reliability of the information. Incidentally, the determination unit <b>1</b>C may exclude objects such as those that are too small for the vehicle <b>10</b> to collide with (e.g., dust) or those (ghost objects) that are likely to be erroneously detected by the obtaining device <b>4</b> from the target candidate.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The object of the predetermined type, which is preferentially regarded as the target candidate in the normal mode, is not limited to the moving object described above. The reliability of the information acquired by the obtaining device <b>4</b> can be estimated based on reflection intensity and depth of radio waves when the obtaining device <b>4</b> is a radar and based on, for example, image patterns when the obtaining device <b>4</b> is a camera. Therefore, the reliability of the information may be estimated, and an object with the estimated reliability higher than a predetermined value may preferentially be considered as the object of the predetermined type, which is regarded as the target candidate as described above.

When the determination unit <b>1</b>C determines that there is no collision risk during the deceleration control in the normal mode (when the determination result of the determination unit <b>1</b>C is overturned), the second control unit <b>1</b>E interrupts the deceleration control. On the other hand, during the execution of the deceleration control in the special mode, even if the determination unit <b>1</b>C determines that there is no collision risk (even if the determination result of the determination unit <b>1</b>C is overturned), the second control unit <b>1</b>E continues the deceleration control without interruption.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">Condition 3 is provided for the occupant of the vehicle <b>10</b> to intentionally discontinue the deceleration control. Similar to the identifying condition, the cancelling condition used in Condition 3 varies depending on the operation mode of the deceleration control. Specifically, the cancelling condition is set to be satisfied less easily in the special mode than in the normal mode.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0111">The cancelling condition of the present embodiment is summarized below for each operation mode.<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0112">Normal mode: A predetermined cancel operation has been performed at least once.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0113">Special mode: The predetermined cancel operation has been performed multiple times.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0109" num="0114">The present embodiment illustrates an example in which the cancel operation described above is a depressing operation to the accelerator pedal <b>2</b>.

When Condition 3 is satisfied, the second control unit <b>1</b>E discontinues the deceleration control regardless of whether or not the deceleration control has already been executed. Therefore, if the cancelling condition is satisfied during the alarm and before the start of the deceleration control, the second control unit <b>1</b>E discontinues the deceleration control without executing the deceleration control, and if the cancelling condition is satisfied during the execution of the deceleration control, the second control unit <b>1</b>E discontinues the deceleration control that is being executed.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0116">In contrast to Conditions 1 to 3 described above, Condition 4 is an end (completion) condition of the deceleration control.

Actions and Effects</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0137">According to the control device <b>1</b>, the vehicle control method, and the computer program <b>8</b> described above, following actions and effects can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0138">(1) In the special mode which is set when the abnormality of the driver is detected, the range for identifying the object around the vehicle <b>10</b> as the candidate is expanded as compared with the range in the normal mode provided for cases in which the abnormality of the driver is undetected. This results in a higher probability of determining that there is the collision risk with respect to the target candidate in the special mode, so that the opportunity to execute the deceleration control increases. Therefore, when the abnormality happens to the driver, the deceleration control can be executed more reliably. Accordingly, even if the driver is in a state unable to drive, the vehicle <b>10</b> can be automatically decelerated by the deceleration control, which can reduce the collision risk more reliably.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0139">On the other hand, when the operation mode of the deceleration control is the normal mode, there is a high possibility that the collision can be avoided by the driver's operation, so that by narrowing the target candidate as compared with that in the special mode, it is possible to reduce the opportunity to determine that there is the collision risk. This reduces erroneous activation of the deceleration control (unnecessary execution of the deceleration control) when there is no abnormality of the driver, so that unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0140">(2) As compared with the normal mode, in the special mode, an object with a shorter detection period T is also regarded as the target candidate, so that the target candidate can be identified earlier. As a result, in the special mode, even if the target is detected late, the deceleration control is started at an earlier timing as compared with the timing in the normal mode, which can increase the probability of avoiding the collision of the vehicle <b>10</b> by the deceleration control even in the event of a sudden cut-in by another vehicle <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0141">On the other hand, as compared with the special mode, in the normal mode, an object with a longer detection period T is regarded as the target candidate, so that identifying the target candidate by erroneous detection is suppressed. This enhances the accuracy of determining whether or not there is the collision risk, reducing the erroneous activation of the deceleration control. Therefore, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0142">(3) In the special mode, since the target candidate is identified regardless of the type of the object, the deceleration control can be executed for any types of objects. Accordingly, in the event of the abnormality of the driver, the collision risk can be more reliably reduced for any types of objects.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143">On the other hand, in the normal mode, the object of the predetermined is preferentially regarded as the target candidate (the object of the predetermined type is regarded as the target candidate with priority over other objects), so that the execution of the deceleration control is avoided for the object such as the one detected based on unreliable information or the one with a structure that is less likely to cause damage even in collision, for example. Therefore, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0144">(4) In the special mode, since the target candidate is identified regardless of whether or not the object is detected within the predetermined range, the deceleration control can be executed for the object located in any directions. As a result, in the event of the abnormality of the driver, the collision risk (for example, not only the risk of a front collision, but also a side collision) can be reduced more reliably for the object located in any directions.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0145">On the other hand, in the normal mode, by excluding the object within the predetermined range from the target candidate (by restricting the target candidate to the object outside the predetermined range), the execution of the deceleration control can be avoided for the object beside or behind the vehicle <b>10</b>, for example. Therefore, in a situation where the abnormality of the driver is not detected and there is a high possibility that the driver can avoid the collision by steering the vehicle <b>10</b>, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0146">(5) In the special mode, since the target candidate is identified based on the traveling direction of the vehicle <b>10</b> regardless of the traveling lane of the vehicle <b>10</b>, even if the driver is in a state unable to steer the vehicle <b>10</b>, the deceleration control can be executed for the object in the traveling direction. This can more reliably reduce the collision risk also for the object outside the traveling lane in the event of the abnormality of the driver.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0147">On the other hand, in the normal mode, the object outside the traveling lane of the vehicle <b>10</b> is excluded from the target candidate (the target candidate is limited to the object in the traveling lane), so that, on the roads S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> respectively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the execution of the deceleration control for another vehicle <b>20</b> can be avoided. Therefore, in a situation where the abnormality of the driver is not detected and there is a high possibility that the driver can avoid the collision by steering the vehicle <b>10</b>, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0148">(6) If it is determined that there is no collision risk during the alarm in response to the determination that there is the collision risk and before the start of the deceleration control, the deceleration control is discontinued, so that unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed. However, as described above, in the special mode, since there is a high probability of determining that there is the collision risk as compared with the normal mode, the deceleration control is less likely to be discontinued. Thus, when the abnormality of the driver is detected, even if the driver is in a state unable to drive, the collision risk of the vehicle <b>10</b> can be more reliably reduced.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0149">(7) In the special mode, even if it is determined that there is no collision risk, the ongoing deceleration control is continued, so that the collision risk of the vehicle <b>10</b> can be more reliably reduced. As such, after the vehicle <b>10</b> has started decelerating by the deceleration control in the special mode, because the deceleration control is continued regardless of the presence or absence of the collision risk, the collision risk of the vehicle <b>10</b> can be more reliably reduced even if the driver is in a state unable to drive.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0150">On the other hand, in the normal mode, since the executed deceleration control is interrupted when it is determined that there is no collision risk, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0151">(8) In the normal mode, the deceleration control is discontinued when the cancel operation is performed at least once, whereas in the special mode, the deceleration control is discontinued when the cancel operation is performed multiple times. As such, in the special mode, the deceleration control is less easily discontinued (the cancelling condition for discontinuing the deceleration control is less easily satisfied) than in the normal mode, so that the collision risk of the vehicle <b>10</b> can be more reliably reduced.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0152">In the event of the abnormality of the driver, the driver in convulsions, for example, may unintentionally perform the cancel operation. Regarding this, when the number of the cancel operations for discontinuing the deceleration control is set larger in the special mode than in the normal mode as described above, the deceleration control can be inhibited from being discontinued by an unintended cancel operation in the event of the abnormality of the driver.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0153">On the other hand, in the normal mode, since the deceleration control is discontinued even by a single cancel operation, the deceleration control can be easily discontinued when the driver determines that the deceleration control is unnecessary. As a result, unnecessary deceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b> due to the deceleration control can be further suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">5.
