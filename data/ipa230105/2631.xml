Application of a stimulus, such as radiation from a laser source(s) effects laser-reactive compounds in compositions applied on substrates such that they display colour upon application of the radiation. Typically, to achieve formation of a white image, compounds such as sodium molybdate dihydrate or sodium carbonate are utilised in laser-reactive compositions. Upon application of radiation, the compounds undergo off-gassing, typically releasing carbon dioxide or water, which generate pockets or bubbles within the polymeric carrier vehicle of the composition. This results in a change in refractive index giving the appearance of white colour formation. However, such hydrate and carbonate compounds are highly susceptible to water which can penetrate the pockets or bubbles generated by off-gassing, resulting in loss or degradation of the image over time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of preparing a substrate on which an image can be formed, the method comprising applying a transparent or translucent composition comprising a protein in a non-denatured state to at least a portion of the substrate, wherein the protein can be denatured upon application of radiation to the transparent or translucent composition to thereby form an image on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of forming an image on a substrate comprising a transparent or translucent composition applied thereto, wherein the transparent or translucent composition comprises a protein in a non-denatured state, and the method comprises applying radiation to the transparent or translucent composition to denature the protein and thereby form an image on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a transparent or translucent composition comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a) a protein in a non-denatured state, wherein the protein can be denatured upon application of radiation to the transparent or translucent composition;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">b) an aqueous medium or solvent;

In particular, white or off-white images can be advantageously formed. The composition of the present invention is transparent or translucent upon formulation, and application to a substrate(s). Upon application of radiation to selected areas of the composition on the substrate, a white or off-white image can be formed at these selected areas whilst the areas of the composition to which the radiation has not been applied (background) are unaffected.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0025">Furthermore, the use of proteins is advantageous in comparison to traditional laser-reactive compositions utilising hydrate and carbonate compounds. Such compounds are only soluble in water-based systems, meaning that printing speeds are restricted when the compounds are utilised. In contrast, proteins may be solubilised in alkaline aqueous solutions or solvents such as alcohols, esters and ketones, enabling high-speed printing using commercial printing techniques such as solvent-based gravure and flexographic printing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0026">Furthermore, the compositions of the invention demonstrate improved water and environmental resistance over those of the prior art. The use of the compositions of the invention in conjunction with any protective overcoat layers applied thereon or utilised therewith such as overprint varnishes or laminates, also serves to further improve water and environmental resistance. Still further, as proteins are biodegradable materials, the compositions of the invention are environmentally friendly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0027">It has further been surprisingly and advantageously found that proteins can be utilised in the compositions of the present invention as both the component achieving image formation and the binder of the composition. Manufacture of the compositions is therefore significantly simplified in comparison to that of traditional compositions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0028">It will be appreciated that the proteins of the compositions of the invention act as the image-forming component of the compositions. Advantageously, this means that no pigments or dyes are required to be present in the compositions for colour formation purposes.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0029">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of preparing a substrate on which an image can be formed, the method comprising applying a transparent or translucent composition comprising a protein in a non-denatured state to at least a portion of the substrate, wherein the protein can be denatured upon application of radiation to the transparent or translucent composition to thereby form an image on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0030">By &#x201c;non-denatured state&#x201d; is meant the state of the protein in which it assumes its preferred conformational state. This is the most energetically favourable natural state of the protein. The non-denatured state is typically a folded highly specific three-dimensional structure. The protein is operative and functional in its non-denatured state. In the non-denatured state, the protein has not been subjected to denaturation through application of any stimulus, such as radiation, and may be biologically active. In the non-denatured state, the protein is not visible to the human eye in the composition and the composition comprising the protein in the non-denatured state is transparent or translucent. The protein is stable in the non-denatured state at ambient conditions. It therefore remains in the non-denatured state until the specific application of radiation to the composition and thus, the protein itself. &#x201c;Ambient conditions&#x201d; and like terms as used herein, refers to the normal range of conditions of the surrounding environment to which the composition, and thus the protein, is exposed, i.e. the range of temperatures, pressures and atmospheric conditions to which the composition and thus the protein is exposed during use, storage and otherwise. This includes solar radiation including electromagnetic radiation of X-rays, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation. Typically, ambient conditions include a temperature of from 10 to 35&#xb0; C., a pressure of from 20 to 100 kPa, and the environment is typically an oxygen-containing atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0031">Upon application of radiation to selected areas of the transparent or translucent composition on the substrate, an image is formed through denaturation of the protein in the areas of the composition exposed to the radiation. Upon application of the radiation, the protein undergoes a conformational change. The term &#x201c;conformational change&#x201d; of a protein is well-known to the skilled person to refer to a change in the shape of a protein in response to changes in its environment or other factors; each possible shape is called a conformation. Conformational changes may be brought about by alterations of the interchain crosslinking (i.e. hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions), protein unfolding and precipitation. Factors that may induce such changes include temperature, pH, voltage, light in chromophores, ion concentration or phosphorylation. In the context of the present invention, the conformational change is facilitated by the application of radiation. The conformational change can be considered a transition from the non-denatured state of the protein to the denatured state of the protein in the areas of the composition that have been exposed to the radiation. During this transition, the protein becomes visible to the human eye in the composition. In the denatured state, the protein is visible to the human eye in the composition. The denatured state of the protein is typically white or off-white in colour, such that the image formed on the substrate is white or off-white in colour. It will be appreciated by a skilled person that in the areas of the composition to which the radiation has not been applied, the protein remains in the non-denatured state and the composition in these areas is transparent or translucent. The denaturation and conformational change of the protein is an irreversible process, therefore once the protein is in the denatured state following application of radiation; it will remain in this state without fading or reverting back to a non-denatured state. The protein is visible to the human eye in the composition in the denatured state, facilitating the formation of an image. Without being bound by theory, in the context of the present invention, the inventors consider that upon application of the radiation, a conformational change and agglomeration and crosslinking of polypeptide subunits of protein occurs such that the protein is denatured and becomes visible to the human eye in the composition, typically displaying a white or off-white colour.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0032">As mentioned above, the protein is stable in the non-denatured state at ambient conditions so that it does not undergo a conformational change and is not denatured prior to the specific application of radiation to the composition on the substrate. Suitably, the protein transitions from the non-denatured state to a denatured state, i.e. is denatured, at temperatures of above 40&#xb0; C., preferably above 45&#xb0; C., more preferably above 50&#xb0; C., even more preferably above 55&#xb0; C. and yet more preferably above 60&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0033">In the context of the present invention, the protein is visible to the human eye in the composition once denatured, i.e. in a denatured state. In the context of the present invention, the denatured protein typically displays a white or off-white colour in the areas of the composition to which the radiation has been applied. It will be appreciated by a skilled person that the areas of the composition to which the radiation has not been applied (background) will remain unaffected, and the protein will remain in a non-denatured state in these areas. The term &#x201c;white&#x201d;, &#x201c;white colour&#x201d; or &#x201c;off-white&#x201d; encompasses pure or absolute white, in addition to any shades or tints thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0034">In the context of the present invention, the effective formation of an image is determined by measurement of an opacity value. In the context of the present invention, opacity is a measure of the impenetrability of the composition to light, in this instance, visible light. Opacity is expressed as a percentage from transparent (0%) to opaque (100%). The percentage is a measure of the amount of light that does not pass through the composition, i.e. at 0% opacity, the composition is completely transparent as 0% of the light does not pass through the composition, and at 100% opacity, the composition is completely opaque as 100% of the light does not pass through the composition. In the context of the present invention, opacity values of both the areas of the composition to which radiation has been applied (image) and the areas of the composition to which the radiation has not been applied (background) can be measured in order to demonstrate the effective formation of a discernible human and/or machine-readable image. It will be appreciated by a skilled person that in the context of the present invention, the opacity of the image is greater than the opacity of the background, such that a discernible human and/or machine-readable image is formed. The greater the difference between the opacity values of the image and the background, the more distinct and discernible the image is. It will be further appreciated by a skilled person that the opacity values for the areas of the composition to which the radiation has not been applied are equivalent to those of the transparent or translucent composition applied to the substrate prior to application of radiation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0035">For the present invention, the transparent or translucent composition and the areas of the imaged composition to which the radiation has not been applied may have an opacity of 20% or less, such as from 15% or less, preferably 10% or less, or even 5% or less. Further, in the context of the present invention, the areas of the imaged composition to which the radiation has been applied and an image formed thereon may have an opacity of 40% or more, such as 45% or more, preferably 50% or more, or even 60% or more, such as 70% or more. It will be appreciated that the higher the opacity value of the image, the more distinct and discernible the image formed. A high opacity value thus denotes effective image formation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">In the context of the present invention, opacity measurements are made using the opacity function of a Techkon SpectroDens spectrophotometer according to ASTM standard ASTM D589-97, and the imaged (image) and unimaged (background) areas of the composition on the substrate are each measured relative to black and white standards. First, the opacity function of the Techkon SpectroDens spectrometer is selected, the opacity of a composition on the substrate is then measured relative to a black Leneta chart, the opacity of the composition on the substrate is then measured relative to a white background such as minimum 50 sheets of white paper, and the resulting opacity measurement displayed by the Techkon SpectroDens spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">In the context of the present invention, it will be appreciated that when the transparent or translucent composition is applied to a substrate, the substrate itself, as well as any colour thereof, will typically be visible through the composition in light of its transparent or translucent nature. After formation of the image, this will typically remain the same for the areas of the composition to which the stimulus has not been applied.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">In the context of the present invention, the terms &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; and &#x201c;translucent&#x201d; refer to the composition prior to application of the stimulus, or the areas of the imaged composition to which the stimulus has not been applied. This transparent or translucent composition may be substantially colourless, preferably colourless.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0039">It will be appreciated by a skilled person that the protein is the &#x201c;image-forming compound&#x201d; of the composition. By &#x201c;image-forming compound&#x201d; is meant that following application of the composition to the substrate, the protein will form a discernible image on the substrate upon exposure of the composition, and thus the protein, to the radiation. The discernible image is human and/or machine-readable. In the context of the present invention, the discernible image formed by the protein will typically be white or off-white in colour. By discernible image is meant that the image is distinct and easily discernible from the background of the composition, i.e. the areas of the composition that have not been exposed to the radiation. It will be appreciated that in light of the transparent or translucent nature of the composition, the substrate itself, as well as any colour thereof, will typically by visible through the areas of the composition where an image has not been formed. It is therefore preferable that the colour of the substrate upon which the transparent or translucent composition is applied is selected such that the image formed is distinct and easily differentiable therefrom. For example, if the image is white in colour, the substrate may be any colour in the visible spectrum that contrasts with white, such as red, blue, green, orange, purple, brown and black, including any shade or tint thereof or special effect such as pearlescent or metallic. The greater the contrast, the more distinct the image. It will further be appreciated that in instances in which the substrate itself is transparent or translucent, such as a polymeric film, any further substrate to which the substrate is attached may demonstrate the above properties.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0040">The protein may be any suitable protein. More than one protein may be present in the composition. The protein may be sourced from a range of natural resources, including animal, dairy and plant proteins. Preferably, the protein is selected from an animal or plant protein. More preferably, plant proteins are selected due to their biodegradable and environmentally-friendly nature. Examples of animal proteins include, but are not limited to: collagen (hydrolysed or non-hydrolysed) such as hydrolysed bovine collagen; and gelatine. Examples of dairy proteins include, but are not limited to: egg white; whey; and casein. Examples of plant proteins include, but are not limited to: prolamine proteins, such as gluten, zein, soy, pea and hemp.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">Preferably, the protein is selected from a prolamine protein and collagen such as hydrolysed collagen such as hydrolysed bovine collagen.

Some will be more soluble in higher or lower pHs. However, typically extreme pH values, such as pH 1 or pH 14 will often cause the proteins to undergo a conformational change before the application of the stimulus, which is undesirable.

Suitable means include laser excitation through application of radiation to the composition and thus the protein by a laser source(s). It will be understood by a skilled person that when the composition is applied on a substrate, the radiation may be applied to the composition on the substrate at localised positions to selectively develop the denatured state of the protein at these localised positions in the composition. These localised positions may overlap with each other. It will also be understood by a skilled person that the radiation is applied to the composition for an appropriate amount of time required to facilitate the conformational change of the protein (denaturation) and the transition from the non-denatured state to the denatured state.

It will be appreciated by a skilled person that this may affect the opacity value of the image formed. For example, where a laser source(s) is used to apply the radiation, the fluence (amount of energy delivered per unit area) may affect the opacity value of the image formed.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0100">In the context of the present invention, the fluence is dependent upon the power of the means used to apply the radiation (wattage), and the time for which the radiation is applied to a particular localised position of the composition on the substrate, which may be controlled by the scanning speed of the laser or the speed of the moving stage. These two variables can be altered to change the fluence. Where the fluence is low (e.g. lower power and/or shorter irradiation times), the image formed will have a lower opacity value, and where the fluence is high (e.g. higher power and/or longer irradiation times), the image formed will have a higher opacity value. In the context of the present invention, fluence values may range from 0.01 to 20 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as from 0.1 to 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, and even from 0.5 to 5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>or 1 to 5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0101">As discussed above, the protein suitably undergoes a conformational change, i.e. is denatured and transitions from the non-denatured state to the denatured state, at temperatures of above 40&#xb0; C., preferably above 45&#xb0; C., more preferably above 50&#xb0; C., even more preferably above 55&#xb0; C. and yet more preferably above 60&#xb0; C. It will therefore be appreciated that the radiation provides thermal energy to the protein such that the protein is heated to a temperature of above 40&#xb0; C., preferably above 45&#xb0; C., more preferably above 50&#xb0; C., even more preferably above 55&#xb0; C. and yet more preferably above 60&#xb0; C. Suitably, the protein is heated to a temperature of below 150&#xb0; C., preferably below 140&#xb0; C., more preferably below 130&#xb0; C., yet more preferably below 120&#xb0; C. Suitably, the protein is heated to a temperature of from 40 to 150&#xb0; C., such as from 45 to 140&#xb0; C., or even from 50 to 130&#xb0; C., or 55 to 120&#xb0; C., or 60 to 120&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0102">Preferably, the radiation is applied to the composition at localised positions of the composition in order to form a desired image.

Preferably, for the present invention, the image formed is white in colour. Preferably, the denatured state of the protein is white in colour, such that a white image is formed.
