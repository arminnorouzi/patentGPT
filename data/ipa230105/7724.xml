Alternatively, the terminal <b>11</b> may also be a roadside device, for example, a street light, a signal light, or other roadside devices with a wireless communication function.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base station <b>12</b> may be a network-side device in the wireless communication system.

The duration timers are aligned. Different DRX groups may use different DRX short cycle parameters, such as DRX short cycle (shortDRX-Cycle) and DRX short cycle timer (drx-ShortCycleTimer). Generally, DRX group 1 corresponds to a Frequency Range (FR) 1, and DRX group 2 corresponds to FR2, that is, they are used for low frequency band and high frequency band respectively. According to the frequency ranges of the fifth generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technology defined by the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), FR1 is: 450 MHz-6000 MHz, and FR2 is: 24250 MHz-52600 MHz. Because of the higher speed in the high frequency band, the data of the same amount of data is transmitted faster in FR2. In the related art, there is no provision for separately configuring the DRX short cycle parameter of DRX group 1 and the DRX short cycle parameter of DRX group 2.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this example provides a method for configuring a short cycle, which may be applied to a base station of wireless communication, and the method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>101</b>: for a plurality of DRX groups of the user equipment, a DRX short cycle parameter of a DRX group for a first frequency band and/or a DRX group for a second frequency band is configured; where a frequency of the first frequency band is higher than a frequency of the second frequency band.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The DRX short cycle parameter may include any parameters related to the DRX short cycle of the DRX group, for example, including: a parameter indicating whether to configure the DRX short cycle, a parameter of how to configure the DRX short cycle, and/or an effective range parameter of the DRX short cycle, etc. For example, the DRX short cycle parameter may be used to configure parameters of attributes of the DRX short cycle such as a duration of the DRX short cycle and a duration time of the DRX short cycle. The DRX short cycle parameter may include: a DRX short cycle timer duration and/or a DRX short cycle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The base station may configure the DRX short cycle parameter for the user equipment in the RRC connected state through Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling, and the user equipment obtains the DRX short cycle parameter to determine the configuration of the DRX short cycle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, one DRX cycle may be composed of a duration part of a duration timer (onDurationTimer) and a duration part of a DRX opportunity (Opportunity for DRX). During the duration of the duration timer, the user equipment monitors and receives the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). During the duration of the DRX opportunity, the user equipment no longer monitors the PDCCH to reduce power consumption. The DRX cycle may include: a DRX short cycle (ShortDRX-Cycle) and a DRX long cycle (longDRX-Cycle). Among them, the DRX long cycle is longer than the DRX short cycle. Both the DRX short cycle and the DRX long cycle belong to the DRX cycle configured for the DRX group.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, the DRX short cycle is an optional configuration. When the DRX short cycle is configured for the user equipment, the user equipment may start the DRX short cycle timer (Drx-ShortCycleTimer) when using the DRX short cycle. When the DRX short cycle timer expires, it switches to the DRX long cycle. At this time, the DRX short cycle timer is equivalent to limiting the action time range of the DRX short cycle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The DRX group for the first frequency band may be a DRX group belonging to the frequency band range FR2. The DRX group for the second frequency band may be a DRX group belonging to a Frequency Range (FR) 1. Among them, FR2 is higher than FR1. For example, FR1 may be: 450 MHz-6000 MHz, and FR2 may be: 24250 MHz-52600 MHz.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this way, different DRX short cycle parameters are set for DRX groups of different frequency bands, which improves the flexibility of setting the DRX short cycle parameter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an example, step <b>101</b> includes: configuring a DRX short cycle timer duration of the DRX group for the first frequency band to be less than or equal to a DRX short cycle timer duration of the DRX group for the second frequency band; and/or, configuring a DRX short cycle of the DRX group for the first frequency band to be greater than or equal to a DRX short cycle of the DRX group for the second frequency band.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Because the DRX group for the first frequency band of higher frequency band has a higher data transmission rate than the DRX group for the second frequency band of lower frequency band, the time required to transmit the same data is shorter, and the time required for the DRX group for the first frequency band to monitor the PDCCH is shorter. Therefore, the monitoring duration when the DRX group for the first frequency band is in the DRX short cycle may be configured to be less than or equal to the monitoring duration when the DRX group for the second frequency band is in the DRX short cycle.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For the DRX short cycle timer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the DRX short cycle timer times out, the effective DRX cycle is switched from the DRX short cycle to the DRX long cycle.
