More particularly, the present invention pertains to a process for PEGylation and purification of therapeutic protein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">PEGylation, the chemical linkage of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to a therapeutic protein/peptide, has been widely used as a post-production modification methodology to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of proteins [1]. It has been shown to increase solubility, decrease renal clearance, improve physical and thermal stability, protect against enzymatic degradation, increase circulating half-life, reduce immunogenicity and reduce toxicity [1-4]. Currently, there are more than a dozen PEGylated drugs on the market, and several under clinical development [5].</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) is a hematopoietic cytokine that stimulates the bone marrow to produce granulocytes and stem cells. G-CSF is an essential biopharmaceutical drug in treatment of neonatal infections, granulocyte transfusion in patients with neutropenia after chemotherapy, in severe infection and sepsis, in acute myeloid leukaemia etc. PEGylation of GCSF has been shown to increase its in-vivo half-life and thereby the drug's bioavailability and chemical potency [6]. This PEGylated form of GCSF, &#x201c;PEG-GCSF&#x201d;, is a long acting form that requires only a once-per-cycle administration for the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia leading to a greater likelihood of patient compliance and decreased burden for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals [7].</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Preparation of PEGylated proteins involves two major unit operations PEGylation reaction and chromatographic separation of mono-PEGylated product from un-PEGylated and multi-PEGylated variants. A number of process schemes for PEGylation of proteins and purification of PEGylated proteins have been proposed in the last decade.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/326,277 relates to a process for PEGylation and purification of PEG-GCSF. However, the prior art document reports a long time for completion of PEGylation reaction (12-18 h) and utilizes a conventional bind and elute cation exchange chromatography for purification. However, a faster PEGylation reaction is required along with a displacement mode counter current continuous chromatography.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another U.S. Pat. No. 8,586,710 discloses an improved process for PEGylation of r-met-HuG-CSF, in which the reaction is carried out in the presence of sugar alcohols, for example, sorbitol. The process herein claims the increase in % yield of mono-PEGylation in the presence of 5% sorbitol (82% vs 74% in absence of sorbitol). The % conversion of mono-PEGylated r-met-HuG-CSF is &#x3e;98% wherein the PEGylation reaction is carried out overnight at 2-8&#xb0; C. in the presence of sorbitol. However, the prior art document does not report any improvement in the reaction completion time, and has poor productivity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similarly, numerous non-patent prior art documents disclose methods for PEGylation of GCSF. For instance, Tiwari et al., reports an increase in the yield of mono-PEGylated GCSF upto 80% after 5 hrs of PEGylation reaction at room temperature. [4]. Another research article by Puchkov et al. reported approximately 85% product yield of PEGylated GCSF when the reaction was carried out for 18 h at 4&#xb0; C. [6].</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">All the above prior arts disclose that the % mono-PEG conversion is somewhat similar in the range of 70-80%, while the reaction completion time varies from 5-24 hrs. This indicates that that productivity of the reaction is dependent on the reaction completion time and is the major factor behind low productivity (mg of mono-PEGylated protein produced/unit time) of PEGylation step.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Post PEGylation, cation exchange chromatography has been the most widely utilized chromatography for purification of mono-PEGylated GCSF from impurities like multi-PEGylated and un-PEGylated species. Majority of published reports utilize weak or strong cation exchange chromatography for purification of mono-PEGylated GCSF [<b>4</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>8</b>,<b>9</b>]. Sample displacement chromatography has been applied to the purification of small molecules and proteins.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 9,067,990B2 relates to compositions and methods for isolating and purifying proteins for e.g. antibodies, host cell proteins incorporating a displacement chromatographic step. This mode of chromatography has recently been applied in a multi column continuous chromatography setup for the separation of monoclonal antibody charge variants. However, the prior art utilizes a complex linear gradient for achieving separation. Therefore, a method is required which removes impurities in flowthrough and utilize a simpler step elution protocol.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the major limitations of prior arts cited above is that most of them operate in bind and elute mode, and thus utilize shallow linear gradients along with peak cutting for the separation of different PEG-protein conjugates. This necessitates, in-process quality checks before pooling of fractions which makes the overall purification process lengthy and complex. It also increases the chances of errors and leads to fluctuations in chromatography yield and performance between batches. Thus there is a need to develop improved process which is able to remove all the multi-PEGylated impurities in the loading flow-through, simplifying the overall purification process and results in higher productivity and improved resin utilization.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a highly efficient, robust, economical, scalable, industrially viable and productive process of PEGylation and purification for therapeutic proteins.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another objective of the present invention is to convert the established batch process to an integrated continuous process and further improve the productivity and thereby the economics of the process.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a PEGylation reaction having high yield and shorter time of completion and a displacement mode cation exchange chromatographic separation post PEGylation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still another objective of the invention is to establish a rapid method for N-terminal PEGylation reaction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another objective of the present invention is to integrate the established PEGylation and purification process to any existing manufacturing process to offer an end-to-end integrated assembly from inclusion bodies to purified PEGylated product.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention provides a novel process of PEGylation and purification of protein therapeutics.

This results in an overall decrease in the reaction selectivity. Hence, in order to maximize % mono-PEG conversion, productivity and selectivity reaction must be stopped just before it reaches the maximum mono-PEG concentration [20].

Binding of multi-PEGylated species with the resin was found to weak, leading to removal of the multi-PEGylated species during column loading in flowthrough. Loading the column up to 5% breakthrough (batch loading, dynamic binding capacity, &#x2dc;5 mg/mL of resin) resulted in removal of more than 60% multi-PEGylated impurities in flowthrough. However, in order to achieve complete removal of the pre peak multi-PEGylated species in flowthrough, the column loading (amount of protein, % breakthrough) had to be increased. It was identified, that by loading the column to 100% breakthrough (&#x2dc;7.5 mg/mL of resin), complete removal of acidic multi-PEGylated species could be obtained in flow through. This can be attributed to the fact that on loading the column beyond the 5% breakthrough (dynamic binding capacity) remaining multi-PEGylated species, which are weakly bound to the resin are displaced by tighter binding species like mono-PEG GCSF and un-PEGylated GCSF due to competition for binding sites. Binding strength of the various PEG conjugates onto the column follows the following order-multi-Pegylated species&#x3c;mono-PEGylated&#x3c;un-PEGylated protein. This chromatographic behaviour can be referred to as displacement mode chromatography.

Established purification process for PEG-GCSF consisted of two major unit operations-PEGylation and chromatography. Each of these unit operations was targeted individually and converted to continuous mode with the help of enabler technologies like coiled flow inversion reactor for continuous PEGylation and counter-current chromatography using the BioSMB system for continuous chromatography. The optimized batch protocols for PEGylation and chromatography were adapted for continuous operation with certain modifications. An integrated continuous PEGylation process consisting of CFIR, depth filter, and continuous chromatography was established. Moreover, this established continuous PEGylation process was integrated with a previously established GCSF manufacturing process to obtain an end-to-end continuous PEGylation platform. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the architecture of the developed integrated continuous downstream process for PEG-GCSF.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0083">Purified GCSF obtained from the GCSF manufacturing train was continuously concentrated with the help of two 10 kDa inline concentrator (ILC) units present in series. Output from the ILC units was collected in surge vessel 2, from where it was fed to the CFIR for continuous PEGylation. Optimized conditions for PEGylation obtained from the batch DoE experiments were directly used for continuous operation. All the process feed streams for the continuous process were prepared using the same compositions as those used in batch PEGylation. Initial mixing of the mPEG-ALD, sodium cyanoborohydride, and protein was achieved in an inline dynamic mixer. The dynamic mixer unit consisted of a polypropylene cylinder with magnetic beads inside it. The unit was stirred using a magnetic stirrer. Protein (20 mg/mL) was pumped at a flow rate of 0.33 mL/min, mPEG-ALD stock (100 mg mPEG/mL of buffer) was pumped at 0.33 mL/min and sodium cyanoborohydride (0.35 M) at 0.04 mL/min into the dynamic mixer. The sample from the dynamic mixer was continuously pumped into the CFIR. A residence time of 1 h was provided in the CFIR after which the PEGylation reaction was quenched by inline addition of 1 M Tris at 0.05 mL/min. This was followed by inline dilution of sample with acetic acid (0.1 M acetic acid) at a flow rate of 9.25 mL/min, resulting in a 13&#xd7; dilution of reaction output. After this the sample was continuously filtered using a 250 cm<sup>2 </sup>depth filter (Pall Lifesciences). Output from the depth filter flowed into a 500 mL Schott Duran bottle that served as surge vessel 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

In a four column PCC setup, the unbound protein lost during loading of the first column (in flow-through and the wash step) is captured onto a second column present in series, while the remaining two parallel column undergo non-loading steps. The operation of the developed displacement mode chromatography in continuous multi-column system (PCC mode) provides a promising strategy for complete removal of multi-PEGylated impurities in flow through mode. We would like to highlight that the benefits of displacement mode chromatography in the continuous setup are more significant compared to in batch setup, as in continuous setup increased loading results in complete removal of impurities without any loss of product as the product lost in flow through is captured by the second column in series. This depicts that the application of continuous chromatography in displacement mode results in better purity along with higher resin utilization. This led to an overall simplification of the chromatographic process, resulting in &#x3e;99% pure mono-PEGylated product (SEC-HPLC and IEX-HPLC) and product recovery of &#x3e;95% without any complex peak cutting.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0086">Continuous chromatography was carried out on a continuous chromatography system, utilising 4 column periodic counter-current (PCC) setup, for 20 column operations (5 cycles).
