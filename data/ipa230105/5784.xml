More specifically, some embodiments relate to methods for adjusting one or more support elements to match a non-linear back side surface of a semiconductor wafer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of semiconductor wafer processing, it is common practice to subject the wafer to etching processes which selectively remove portions of material from a multi-layer device. Various types of etching processes and etching apparatus are used in the semiconductor wafer processing art to fabricate microelectronic integrated circuits. In the semiconductor wafer processing art, microelectronic devices are formed by depositing and etching integrated circuit components sequentially. Both wet and dry etching patterning processes are used where portions of a material are selectively removed as part of the process to fabricate features or components of microelectronic devices. In both wet and dry etch processes, it is desirable to selectively remove material uniformly and with precise alignment across the semiconductor wafer surface to maintain critical dimensions (CD) of the patterned structures and to avoid compromising subsequent processes, such as further photolithographic patterning processes. In some instances, microelectronic device structures are formed with CD's unacceptably outside of design specifications, leading to costly rejection of the process wafer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The semiconductor wafer processing may include providing a photoresist film (e.g., resistive film) over a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer (that is initially flat) and subsequently baking (e.g., post-apply bake (PAB)) the substrate and photoresist film. The baking of the resistive film generates a stress on the wafer. This stress may cause a bowing (e.g., positive and/or negative bowing) or warping of the wafer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One conventional solution in the etching process to account for a warped or bowed wafer is to secure the wafer to a hot plate during a baking process (e.g., post-apply bake) using a vacuum applied to the back side of the wafer through the hot plate. The force of the vacuum &#x201c;sucks&#x201d; or &#x201c;pulls&#x201d; the wafer (that includes the resistive film) into contact with the flat top surface of the hot plate such that the wafer is flat. However, this solution causes air flow as the vacuum is applied between the hot plate and wafer. The air flow may result in non-uniformity of temperature across the wafer and cause non-uniform baking/curing of the resistive film, which, in turn, may cause unacceptable CDs resulting from the subsequent etching process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, various technologies, such as three-dimensional (3-D) tiered integrated circuits, use a thicker resistive film coating than other conventional technologies. As such, the bowing or warping of a wafer, for 3-D tiered integrated circuits, may be more severe than bowing or warping of wafers processed using other conventional technologies. Wafers with such a severe bow or warp may not be able to be sufficiently &#x201c;pulled&#x201d; into contact with a hot plate by a vacuum. Additionally, the increased vacuum force to pull a wafer with large bow to a hot plate increases the non-uniform baking/curing of the resistive film.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fabrication of an integrated circuit (IC) often includes a variety of physical and chemical processes performed on a semiconductor (e.g., silicon) substrate, which may be configured as a wafer, or as another bulk substrate, such as a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate or a silicon-on-glass (SOG) substrate. For convenience, all such substrates are referred to herein as &#x201c;wafers.&#x201d; One such process is lithography (e.g., photolithography) which includes, among other things, applying a photoresist film over a substrate, such as a silicon wafer and subsequently baking the photoresist film. The baking of the photoresist film (e.g., post-apply bake, also termed a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; bake, to remove a solvent component of the photoresist and enhance adherence of the photoresist to the active surface) prior to patterning may cause the wafer to deform (e.g., bow or warp). A bowed or warped wafer may result in an inability to maintain critical dimensions (CD) of features during the fabrication of an integrated circuit. In various embodiments, lithography implemented in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure includes transferring thermal energy to (heating/baking) or from (cooling) a wafer. Typically, during the process of heating/cooling, a wafer is placed on a support apparatus, such as a cooling plate or hot plate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various embodiments described herein relate to, adjusting a top or upper surface of a support apparatus (e.g., hot plate or cooling plate) to match a non-linear back side surface of a wafer. In general, a non-linear back side surface of a wafer is at least one portion of the back side surface that is non-linear (or non-planar). Examples of a non-linear surfaces are, but not limited to, a bow and a warp. A bowed surface and/or a warped surface may be concave and/or convex. Additional description and examples of non-linear back side surfaces, such as a bow and a warp are provided in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, an apparatus (e.g., wafer support apparatus) includes a group of mutually lateral adjacent support elements. Each mutually lateral support element is configured to independently move at least vertically and comprising an upper surface. The support apparatus also includes a thermal energy transfer device operably coupled to each of the support elements, and an actuator system operably coupled to each of the mutually lateral support elements to selectively move one or more of the mutually lateral support elements vertically.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As will be described in further detail herein, by adjusting a top surface of a support apparatus to conform to a non-linear back side surface of a wafer (that is placed on the top surface of the support apparatus) a substantially uniform temperature may be applied to the wafer to facilitate uniform solvent removal and adherence to the active surface of the wafer. A uniform temperature applied to a nonlinear wafer surface facilitates in maintaining of critical dimensions (CD) of the patterned structures in the fabrication of ICs.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> depicts apparatus <b>100</b> (e.g., hot plate or cooling plate) for supporting wafer <b>160</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a top view of apparatus <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of apparatus <b>100</b> along plane A (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).

Bottom surface <b>164</b> of wafer <b>160</b> is placed on top surface <b>110</b> of apparatus <b>100</b>. As depicted, wafer <b>160</b> is non-linear (e.g., non-planar). Wafer <b>160</b> may have various types of non-linear back side surface such a bow, a warp or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, a bow measurement is the deviation from a center point of the median surface. As depicted, wafer <b>160</b> has a bow measurement <b>170</b> measured from plane <b>166</b> corresponding to an apex of bottom surface <b>164</b> of wafer <b>160</b> and plane <b>168</b> corresponding to peripheral edges of non-linear wafer <b>160</b>. Bow measurement <b>170</b>, in one embodiment, is in the range of about +/&#x2212;700 &#x3bc;m. In another embodiment, bow measurement <b>170</b> is in the range of about +/&#x2212;1 mm. A bow may be a positive bow (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>C</figref>) or a negative bow (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). Wafer <b>160</b> may include various types of non-linear back side surfaces such as, but not limited, to a warp. In general, a warp measurement is the difference between the maximum and minimum distances of the median surface using the entire median surface rather than just the center point as with bow measurements. In various embodiments, warp measurements are determined by factors such as the wafer diameter, the wafer thickness, gravity, and how the wafer is held. A warped wafer may exhibit curvatures in multiple directions with respect to a major plane of the wafer, and also different curvatures in different directions along the plane of a wafer. For example, a warped wafer may exhibit a shallow twisted configuration, or a rippled configuration. Other types of non-linear back side surface of a wafer can be expected. For example, a non-linear back side surface of a wafer may be a paraboloid, such as a hyperbolic paraboloid.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Due to the non-linear back side surface of wafer <b>160</b>, gap <b>172</b> is formed between top surface <b>110</b> and bottom surface <b>164</b>.
