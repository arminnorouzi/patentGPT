More specifically, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to receiving and processing data stream via a wireless communication network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the rapidly growing trend of mobile and remote data access over high-speed communication networks, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) or fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) cellular services, accurately delivering and deciphering data streams has become increasingly challenging and difficult. Such systems have to compensate for multipath transmissions that may have a large path loss.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 5G NR systems, the importance of beamformers are emphasized, since it is one of the most practical ways to compensate for a large path loss in the ultra-high frequency range. Typically, beam selection for a downlink beamformer is obtained from user equipment (UE) feedback that is received as a channel quality indicator (CQI) for candidate beams transmitted by the NR base station (gNB). Based on the idea that link reciprocity is maintained, the downlink beam selection is regarded as the best one for the uplink beam as well. However, in the presence of one or more interfering signals, link reciprocity may not provide the best beam selection for receiving uplink transmissions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various exemplary embodiments, methods and apparatus are provided for adaptive beam selection to receive uplink transmissions in a wireless communications network. In an embodiment, a cyclic prefix and a tail portion of an OFDM symbol are compared for differences that may occur during transmission. The differences are processed to identify a preset beam pattern to be used to receive uplink transmissions. The embodiments utilize the structure of the OFDM symbol and do not require a signal characteristic normally used for beamformer selection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, a method is provided that includes forming a matrix (A) of cyclic prefix values and a matrix (B) of tail values from an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) symbol, and forming a summation matrix (S) and a difference matrix (D) from the matrix A and the matrix B.

In a wireless environment, spatiotemporal diversity can be adopted for performance enhancements. By applying blind approaches that provide spatiotemporal diversity to OFDM systems, higher bandwidth efficiency can also be achieved. Since wireless applications require channel equalizers with fast channel adaptation and tracking ability, it is more favorable to exploit signal structure without knowledge of the received signal statistics. In various embodiments, a blind spatiotemporal equalization algorithm using cyclic prefix in OFDM systems is provided. Instead of using the statistics of the received signal, the signal structure of the OFDM symbol, i.e., cyclic prefix, is exploited. Using a least squares approach, the spatiotemporal equalizer is applied to received signal samples in one OFDM symbol frame.

The MIMO transceiver <b>102</b> is coupled to a plurality of antennas <b>104</b>. During downlink transmissions, the MIMO transceiver <b>102</b> controls the antennas <b>104</b> to transmit information using one or more transmission beam patterns <b>108</b>. For example, the downlink beam pattern <b>112</b> can be formed to transmit downlink information to user equipment <b>110</b>. The user equipment <b>110</b> responds with channel quality information that indicates the quality of the received downlink transmission. The transceiver uses the channel quality information to adjust or select the appropriate beam pattern that is used for downlink transmissions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, for uplink transmissions, the beam pattern <b>112</b> may not be the best choice. For example, utilizing the beam pattern <b>112</b> may result in the reception of interfering signals from interfering transmission source <b>114</b>. In order to receive uplink transmissions from user equipment <b>110</b> while rejecting interfering signals from source <b>114</b>, the MIMO transceiver <b>102</b> utilizes or selects a different beam pattern (such as beam pattern <b>116</b>) that can receive uplink transmissions from the user equipment <b>110</b> while rejecting or attenuating transmissions from the interfering source <b>114</b>. Therefore, the network <b>100</b> operates with multiple beam patterns for both uplink and downlink operations. Since the optimal uplink beam pattern may be different from the optimal download beam pattern, a method for selecting the best beam pattern to use for uplink transmissions is needed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an exemplary embodiment, the MIMO transceiver <b>102</b> includes the ABS <b>106</b> that selects the optimal beam with which to receive uplink transmissions. The ABS <b>106</b> determines or selects the best beam pattern to be used to receive uplink transmissions based on analysis of received uplink symbols.

The beamformer <b>202</b> applies weights to received signals from the antennas <b>104</b> according to a beam preset weight signal <b>214</b> to form a preset beam pattern that is used to receive uplink transmissions.

In an embodiment, the beam pattern selector <b>208</b> outputs the beam preset weight signal <b>214</b> that causes the beamformer <b>202</b> to implement a preset beam pattern that is selected from the preset beam patterns <b>218</b>. The beam pattern selector <b>208</b> operates to select a preset beam based on a received system selection signal <b>216</b>. For example, an initial beam pattern can be selected using the system selection signal <b>216</b>. The subframe receiver <b>204</b> identifies symbols in the sub-frame and outputs the sub-frame symbols <b>210</b> to other entities at the transceiver <b>102</b>. The sub-frame symbols <b>210</b> are also input to the ABS <b>106</b>. The symbol processor <b>206</b> receives the sub-frame symbols <b>210</b> and processes these symbols in accordance with a beam selection algorithm to determine a preset beam identifier <b>212</b> that is input to the beam pattern selector <b>208</b>. The beam pattern selector <b>208</b> uses the preset beam identifier <b>212</b> to generate the beam preset weight signal <b>214</b> to cause the beamformer <b>202</b> to implement one of the preset beam patterns <b>218</b>. Thus, the uplink beam pattern selection is based on the received symbols.
