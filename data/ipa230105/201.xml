This is as described in the Spanish utility model ES1064879U, which discloses a footwear protector for motorcyclists consisting of a sleeve adaptable to the periphery of the footwear in the front area thereof, between the shank and the toe, specifically in correspondence with the area of incidence of said footwear on the gear lever, acting as a means of physical independence between both elements, that is, footwear and gear lever. The aforementioned sleeve is made of a resistant material, the one intended to come into contact with the gear lever, and a second sector which is elastically deformable that ensures the tight fit and stabilization of the protector on the periphery of the footwear.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The utility model ES1021703U discloses a protector for motorcyclists' footwear, intended to prevent premature wear of the footwear due to rubbing or contact with the gearshift handlebars that a good number of motorbikes have when changing gears, characterized essentially in that it comprises an elastic and flexible band joined at its ends and that it is suitable for adapting to any motorcyclist's footwear. The band has a strip of leather or other highly wear-resistant flexible material on one part of its outer surface which, being attached to the band by stitching or similar, is placed on the upper part of the footwear so that it comes into contact with the aforementioned handle every time the rider uses it to change gear, thus protecting the footwear from any contact between the footwear and the aforementioned handle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The difference of the present invention with respect to the documents cited above is that these devices only protect the footwear with respect to the action on the lever and are not designed as elements that give length to the area of contact with the ground. As it can be seen in the drawings, the element is arranged on the toe of the footwear and the outer side of the footwear, and the over-outsole of the device has indentations which are specifically designed so as not to hinder the gear shifting and braking maneuvers without reducing the safety in ground-support maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Document WO-A-01 35781 describes a footwear item of this type and, more particularly, a motorcycle boot, comprising: a first rigid member defining a body intended to receive the foot of a user and extending in an elongation direction; a second rigid member defining the leg of the boot intended to receive the leg of the user and extending substantially in an elevation direction; a joint connecting the body and the leg of the boot, the said joint allowing the rotation of the leg of the boot with respect to the body in a transverse direction substantially perpendicular to the elongation direction and the elevation direction, in order to allow the bending of the user's foot; stop means comprising a first element attached to the body and a second element attached to the leg of the boot which come into contact with each other to limit the rotation of the leg of the boot relative to the body in the transverse direction within an extreme range of rotation; damping means generating a torque in the transverse direction which opposes the approach of the first and second stop elements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This item is included in the footwear and is not an independent element that is incorporated into the footwear, so the result is very robust footwear, which decreases the comfort to the user. The device of the present invention is fitted to the wearer's footwear allowing to have greater comfort when placing the leg at the time in which the rider wishes to perform the stopping maneuver. Therefore, the device satisfactorily solves the problem that the user has in maneuvers where support with the ground or asphalt is necessary, thus improving the distance in the first contact zone without hindering the support of the foot on the footrest when the motorcyclist resumes their march.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention discloses a device to be used by motorcyclists, cyclists or the like, wherein said device makes it possible to keep the outside of the rider's foot higher by providing the necessary length in motorbike stopping maneuvers and thus achieving a significant improvement in the support and stability of the motorcyclist-motorcycle combination. The present invention is fitted to the wearer's footwear allowing to have greater comfort when placing the leg at the moment in which the rider wishes to perform the stopping maneuver. This is due to the fact that it fundamentally raises the leg with respect to its original position giving greater length when touching the ground, and therefore providing greater stability to the motorcyclist-motorcycle combination. The device of the present invention avoids having to look for points of support in height such as kerns, pavements, bollards, etc., to maintain the stability of the motorbike when stationary.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The device comprises an over-outsole which is arranged on top of the sole of the wearer's footwear and extends between the metatarsal area and the distal phalanges of the foot, wherein the aforementioned over-outsole has indentations on part of its surface and allows the toe of the device to be vertically adjusted with the over-outsole and extends between the said toe and the outer side of the footwear.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to complement the description being made and for the purpose of encouraging a better understanding of the features of the invention, in accordance with a preferred example of the practical embodiment thereof, a set of drawings is attached as an integral part of said description, in which the following has been represented for illustrative and non-limiting purposes:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. shows a view of the upper part of the device (<b>1</b>) of the invention fitted to the footwear of a motorcyclist, where it can be seen that the extension of the device (<b>1</b>) is between the toe (<b>3</b>) and the lateral end (<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. shows a view of the lower part of the device (<b>1</b>) where the over-outsole (<b>2</b>) and the indentations (<b>4</b>) can be seen.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention discloses a device to be used by motorcyclists or the like in motorbike stopping maneuvers, wherein the device is fitted to the wearer's footwear allowing to have greater comfort when placing the leg at the moment in which the rider wishes to perform the stopping maneuver.
