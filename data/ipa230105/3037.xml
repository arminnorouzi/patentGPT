One example of a construction template includes adhering one or more templates onto a surface of a building slab. These templates are rolled onto the flat building slab in a side-by-side orientation, however if there are objects extending vertically from the surface of the building slab then these objects interfere with the placement of the templates. These templates are not suitable for surface conditions that are not flat. Attachment and positioning of the templates onto the building slabs is labor intensive, time consuming, challenging, and therefore expensive. Moreover, the placement of the construction templates is often not accurate which leads to misplacement of construction materials when following the construction templates that are not positioned accurately. Misplaced construction materials will eventually need to be fixed and relocated and/or replaced before the construction job is complete which leads to additional costs to correct the problem. The construction templates are single-use, which also increases the cost, and waste as new templates must be made for additional construction jobs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There remains a significant unmet need for the unique apparatuses, methods, systems, and techniques disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unique apparatuses, methods, and systems are disclosed for a calibration system including a calibration rig and a laser. Beneficially, the calibration system can easily be transported and set up in various field or construction conditions. The calibration system can be used for any layout purpose, even those not construction related such as equipment in a facility, retail kiosks at a store, to name a few. The calibration rig includes calibrated, flexible or rigid components, that are collapsible, and transportable such as in a standard van, automobile, or vehicle. The calibration system specifically calibrates the laser by using fixed, known points on the calibrated, flexible or rigid components that expand or assemble together to form a calibration grid usable at a first site and can later be folded, collapsed, and or rolled, for easy transport to a second site. The calibration system is portable and re-useable so that it can be moved from site to site fluidly and with limited downtime, and can be quickly setup at a new location. The calibration system can be used in diverse locations and conditions such as on a work surface that is not flat. The calibration system can include a spacer for exact spacing of the flexible or rigid components. The calibration system can include one or more calibration or control markers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The calibration rig includes a plurality of reflective calibration locators that are positioned on the calibration grid at the known points that correspond to a calibration file that is accessible by the laser. The laser scans the plurality of reflective calibration locators positioned at the known points to determine actual calibration locations of the calibration locators. The laser reads the actual calibration locations of the calibration locators and compares the actual calibration locations of the calibration locators to predetermined calibration locations of the calibration locators that are found in the calibration file. The predetermined calibration locations are an exact location of the position in which the calibration locators should be placed. The laser scans all of the calibration locators that are positioned on the joint locations to determine a calibration accuracy at each of the calibration locators. Thereafter the laser can be calibrated by using the calibration accuracies of the calibration grid. The calibration accuracies are a comparison between the actual calibration locations and the corresponding predetermined calibration locations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, the work surface may contain obstacles or may be uneven which does not affect the calibration system as it can be installed on the work surface to avoid the obstacles and operate without any issues. The problem of projecting an accurate architectural layout with limited reference points is solved with the disclosed calibration system. The problem of projecting an accurate architectural layout onto a work surface that includes obstacles and/or uneven surface is solved with the present calibration system. The projected architectural layout is projected at full scale or size onto the work surface. It should be appreciated that more than one architectural layout can be projected onto the work surface wherein the additional architectural layouts can represent different layers of materials or elements for installation on the work surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a calibration rig comprising: a plurality of vertical calibration legs;

One technique includes using precisely measured calipers. In particular, the Pythagorean Theorem, A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup>=C<sup>2</sup>, is used to calculate the diagonal, C, that is also measured by the calipers wherein the length of one of the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> is &#x2018;A&#x2019; and the length of the adjacent one of the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> is &#x2018;B&#x2019;. Since the lengths of the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> and the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> are known, then the caliper is set to measure the diagonal, C, to facilitate placement of the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> to the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> to form 90 degree angles between the vertical and horizontal calibration legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. For example, if the A and B lengths of the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> and the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> are 4&#x2032;, then to position the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> at 90 degree angles to the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> or vice versa then diagonal, C, is 5.657&#x2032;. In this example, if the caliper measures C at 5.657&#x2032;, then the adjacent vertical and horizontal calibration legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are positioned at a 90 degree angle relative to each other. Further in this example, if the measured diagonals, C, are not equal to 5.657&#x2032; then one or more of the vertical or horizontal calibration legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are adjusted or rotated relative to the other about the joint locations <b>320</b> until the measured diagonals, C, are equal to 5.657&#x2032;. This method of measuring the diagonals, C, and adjusting or rotating the vertical and horizontal calibration legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> as required to obtain the correct measurement for diagonal C based upon the Pythagorean Theorem is repeated until all of the vertical and horizontal legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are at 90 degrees to each other to form the calibration grid <b>350</b>. In one embodiment, the diagonals, C, of the vertical and horizontal legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are measured in a pattern that starts at an upper right and proceeds to a lower left of the calibration rig <b>304</b> and then the pattern proceeds from an upper left to a lower right of the calibration rig <b>304</b>. If these diagonals, C, are the same, then there are 90 degree angles between the vertical and horizontal legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. Yet another technique to place the horizontal calibration legs <b>312</b> in proper relationship to the vertical calibration legs <b>310</b> includes using the laser <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A representative illustration of the formula of A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup>=C<sup>2 </sup>applied for the calibration rig <b>304</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

The laser <b>302</b> scans the calibration locators <b>396</b> after the locators <b>396</b> are positioned on the calibration grid <b>350</b>. The laser <b>302</b> reads the actual calibration locations of the calibration locators <b>396</b> and compares the actual calibration locations of the calibration locators <b>396</b> to predetermined calibration locations of the calibration locators <b>396</b>.

For example, in a calibration grid <b>350</b> that is 7&#xd7;7 there are 49 of the joint locations <b>320</b> wherein each of the joint locations <b>320</b> has a unique predetermined calibration location and a measured actual calibration location after the calibration locator <b>396</b> is placed on the joint locations <b>320</b>. In this example, the calibration grid <b>350</b> includes the vertical and horizontal legs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> that are positioned at 4&#x2032;-0&#x2033; on centers. For example, the first of the joint locations <b>320</b> has a first predetermined calibration location of x=0.000000, y=0.000000, and z=0.000000. The laser <b>302</b> scans the calibration locator <b>396</b> that is positioned on the first of the joint locations <b>320</b> and determines the first actual calibration location and a first calibration accuracy of the first calibration locator <b>396</b> that is the difference between the first predetermined calibration location and the first actual calibration location.

A third of the joint locations <b>320</b> has a third predetermined calibration location of x=0.000000, y=8.000000, and z=0.000000.
