The first electronic device is connected to a second electronic device through wireless connections, such as a Bluetooth connection; the second electronic device includes a first channel playback apparatus and a second channel playback apparatus. For example, the second electronic device is an earphone, the first channel playback apparatus is a left earphone, and the second channel playback apparatus is a right earphone; or the second electronic device is an audio system, the first channel playback apparatus is a left-channel audio system, and the second channel playback apparatus is a right-channel audio system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart of an audio transmission method according to an embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the audio transmission method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step <b>101</b>: Obtain target audio.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the target audio may be an audio to be played or currently being played in the first electronic device. For example, in a case of receiving a touch operation of a user on a music play button, the first electronic device obtains the target audio; or in a case of receiving a touch operation of a user on a video play button, the first electronic device obtains the target audio.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Step <b>102</b>. Transmit an audio signal of the target audio to the first channel playback apparatus or the second channel playback apparatus through an Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To better describe this solution, in the following implementation of the embodiment of the present application, an earphone is used as the second electronic device, a left earphone of the earphone is used as the first channel playback apparatus, and a right earphone of the earphone is used as the second channel playback apparatus for specific description.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment of the present application, in a case that the first electronic device obtains the target audio, and the first electronic device establishes a wireless connection with an earphone, the first electronic device transmits the audio signal of the target audio to the left earphone or the right earphone of the earphone through the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It can be understood that the electronic device is usually provided with a Bluetooth chip, so as to transmit the audio signal to the earphone based on the Bluetooth transport protocol. However, a transmission bandwidth of Bluetooth is only 3 Mbps, and if an overhead of the transport protocol is also considered, an actual transmission rate of audio is even smaller, which limits the transmission of an audio file of the electronic device. A transmission speed supported by the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol has reached 27 Mbps. In this embodiment of the present application, the first electronic device can transmit the audio signal to the earphone based on the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, so that the first electronic device can transmit the audio with higher quality and higher resolution requirements, to avoid sound quality damage caused by the low transmission rate, and ensure the audio transmission quality and playback effect.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a specific implementation, step <b>102</b> may include:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">calling media access control (MAC) and a physical layer (PHY) in the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol through an alternate medium access control/physical layer (AMP) controller and a protocol adaptation layer (PAL) in a Bluetooth transport protocol, and transmitting the audio signal of the target audio to the first channel playback apparatus and the second channel playback apparatus.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that there is an Alternate Medium Access Control/Physical layer (AMP) controller in the Bluetooth transport protocol. The AMP controller is a secondary controller of a Bluetooth transmission system, and is a primary controller of a Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR), which is used for searching, pairing, connection establishment, and connection maintenance; and when a Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) connection between two BR/EDR Bluetooth devices is established, the AMP controller can detect an AMP controller of another device. When both Bluetooth devices have the AMP controller, the Bluetooth transmission system provides a mechanism for data flow to migrate from the primary controller to the secondary controller. Each AMP controller is provided with a Protocol Adaptation Layer (PAL). In a protocol stack layered architecture diagram, the PAL is above the Medium Access Control (MAC) and the Physical layer (PHY), and the function of the PAL is to map the Bluetooth protocol in the primary controller to the AMP controller.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment of the present application, the first electronic device and the earphone are connected by Bluetooth. The first electronic device can use the AMP and the PAL as secondary transmission link control interfaces to call the MAC and the PHY in the 802.15.4a Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, so as to transmit audio signals without changing the Bluetooth transport protocol. Further, the audio signal of the target audio is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone. In this way, the first electronic device may transmit, on the basis of the already set Bluetooth chip and the existing Bluetooth transport protocol, the audio signal by calling a transmission bandwidth of 27 Mbps in the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, which increases the transmission rate of the audio signal, enables the first electronic device to transmit the audio with higher quality and higher bandwidth, so as to avoid damage to the sound quality of the audio. In addition, the convenience of the first electronic device and the earphone for Bluetooth networking and pairing, as well as the compatibility for the Bluetooth earphone are retained.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, step <b>102</b> may further include:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">transmitting, in a case that a transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio is greater than a preset bandwidth, the audio signal of the target audio to the first channel playback apparatus or the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It can be understood that the first electronic device transmits, on the basis of the already set Bluetooth chip and the existing Bluetooth transport protocol, an audio signal by calling the MAC and the PHY in the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol through the AMP and the PAL. The first electronic device still retains the Bluetooth chip, and thus can still transmit the audio signal through the Bluetooth transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be noted that the bandwidth of the Bluetooth transport protocol is 3 Mbps, while the transmission bandwidth of the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol is 27 Mbps. In this embodiment of the present application, after obtaining the target audio, the first electronic device may determine, based on a data size of the target audio, the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio. In a case that the required transmission bandwidth is greater than the preset bandwidth, the audio signal of the target audio is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the preset bandwidth is 3 Mbps, and when the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio is greater than 3 Mbps, it is no longer suitable to transmit the audio signal through the Bluetooth transport protocol. Then the audio signal may be transmitted through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, so as to ensure that the first electronic device can transmit the high-quality audio. In addition, there is no need to perform compression-transmission-decompression operations on the high-quality audio through Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which avoids damage to the sound quality.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, after step <b>101</b>, the method may further include:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">transmitting, in a case that the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio is less than or equal to the preset bandwidth, the audio signal of the target audio to the first channel playback apparatus or the second channel playback apparatus through the Bluetooth transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can be understood that if the transmission bandwidth of the Bluetooth transport protocol is 3 Mbps, the preset bandwidth may be set to 3 Mbps; when the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio is less than or equal to 3 Mbps, the audio signal of the target audio is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone through the Bluetooth transport protocol; and when the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio is greater than 3 Mbps, the audio signal of the target audio is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. In this way, the first electronic device can select different transmission modes to transmit the audio signal based on the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal. This increases the audio transmission mode of the first electronic device, improves the transmission rate of audio signal, and enables the first electronic device to transmit the audio with higher quality and higher bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, a first Bluetooth chip obtains the target audio (a first music or a second music) through an Audio application layer; and when a transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio (the first music) is less than or equal to the preset bandwidth, the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol (AVDTP) are used to encode the audio signal, and the encoded audio signal is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone of the earphone through a baseband unit and a radio frequency unit. It should be noted that the Bluetooth transport protocol also includes other protocols and control layers to follow, such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), the AMP, the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (L2CAP), the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) control plane, the Link Manager Protocol (LMP), the Bit Torrent (BT) baseband control layer, the Physical layer (PHY), and the like.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the audio signal of the target audio (the second music) is greater than the preset bandwidth, the MAC and the PHY in the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) transport protocol are called through the AMP and the PAL in the Bluetooth transport protocol, and the audio signal of the second music is transmitted to the left earphone or the right earphone. In this way, the audio transmission channel of the first electronic device is expanded, thereby improving the transmission quality of the audio file, avoiding damage to the sound quality of the audio file, and ensuring the sound quality effect of the audio file.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted that, after obtaining the target audio, the first electronic device decodes the target audio into a left-channel audio signal and a right-channel audio signal, and then the left-channel audio signal and the right-channel audio signal are combined and output to the left earphone or the right earphone through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. In other words, what the left earphone or the right earphone receives is the packaged left-channel audio signal and right-channel audio signal; if it is received by the left earphone, the left-channel audio signal is extracted therefrom, and the right-channel audio signal is transmitted to the right earphone, and if it is received by the right earphone, the right-channel audio signal is extracted therefrom, and the left-channel audio signal is transmitted to the left earphone.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, it is assumed that the left earphone receives the packaged left-channel audio signal and right-channel audio signal, and the left earphone extracts the left-channel audio signal therefrom. If the transmission bandwidth required for the right-channel audio signal is less than the preset bandwidth (for example, 3 Mbps), the left earphone may transmit the right-channel audio signal to the right earphone through the Bluetooth transport protocol; and if the transmission bandwidth required for the right-channel audio signal is greater than the preset bandwidth, the left earphone may transmit the right-channel audio signal to the right earphone through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. In other words, the earphone can also select an appropriate transmission mode to transmit the audio signal based on the transmission bandwidth required for the audio signal. The foregoing solution is also applicable to the second electronic device such as an audio system. Details are not repeated herein again.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">An embodiment of the present application further provides another audio transmission method, and the audio transmission method is applied to the second electronic device. The second electronic device includes a first channel playback apparatus and a second channel playback apparatus. For example, the second electronic device is an earphone, the first channel playback apparatus is a left earphone, and the second channel playback apparatus is a right earphone; or the second electronic device is an audio system, the first channel playback apparatus is a left-channel audio system, and the second channel playback apparatus is a right-channel audio system. The second electronic device is connected to the first electronic device through wireless connections, such as a Bluetooth connection, and the first electronic device may be a device such as a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a computer, a wearable device, or the like that can transmit audio to the second electronic device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an audio transmission method according to an embodiment of the present application.

Transmit a first channel audio signal in the audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first channel playback apparatus is a left-channel playback apparatus, the second channel playback apparatus is a right-channel playback apparatus, and the first channel audio signal is a right-channel audio signal; or the first channel playback apparatus is a right-channel playback apparatus, the second channel playback apparatus is a left-channel playback apparatus, and the first channel audio signal is a left-channel audio signal.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this step, the first channel playback apparatus calls media access control (MAC) and a physical layer (PHY) in the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol through an alternate medium access control/physical layer (AMP) controller and a protocol adaptation layer (PAL) in the Bluetooth transport protocol, and transmits the first channel audio signal in the audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">To better describe this solution, in the following implementation of this embodiment of the present application, an earphone is used as the second electronic device, a left earphone (namely, the left-channel playback apparatus) of the earphone is used as the first channel playback apparatus, and a right earphone (namely, the right-channel playback apparatus) of the earphone is used as the second channel playback apparatus for specific description.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment of the present application, the earphone is provided with a Bluetooth chip. For example, the Bluetooth chip is disposed in the left earphone, and the left earphone can transmit the right-channel audio signal to the right earphone based on the Bluetooth transport protocol. There is an Alternate Medium Access Control/Physical layer (AMP) controller in the Bluetooth transport protocol. Each AMP controller is provided with a Protocol Adaptation Layer (PAL). In a protocol stack layered architecture diagram, the PAL is above the Medium Access Control (MAC) and the Physical layer (PHY), and the function of the PAL is to map the Bluetooth protocol in the primary controller to the AMP controller.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this embodiment of the present application, after receiving the audio signal sent by the first electronic device, the left earphone can use the AMP and the PAL as secondary transmission link control interfaces to call the MAC and the PHY in the 802.15.4a Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, so as to transmit audio signals without changing the Bluetooth transport protocol. Further, the right-channel audio signal in the audio signal is transmitted to the right earphone. In this way, the earphone may transmit, on the basis of the already set Bluetooth chip and the existing Bluetooth transport protocol, the audio signal by calling a transmission bandwidth of 27 Mbps in the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, which increases the transmission rate of the audio signal, enables the earphone to transmit the audio with higher quality and higher bandwidth, so as to avoid damage to the sound quality of the audio. In addition, convenience of the earphone and the first electronic device for Bluetooth networking and pairing is retained.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, step <b>202</b> may further include:</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">transmitting, in a case that the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the first channel audio signal is greater than the preset bandwidth, the first channel audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, the preset bandwidth is 3 Mbps, and when the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the first channel audio signal (for example, the left-channel audio signal) is greater than 3 Mbps, it is no longer suitable to transmit the audio signal through the Bluetooth transport protocol. Then the audio signal may be transmitted through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol, so as to ensure that the earphone can transmit the high-quality audio, which avoids sound quality damage and ensures the listening experience of the user.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, in a case that the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the first channel audio signal is less than or equal to the preset bandwidth, the first channel audio signal is transmitted to the second channel playback apparatus through the Bluetooth transport protocol. It can be understood that if the transmission bandwidth of the Bluetooth transport protocol is 3 Mbps, the preset bandwidth may be set to 3 Mbps; and when the transmission bandwidth required for transmitting the first channel audio signal is less than or equal to 3 Mbps, the first channel playback apparatus transmits the first channel audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Bluetooth transport protocol. In this way, the second electronic device can select different transmission modes for transmission based on the bandwidth required for transmitting the first channel audio signal. This increases the transmission modes for the second electronic device to transmit the audio signal, and ensures that the second electronic device can transmit the audio with higher quality and higher bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As an optional implementation, the audio signal includes an indication signal, and the indication signal is used to instruct to transmit the first channel audio signal in the audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other words, the audio signal transmitted from the first electronic device to the second electronic device includes the indication signal, and the first channel playback apparatus transmits, based on the indication signal, the first channel audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. In this way, the transmission mode of the audio signal between the first channel playback apparatus and the second channel playback apparatus is specified by the first electronic device, and the first channel playback apparatus does not need to determine the transmission bandwidth required for the first channel audio signal. No matter how great the transmission bandwidth required for the first channel audio signal is, it is transmitted based on the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. Therefore, the sound quality of the first channel audio signal is prevented from being damaged, and the transmission rate between the first channel playback apparatus and the second channel playback apparatus is improved.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to the technical solution provided in the embodiments of the present application, the second electronic device receives, through the first channel playback apparatus, the audio signal transmitted by the first electronic device, and transmits the first channel audio signal in the audio signal to the second channel playback apparatus through the Ultra Wide Band transport protocol. This increases the transmission rate of the audio signal, so that the second electronic device can transmit the audio with higher quality and higher bandwidth, avoids audio quality damage of the audio, and ensures efficient transmission of the high-quality audio.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structural diagram of an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present application.
