present disclosure relates to a seat rail locking device for a vehicle, and more specifically, to a seat rail locking device for a vehicle, which newly improves a conventional seat rail locking method of moving a lock pin in a directly downward direction to pass through a floor panel to a method of locking a seat rail by moving the lock pin in an upward direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">(b) Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known, seats for a vehicle are basically configured to include a seat cushion on which a passenger's lower body is seated, a seatback on which the passenger's upper body leans, and a headrest for supporting the passenger's neck and head.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The seats for a vehicle are mounted on a floor panel inside the vehicle by a seat rail including a fixed rail and a movable rail so that the front and rear locations may be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To this end, the fixed rail (lower rail) in a configuration of the seat rail is fixedly mounted on the floor panel via a mounting bracket and a bolt, and the movable rail (upper rail) assembled with the seat cushion is fastened to the fixed rail to be movable in forward and backward directions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, a seat rail locking device for locking and unlocking the movable rail is mounted across the fixed rail and the movable rail.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, a conventional manual type seat rail locking device will be described as follows.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show the conventional manual type seat rail locking device, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional diagram showing a locking state of the seat rail, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional diagram showing an unlocking state of the seat rail.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a seat rail <b>10</b> is configured to include a fixed rail <b>12</b> fixedly mounted on a floor panel <b>30</b>, and a movable rail <b>14</b> fastened to the fixed rail <b>12</b> to be movable in forward and backward directions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, a seat rail locking device for locking and unlocking the movable rail is installed across the fixed rail <b>12</b> and the movable rail <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The seat rail locking device is configured to include a support plate <b>21</b> having a top connected to a seat cushion frame (not shown), and a bottom coupled to the movable rail <b>14</b>; a lock pin <b>22</b> inserted into the support plate <b>21</b> and the movable rail <b>14</b> to be movable in upward and downward directions; a spring <b>23</b> inserted between a bottom surface of the support plate <b>21</b> and a circumferential part <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> of the lock pin <b>22</b> to be compressible; and a track lever <b>24</b>, one end of which is formed with a folding part <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> for unlocking located at a bottom of the circumferential part <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> of the lock pin <b>22</b>, the other end of which is formed with a handle part <b>24</b>-<b>2</b> foldable by a user, and an intermediate portion of which is fastened to the support plate <b>21</b> by a hinge <b>24</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">At this time, the fixed rail <b>12</b> is formed with a locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> into which a lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> is lockably inserted.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, a stopper plate <b>25</b> provided in a structure in which the lock pin <b>22</b> passes through to be movable in upward and downward directions to limit a descending distance of the lock pin <b>22</b> is further disposed between the fixed rail <b>12</b> and the movable rail <b>14</b>, and a circumferential portion of the lock pin <b>22</b> is further formed with a stopper part <b>22</b>-<b>2</b> caught to the stopper plate <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A structure of the conventional manual rail lock system has a structure in which at least one lock pin is locked using a plurality of lock pins for customer safety.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, when the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> is locked to and inserted into the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b> passing through the stopper plate <b>24</b> as the lock pin <b>22</b> is pushed in a downward direction by an elastic restoring force of the spring <b>23</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lock pin <b>22</b> is in a state of being restricted in forward and backward directions, and an upper end of the lock pin <b>22</b> is in a state of passing through and being inserted into the support plate <b>21</b> and the movable rail <b>14</b>, and as a result, the movable

the handle part <b>24</b>-<b>2</b> of the track lever <b>24</b> in an unlocking direction, the track lever <b>24</b> is rotated in the unlocking direction around the hinge <b>24</b>-<b>3</b> and at the same time, the folding part <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> for unlocking of the track lever <b>24</b> pushes the bottom of the circumferential part <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> of the lock pin <b>22</b> in an upward direction, so that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the lock pin <b>22</b> moves in the upward direction and at the same time, the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> escapes from the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>, and as a result, the movable rail <b>14</b> is in an unlocking state of being movable along the fixed rail <b>12</b> in forward and backward directions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">At this time, when the user releases the handle part <b>24</b>-<b>2</b> of the track lever <b>24</b>, the lock pin <b>22</b> is pushed in a downward direction again by the elastic restoring force of the spring <b>23</b> and at the same time, the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> moves in a directly downward direction and is locked to and inserted into the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>, so that the movable rail <b>14</b> is in a locking state of not being movable along the fixed rail <b>12</b> in the forward and backward directions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For reference, one lock pin <b>22</b> is shown in the cross-sectional diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, but a plurality of lock pins <b>22</b> are really arranged in the forward and backward directions, and the movable rail may be locked even when only one of the plurality of lock pins <b>22</b> is inserted into and fastened to the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since the above-described conventional manual type seat rail locking device has the structure in which the lock pin <b>22</b> moves in the directly downward direction so that the lower end thereof is inserted into and fastened to the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> may come into contact with the floor panel <b>30</b> on which the fixed rail <b>12</b> is mounted through the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> may be pressed by dispersion of the floor panel <b>30</b> and the like, thereby not properly locking the lock pin <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, as the release of electric vehicles is generalized, a bottom space of the floor panel <b>30</b> and the like may be used as a battery mounting space, and the lower end of the lock pin <b>22</b> is pressed by coming into contact with the floor panel <b>30</b> through the locking hole <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> of the fixed rail <b>12</b>, which may serve as an interference factor while a battery is packaged on the floor panel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, there is a need for the method of moving and locking the lock pin in an upward direction to not only reduce the number of parts and improve an assembling property, but also prevent the interference with the floor panel by moving away from the method of moving and locking the lock pin in the directly downward direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the disclosure and accordingly it may include information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0025"
