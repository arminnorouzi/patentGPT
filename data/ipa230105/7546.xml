mechanisms to report the UE capability for simultaneous connectivity based handover, or so-called Dual Active Protocol Stack Handover (DAPS-HO). A UE reports the DAPS-HO capability of the UE to the network and then the base station initiates physical layer procedures to carry out DAPS-HO in accordance with the DAPS-HO capability reported by the UE. Aspects of the present disclosure also provide examples of signaling that may be used by the UE for reporting DAPS-HO capability to the network and the physical layer procedures that the UE may follow in accordance with the configuration that the network provides to the UE, which should be in accordance with the UE's capability.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="135.38mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="163.83mm" wi="159.26mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="229.45mm" wi="143.68mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="91.95mm" wi="57.07mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="232.33mm" wi="143.00mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="140.21mm" wi="84.24mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="229.28mm" wi="147.57mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="120.23mm" wi="133.94mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="211.84mm" wi="156.89mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="232.83mm" wi="57.40mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="125.98mm" wi="160.95mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="224.87mm" wi="130.98mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="122.68mm" wi="144.53mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="224.45mm" wi="97.62mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="101.52mm" wi="161.71mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="171.37mm" wi="165.61mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="171.37mm" wi="165.61mm" file="US20230007547A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

A wireless communication from a UE to a base station is referred to as an uplink (UL) communication. A wireless communication from a base station to a UE is referred to as a downlink (DL) communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Resources are required to perform uplink, downlink and sidelink communications. For example, a base station may wirelessly transmit data, such as a transport block (TB), to a UE in a downlink transmission at a particular frequency and over a particular duration of time. The frequency and time duration used are examples of resources.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A base station has a specific coverage area. Base stations are positioned so that their coverage areas overlap, to provide coverage to a larger area. When a UE travels from one location that is served by a first base station to a second location that is served by a second base station, it is necessary for the UE to be handed over from the first base station to the second base station. In conventional 3G and 4G networks, during a handover the UE can experience mobility interruption. When operating in these conventional networks, the UE releases a link with source base station and then establishes a new link with target base station.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These conventional networks support &#x201c;Make-Before-Break&#x201d; handover, which involves generating a link with a target cell before dropping the source cell. However, in such a scenario a mobile broadband handover (MBB-HO) solution is left to UE implementation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next-generation wireless networks, such as 5G New Radio (NR), are expected to support a UE simultaneously receiving transmissions from source and target cells during a handover. That means that for the duration of the handover, the UE is connected to both the source base station and the target base station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, next-generation networks are expected to support separate UE capability for Dual Active Protocol Stack Handover (DAPS-HO), with separate UE capability for NR Dual Connectivity/Carrier Aggregation (NR-DC/CA) and a dual active protocol stack (DAPS) based HO interruption reduction solution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, improved mechanisms for DAPS-HO would be beneficial for communication systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method including a UE selecting DAPS-HO UE capability information the UE is to provide to the network, the capability information indicating functionality supported by the UE during a handover from a source cell to a target cell;

The source cell <b>904</b> and the target cell <b>907</b> are part of a network that the UE <b>910</b> is communicating over.

All of the shown parameters or a subset of the parameters may be indicated by a UE that supports intra-frequency DAPS-HO at a given time. Intra-frequency DAPS-HO refers to a handover where the target cell was identified by the UE using so-called intra-frequency measurements, which are defined as measurements where the SS/PBCH blocks of the source and target cells are occupying the same center frequency and use the same subcarrier spacing. Correspondingly, inter-frequency DAPS-HO refers to a handover where the target cell was identified by the UE using so-called inter-frequency measurements. Inter-frequency measurements are measurements that are not intra-frequency measurements. It is also assumed that intra-frequency DAPS-HO operation is carried out when the source and target cells are both located on the same frequency band. There may be other parameters not listed in the example that may also be included, if appropriate.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The simultaneousRxPDCCH parameter indicates whether receiving PDCCH from the source and target base stations simultaneously during the handover is supported by the UE.

The simultaneousTxPUCCH parameter indicates whether transmitting PUCCH to the source and target base stations simultaneously during the handover is supported by the UE. The simultaneousTxPUSCH parameter indicates whether transmitting PUSCH to the source and target base stations simultaneously during the handover is supported by the UE. The maxNumCandidateTargetCells parameter indicates a number of candidate target cells that the UE could be involved with as part of the DAPS-HO when determining the final target cell.

In a particular example, if the PUCCH for the source cell and the target cell overlap on some resources, the UE may drop the PUCCH with a smaller UCI payload or the UCI of a first PUCCH is sent on a next PUCCH transmission occasion.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0249">If the network configures the UE with parameters that result in the UE exceeding its capability in some way (e.g. PDCCH candidate monitoring, PUCCH transmission, UL power control), the UE can drop the processing of tasks that exceed the capability that the UE previously reported to the network.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0250">For example, if the UE reports a capability of performing N PDCCH blind detections per transmission resource, wherein N is an integer, such as a slot, per serving cell and the network configures a serving cell (e.g. source or target) with CORESETs and Search Space sets in a manner such that the UE would need to perform N&#x2032;&#x3e;N PDCCH blind detections per slot to look for a PDCCH message, the UE is not expected to perform more than N PDCCH blind detections on the corresponding cell.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0251">In another example, if the UE reports a capability of dynamic or semi-static uplink power control and the network configures maximum transmit powers that exceed the total transmit power that the UE is capable of transmitting, the UE is not expected to transmit at a power higher than its maximum transmit power.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0252">In some embodiments, the UE can report a capability allowing the network to configure the UE to perform a mobility procedure that reduces and may eliminate service interruption. This occurs because the network can configure the UE with two serving cells in order for the UE to receive transmissions simultaneously from both source and target cells.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0253">Furthermore, the network can configure the UE with two serving cells in order to transmit transmissions simultaneously to source and target cells or to transmit in an orthogonal manner (e.g. in the time domain, frequency domain, code domain, spatial domain, etc.) to source and target cells.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0254">Based on the content of the UE capability report, the network can configure the UE in a way that allows it to perform a handover by reducing or possibly eliminating service interruption.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0255">In a situation where the UE is at an edge of a serving cell adjacent a target cell, the network can instruct the UE to monitor for PDCCH candidates from both source and target cells while the handover is being performed.

In this illustrated figure, the UE monitors both the source and target cell only for a maximum of a finite duration of the timer. Once the timer expires, the UE then monitors only the target cell. In the particular example, for a duration of time <b>810</b> before the handover occurs the UE monitors PDCCH from only the source cell.

The source cell <b>904</b> and the target cell <b>907</b> are part of a network that the UE <b>910</b> is communicating over. Processing being performed by the network, such as generating a DAPS-HO command based on the UE capability information provided by the UE <b>910</b>, may be localized near one of the target cell <b>907</b> or the source cell <b>904</b> or somewhere else in the network. At some point prior to the possibility of a handover from the source cell <b>904</b> to the target cell <b>907</b>, the UE <b>910</b> sends <b>920</b> a higher layer signaling message that includes UE-NR-Capability information.

The higher-layer signaling may be RRC signaling. At some point in time after the source cell <b>904</b> receives the UE capability information, the network generates a DAPS-HO command and the source cell <b>904</b> sends <b>930</b> the DAPS-HO command to the UE <b>910</b>.

A given primary cell of a given MCG is either the source or target cell.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0260">In some embodiments, for UEs not capable of simultaneous transmission, for intra-frequency DAPS-HO, the UE sends separate PUCCH transmissions to source and target cells in accordance with the agreements in the multi-TRP framework. For other cases of DAPS-HO, the UE sends PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK according to existing Rel. 15 specification. For UEs capable of simultaneous transmission, PUCCH transmissions to source and target cells carrying HARQ-ACK are sent in the same slot.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0261">In some embodiments, if the source and target cells are both in the same frequency range and are using the same DL and UL BWPs, the UE may determine downlink pathloss estimates separately for each cell based on reference signals (RSs) by those cells, but UL Power Control may eventually be performed in a joint manner using semi-static power sharing. For DAPS-HO, power sharing is assumed for Uplink Power Control for PUCCH for UEs indicating DAPS-HO with simultaneous transmission capability. A power sharing mechanism supported in Rel-16 NR-New Radio Dual Connectivity (NR DC) with frequency range 1 (FR1)+FR1 band combinations applies to the power sharing for DAPS-HO.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">In some embodiments, simultaneous connectivity is dependent on the level of granularity, e.g. slot-based. If TDM patterns are defined on a granularity smaller than slots, it is still possible to configure UEs to receive PDCCHs and transmit PUCCHs in a manner that appears simultaneous in FR2. For FR2 UEs, support TDM-based reception of PDCCH/PDSCH from source and target gNBs for DAPS-HO. For FR2 UEs, support TDM-based transmission of PUCCH/PUSCH to source and target gNBs for DAPS-HO.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">In some embodiments, while DAPS-HO is taking place, UEs are expected not to be in discontinuous reception (DRX) operation mode or to be configured with the same DRX periodicity during DAPS-HO operation. For each band or band combination that the UE reports DAPS-HO support on, the UE can further indicate which features it supports for DAPS-HO, features such as simultaneous reception, simultaneous transmission, and so on. DAPS-HO capability is reported per band and/or per band combination</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">In some embodiments, for each supported band or band combination, the UE reports a set of supported features, e.g. simultaneous PDCCH reception, PDSCH with full/partial/no overlap, multiple Timing Advance, dynamic or semi-static UL power control, etc.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">It should be appreciated that one or more steps of the embodiment methods provided herein may be performed by corresponding units or modules.
