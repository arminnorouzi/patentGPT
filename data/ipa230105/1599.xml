Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a cutting mat, and more particularly to an innovative folding cutting mat form with a reinforced structure which is better for repetitive folding action.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traditional cutting mat product type is well known by relevant users, which is generally a plate body made of cutting resistant material. In order to enlarge the cutting area and give attention to the portability of cutting mat, related suppliers have put a folding cutting mat on the market. The folding structure thereof is made by attaching a flexible soft sheet between the abutting sides of two cutting plates, thus, the two cutting plates can fold using the soft sheet as a flexible part.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, said folding cutting mat structure type still has some problems in practical application. For example, as the soft sheet must adhere between two cutting plates, the costs of material and process will increase a lot, and the soft sheet corners are likely to peel off or warp during operation, leading to poor durability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, if related circles try to develop the folding cutting mat into a multi-directionally extensible type with other added values and functions, said structure type which achieves the folding function by attaching a soft sheet is inapplicable as the aesthetic property and cutting area are likely to be influenced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, for said problems in the known cutting mat structure, how to develop an innovative structure with more ideal practicability is anxiously expected by users, as well as the goal and direction of research and development of related suppliers.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a reinforced folding cutting mat. The technical problem to be solved is to break through how to develop a novel cutting mat structure type with more ideal practicability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on said objective, the present invention provides a folding cutting mat, including a mat, which is a plate body thicker than 0.5 mm. The mat is formed with at least a cutting face. The cutting face is made of cutting resistant plastic material, and the mat has a rectangular contour. At least a fold tangent is formed in at least one part of mat, so that the mat can be bent using the fold tangent as fold line, and one fold tangent includes a plurality of deep cutting edges and a plurality of reinforcing ribs with different cutting depths. The reinforcing ribs are adjacent to the deep cutting edges.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the innovative structure type and technical characteristic, in comparison to prior art, the present invention provides the folding cutting mat product with a one-piece cutting formed, structure reinforced and more durable fold tangent type through the morphological feature formed by the deep cutting edges and reinforcing ribs with difference cutting depths, and the material and manufacturing costs are reduced a lot, resulting in practical progressiveness and better industrial and economic benefit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another objective of the present invention is another technical characteristic when there is a plurality of fold tangents, the fold tangents adjacent to each other are formed on different surfaces of mat, so that the mat can be operated in Z-shaped folded state to achieve convenient folding and extension, as well as the advantage and practical progressiveness in stack storage and transportation of the end products or semi-finished products of folding cutting mat.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a stereogram of the preferred embodiment of the folding cutting mat of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of the preferred embodiment of the folding cutting mat of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a close-up front view of the preferred embodiment of the folding cutting mat of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of Mark <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a three-dimensional diagram of Mark <b>4</b> region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of cutting forming of fold tangent of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an Embodiment 1 of the folding cutting mat of the present invention bent into a curtain.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an Embodiment 2 of the folding cutting mat of the present invention bent into a curtain.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a sectional view of local structure of composite embodiment of the mat.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the mat in a Z-shaped folded state.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows another embodiment of the reinforcing rib configuration of fold tangent of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an embodiment of bifacially folding configuration of the mat.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> show the preferred embodiments of the reinforced folding cutting mat of the present invention, but the embodiments are for illustration only, the patent application is not limited to this structure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The folding cutting mat comprises a mat <b>10</b>, which is a plate body thicker than 0.5 mm. The mat <b>10</b> is formed with at least a cutting face <b>11</b> (note: both sides of the mat <b>10</b> in this case are cutting faces). The cutting face <b>11</b> is made of cutting resistant plastic material (e.g. soft PVC, TPR, etc.), and the mat <b>10</b> has a rectangular contour (note: including the shapes with bevels or fillets at corners of rectangle). At least a fold tangent <b>20</b> is formed in at least one part of the mat <b>10</b>, so that the mat <b>10</b> can be bent using the at least one fold tangent <b>20</b> as fold line. Wherein one fold tangent <b>20</b> includes a plurality of deep cutting edges <b>21</b> and a plurality of reinforcing ribs <b>22</b> with different cutting depths. The reinforcing ribs <b>22</b> and the deep cutting edges <b>21</b> are adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the above description, said fold tangent <b>20</b> is a groove formed by cutting one side towards the other side of the mat <b>10</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). This part is distinct from the intermittently punched pre-fold line (or pre-broken line) form of the known thin-shell objects, and the readers shall be acquainted with this difference.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in this case, the mat <b>10</b> is a single-layer structure composed of one material. (e.g. the overall structure of the mat <b>10</b> composed of such single materials as soft PVC, TPR, etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Based on said structural composition and technical characteristic, the folding cutting mat disclosed in the present invention in practical application is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the fold tangent <b>20</b> can be rapidly formed by cutting die <b>30</b>, so as to form deep cutting edges <b>21</b> and reinforcing ribs <b>22</b> with different cutting depths, thus it can be seen that in comparison to the known technology, the present invention can increase the process efficiency greatly and reduce the cost significantly. With the distribution number and form planning of said fold tangent <b>20</b>, the folding cutting mat of the present invention can be bent into a <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.12mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230001600A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>-shaped curtain form as required (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), or bent into a T-shaped curtain form (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), or bent into other feasible curtain forms, so as to exercise the other practical added values of the folding cutting mat product, such as epidemic prevention curtain in large demand at present, so as to meet the consumers' multiple requirements, and the operation and storage of the folding cutting mat are quite simple and saving space. Moreover, the fold tangent <b>20</b> of the present invention forms a particular morphological feature of shallower reinforcing rib <b>22</b> at the abutting joint of deep cutting edge <b>21</b>, so as to form reinforcing connecting rib structures spaced apart in the groove type fold tangent <b>20</b>, when the groove section of fold tangent <b>20</b> is open as the mat <b>10</b> is bent, said reinforcing rib <b>22</b> is stretched to reinforce connection, so as to effectively prevent the fold tangents <b>20</b> of mat <b>10</b> from breaking due to repeated folding, the durability is enhanced, and the service life of folding cutting mat product is prolonged greatly. When the groove section of fold tangent <b>20</b> is restored to the original state, the reinforcing rib <b>22</b> is restored to the original state as the plastic material of mat <b>10</b> is elastic.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in this case, the mat <b>10</b>B is a composite layer structure type composed of a plurality of dissimilar materials, including two first material layers <b>101</b> for forming two cutting faces <b>11</b> (e.g. soft PVC and TPR), and a second material layer <b>102</b> sandwiched in between the two first material layers <b>101</b> (e.g. PP), wherein the hardness of the second material layer <b>102</b> is higher than the hardness of the first material layer <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in this case, the cutting depth of the reinforcing ribs <b>22</b> is 1/10 to &#xbd; of the thickness of the second material layer <b>102</b> (see H<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), this is the preferred cutting depth range.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in this case, when there is a plurality of fold tangents <b>20</b>, the fold tangents <b>20</b> adjacent to each other are formed on different surfaces of the mat <b>10</b>, so that the mat <b>10</b> can be operated in Z-shaped folded state. The benefit of this embodiment is that the production circle can fold and stack a coil of very long material in Z shape through stamping and cutting forming operation of mat <b>10</b> contour and fold tangent <b>20</b>, when the material is sent to the end product assembling and packing unit, the predetermined fold tangent <b>20</b> is cut off to form the final folding cutting mat product type, so as to implement more convenient stack storage and transportation of the end products or semi-finished products of folding cutting mat, reduce the cost and storage space.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the fold tangent <b>20</b> disclosed in this case has a configuration of very dense reinforcing ribs <b>22</b>, so as to achieve better strength and durability.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the mat <b>10</b> disclosed in this case is bifacially folding type, this is one of specific embodiments of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
