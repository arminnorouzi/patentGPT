Additionally, the motor winding may experience a corresponding over-voltage which increases stress on the winding insulation and other motor components. A soft-starter device as described herein reduces the starting current to adequate levels to avoid perturbations to the grid or to the motor starting process, by limiting the current conduction time. In addition, eliminates the over-voltages enabling greater reliability for the control circuit and the motor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The soft-starter device may be implemented by using fully controllable power semiconductor devices (e.g. SiC MOSFETs), specifically for one or more source-to-source (or emitter-to-emitter) series connection of MOSFETs to form a bi-directional switch. The soft-starter device includes a control circuit and decision algorithm for operating the fully controllable power semiconductor devices to control the bi-directional switch to enable zero-current turn-off based on independently controlled states of the semiconductor devices and without need for accurate current sensing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a non-limiting example, the control circuit and decision algorithm enable control of source voltage applied to a three-phase load (e.g. motor load fed by a soft-starter) using fully controllable power semiconductor devices and extend the number of operations (e.g., tens of millions of operations) of the FET/IGBT based control switch and MOV due to a reduction in the stress under normal operations. The reduction of stress may also be realized by the motor winding insulation during the starting of direct on line/soft-started motors. The soft-starter device disclosed enables use of fully controllable semiconductor devices, such as SiC MOSFETs and GaN FET, which enable low losses and small form factor for solid state breaker, contactor, and Breaktor (i.e., breaker+contactor), and other event switching applications.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a soft-starter for an induction machine using a thyristor control switch. The device is gated with a pulsed current at certain firing angles in the supply voltage half-cycle. The device then naturally turns-off at the next current zero-crossing in the absence of a gate-pulse. The firing angle is varied throughout the soft-start duration based on a defined control strategy to limit the starting current of the motor. However, this uncontrolled turn-off of the thyristor cannot be used to limit the fault current in case of a downstream fault.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a fully controlled soft-starter device (&#x201c;soft-starter device&#x201d;), according to aspects of the present disclosure. For instance, the fully controlled soft-starter device may be a field effect transistor, such as a metal-oxide-semiconductor silicon carbide field effect transistor (SiC MOSFET). The SiC MOSFET may be utilized to combine a motor control function and a fault protection function for a motor controller/starter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the fully controlled soft-starter device provides fast interruption of fault current that reduces the need for additional protection devices between the soft-starter device and the load. The fully controlled soft-starter device also provides frequent start and stop of the motor or frequent on/off control of general loads.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since an induction motor is a highly inductive load, performing a turn-off operation at even very small current levels can cause the voltage across the soft-starter device to exceed the safe operating range. The motor winding may also experience a corresponding over-voltage which causes increased stress on the winding insulation. The accuracy of this zero-current turn-off (ZCTO) operation depends on the accuracy of a current sensor and the control electronics in the circuit. In some cases, the range of the current sensor can be high when the current sensor also controls the starting current. The current sensor used to also control the starting current generally have a low sensitivity and hence, reduced accuracy at low currents near the zero-crossing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other examples of soft-starter devices may include Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), junction-gate field-effect transistor (JFET), or gallium nitride (GaN) FETs.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the soft-starter device <b>102</b> includes a first field effect transistor (FET) <b>110</b> and a second FET <b>120</b>. The first FET <b>110</b> includes a first source <b>112</b>, a first drain <b>114</b>, and a first gate <b>116</b>. The soft-starter device <b>102</b> also includes a second FET <b>120</b>. The second FET <b>120</b> includes a second source <b>122</b>, a second drain <b>124</b>, and a second gate <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">While not pictured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and as described elsewhere herein, the soft-starter device <b>102</b> may include a control circuit configured to provide independent control of the first FET <b>110</b> and second FET <b>120</b>. The control circuit provides independent control signals to each of first FET <b>110</b> and second FET <b>120</b> to permit conduction of current alternatively through the diodes of the soft-starter device <b>102</b>. Alternative commutation to the diodes of the soft-starter device <b>102</b> stops the conduction at the diode current inversion (zero-crossing). Controlling conduction based on the diode current inversion provides for reliable operation of both the soft-starter device <b>102</b> and a metal oxide varistor (MOV).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an example of various operating modes for the soft-starter device, according to aspects of the present disclosure. The soft-starter device includes a control circuit for a back-to-back FET (e.g. SiC MOSFET) 4-quadrant switch configuration. The back-to-back FET configuration provides soft turn-off for solid state circuit breaker, contactors, and plug and play motor controllers. As described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the back-to-back FET configuration provides current interruption while the current is reversing at the instant when it is actually zero (i.e., the zero crossing and diode current inversion).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The soft-starter device controlling the FETs based using the diode current inversion prevents both dangerous over-voltages across the soft-starter device (e.g., the component semiconductors) and excessive energy dissipation by the auxiliary components that clamp the voltage in case of overvoltage (e.g., MOV in parallel connection with the semiconductors).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The soft-starter device can selectively turn off, using a control circuit, one or more FET to commute the current to a freewheeling diode (e.g. body diode or the FET). Because the soft-starter device commutates the current to one or more freewheeling diodes, the current flow is not abruptly interrupted, but rather carried until the natural current inversion. After the current carried by one or mode diodes is exhausted by diode reverse recovery, the other FET or FETs may be turned off by the soft-starter device (e.g., using the control circuit). The soft-starter device turning off the other FET or FETs causes a complete current interruption and circuit isolation. Additional details of operations modes for the soft-starter device are described below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In case of the two modes marked as diode modes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one of the two semiconductor devices is gated low. Hence, the conduction is through the anti-parallel diode, making these uni-directional conduction modes. In the diode modes, the conduction will naturally stop at zero-current at the natural current inversion typical of an AC system. Hence, these modes can be used to achieve the desired natural zero current turn-off during the soft-start operation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A first mode <b>202</b> provides for current conduction in both directions. For example, both the FETs (G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>) are gated high. Thus, the channel of both devices are conducting and the soft-starter device behaves like a resistor, allowing conduction in both directions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A second mode <b>204</b> and third mode <b>206</b> provide current conduction in one direction as depicted by the current flow through the respective diode for each mode. For example, in the second mode <b>204</b> one of the two FETs (G<b>1</b> or G<b>2</b>) is gated low (and the opposite FET gated low for third mode <b>206</b>). The current is conducted through the anti-parallel diode, making the second mode <b>204</b> and third mode <b>206</b> one-direction conduction modes. In the second mode <b>204</b> and third mode <b>206</b>, the conduction will naturally stop at zero-current at the natural current inversion similar to an AC system. Hence, the second mode <b>204</b> and third mode <b>206</b> can be used to achieve the desired natural zero current turn-off during the soft-start operation and reduces the need for high accuracy current sensors.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A fourth mode <b>208</b>, the soft-starter device blocks current conduction in both directions. For example, both the FETs (G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>) are gated low. Thus, the channel of both devices are blocking and the soft-starter device behaves like an open circuit, preventing conduction in both directions.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example of timing diagrams using diode modes, according to aspects of the present disclosure.

In this example process, the soft-starter device includes two field effect transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> and a control circuit. In one example, Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> may transistors as described with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>402</b>, the process <b>400</b> involves gating off both field effect transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. For example, the control circuit can provide a low signal to the gate of each of Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. In one aspect, the operations at block <b>402</b> involve initializing the field effect transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At block <b>404</b>, the process <b>400</b> involves determining a reference firing angle to compare with the measured phase angle. In one example, the control circuit may set the reference firing angle to a pre-determined amount, or adjust the reference firing angle based on environmental, performance, and circuit characteristics (e.g., tolerances, motor specification, etc.).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>406</b>, the process <b>400</b> involves comparing the measured phase of a supply voltage with the reference firing angle. In one example, the soft-starter device may perform a modulo operation of the measured phase angle with respect to 180&#xb0; may be used. The soft-starter device may perform the comparison of the measured phase angle with the reference firing angle for each half cycle of the supply voltage. In another example, the soft-starter device may compare the measured phase with the reference firing angle as a binary comparison, or by computing a difference and determining the absolute value.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At block <b>408</b>, the process <b>400</b> involves turning on the first FET Q<b>1</b> and the second FET Q<b>2</b>. As described previously, both Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> enabled puts the soft-starter in the first mode and the soft-starter device provides current conduction in both directions. For example, both the FETs (G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>) are gated high. Thus, the channel of both Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are conducting and the soft-starter device behaves like a resistor, allowing conduction in both directions. From block <b>408</b>, the process <b>400</b> proceeds in parallel to blocks <b>410</b> and <b>412</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At block <b>412</b>, the soft-starter device may detect a falling edge of the turn-on pulse generated by a phase comparison. For instance, the soft-starter device may detect that the turn-on pulse generated at block <b>408</b> is transitioning from a high logic value to a low logic value. When the soft-starter device detects a falling edge, then the process <b>400</b> may move to block <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At block <b>414</b>, the soft-starter device may determine whether any return-path devices in other phases are in an on state. For example in a three phase motor circuit, the soft-starter device may determine whether to turn off a Q<b>1</b> device in Phase A will be dependent on whether the Q<b>2</b> devices in Phases B and C are being provided an enabling control signal (gate on signal). As described with respect to block <b>412</b>, the check of return-path devices is performed when a falling edge is detected.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one example for three-phase loads without a neutral connection, determining whether any return-path devices are in an on state is necessary because the current cannot start flowing unless the devices in at least two phases are not turned-on. During a motor soft-start operation, the check of return-path devices can happen in the beginning of the soft-start period, when the firing angle is high. In this example, if only the turn-off condition based on current is used, the devices in the first phase will be kept in ON-state till the next half-cycle when a second phase control switch is turned-on.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For instance, when the reference angle is 150&#xb0;, the semiconductor devices in the second phase will not turn-on till the first phase has reached 30&#xb0; in the next half cycle. Controlling the semiconductor devices in the first phase in an ON-state until 30&#xb0; in the next half cycle will cause high inrush currents. The high inrush currents may be observed when firing angles are higher than 120&#xb0;. To compensate, the soft-starter device detects the state of the semiconductor devices in the other phases allowing the soft-starter device to turn off the semiconductor devices in the other phases at the end of the half cycle for high firing angles. In another example, for firing angles less than 120&#xb0;, this turn-off condition will not be met. From block <b>414</b>, the process <b>400</b> may proceed to block <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At block <b>410</b>, the soft-starter device may compare the phase current with a diode threshold current (e.g., IDiode&#x2212; and IDiode+). The soft-starter device may apply a comparison condition that is different for the FETs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> in each phase. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the comparison condition for Q<b>1</b> may be I<sub>a,b,c</sub>&#x3e;I<sub>Diode&#x2212;</sub> and a slope greater than 0 and the comparison for Q<b>2</b> may be I<sub>a,b,c</sub>&#x3c;I<sub>Diode+</sub> and a slope less than 0. The soft-starter device may use the added condition on the slope to ensure that the turn-off determination is made only at the end of each current half-cycle. From block <b>410</b>, the process <b>400</b> may proceed to block <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At block <b>416</b>, the soft-starter device may determine to turn off Q<b>1</b> or Q<b>2</b> based on either or both of the conditions analyzed in block <b>410</b> and blocks <b>412</b>-<b>414</b>. In one example, the soft-starter device may send a disable (e.g., a logic low voltage) signal to turn off one of the field effect transistors Q<b>1</b> or Q<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example of a control circuit <b>500</b> implementing the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure.
