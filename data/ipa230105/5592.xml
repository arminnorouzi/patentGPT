Planning the orthodontic treatment may typically include a number of health care professionals, potentially representing various entities and potentially located in different geographical locations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of such entities may be an orthodontic clinic where an operator may collect data pertaining to the orthodontic treatment of the subject, such as images of subject's arch forms, a medical history of the subject, and the like, for devising a preliminary orthodontic treatment plan. Generally, the orthodontic treatment may comprise a certain number of steps in which different orthodontic appliances are applied to the subject's teeth. Thus, the operator may further communicate certain parts of the preliminary orthodontic treatment plan, such as the arch form images corresponding to the steps of the treatment, to another entity (a laboratory, for example) for making the orthodontic appliances for providing them to the subject.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, for various reasons, the preliminary orthodontic treatment plan may need to be revised during or between the treatment steps. This may be performed, for example, by the same or a different operator. In another example, the orthodontic treatment plan may be revised by a higher-level-skill orthodontic practitioner, such as an orthodontist or a maxillo-facial surgeon, for example, to improve the efficacy of the orthodontic treatment at a given step and/or reduce the discomfort caused to the subject after a first trial of the respective orthodontic appliance. By doing so, another version of the orthodontic treatment plan may be devised.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As it may be appreciated, when the above workflow is to be performed for many subjects or when the workflow for a given orthodontic treatment plan involves many operators and practitioners attending to the given orthodontic treatment plan at different steps thereof, a plurality of different versions of the given orthodontic treatment plan may be created, and can become easily confused. Furthermore, a given laboratory may collaborate with many different orthodontic practitioners. Working with the most up-to-date version of the given orthodontic treatment plan may become important. Working with out-dated versions may result in an ineffective treatment for the subject, not to mention wasted time and resources.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example problematic situation is as follows: the operator creates the orthodontic treatment plan, uploading it into a computer system which the orthodontist can access through their private system account. The orthodontist may start editing the given orthodontic treatment plan, at the same time as the operator also edits it. In this situation, there may be a version conflict, resulting in a loss of the changes made by either or both ones of the operator and the orthodontist.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain prior art approaches have been proposed related to shared access to information relating the development of the orthodontic treatment plan at the computer system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat.

More specifically, the developers have appreciated that a collaborative access to the orthodontic treatment may be more conveniently organized for all parties involved in the development thereof if the orthodontic treatment plan could be stored and modified solely on the server.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, to prevent conflicts between the versions of the orthodontic treatment plan created by different users, the server may be configured to implement certain restrictive policies allowing, for example, access only to one user at a time, subsequently restricting access to any other user. To that end, changes made by a given user (such as the orthodontist) working on the orthodontic treatment plan may be stored in a separate new version thereof. Additionally, at least one other user may be notified of the creation of the new version of the orthodontic treatment plan by the given user, and may thus attend to implementing their consecutive steps in the development of the orthodontic treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The developers have also realized that computational burden on the server may be reduced if each new version of the orthodontic treatment plan is not created every time a respective previous version thereof is accessed by the given user, rather, by contrast, is created only if there have been changes made to the respective previous version of the orthodontic treatment plan. Such an approach may allow avoiding creating, storing, and transmitting unnecessary copies of the orthodontic treatment plan among the users, which may increase operational efficiency of the server.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the developers have further appreciated that such an architecture of the computer system may allow saving changes made to the orthodontic treatment plan by certain users (for example, doctors) in a centralized manner for further predicting, for example, using a trained machine-learning algorithm, preferences of those particular users when automatically generating further orthodontic treatment plans associated with them. This may, for example, allow saving time on fine-tuning the orthodontic treatment plan by higher-level practitioners, which, in turn, increases efficiency of the orthodontic treatment plan development process.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, in accordance with a first broad aspect of the present technology, there is provided a distributed computer system for manufacturing an orthodontic appliance for a subject. The system comprises: a server communicatively couplable to electronic devices associated with sets of users, a given electronic device configured to implement a thin client for accessing the server.

According to at least some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the distributed computer system may be configured to provide collaborative access to such entities and/or individuals to implement their steps in developing the orthodontic treatment plan avoiding conflicts of versions of the orthodontic treatment plan thereamong. This may be achieved, in some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, by the distributed computer system being configured to provide the access to one of the entities and/or individuals at a time.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Certain embodiments of the present technology minimize, reduce or avoid some of the problems noted with the prior art. For example, by implementing certain embodiments of the present technology, efficiency of the manufacturing the orthodontic appliance may be increased.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the efficiency of the manufacturing the orthodontic appliance can be increased via reducing computational resources of the distributed computer system on the developing the orthodontic treatment plan. For example, the reducing the computational resources may be achieved by the distributed computer system being configured to generate and save each new version of the orthodontic treatment plan only in case of changes made to a previous version of the orthodontic treatment plan&#x2014;as opposed to generating each new version of orthodontic treatment plan every time it is accessed by an other entity and/or individual.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another example, the efficiency of the manufacturing the orthodontic appliance can be increased through reducing the time spent on the developing the orthodontic treatment plan. In this regard, the reducing the time for the developing the orthodontic treatment plan may be achieved, according to certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, by saving changes to the orthodontic treatment in association with respective entities and/or individuals who have made those changes, which may be used for predicting, for example, by a specifically trained machine-learning algorithm, preferences of those entities and/or individuals when automatically generating further orthodontic treatment plans for other subjects. Such an approach to the automatic generation of orthodontic treatment plans may help save time on adjusting the orthodontic treatment plan by certain entities and/or individuals.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Orthodontic Treatment</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is depicted a perspective view of a lower arch form <b>10</b> and an upper arch form <b>11</b> of the subject (not depicted), to which certain aspects and non-limiting embodiments of the present technology may be applied.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As can be appreciated, the lower arch form <b>10</b> includes lower teeth <b>12</b> and lower gingiva <b>14</b>; and the upper arch form <b>11</b> includes upper teeth <b>13</b> and upper gingiva <b>15</b>. Further, in the depicted embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, positions of at least some of the lower teeth <b>12</b> within the lower arch form <b>10</b> and those of the upper teeth <b>13</b> within the upper arch form <b>11</b> may be indicative of certain orthodontic disorders of the subject. For example, at least a given lower tooth <b>16</b> and a given upper tooth <b>17</b> are misaligned within a respective one of the lower arch form <b>10</b> and the upper arch form <b>11</b>. Further, as the given lower tooth <b>16</b> is abnormally embedded within the lower teeth <b>12</b> while the given upper tooth <b>17</b> abnormally protrudes over opposing ones of the lower teeth <b>12</b>, the misalignment thereof may affect the bite of the teeth, or, in other words, cause a malocclusion&#x2014;that is, an irregular spatial relationship&#x2014;between the lower teeth <b>12</b> and the upper teeth <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Other malocclusions (not depicted) associated with misalignment of lower teeth <b>12</b> relative to each other and the upper teeth <b>13</b>, according to certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, may include, without limitation: overbites, underbites, crossbites, openbites, crowding of some of the lower teeth <b>12</b> and the upper teeth <b>13</b>, midline shift therebetween, and others.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, for resolving the above-mentioned malocclusions, an orthodontic treatment may be provided to the subject.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the orthodontic treatment may comprise applying an orthodontic appliance to the subject's teeth. Generally speaking, the orthodontic appliance may be configured to exert a respective predetermined force onto at least some of the lower teeth <b>12</b> and the upper teeth <b>13</b>&#x2014;such as the given lower tooth <b>16</b> and the given upper tooth <b>17</b>, causing them to move towards an aligned position, thereby restoring the normal occlusion of the lower teeth <b>12</b> relative to upper teeth <b>13</b> of the subject. More specifically, in the depicted embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the orthodontic appliance may be configured to cause the given lower tooth <b>16</b> to move outwardly between lower teeth adjacent thereto; and further cause clockwise rotation thereof. Further, the orthodontic appliance may be configured to cause the given upper tooth <b>17</b> to move inwardly. In various non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the orthodontic appliance may comprise orthodontic appliances of different types, shapes, sizes and configurations, such as those including, without limitation, aligners, brackets, multi-strand wires, strips, retainers, and plates.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the orthodontic appliance may be selected, in the course of the orthodontic treatment to correct a respective malocclusion. For example, in some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the orthodontic appliance may include a biteplate (not depicted) used for correcting the overbites. More specifically, the biteplate may be configured for preventing front ones of upper teeth <b>13</b> overlap front ones of the lower teeth <b>12</b> for extended periods of time.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, in some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the orthodontic appliance may include a bitesplint (not depicted), which may be applied to the lower teeth <b>12</b> for correcting the crossbites&#x2014;a lateral misalignment of one of the lower arch form <b>10</b> and the upper arch form <b>11</b> resulting, for example, in buccal surfaces of some of the upper teeth <b>13</b> overlapping lingual surfaces of opposing ones thereto of the lower teeth <b>12</b>. To that end, the bitesplint may be configured for preventing the subject from biting completely, which may further allow correcting the crossbites.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In specific non-limiting embodiments of the present the present technology, the orthodontic appliance may include at least one aligner. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, there is depicted an aligner <b>20</b> applied to at least some of the lower teeth <b>12</b>, in accordance with certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology. The aligner <b>20</b> comprises an inner surface <b>22</b> and an outer surface <b>24</b>. The inner surface <b>22</b> defines a channel <b>26</b>, which is configured, in some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, for receiving crown portions of at least some of the lower teeth <b>12</b>, such as the given lower tooth <b>16</b>. However, in other non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the channel <b>26</b> of the aligner <b>20</b> may be configured to receive crown portions of all of the lower teeth <b>12</b>. At least one edge (also referred to herein as an &#x201c;open edge&#x201d;) of the channel <b>26</b> is shaped for following a gum line (not depicted) along the lower gingiva <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">It will be appreciated that, in accordance with certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be used for treating different teeth malocclusions, including but not limited to one or more of: closing interdental spaces (&#x201c;space closure&#x201d;), creating/widening interdental spaces, tooth rotation, tooth intrusion/extrusion, and tooth translation, to name a few. It should further be noted that in certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, applying the aligner <b>20</b> to the lower teeth <b>12</b> may further include applying specific attachments thereto.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As may become apparent, the aligner <b>20</b> may be designed in such a way that its inner surface <b>22</b> is configured to impose respective forces on one or more of the lower teeth <b>12</b> to obtain a desired position of the lower teeth <b>12</b> at a given stage of the orthodontic treatment.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Needles to say that, although in the depicted embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the aligner <b>20</b> is configured to be applied onto the lower teeth <b>12</b>, in other non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, a respective configuration of the aligner <b>20</b> may be applied to the upper teeth <b>13</b> of the subject for treating misalignment of at least some thereof&#x2014;such as the given upper tooth <b>17</b>. By so doing, the desired occlusion between the lower teeth <b>12</b> and the upper teeth <b>13</b> may be attained.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to certain non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be made of a polymer, such as a thermoplastic material. In other non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be made of poly-vinyl chloride (PVC). In yet other non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be made of polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). Other suitable materials can also be used to form the aligner <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing techniques where the aligner <b>20</b> is formed by printing according to a pre-generated 3D digital model thereof.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be produced by a thermoforming process where (1) an unfinished aligner is produced, using a preform, on a respective aligner mold (not depicted) associated with a respective stage of the orthodontic treatment, which is configured to shape the inner surface <b>22</b> of the aligner <b>20</b>; and (2) the unfinished aligner is cut along a predetermined cut line to remove excess material therefrom, thereby producing the aligner <b>20</b>, the predetermined cut line defining the at least one edge of the channel <b>26</b> of the aligner <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In specific non-limiting embodiments of the present technology, the aligner <b>20</b> may be manufactured in accordance with one or more methods described in a co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 11,191,618-B1, issued on Dec. 7, 2021, and entitled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FORMING A DENTAL APPLIANCE,&#x201d; the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As it may become apparent, to produce the aligner <b>20</b> for achieving the desired occlusal relationship between the lower teeth <b>12</b> and the upper teeth <b>13</b> during the orthodontic treatment, the tooth movements of the subject's teeth to which the aligner <b>20</b> is to be applied to should be carefully planned, based on respective 3D digital models (such as a 3D model <b>710</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, for example) of the lower arch form <b>10</b> and the upper arch form <b>11</b>, for example, to determine respective forces applied to the subject's teeth during respective stages of the orthodontic treatment. For example, the respective 3D digital models of each one of the lower arch form <b>10</b> and the upper arch form <b>11</b> of the subject may be generated using intra-oral scanning techniques.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus, as it can be appreciated the process for manufacturing the aligner <b>20</b> for the subject may involve certain steps that may be implemented by different entities (such as clinics and laboratories, for example) and/or users (such as operators, orthodontic practitioners of different levels, and the like). By way of example, (i) accessing current configurations of the lower arch form <b>10</b> and the upper arch form <b>11</b>, for example, based on the respective 3D digital models, may be performed by an intermediary orthodontic practitioner (such as a dentist/orthodontist assistant, a dental/orthodontic nurse, for example). Further, the intermediary orthodontic practitioner may then communicate the respective 3D digital models to an entity running a specific digital treatment planning application for (ii) determining a preliminary version of the orthodontic treatment plan. In some cases, the preliminary version of the orthodontic treatment plan may further need to be (iii) reviewed by a higher-level orthodontic practitioner (for example, a dentist, an orthodontist, a maxillo-facial surgeon, and the like), who can further communicate the finalized orthodontic treatment plan for (iv) to the subject for presentation of the finalized orthodontic treatment plan thereto and (v) to a laboratory facility for the manufacturing at least one configuration of the aligner <b>20</b> for implementing the orthodontic treatment.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As it can further be appreciated, the structure of such a workflow for the manufacturing the aligner <b>20</b> may permit at least some of the above-mentioned users involved therein to work on the orthodontic treatment plan simultaneously, which may cause loss of changes made by at least some of these users further resulting in an ineffective orthodontic treatment, damage to the subject's teeth, not to mention, wasted time and resources for implementing such a faulty orthodontic treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thus, to address the above-identified technical problem, non-limiting embodiments of a distributed computer system described herein has been developed.
