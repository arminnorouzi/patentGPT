There are prohibitive design restrictions such as a tight power budget and payload, which is particularly important in aerial flights. To address these challenges, we pose a problem called the Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM) problem. In the MVAM problem, we attempt to allocate mass in robot designs such that the energetic performance is affected the least. To solve the MVAM problem, we adopted a generative design approach using the Grasshopper generative design tool's evolutionary solver to synthesize a parametric design space for the robot. Then, this space was searched for the morphologies that could yield a minimized Total Cost of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed that a front heavy quadrupedal robot can achieve a lower TCOT while retaining larger margins on allowable added mass to its design.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While energetic efficiency of legged locomotion has been extensively studied based on shaping joint trajectory [2], actuator design [3], [4] and compliance [5], [6], there has been little to no attempt to connect it to robot morphology. For instance, efficiency was a key factor in the MIT Cheetah robot's trotting gaits with jerky and interrupted joint movements under large Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs) [7]. Efficiency was achieved based on electric actuator design and selection of predefined trotting gaits. Since commercial actuators with high ratio gearboxes are often tightly designed based on more continuous and controlled behaviors, the Cheetah possessed back-drivable and brushless actuators.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In ANYmal, the emphasis has been on endurance and with its bulky structure, so natural and fast running patterns showcased by MIT's Cheetah are not feasible on this platform [8]. ANYmal's design characteristics are high torque joint actuation through the combination of electric motors and harmonic drives with rotational springs, precision joint movement measurement, and a rigid, bulky leg structure that accommodate high mechanical bandwidth for high bandwidth impedance control. With these characteristics, robot morphology and payload have not been important in the design of ANYmal.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one example of a morpho-functional robot in accordance with one or more embodiments called the Husky Carbon robot in a legged mode of operation. Husky Carbon, when standing as a quadrupedal robot, is 2.5 ft. (0.8 m) tall. The robot is about 1 ft. (0.3 m) wide. It is fabricated from reinforced thermoplastic materials through additive manufacturing and weighs 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg). It hosts on-board power electronics and a power supply. The robot optionally includes exteroceptive sensors such as camera and LiDAR. The robot is constructed of two pairs of identical legs in the form of parallelogram mechanisms. Each with three degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), the legs are fixated to Husky's torso by a one-DOF revolute joint with a large range of motion. As a result, the legs can be located sideways as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. This configuration allows facing the knee actuators upwards for propulsion purpose. A clutch mechanism can disengage the knee actuator from the lower limb before the actuator runs a propeller.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The robot has 12 actuators. Each custom-made actuator has a pancake brushless-DC motor winding from T-motor with a KV equal to 400. Harmonic drive component sets (flexspline, circular spline, and wave generator) with gear ratios: 30, 50 and 100 for knee, hip sagittal and hip frontal, respectively, and hall-effect-based incremental encoders are embedded inside the 3D-printed structure of the robot. The embedding process, which will be discussed in further detail below, reduces the use of metal housings and fasteners to produce a lighter structure. The robot includes an on-board inertial measurement unit for orientation sensing.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Significant design restrictions such as payload and actuation power exist in the design of morpho-functional robots. By looking at legged locomotion as the translation of the center of mass (COM) of the robot in the environment led by body self-manipulation, it is apparent that added mass from structures, actuators, electronics, etc., can yield added required actuation torques at the joints and have to be compensated by stronger and larger actuators, which in turn add extra mass to the system. So, the resulting loop of added mass for the added required joint torque can lead to bulky systems. This issue becomes very important when aerial mobility is considered as, e.g., the application of metal parts or bulky actuators that are widely used in legged robots is no longer possible. That said, the use of lighter non-metallic structures, unreinforced body frameworks, smaller actuators, etc., can manifest itself in destructive ways such as unplanned compliance or lack of actuation power in the system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Compliance can yield control design challenges both for aerial and legged mobility. In general, whole body control in legged systems is challenging by itself and unplanned compliance can lead to extra challenges such as poor foot placement performance [10], [11]. That said, compliance is not a negative property by itself and is the defining characteristics of biological locomotion systems [9]. This is the reason legged community has adopted series elastic actuators [12], [13].</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The inherent compliance in Husky's body has led to a few issues that have been addressed with the help of closed-loop feedback. While Husky's compliant legs can potentially accommodate locomotion on grounds that feature unknown irregularities, body flexibility in Husky can prohibit precise kinematic planning for perceived ground changes and can lead to instantaneous body sagging each time feet touch-downs occur. Other issues include degraded mechanical bandwidth as it is important to the projection of joint torques to body forces, impedance control, or foot placement. For instance, the leg compliance can introduce oscillations of large amplitude and can lower the natural frequency of the tracking controller meant to position the COM at desired locations with respect to the contact points [14], [15], [13], [16], [10].</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Quadrupedal robots are often designed in such a way that they have wide support polygons, which allow trivial, quasi-static locomotion [16], [17], [11], [11]. Husky possesses a very small stability margin based on a crude definition [18] that considers the shortest distance from the robot's projected COM to the edges of its support polygon constructed by the contact points. This small margin exists for two reasons. First, the small stability margin is caused partly because of a low cross-section torso, i.e., the hips are located very close to each other in the frontal plane, which is important to reduce induced drag forces for aerial mobility. Second, it is partly caused by the inherent compliance in the system, which can cause fall-overs even when the robot has four contact points. Due to the robot body flexibility COM can shift towards the edges of the support polygon very easily if required corrections are not made quickly through foot placement or active control of the joints.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Small stability margins in Husky has led to other challenges such as gait design issues that generally are expected in bipedal systems and not quadrupedal robots [19]. In Husky, the stability margin and gait cycle periods are adversely related. When the gait cycle time is larger than approximately one third of a second, which is equivalent to a 3-Hz gait cycle, even when the robot retains three contact points with the ground surface the projected position of the robot COM could reach to the boundaries of the support polygon. If new foot placements are not involved, the robot's stability margin will reduce further by the sagging effects led by the compliance in the robot. This poses severe gait design challenges.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM) Problem</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Added mass can affect various aspects of mobility in a mobile robot, e.g., in legged systems, it can affect impact dynamics, energetic efficiency, selection of actuators, etc. It is nearly impossible to consider every aspect of mobility when dealing with a mass allocation problem. We only consider the connection between morphology and energetic efficiency of legged mobility, which has direct implications in the design of Husky. We call this problem Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM). While aerial mobility is another important objective in this project, the MVAM problem only addresses payload restrictions in relation to it.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Inspection of energetic efficiency of legged robots is not a new topic and has been extensively studied and various key players such as joint movement, actuator design, and compliance have been examined. However, there has been little to no attempt to connect efficiency to robot morphology. In pursuit of a multi-modal design that can realize legged and aerial mobility, actuation and payload pose formidable challenges. We studied how Husky's morphology can affect its Total Cost of Transport (TCOT). The MVAM problem addresses how the search for a morphology with minimum TCOT and payload can be mathematically formulated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To do this, we drew a connection between generative design algorithms such as those available in Rhino and physics modeling tools from MATLAB. Using Grasshopper, which is a plugin for the Rhino 6 CAD software, we were able to create a parametric model of the entire robot. The parameters including the location of metal parts (e.g., components of harmonic drives) and electronics within body structures, the size of housings, body frame, connecting rods, etc., were made accessible to a Galapagos, an evolutionary solver within Grasshopper, which was allowed to automatically find the overall design space based on any other components that were included in the model. The resulting design space can reflect important aspects including geometry, inertial properties, structural strength and kinematics of the physical model realistically. Tweaks to the geometry of the robot can also be made by the solver. Then, we linked this space to the parametric constrained dynamical model of Husky in MATLAB.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Since finding a closed-form solution of TCOT in terms of morphology (i.e., components location, shape and size) is not feasible, we considered the numerical model of Husky in MATLAB. In this model, inertial properties including the COM position and principal mass moment of inertia are introduced as decision parameters that are set by a finite state nonlinear optimizer in MATLAB. The model is constrained in its sagittal and frontal planes of walking (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). No motion in the frontal plane of locomotion is allowed. In the sagittal plane, all joints movements are forced to follow feasible, predefined trajectories. These predefined trajectories described forward walking gaits in our robot.

In this process, circular splines are embedded inside the actuator housings and other components including wave generators and flexsplines are embedded at the subsequent steps. Embedding components within 3D printed structures and linking this approach to a physics-based generative design method (MVAM problem) and the use of the results directly to create a legged robot with many parts and components is unprecedented and has not reported before.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The benefits of this approach are as following. First, a considerable payload reduction can be achieved for a feasible and working platform. Second, system components can be precisely located at predetermined locations dictated by the MVAM solutions, which are aimed at enhancing efficiency and reduce payload. Finally, the model and robot can be matched better, which is important for model-based control design. Therefore, morphology and its role in control can be taken into account. We incorporated classical actuator models in our MVAM problem to determine actuation requirements. The findings can be used to select DC motor windings and harmonic drives.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To minimize added mass over yield strength ratio, we applied a simple approach. To increase the stiffness of light 3D printed parts, we applied a method that has roots in classical beam theory. One can increase stiffness of beam by increasing the moment of inertia of the beam section or the modulus elasticity of the material. In our case it was more feasible, from a design perspective, to increase the moment of inertia because we wanted to avoid using heavy metals with a considerably higher modulus. By sandwiching 3D-printed thermoplastic material between layers of continuous carbon fiber, weight is reduced while stiffness was greatly increased. This was achieved using MarkForged slicer application called Eiger.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, TCOT values are computed for all of the morphologies in the design space and are represented by the color and intensity of the data points.

For instance, for a rectangular section, moment of inertia will increase when one increases the depth or width of the beam.

After the circular spline and flexible spline are coated in harmonic drive grease according to their specifications, the flexible spline and output support are inserted into the housing and fastened to the output shaft with a metal fastener. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> further illustrates embedding process and the insertion of the output shaft, output support, and harmonic drive flexible spline and wave generator.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0066">The coils of a T-motor Antigravity 4004 brushless DC motor are press-fit onto the 3D-printed housing and secured with a laser-cut carbon fiber key, which is cut from 1 mm thick carbon fiber stock with an LPKF ProtoLaser U4.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0067">The LPKF ProtoLaser U4 leverages a highly versatile and accurate scanner-guided laser with a wavelength of 355 nm in the UV spectrum that has been specially developed for use in electronics laboratories. This wavelength makes it possible for many material groups to be perfectly processed with the laser without additional tools, masks or films. The laser cutter allows cutting extremely precise laser-cut components that can match the accuracy of the printer. Such an accuracy is important and key in the overall process of embedding components in that any discrepancy in the dimensions can lead to severe damages to the printer consumable nuzzle. Placing scan fields next to each other results in a working range of up to 229 mm by 305 mm by 10 mm. The laser focus with a diameter of approximately 20 &#x3bc;m. allows for structures with a pitch of 65 micron, i.e., 50 micron line width, 15 micron apart.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0068">A custom shaft also is press-fit into the rotor of the motor and secured by set screws. Once the rotor and shaft assembly is pressed into the upper motor housing, the upper and lower motor housings can be fastened together with three screws and nuts. E-clips are used to secure both sides of the shaft. The harmonic drive wave generator is secured with set screws to the motor shaft and is then slowly pressed into the circular spline inside the harmonic drive housing.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0069">Once assembled, the actuator was tested with an Elmo amplifier connected to a PC with Elmo Application Studio II and a power supply. A series of tests were run on the actuators, and the frequency response of the current and velocity identification tests on the actuator with and without the harmonic drive are shown in the bode plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0070">The methods, operations, modules, and systems described herein particularly for locating and sizing robot components may be implemented in one or more computer programs executing on a programmable computer system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system <b>510</b>, on which the one or more computer programs may operate as a set of computer instructions.
