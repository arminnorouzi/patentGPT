More specifically, the disclosure is directed towards a handle having a resiliently biased universal fit element for attaching to varying knee braces.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Knee braces, or knee orthoses, are commonly employed to resist excessive movement of the knee joint in humans. In particular, knee braces provide support to the patella and surrounding ligaments. Knee braces are used during physical activity, such as sports, recovering from an injury, and to prevent injury. In instances where a knee brace is used with subjects having diseases causing impairment of muscles surrounding the knee, the knee brace can prevent flexion or extension instability of the knee.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because knee braces are generally desired to provide stability to the knee without excessively limiting range of motion in the subject, existing knee braces are not positionally secure, or do not allow the subject to adjust the position of the knee brace without excessively limiting range of motion in the subject. Knee braces may be configured with handles such that the subject can retain or adjust the position of the knee braces. However, because knee braces are not uniform in shape, size, and configuration, often differing by manufacturer and model, one handle has not been able to fit knee braces that differ in these ways. Thus, a need exists for a knee brace handle that is adapted to fit with a wide variety of knee braces such that a subject may positionally adjusted or secure knee braces.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a handle includes a body having a top portion, a bottom portion opposite of the top portion, a front side, and a rear side opposite of the front side. The handle includes a resiliently biased front cavity member disposed on the front side of the body and defining a hinge. The resiliently biased front cavity member hingedly pivots between a closed position and an open position. A releasable fastener may be disposed on the handle and configured to secure the resiliently biased front cavity member in the closed position. The releasable fastener may be a thumb screw or a friction fit (not shown). The front cavity member may be configured to open away from the rear side when moving from the closed position to the open position and toward the rear side when moving from the open position to the closed position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The handle includes a rear cavity member disposed on the rear side of the body and opposite of the resiliently biased front cavity member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The resiliently biased front cavity member or the rear cavity member may include one or more grooves. Both of the resiliently biased front cavity member and the rear cavity member may include the one or more grooves. Each, or both, of the resiliently biased front cavity member and the rear cavity member may include a first cavity end and a second cavity end opposite of the first cavity end. In embodiments of the handle including the one or more grooves on the resiliently biased front cavity member, the resiliently biased front cavity member may include one or more grooves of the resiliently biased front cavity member comprised of a first groove and a second groove disposed proximate to the first cavity end and the second cavity end, respectively. The first groove and the second grove of the resiliently biased front cavity member may have a triangular profile. The resiliently biased front cavity member may include a third groove and a fourth groove disposed proximate to the first groove and the second groove, respectively, of the front cavity member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In embodiments of the handle including the one or more grooves on the rear cavity member, the one or more grooves may include a first groove and a second groove each having a triangular profile and disposed at the first cavity end and the second cavity end.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The handle includes a cavity defined by the resiliently biased front cavity member and the rear cavity member. The cavity may be disposed at the bottom portion of the body. The cavity may include a central longitudinal axis. The rear cavity member may include a third groove and a fourth groove disposed proximate to the central longitudinal axis. Each of the third groove and fourth groove may have a rectangular profile.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The handle may include an insert configured to be cooperatively received in the cavity of the handle. The insert may include a slot having a differing inner profile from the inner profile of the cavity. The slot may have a rectangular profile. The insert may include a resiliently biased hinge that allows the insert to move between open and closed positions. The insert may include an upper lip and a bottom lip.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The resiliently biased front cavity member may curve away from the central longitudinal axis. The rear side of the rear cavity member includes an indentation. The body of the handle may be elongated from the top portion to the bottom portion. The body may include a first leg and a second leg extending from the top portion to the bottom portion, and the top portion may include a width that is greater than a width of the first leg and the second leg. The body and/or the insert, including components thereof, may be rigid. The body and/or the insert, including components thereof, may be integrally formed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It should be noted that identical features in different drawings are shown with the same reference numeral.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a front perspective view of an embodiment of a handle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a close-up front perspective view of the handle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a closed position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a close-up front perspective view of the handle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an open position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a close-up top view of the bottom portion of the handle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a close-up rear perspective view of the bottom portion of the handle according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a front perspective view of an insert according to one embodiment of the handle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a top view of an insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a closed position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a top view of an insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an open position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a rear perspective view of an insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a front perspective view of an embodiment of the handle with the insert disposed within the cavity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> shows a front view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> shows a close-up front view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a right-side view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> shows a top perspective view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows a left side view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a close-up top perspective view of the handle with the insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the present disclosure.
