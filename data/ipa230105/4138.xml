A learning device for the intellectual control derives an optimum control law from past plant operation data by a statistical analysis. A control device which operates in accordance with the control law can realize a high control performance limitedly in a range that past plant operation data is present.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, in a range that the past plant operation data is not present, it becomes necessary to protect plant components.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Patent Literature 1, a method of predicting a future plant state of a plant by iteration calculations of a simulator and a control device of the plant and optimally selecting a limiting value of a manipulated variable so as not to activate a protection function of the plant components and to normalize the plant state is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Patent Literature 2, a method of making it learn in advance a feature amount of a monitoring sensor signal by a predictive diagnosis function and preparing a standard of a divergence degree is disclosed. In a case where the divergence degree reaches a certain threshold value, switching to fallback becomes possible.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Sho 60-93507</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2018-060387</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described in the Patent Literature 1, protection of the components becomes possible by switching the control when a process value deviates from a margin. On the other hand, appropriate margin setting is difficult. When the margin is small, there is a risk that the components would be damaged. When it is large, an operating time for artificial intelligence control becomes short and a plant efficiency is lowered.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As described in the Patent Literature 2, the control can be switched at an early stage by defining data which has been learned as an experience range and by deciding whether the artificial intelligence control is applicable depending on whether it deviates from that range. However, it is difficult to define a relevancy with a personally set restriction and it is difficult to improve a decision accuracy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a plant operator monitors the process value and decides to switch to a general control mode or a protection control mode and thereby it is expected that an optimum control mode which accords with the situation will be adopted. However, when the plant operator judges control modes of all plants in all time zones, a monitoring load on the plant operator is increased and human fatigue occurs.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, there also exists a scene that the plant operator watches out in particular. For example, at an initial stage that an intellectual control system is applied to the plant, the plant operator adjusts the system finely in order to increase a control performance to an expected level. On this occasion, for example, in a case where it is necessary to conduct re-learning with the use of freshly acquired data, it is difficult to predict a time which is required for adjustment. In this adjustment period, it is necessary for the plant operator to make effort for stable control of the plant with particular caution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present invention mainly aims to provide information which is useful for reducing a monitoring load thereon while making the plant operator conduct monitoring in an appropriate situation as a main issue.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to solve the aforementioned issue, a monitoring support device according to the present

Incidentally, the plant <b>29</b> is one example of a control object and may be also applied to other control objects (a motor vehicle, a robot, an electric train and so forth). The plant <b>29</b> operates by appropriately switching from mechanical learning control by the processing device <b>40</b> to manual control from the monitoring room <b>39</b> and vice versa. Thereby, even when an unexpected situation that mechanical learning is not conducted occurs, the plant control system is stably controlled by intervention of human-based judgement.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The processing device <b>40</b> is configured as a computer which has a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a memory, a storage means (a storage unit) such as a hard disc and so forth and a network interface.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The CPU executes a program (also called an application and app. which is an abbreviation thereof) which is read on the memory and thereby this computer makes a control unit (a control means) which is configured by respective processing sections operate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The processing device <b>40</b> has a learning unit <b>41</b> which conducts mechanical learning and a control unit <b>42</b> which conducts processing which relates to control of the plant <b>29</b> by using a result of learning by the learning unit <b>41</b>. The learning unit <b>41</b> has an operation data storage section <b>12</b>, a control learning section <b>21</b>, a monitoring condition learning section <b>31</b> and a state conversion table <b>31</b>T.

A difference between the attenuation type state transition matrix D and the state transition matrix T is the following.
