Initial methods involved engineering nucleases such as meganucleases, zinc finger fusion proteins or TALENs, requiring the generation of chimeric nucleases with engineered, programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding domains specific for each particular target sequence. RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs), such as the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) proteins of the CRISPR-Cas bacterial system, allow for the targeting of specific sequences by complexing the nucleases with guide RNA that specifically hybridizes with a particular target sequence. Producing target-specific guide RNAs is less costly and more efficient than generating chimeric nucleases for each target sequence. Such RNA-guided nucleases can be used to edit genomes through the introduction of a sequence-specific, double-stranded break that is repaired via error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) to introduce a mutation at a specific genomic location.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, RGNs are useful for targeted DNA editing approaches. Targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences, for example targeted cleavage, to allow for introduction of a specific modification into genomic DNA, enables a highly nuanced approach to studying gene function and gene expression. RGNs may also be used to generate chimeric proteins which use the RNA-guided activity of the RGN in combination with a DNA modifying enzyme, such as a deaminase, for targeted base editing. Targeted editing may be deployed for targeting genetic diseases in humans or for introducing agronomically beneficial mutations in the genomes of crop plants. The development of genome editing tools provides new approaches to gene editing-based mammalian therapeutics and agrobiotechnology.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Compositions and methods for modifying a target DNA molecule are provided.

Therefore, it is to be understood that the inventions are not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This disclosure provides novel adenine deaminases and fusion proteins that comprise a nucleic acid molecule-binding polypeptide, such as a DNA-binding polypeptide, and a novel deaminase polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the DNA-binding polypeptide is a sequence-specific DNA-binding polypeptide, in that the DNA-binding polypeptide binds to a target sequence at a greater frequency than binding to a randomized background sequence. In some embodiments, the DNA-binding polypeptide is or is derived from a meganuclease, zinc finger fusion protein, or TALEN. In some embodiments, the fusion protein comprises an RNA-guided DNA-binding polypeptide and a deaminase polypeptide. In some embodiments, the RNA-guided DNA-binding polypeptide is an RNA-guided nuclease, such as a Cas9 polypeptide domain that binds to a guide RNA (also referred to as gRNA), which, in turn, binds a target nucleic acid sequence via strand hybridization.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The deaminase polypeptides disclosed herein can deaminate a nucleobase, such as, for example, adenine. The deamination of a nucleobase by a deaminase can lead to a point mutation at the respective residue, which is referred to herein as &#x201c;nucleic acid editing&#x201d;, or &#x201c;base editing&#x201d;. Fusion proteins comprising an RNA-guided nuclease (RGN) polypeptide and a deaminase can thus be used for the targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such fusion proteins are useful for targeted editing of DNA in vitro, e.g., for the generation of genetically modified cells. These genetically modified cells may be plant cells or animal cells. Such fusion proteins may also be useful for the introduction of targeted mutations, e.g., for the correction of genetic defects in mammalian cells ex vivo, e.g., in cells obtained from a subject that are subsequently re-introduced into the same or another subject; and for the introduction of targeted mutations, e.g., the correction of genetic defects or the introduction of deactivating mutations in disease-associated genes in a mammalian subject. Such fusion proteins may also be useful for the introduction of targeted mutations in plant cells, e.g., for the introduction of beneficial or agronomically valuable traits or alleles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The terms &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; &#x201c;peptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a polymer of amino acid residues linked together by peptide (amide) bonds. The terms refer to a protein, peptide, or polypeptide of any size, structure, or function. Typically, a protein, peptide, or polypeptide will be at least three amino acids long. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may refer to an individual protein or a collection of proteins. One or more of the amino acids in a protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be modified, for example, by the addition of a chemical entity such as a carbohydrate group, a hydroxyl group, a phosphate group, a farnesyl group, an isofarnesyl group, a fatty acid group, a linker for conjugation, functionalization, or other modification, etc. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may also be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be just a fragment of a naturally occurring protein or peptide. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be naturally occurring, recombinant, or synthetic, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Any of the proteins provided herein may be produced by any method known in the art. For example, the proteins provided herein may be produced via recombinant protein expression and purification, which is especially suited for fusion proteins comprising a peptide linker. Methods for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known, and include those described by Green and Sambrook, <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </i>(4th ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2012)), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II. Deaminases</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;deaminase&#x201d; refers to an enzyme that catalyzes a deamination reaction. The deaminases of the invention are nucleobase deaminases and the terms &#x201c;deaminase&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleobase deaminase&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. The deaminase may be a naturally-occurring deaminase enzyme or an active fragment or variant thereof. A deaminase may be active on single-stranded nucleic acids, such as ssDNA or ssRNA, or on double-stranded nucleic acids, such as dsDNA or dsRNA. In some embodiments, the deaminase is only capable of deaminating ssDNA and does not act on dsDNA.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The presently disclosed methods and compositions comprise an adenine deaminase. In some embodiments, the deaminase is an ADAT family deaminase or a variant thereof. Deamination of adenine, adenosine, or deoxyadenosine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases. To date there are no known naturally occurring adenine deaminases that deaminate adenine in DNA. Several methods have been employed to evolve and optimize adenine deaminase acting on tRNA (ADAT) proteins to be active on DNA molecules in mammalian cells (Gaudelli et al, 2017; Koblan, L. W. et al, 2018<i>, Nat Biotechnol </i>36, 843-846; Richter, M. F. et al, 2020<i>, Nat Biotechnol, doi:</i>10.1038/s41587-020-0562-8, each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein). One such method uses a bacterial selection assay where only cells with the ability to activate antibiotic resistance through A:T&#x3e;G:C conversions are able to survive.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention relates to novel adenine deaminase polypeptides which were produced through evolution and optimization of bacterial deaminases. Novel adenine deaminases are presently disclosed and set forth as SEQ ID NOs: 1-10 and 399-441. The deaminases of the invention may be used for editing of DNA or RNA molecules. In some embodiments, the deaminases of the invention may be used for editing of ssDNA or ssRNA molecules. The adenine deaminases described herein are useful as deaminases alone or as components in fusion proteins. A fusion protein comprising a DNA-targeting polypeptide and an adenine deaminase polypeptide is referred to herein as an &#x201c;A-based editor&#x201d;, &#x201c;adenine base editor&#x201d;, or an &#x201c;ABE&#x201d; and can be used for the targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x201c;Base editors&#x201d; are fusion proteins comprising a DNA-targeting polypeptide, such as an RGN, and a deaminase. Adenine base editors (ABEs) comprise a DNA-targeting protein, such as an RGN, and an adenine deaminase. ABEs function through the deamination of adenine into inosine on a DNA target molecule (Gaudelli, N. M. et al. 2017). Inosine is recognized as a guanine by polymerases and allows for the incorporation of a cytosine on the complementary DNA strand across from the inosine. After a round of replication post-deamination, there is a resulting A:T to G:C base pair change in the genome. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed adenine deaminases or active variants or fragments thereof introduce A&#x3e;N mutations in a DNA molecule, wherein N is C, G, or T. In further embodiments, they introduce A&#x3e;G mutations in a DNA molecule.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In those embodiments wherein the deaminase has been targeted to a specific region of a nucleic acid molecule via fusion with a DNA-binding polypeptide, the mutation rate of adenines within or adjacent to the target sequence to which the DNA-binding polypeptide binds can be measured using any method known in the art, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), or DNA sequencing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The presently disclosed novel deaminases or active variants or fragments thereof that retain deaminase activity may be introduced into the cell as part of a deaminase-DNA-binding polypeptide fusion, and/or may be co-expressed with a DNA-binding polypeptide-deaminase fusion, to increase the efficiency of introducing the desired A&#x3e;G mutation in a target DNA molecule. The presently disclosed deaminases have the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-10 and 399-441 or a variant or fragment thereof retaining deaminase activity. In some embodiments, the deaminase has an amino acid sequence having at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identity to the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-10 and 399-441. In particular embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 407, 405, 399, 1-10, 400-404, 406, and 408-441. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 407. For example, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least about 80% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 96% identity, at least about 97% identity, at least about 98% identity, at least about 99% identity, at least about 99.5% identity, or at least about 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 407. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% identity, at least 90% identity, at least 95% identity, at least 96% identity, at least 97% identity, at least 98% identity, at least 99% identity, at least 99.5% identity, or at least 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 407. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 407. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 399. For example, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least about 80% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 96% identity, at least about 97% identity, at least about 98% identity, at least about 99% identity, at least about 99.5% identity, or at least about 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 399. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% identity, at least 90% identity, at least 95% identity, at least 96% identity, at least 97% identity, at least 98% identity, at least 99% identity, at least 99.5% identity, or at least 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 399. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 399. In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 405. For example, the deaminase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least about 80% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 96% identity, at least about 97% identity, at least about 98% identity, at least about 99% identity, at least about 99.5% identity, or at least about 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 405.

In some embodiments, the deaminase comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 405.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Nucleic Acid Molecule-Binding Polypeptides</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some aspects of this disclosure provide fusion proteins that comprise a nucleic acid molecule-binding polypeptide and a deaminase polypeptide. While binding to and targeted editing of RNA molecules is contemplated by the present invention, in some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule-binding polypeptide of the fusion protein is a DNA-binding polypeptide. Such fusion proteins are useful for targeted editing of DNA in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo. These novel fusion proteins are active in mammalian cells and are useful for targeted editing of DNA molecules.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;fusion protein&#x201d; as used herein refers to a hybrid polypeptide which comprises protein domains from at least two different proteins. A fusion protein may comprise more than one different domain, for example, a DNA-binding domain and a deaminase. In some embodiments, a fusion protein is in a complex with, or is in association with, a nucleic acid, e.g., RNA.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed fusion proteins comprise a DNA-binding polypeptide. As used herein, the term &#x201c;DNA-binding polypeptide&#x201d; refers to any polypeptide which is capable of binding to DNA. In certain embodiments, the DNA-binding polypeptide portion of the presently disclosed fusion proteins binds to double-stranded DNA. In particular embodiments, the DNA-binding polypeptide binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;sequence-specific&#x201d; or &#x201c;sequence-specific manner&#x201d; refer to the selective interaction with a specific nucleotide sequence.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Two polynucleotide sequences can be considered to be substantially complementary when the two sequences hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Likewise, a DNA-binding polypeptide is considered to bind to a particular target sequence in a sequence-specific manner if the DNA-binding polypeptide binds to its sequence under stringent conditions. By &#x201c;stringent conditions&#x201d; or &#x201c;stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; is intended conditions under which the two polynucleotide sequences (or the polypeptide binds to its specific target sequence) will bind to each other to a detectably greater degree than to other sequences (e.g., at least 2-fold over background). Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the temperature is at least 30&#xb0; C. for short sequences (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least 60&#xb0; C. for long sequences (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 37&#xb0; C., and a wash in 1&#xd7; to 2&#xd7;SSC (20&#xd7;SSC=3.0 M NaCl/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55&#xb0; C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1.0 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37&#xb0; C., and a wash in 0.5&#xd7; to 1&#xd7;SSC at 55 to 60&#xb0; C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37&#xb0; C., and a wash in 0.1&#xd7;SSC at 60 to 65&#xb0; C. Optionally, wash buffers may comprise about 0.1% to about 1% SDS. Duration of hybridization is generally less than about 24 hours, usually about 4 to about 12 hours. The duration of the wash time will be at least a length of time sufficient to reach equilibrium.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched sequence. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl (1984) Anal. Biochem. 138:267-284: Tm=81.5&#xb0; C.+16.6 (log M)+0.41 (% GC)&#x2212;0.61 (% form)&#x2212;500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, % GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, or 4&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm). Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described.

If the guide RNA complexes with an RGN, the bound RGN introduces a single-stranded or double-stranded break at the target sequence. After the target sequence has been cleaved, the break can be repaired such that the DNA sequence of the target sequence is modified during the repair process. Provided herein are methods for using mutant variants of RNA-guided nucleases, which are either nuclease inactive or nickases, which are linked to deaminases to modify a target sequence in the DNA of host cells. The mutant variants of RNA-guided nucleases in which the nuclease activity is inactivated or significantly reduced may be referred to as RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptides, as the polypeptides are capable of binding to, but not necessarily cleaving, a target sequence. RNA-guided nucleases only capable of cleaving a single strand of a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule are referred to herein as nickases.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A target nucleotide sequence is bound by an RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptide and hybridizes with the guide RNA associated with the RGDBP.

A single guide RNA comprises the crRNA and optionally tracrRNA on a single molecule of RNA, whereas a dual-guide RNA system comprises a crRNA and a tracrRNA present on two distinct RNA molecules, hybridized to one another through at least a portion of the CRISPR repeat sequence of the crRNA and at least a portion of the tracrRNA, which may be fully or partially complementary to the CRISPR repeat sequence of the crRNA. In some of those embodiments wherein the guide RNA is a single guide RNA, the crRNA and optionally tracrRNA are separated by a linker nucleotide sequence.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In general, the linker nucleotide sequence is one that does not include complementary bases in order to avoid the formation of secondary structure within or comprising nucleotides of the linker nucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, the linker nucleotide sequence between the crRNA and tracrRNA is at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, or more nucleotides in length. In particular embodiments, the linker nucleotide sequence between the crRNA and tracrRNA is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more nucleotides in length.

The guide RNA can be transcribed in vitro or chemically synthesized. In some embodiments, a nucleotide sequence encoding the guide RNA is introduced into the cell, organelle, or embryo. In some embodiments, the nucleotide sequence encoding the guide RNA is operably linked to a promoter (e.g., an RNA polymerase III promoter). The promoter can be a native promoter or heterologous to the guide RNA-encoding nucleotide sequence.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In various embodiments, the guide RNA can be introduced into a target cell, organelle, or embryo as a ribonucleoprotein complex, as described herein, wherein the guide RNA is bound to an RNA-guided nuclease polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The guide RNA directs an associated RNA-guided nuclease to a particular target nucleotide sequence of interest through hybridization of the guide RNA to the target nucleotide sequence. A target nucleotide sequence can comprise DNA, RNA, or a combination of both and can be single-stranded or double-stranded. A target nucleotide sequence can be genomic DNA (i.e., chromosomal DNA), plasmid DNA, or an RNA molecule (e.g., messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, micro RNA, small interfering RNA). The target nucleotide sequence can be bound (and in some embodiments, cleaved) by an RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptide in vitro or in a cell. The chromosomal sequence targeted by the RGDBP can be a nuclear, plastid or mitochondrial chromosomal sequence. In some embodiments, the target nucleotide sequence is unique in the target genome.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the target nucleotide sequence is adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

In particular embodiments, a PAM is within 1 to 10 nucleotides from the target nucleotide sequence, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides from the target nucleotide sequence. The PAM can be 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; of the target sequence. In some embodiments, the PAM is 3&#x2032; of the target sequence.

Upon recognizing its corresponding PAM sequence, the RGN can cleave the target nucleotide sequence at a specific cleavage site. As used herein, a cleavage site is made up of the two particular nucleotides within a target nucleotide sequence between which the nucleotide sequence is cleaved by an RGN. The cleavage site can comprise the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2<sup>nd </sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup>, 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th </sup>and 5<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th </sup>and 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th </sup>and 8<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th </sup>and 9<sup>th </sup>nucleotides from the PAM in either the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; direction. As RGNs can cleave a target nucleotide sequence resulting in staggered ends, in some embodiments, the cleavage site is defined based on the distance of the two nucleotides from the PAM on the positive (+) strand of the polynucleotide and the distance of the two nucleotides from the PAM on the negative (&#x2212;) strand of the polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">RGDBPs and RGNs can be used to deliver a fused polypeptide, polynucleotide, or small molecule payload to a particular genomic location.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In those embodiments wherein the DNA-binding polypeptide comprises a meganuclease, a target sequence can comprise a pair of inverted, 9 basepair &#x201c;half sites&#x201d; which are separated by four basepairs. In the case of a single-chain meganuclease, the N-terminal domain of the protein contacts a first half-site and the C-terminal domain of the protein contacts a second half-site. Cleavage by a meganuclease produces four basepair 3&#x2032; overhangs. In those embodiments wherein the DNA-binding polypeptide comprises a compact TALEN, the recognition sequence comprises a first CNNNGN sequence that is recognized by the I-TevI domain, followed by a non-specific spacer 4-16 basepairs in length, followed by a second sequence 16-22 bp in length that is recognized by the TAL-effector domain (this sequence typically has a 5&#x2032; T base). In those embodiments wherein the DNA-binding polypeptide comprises a zinc finger, the DNA binding domains typically recognize an 18-bp recognition sequence comprising a pair of nine basepair &#x201c;half-sites&#x201d; separated by 2-10 basepairs and cleavage by the nuclease creates a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang of variable length (frequently four basepairs).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV. Fusion Proteins</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, a DNA-binding polypeptide (e.g., nuclease-inactive or a nickase RGN) is operably linked to a deaminase of the invention. In some embodiments, a DNA-binding polypeptide (e.g., nuclease inactive RGN or nickase RGN) fused to a deaminase of the invention can be targeted to a particular location of a nucleic acid molecule (i.e., target nucleic acid molecule), which in some embodiments is a particular genomic locus, to alter the expression of a desired sequence. In some embodiments, the binding of a fusion protein to a target sequence results in deamination of a nucleobase, resulting in conversion from one nucleobase to another. In some embodiments, the binding of this fusion protein to a target sequence results in deamination of a nucleobase adjacent to the target sequence. The nucleobase adjacent to the target sequence that is deaminated and mutated using the presently disclosed compositions and methods may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 base pairs from the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the target sequence (bound by the gRNA) within the target nucleic acid molecule.

The linker between the deaminase and DNA-binding polypeptide (e.g., RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptide) can determine the editing window of the fusion protein, thereby increasing deaminase specificity and reducing off-target mutations. Various linker lengths and flexibilities can be employed, ranging from very flexible linkers of the form (GGGGS)<sub>n </sub>and (G), to more rigid linkers of the form (EAAAK)<sub>n </sub>and (XP)<sub>n</sub>, to achieve the optimal length and rigidity for deaminase activity for the specific applications. The term &#x201c;linker,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a chemical group or a molecule linking two molecules or moieties, e.g., a binding domain and a cleavage domain of a nuclease. In some embodiments, a linker joins an RNA guided nuclease and a deaminase. In some embodiments, a linker joins a dead or inactive RGN and a deaminase. In further embodiments, a linker joins two deaminases. Typically, the linker is positioned between, or flanked by, two groups, molecules, or other moieties and connected to each one via a covalent bond, thus connecting the two. In some embodiments, the linker is an amino acid or a plurality of amino acids (e.g., a peptide or protein).

The nucleic acid molecule may encode a fusion protein, where the encoded deaminase is operably linked to a DNA-binding polypeptide, and optionally a second deaminase. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule encodes a fusion protein, where the encoded deaminase is operably linked to an RGN and optionally a second deaminase.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide which encodes a deaminase of the invention are codon optimized for expression in an organism of interest. A &#x201c;codon-optimized&#x201d; coding sequence is a polynucleotide coding sequence having its frequency of codon usage designed to mimic the frequency of preferred codon usage or transcription conditions of a particular host cell. Expression in the particular host cell or organism is enhanced as a result of the alteration of one or more codons at the nucleic acid level such that the translated amino acid sequence is not changed. Nucleic acid molecules can be codon optimized, either wholly or in part. Codon tables and other references providing preference information for a wide range of organisms are available in the art (see, e.g., Campbell and Gowri (1990) <i>Plant Physiol. </i>92:1-11 for a discussion of plant-preferred codon usage). Methods are available in the art for synthesizing plant-preferred genes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,380,831, and 5,436,391, and Murray et al.

The cassette may additionally contain at least one additional gene or genetic element to be cotransformed into the organism. Where additional genes or elements are included, the components are operably linked. The term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; is intended to mean a functional linkage between two or more elements. For example, an operable linkage between a promoter and a coding region of interest (e.g., a region coding for a deaminase, RNA-guided DNA-binding polypeptide, and/or gRNA) is a functional link that allows for expression of the coding region of interest. Operably linked elements may be contiguous or non-contiguous. When used to refer to the joining of two protein coding regions, by operably linked is intended that the coding regions are in the same reading frame. In some embodiments, the additional gene(s) or element(s) are provided on multiple expression cassettes. For example, the nucleotide sequence encoding a presently disclosed deaminase, either alone or as a component of a fusion protein, can be present on one expression cassette, whereas the nucleotide sequence encoding a gRNA can be on a separate expression cassette. Another example may have the nucleotide sequence encoding a presently disclosed deaminase alone on a first expression cassette, a second expression cassette encoding a fusion protein comprising a deaminase, and a nucleotide sequence encoding a gRNA on third expression cassette. Such an expression cassette is provided with a plurality of restriction sites and/or recombination sites for insertion of the polynucleotides to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. Expression cassettes which comprise a selectable marker gene may also be present.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The expression cassette may include in the 5&#x2032;-3&#x2032; direction of transcription, a transcriptional (and, in some embodiments, translational) initiation region (i.e., a promoter), a deaminase-encoding polynucleotide of the invention, and a transcriptional (and in some embodiments, translational) termination region (i.e., termination region) functional in the organism of interest. The promoters of the invention are capable of directing or driving expression of a coding sequence in a host cell. The regulatory regions (e.g., promoters, transcriptional regulatory regions, and translational termination regions) may be endogenous or heterologous to the host cell or to each other. As used herein, &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; in reference to a sequence is a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention.

Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immuno deficiency virus (SIV), human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., <i>J. Virol. </i>66:2731-2739 (1992); Johann et al., <i>J. Virol. </i>66:1635-1640 (1992); Sommnerfelt et al., <i>Virol. </i>176:58-59 (1990); Wilson et al., <i>J.

Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus (&#x201c;AAV&#x201d;) vectors may also be used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures (see, e.g., West et al., <i>Virology </i>160:38-47 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368; WO 93/24641; Katin, <i>Human Gene Therapy </i>5:793-801 (1994); <i>Muzyczka, J. Clin. Invest. </i>94:1351 (1994).

Virol. </i>63:03822-3828 (1989). Packaging cells are typically used to form virus particles that are capable of infecting a host cell. Such cells include 293 cells, which package adenovirus, and &#x3c8;J2 cells or PA317 cells, which package retrovirus.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Viral vectors used in gene therapy are usually generated by producing a cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a viral particle. The vectors typically contain the minimal viral sequences required for packaging and subsequent integration into a host, other viral sequences being replaced by an expression cassette for the polynucleotide(s) to be expressed. The missing viral functions are typically supplied in trans by the packaging cell line. For example, AAV vectors used in gene therapy typically only possess ITR sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and integration into the host genome. Viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but lacking ITR sequences.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The cell line may also be infected with adenovirus as a helper. The helper virus promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes from the helper plasmid. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by, e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV.

For polynucleotides, conservative variants include those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the native amino acid sequence of the gene of interest. Naturally occurring allelic variants such as these can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined below.

With such a procedure, one or more different deaminases disclosed herein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1-10 and 399-441) is manipulated to create a new adenine deaminase possessing the desired properties. In this manner, libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of related sequence polynucleotides comprising sequence regions that have substantial sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. For example, using this approach, sequence motifs encoding a domain of interest may be shuffled between the deaminase sequences provided herein and other subsequently identified deaminase genes to obtain a new gene coding for a protein with an improved property of interest, such as an increased K<sub>m </sub>in the case of an enzyme. Strategies for such DNA shuffling are known in the art. See, for example, Stemmer (1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>91:10747-10751; Stemmer (1994) <i>Nature </i>370:389-391; Crameri et al.

(1998) <i>Nature </i>391:288-291; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793 and 5,837,458. A &#x201c;shuffled&#x201d; nucleic acid is a nucleic acid produced by a shuffling procedure such as any shuffling procedure set forth herein. Shuffled nucleic acids are produced by recombining (physically or virtually) two or more nucleic acids (or character strings), for example in an artificial, and optionally recursive, fashion. Generally, one or more screening steps are used in shuffling processes to identify nucleic acids of interest; this screening step can be performed before or after any recombination step. In some (but not all) shuffling embodiments, it is desirable to perform multiple rounds of recombination prior to selection to increase the diversity of the pool to be screened. The overall process of recombination and selection are optionally repeated recursively. Depending on context, shuffling can refer to an overall process of recombination and selection, or, alternately, can simply refer to the recombinational portions of the overall process.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As used herein, &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; in the context of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have &#x201c;sequence similarity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity&#x201d;. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically, this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">As used herein, &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity&#x201d; means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Unless otherwise stated, sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight of 3, and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and % similarity for an amino acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. By &#x201c;equivalent program&#x201d; is intended any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by GAP Version 10.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Two sequences are &#x201c;optimally aligned&#x201d; when they are aligned for similarity scoring using a defined amino acid substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM62), gap existence penalty and gap extension penalty so as to arrive at the highest score possible for that pair of sequences. Amino acid substitution matrices and their use in quantifying the similarity between two sequences are well-known in the art and described, e.g., in Dayhoff et al. (1978) &#x201c;A model of evolutionary change in proteins.&#x201d; In &#x201c;Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure,&#x201d; Vol. 5, Suppl. 3 (ed. M. O. Dayhoff), pp. 345-352. Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C. and Henikoff et al. (1992) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:10915-10919. The BLOSUM62 matrix is often used as a default scoring substitution matrix in sequence alignment protocols. The gap existence penalty is imposed for the introduction of a single amino acid gap in one of the aligned sequences, and the gap extension penalty is imposed for each additional empty amino acid position inserted into an already opened gap. The alignment is defined by the amino acids positions of each sequence at which the alignment begins and ends, and optionally by the insertion of a gap or multiple gaps in one or both sequences, so as to arrive at the highest possible score. While optimal alignment and scoring can be accomplished manually, the process is facilitated by the use of a computer-implemented alignment algorithm, e.g., gapped BLAST 2.0, described in Altschul et al. (1997) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>25:3389-3402, and made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Optimal alignments, including multiple alignments, can be prepared using, e.g., PSI-BLAST, available through www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and described by Altschul et al. (1997) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>25:3389-3402.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">With respect to an amino acid sequence that is optimally aligned with a reference sequence, an amino acid residue &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; the position in the reference sequence with which the residue is paired in the alignment. The &#x201c;position&#x201d; is denoted by a number that sequentially identifies each amino acid in the reference sequence based on its position relative to the N-terminus. Owing to deletions, insertion, truncations, fusions, etc., that must be taken into account when determining an optimal alignment, in general the amino acid residue number in a test sequence as determined by simply counting from the N-terminal will not necessarily be the same as the number of its corresponding position in the reference sequence. For example, in a case where there is a deletion in an aligned test sequence, there will be no amino acid that corresponds to a position in the reference sequence at the site of deletion. Where there is an insertion in an aligned reference sequence, that insertion will not correspond to any amino acid position in the reference sequence. In the case of truncations or fusions there can be stretches of amino acids in either the reference or aligned sequence that do not correspond to any amino acid in the corresponding sequence.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">VII.

The target sequence can subsequently be modified via the deaminase domain of the fusion protein. In some embodiments, the binding of this fusion protein to a target sequence results in modification of a nucleotide adjacent to the target sequence. The nucleobase adjacent to the target sequence that is modified by the deaminase may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 base pairs from the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the target sequence.

Likewise, methods to measure cleavage or modification of a target sequence are known in the art and include in vitro or in vivo cleavage assays wherein cleavage is confirmed using PCR, sequencing, or gel electrophoresis, with or without the attachment of an appropriate label (e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent substance) to the target sequence to facilitate detection of degradation products. In some embodiments, the nicking triggered exponential amplification reaction (NTEXPAR) assay is used (see, e.g., Zhang et al. (2016) <i>Chem. Sci. </i>7:4951-4957).

For example, an RGN nickase that only cleaves the positive (+) strand of a double-stranded polynucleotide can be introduced along with a second RGN nickase that only cleaves the negative (&#x2212;) strand of a double-stranded polynucleotide. In some embodiments, two different fusion proteins are provided, where each fusion protein comprises a different RGN with a different PAM recognition sequence, so that a greater diversity of nucleotide sequences may be targeted for mutation.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any of the presently disclosed methods can be used to target a single target sequence or multiple target sequences.

The deaminase domain of the fusion protein would then introduce mutations at each of the targeted sequences. Also encompassed herein are methods wherein multiple, distinct guide RNAs are introduced in combination with multiple, distinct RNA-guided, DNA binding polypeptides. Such RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptides may be multiple RGN or RGN variants.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Treatment</heading><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Methods of treating a disease in a subject in need thereof are provided herein. The methods comprise administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a presently disclosed fusion protein or a polynucleotide encoding the same, a presently disclosed gRNA or a polynucleotide encoding the same, a presently disclosed fusion protein system, a presently disclosed ribonucleoprotein complex, or a cell modified by or comprising any one of these compositions.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In some embodiments, the treatment comprises in vivo gene editing by administering to a subject in need thereof a presently disclosed fusion protein, gRNA, or a presently disclosed fusion protein system or polynucleotide(s) encoding the same. In some embodiments, the treatment comprises ex vivo gene editing wherein cells are genetically modified ex vivo with a presently disclosed fusion protein, gRNA, or a presently disclosed fusion protein system or polynucleotide(s) encoding the same and then the modified cells are administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the genetically modified cells originate from the subject that is then administered the modified cells, and the transplanted cells are referred to herein as autologous. In some embodiments, the genetically modified cells originate from a different subject (i.e., donor) within the same species as the subject that is administered the modified cells (i.e., recipient), and the transplanted cells are referred to herein as allogeneic. In some examples described herein, the cells can be expanded in culture prior to administration to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, in some embodiments, a method is provided that comprises administering to a subject having such a disease, e.g., a genetic defect associated with the CFTR gene, an effective amount of ribonucleoprotein complex comprising a fusion protein with a deaminase having an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to sequence set forth in any one of the SEQ ID NOs: 399, and 405-407. In the embodiments described herein, the administration of the ribonucleoprotein complex corrects the point mutation or introduces a deactivating mutation into a disease-associated CFTR gene. Other diseases that can be treated by correcting a point mutation or introducing a deactivating mutation into a disease-associated gene will be known to those of skill in the art, and the disclosure is not limited in this respect.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In some embodiments, the disease to be treated with the presently disclosed compositions is one that can be treated with immunotherapy, such as with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell. Such diseases include but are not limited to cancer.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In some embodiments, the deamination of the target nucleobase results in the correction of a genetic defect, e.g., to correct the CFTR gene, or in the correction of a point mutation that leads to a loss of function in a gene product. In some embodiments, the genetic defect is associated with a disease or disorder, e.g., a lysosomal storage disorder or a metabolic disease, such as, for example, type I diabetes. Thus, in some embodiments, the disease to be treated with the presently disclosed compositions is associated with a sequence (i.e., the sequence is causal for the disease or disorder or causal for symptoms associated with the disease or disorder) that is mutated in order to treat the disease or disorder or the reduction of symptoms associated with the disease or disorder.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In some embodiments, the disease to be treated with the presently disclosed compositions is associated with a causal mutation. As used herein, a &#x201c;causal mutation&#x201d; refers to a particular nucleotide, nucleotides, or nucleotide sequence in the genome that contributes to the severity or presence of a disease or disorder in a subject. The correction of the causal mutation leads to the improvement of at least one symptom resulting from a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the correction of the causal mutation leads to the improvement of at least one symptom resulting from a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the causal mutation is adjacent to a PAM site recognized by the RGDBP (e.g., RGN) fused to a deaminase disclosed herein. The causal mutation can be corrected with a fusion polypeptide comprising a RGDBP (e.g., RGN) and a presently disclosed deaminase. Non-limiting examples of diseases associated with a causal mutation include cystic fibrosis, Hurler syndrome, Friedreich's Ataxia, Huntington's Disease, and sickle cell disease. Additional non-limiting examples of disease-associated genes and mutations are available from McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.), available on the World Wide Web.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments, the methods provided herein are used to introduce a deactivating point mutation into a gene or allele that encodes a gene product that is associated with a disease or disorder. For example, in some embodiments, methods are provided herein that employ a fusion protein to introduce a deactivating point mutation into an oncogene (e.g., in the treatment of a proliferative disease). A deactivating mutation may, in some embodiments, generate a premature stop codon in a coding sequence, which results in the expression of a truncated gene product, e.g., a truncated protein lacking the function of the full-length protein. In some embodiments, the purpose of the methods provided herein is to restore the function of a dysfunctional gene via genome editing. The fusion proteins provided herein can be validated for gene editing-based human therapeutics in vitro, e.g., by correcting a disease associated mutation in human cell culture. It will be understood by the skilled artisan that the fusion proteins provided herein, e.g., the fusion proteins comprising an RNA-guided, DNA-binding polypeptide and deaminase polypeptide can be used to correct any single point G&#x3e;A mutation. Deamination of the mutant A to G leads to a correction of the mutation.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">As used herein, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; or &#x201c;palliating&#x201d; or &#x201c;ameliorating&#x201d; are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant any therapeutically relevant improvement in or effect on one or more diseases, conditions, or symptoms under treatment. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a subject at risk of developing a particular disease, condition, or symptom, or to a subject reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though the disease, condition, or symptom may not have yet been manifested. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered after one or more symptoms have developed and/or after a disease has been diagnosed. In particular embodiments, treatment may be administered in the absence of symptoms, e.g., to prevent or delay onset of a symptom or inhibit onset or progression of a disease. For example, treatment may be administered to a susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example, to prevent or delay their prevention or recurrence.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to the amount of an agent that is sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon one or more of: the subject and disease condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The specific dose may vary depending on one or more of: the particular agent chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, and the delivery system in which it is carried.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">The term &#x201c;administering&#x201d; refers to the placement of an active ingredient into a subject, by a method or route that results in at least partial localization of the introduced active ingredient at a desired site, such as a site of injury or repair, such that a desired effect(s) is produced.

Viral vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding the fusion proteins, ribonucleoprotein complexes, or vectors disclosed herein may be administered directly to patients (i.e., in vivo) or they may be used to treat cells in vitro, and the modified cells may optionally be administered to patients (i.e., ex vivo). Conventional viral based systems may include, without limitation, retroviral, lentivirus, adenoviral, adeno-associated and herpes simplex virus vectors for gene transfer. Integration in the host genome is possible with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, often resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. In applications where transient expression is preferred, adenoviral based systems may be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">In some embodiments, the administering comprises administering by electroporation.

Efficacy can also be measured by failure of an individual to worsen as assessed by hospitalization or need for medical interventions (e.g., progression of the disease is halted or at least slowed). Methods of measuring these indicators are known to those of skill in the art. Treatment includes: (1) inhibiting the disease, e.g., arresting, or slowing the progression of symptoms; or (2) relieving the disease, e.g., causing regression of symptoms; and (3) preventing or reducing the likelihood of the development of symptoms.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the presently disclosed RGN polypeptides or polynucleotides encoding the same, the presently disclosed gRNAs or polynucleotides encoding the same, the presently disclosed deaminases or polynucleotides encoding the same, the presently disclosed fusion proteins, the presently disclosed systems (such as those comprising a fusion protein), the presently disclosed ribonucleoprotein complex or cells comprising any of the RGN polypeptides or RGN-encoding polynucleotides, gRNA or gRNA-encoding polynucleotides, fusion protein-encoding polynucleotides, or the systems, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are provided.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">As used herein, a &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; refers to a material that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the activity and properties of the active ingredient (e.g., a deaminase or fusion protein or nucleic acid molecule encoding the same). Carriers must be of sufficiently high purity and of sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration to a subject being treated. The carrier can be inert, or it can possess pharmaceutical benefits. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier that is non-naturally occurring.

A multitude of appropriate formulations are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed. 2005). Non-limiting examples include a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Administered intravenously, particular carriers are physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use may be prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. These compositions also may contain adjuvants including preservative agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It also may be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">In some embodiments wherein cells comprising or modified with the presently disclosed RGNs, gRNAs, deaminases, fusion proteins, systems (including those comprising fusion proteins) or polynucleotides encoding the same are administered to a subject, the cells are administered as a suspension with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene (set forth as SEQ ID NO: 51). CFTR encodes for a cAMP regulated chloride channel located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells that catalyze the passage of small ions through the membrane. Dysregulation of this mechanism causes an impairment of salt and fluid homeostasis that results in multiorgan dysfunctions and ultimately mortality from respiratory failure.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Almost 2,000 mutations in the CFTR gene have been found to cause CF. CFTR mutations are divided into six classes based on the functional defect in either CFTR protein synthesis, trafficking, function, or stability, although it is acknowledged that many CFTR mutants present multiple defects. Class I mutations lead to severely defective protein production. They are primarily nonsense or frameshift mutations which introduce a premature termination codon (PTC), leading to unstable messenger RNA (mRNA) degraded by the mRNA decay pathway (NMD). Nonsense mutations due to single nucleotide changes comprise a major subset of Class I mutations (Marangi, M. and Pistritto, G, 2018<i>, Front Pharmacol </i>9, 396, doi:10.3389/fphar.2018.00396; Pranke, I., et al., 2019<i>, Front Pharmacol </i>10, 121, doi:10.3389/fphar.2019.00121, both of which are incorporated by reference herein). Treatment for patients with Class I cystic fibrosis can be difficult, as no functional CFTR protein is produced. Notably, a significant fraction of these nonsense mutations are potentially addressable with A to G base editors (Geurts, M. H. et al, 2020<i>, Cell Stem Cell </i>26, 503-510 e507, doi:10.1016/j.stem.2020.01.019 incorporated by reference herein).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Geurts et al. were the first group to perform precise base editing in cultured lung epithelial cells with Class I mutations from cystic fibrosis patients, using a fusion protein comprising an adenine deaminase operably linked an RGN, namely either SpyCas9 or the xSpyCas9 variant. SpyCas9 recognizes a 5&#x2032;-nGG-3&#x2032;PAM, while the xSpyCas9 variant recognized the reduced 5&#x2032;-nG-3&#x2032;. The authors state that a major limitation of the base editing technology is the PAM requirement of the Cas protein being used. They find that the majority of nonsense mutations identified in the CFTR gene are not in the required targeting window for a fusion protein comprising the RGN SpyCas9. The PAM is a short motif, generally one to four nucleotides, on the target DNA sequence that is recognized by the RGN. The PAM sequence is intrinsic to each RGN protein, such that an RGN can only access the genomic space around a suitable PAM. Additionally, the base editing window for base editors is limited, frequently to just a portion of the nucleotides in the target sequence. If the nucleotide of interest is too close to the PAM, the RGN blocks access to the nucleotide. If the nucleotide is too far away from the PAM, the deaminase tethered to the RGN is unable to reach the nucleotide. Also, the amount of ssDNA exposed by the R-loop limits the accessibility of the deaminases. The present invention includes RGN-deaminase fusion proteins where the RGN recognizes a PAM which is proximal to a Class I mutation of the CFTR gene and the deaminase is able to successfully modify the targeted causal mutation.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Another limitation to RGN-deaminase fusion proteins known in the art is that the vector construct encoding for the fusion protein is too large for methods of in vivo delivery. AAV delivery of these fusion proteins is not an option for SpyCas9-based fusion proteins because their size exceeds the limit for efficient AAV packaging. The RGN component of the fusion proteins described herein are smaller in size and are therefore viable candidates for AAV vector delivery strategies. The present invention also discloses guide RNAs which are specific for the RGNs described herein and which guide the fusion proteins of the invention to target sites of nonsense mutations in the CFTR gene which were previously unreachable. The present invention also teaches methods of using said fusion proteins for targeted base editing through in vivo AAV vector delivery.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Ideally, the coding sequence of an RGN-deaminase fusion protein of the invention and a corresponding guide RNA for targeting the fusion protein to the CFTR gene may all be packaged into a single AAV vector. The generally accepted size limit for AAV vectors is 4.7 kb, although larger sizes may be contemplated at the expense of reduced packing efficiency. The RGN nickases in Table 28 have a coding sequence length of about 3.15-3.45 kB. To ensure that the expression cassettes for both the fusion protein and its corresponding guide RNA could fit into an AAV vector, novel, active deletion variants of RGNs are described herein. In addition to shortening the amino acid sequence and therefore the coding sequence of the RGN of the fusion protein, the peptide linker which links the RGN and the deaminase may also be shortened. Finally, the genetic elements, such as the promoters, enhancers, and/or terminators, may also be engineered via deletion analysis to determine the minimal size required for each to be functional.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Some embodiments of the disclosure provide methods for editing a nucleic acid using the deaminases or the RGN complexes described herein to achieve the nucleobase change, e.g., an A:T base pair to G:C base pair. In some embodiments, the method is a method for editing a nucleobase of a nucleic acid (e.g., a base pair of a double-stranded DNA sequence). In some embodiments, the deaminases or the RGN complexes described herein are used to introduce a point mutation into a nucleic acid by deaminating and excising a target &#x201c;A&#x201d; nucleobase.

Cells were then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 72 h. Following incubation, genomic DNA was then extracted using NucleoSpin 96 Tissue (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's protocol. The genomic region flanking the targeted genomic site was PCR amplified using the primers in Table 2 and products were purified using ZR-96 DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's protocol. The purified PCR products underwent Next Generation Sequencing on Illumina MiSeq. Typically, 100,000 of 250 bp paired-end reads (2&#xd7;100,000 reads) are generated per amplicon. The reads were analyzed using CRISPResso (Pinello, et al. 2016 <i>Nature Biotech, </i>34:695-697) to calculate the rates of editing. Output alignments were analyzed for INDEL formation or introduction of specific adenine mutations. Tables 3 through 7 show adenine base editing for each fusion protein comprising nAPG07433.1 and a deaminase from Table 1 and a guide RNA from Table 2. The deaminase component of each fusion protein is indicated. The editing rate for adenines within or proximal to the target sequence is indicated. &#x201c;A5&#x201d; indicates, for example, an adenine at position 5 of the target sequence. The position of each nucleotide in the target sequence was determined by numbering the first nucleotide in the target sequence closest to the PAM as position 1, and the position number increases in the 3&#x2032; direction away from the PAM sequence. The tables also show which nucleotide the adenine was changed to, and at what rate. For example, Table 3 shows that for the APG09982-nAPG07433.1 fusion protein, the adenine at position 13 was mutated to a guanine at a rate of 1.2%.</p><p id="p-0738" num="0000"><tables

Cells were then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 72 h. Following incubation, genomic DNA was then extracted using NucleoSpin 96 Tissue (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's protocol. The genomic region flanking the targeted genomic site was PCR amplified using the primers in Table 11 and products were purified using ZR-96 DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's protocol. The purified PCR products underwent Next Generation Sequencing on Illumina MiSeq. Typically, 100,000 of 250 bp paired-end reads (2&#xd7;100,000 reads) are generated per amplicon. The reads were analyzed using CRISPResso (Pinello, et al. 2016 Nature Biotech, 34:695-697) to calculate the rates of editing. Output alignments were analyzed for INDEL formation or introduction of specific adenine mutations.</p><p id="p-0762" num="0764">Table 12 shows all of the adenine base editing for each adenine deaminase fusion in Table 10 and a guide RNA from Table 12. Tables 13-27 show the specific nucleotide mutation profile for select exemplary samples. The editing rate for adenines within or proximal to the target sequence is indicated. &#x201c;A5&#x201d; indicates, for example, an adenine at position 5 of the target sequence. The position of each nucleotide in the target sequence was determined by numbering the first nucleotide in the target sequence closest to the PAM (which is 3&#x2032; of the target for APG07433.1) as position 1, and the position number increases in the 5&#x2032; direction away from the PAM sequence. The tables also show which nucleotide the adenine was changed to, and at what rate. For example, Table 13 shows that for the LPG50148-nAPG07433.1 fusion protein, the adenine at position 13 was mutated to a guanine at a rate of 9.7%.</p><p id="p-0763" num="0000"><tables

Six of the most common nonsense mutations are G542X, W1282X, R553X, R1162X, E60X, R785X, and Q493X. Each of these stop mutations could be edited to restore a coding codon by an RGN-deaminase fusion protein described herein. To target each mutation, the following must be determined: 1) an RGN which has a PAM recognition site proximal to the nonsense mutation; and 2) a guide RNA which optimally targets the RGN-deaminase fusion protein to the target DNA. Table 30 below shows nickase variants of RGNs which possess PAMs that are proximal to each of the six nonsense mutations and the number of guide RNAs which can be used for each RGN. Table 31 describes the genetic loci for each guide RNA. The PAM recognition site for each genetic locus is underlined. The target sequence for the guide RNA and the guide RNA sequence itself are also indicated.</p><p id="p-0801" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00030" num="00030"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

id="p-0803" num="0785">Table 28 in Example 3 provides editing data for the SGN001101 sgRNA targeting CFTR.</p><p id="p-0804" num="0786">To assay for activity of the other guide RNAs, a guide RNA of Table 31 is provided with the corresponding nickase variant of each RGN described in Table 30, which is operably linked to a deaminase of the invention to produce a fusion protein. It is recognized that nuclease inactive variants of each RGN may be tested similarly as well. Each guide and fusion protein combination is assayed for the ability to edit at the target location in 16HBE14o&#x2212; immortalized bronchial epithelial cells. Currently, three HBE cell lines containing the CFTR nonsense mutations are available (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Lexington, Mass.). These cell lines are used to assay the G542X, W1282X, and R1162X nonsense mutation targets and compared to the 16HBE14o&#x2212; line. The fusion protein and guide RNA is delivered to the cells as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which are nucleofected into the 16HBE14o&#x2212; cell line following culturing and transformation methods provided in Valley et al (Valley et al, 2019<i>. J Cyst Fibros </i>18, 476-483, incorporated by reference herein). The guide RNA is provided as a single guide RNA or as a 1:1 or 1:1.2 molar ratio of tracrRNA:crRNA duplex with RGN proteins. Nucleofection of RNPs into cells is performed on a Lonza 4D-Nucleofector. Cells are then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 72 h. In some embodiments, the fusion protein and gRNA are delivered to the cells as RNA molecules, with the fusion protein encoded in an mRNA.</p><p id="p-0805" num="0787">Because there are no cell lines available for the E60X, R553X, and Q493X, these mutations are assayed in HEK293 cells using a modification of the GFP restoration assay described in Example 2, where the mutant locus containing the nonsense mutation is cloned into the GFP reading frame 2.</p><p id="p-0806" num="0788">Following incubation, genomic DNA is then extracted using NucleoSpin 96 Tissue (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's protocol. The genomic region flanking the targeted genomic site is PCR amplified and products are purified using ZR-96 DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's protocol. The purified PCR products are then sent for Next Generation Sequencing on Illumina MiSeq. Typically, 100,000 of 250 bp paired-end reads (2&#xd7;100,000 reads) are generated per amplicon. The reads are analyzed using CRISPResso (Pinello, et al. 2016) to calculate the rates of editing. Output alignments are hand-curated to confirm introduction of the base-edited mutations of interest and also to screen for undesirable INDEL formation.</p><p id="p-0807" num="0789">In addition to efficiency of base editing, the protein product of the base-edited CFTR gene is evaluated for function. For two of the nonsense mutations, Glu60X and Gly542X, the base edited change of adenine to guanine does not restore the wildtype sequence, as these mutations are caused by guanine to thymine transversions. The targeted activity of the fusion protein changes the Glu60X to Glu60Gln and Gly452X to Gly542Arg. While these mutations do allow for a full-length protein to be made, the stability and functionality of the CFTR protein is also confirmed.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 4.2: Engineering RGNs for Decreased Size</heading><p id="p-0808" num="0790">Ideally, the coding sequence of an RGN-deaminase fusion protein of the invention and a corresponding guide RNA for targeting the fusion protein to the CFTR gene is all packaged into a single AAV vector. The generally accepted size limit for AAV vectors is 4.7 kb, although larger sizes may be contemplated at the expense of reduced packing efficiency. The RGN nickases in Table 30 have a coding sequence length of about 3.15-3.45 kB. To ensure that the expression cassettes for both the fusion protein and its corresponding guide RNA could fit into an AAV vector, shortening the length of RGN amino acid and its corresponding nucleic acid coding sequence is desirable.</p><p id="p-0809" num="0791">Through alignment with closely related homologs, a unique 8 amino acid region at positions 590-597 was identified in APG07433.1 and its close homolog APG08290.1 (described in WO 2019/236566 and set forth herein as SEQ ID NO: 60).

The linker of SEQ ID NO: 45 is 16 amino acids in length; this size may be reduced to reduce the size of the coding sequence of the fusion protein. Peptide linkers of less than 16 amino acids can be produced and operably link RGNs APG07433.1-del or APG08290.1-del and a deaminase of the invention and tested for base editing activity using methods similar to Example 1. Because the peptide linker between the RGN and the deaminase can determine the editing window of the fusion protein, testing of alternative linkers with different lengths and rigidity may also lead to improvements in editing efficiency while reducing off-target mutations. Therefore, fusion proteins with the highest editing rate are then assayed following methods similar to Example 4.1 to determine editing efficiency for each of the CFTR target sequences. Fusion protein-gRNA combinations with the highest editing efficiency are selected as the preferred guide for editing at that location and are used for AAV vector design.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 4.3: AAV Delivery</heading><p id="p-0816" num="0796">The coding sequences for validated fusion protein/gRNA combinations with the highest editing rate are packaged into AAV vectors. AAV delivery has a number of benefits including a lack of pathogenicity, low immunogenicity, high transduction rates, and a defined path to manufacturing. Also, AAV dosing of the lungs has been shown to be safe and at least to some degree, efficacious with both single and repeat dosing (Guggino et al., 2017<i>, Expert Opin Biol Ther </i>17, 1265-1273). After a fusion protein/gRNA combination has been cloned into an AAV vector, it may be packaged into several different serotypes to optimize tissue specific infectivity. For treatment of CF, the target for base editing is progenitor apical epithelium cells of the lungs, which will allow the correction to persist throughout cell turnover. To target respiratory epithelium, the capsid for serotypes AAV1, AAV5 or AAV6 are utilized, as these serotypes have been shown to have high infectivity in respiratory epithelium cells (Zabner et al., 2000<i>, J Virol </i>74, 3852-3858).</p><p id="p-0817" num="0797">Once the AAV vectors are produced, they are transduced into human airway epithelial cells in culture. The three HBE cell lines containing the CFTR G542X, R1162X, and W1282X nonsense mutation targets are used to validate the constructs for correction of those mutations. The 16HBE14o&#x2212; line is used to test the constructs correcting the other nonsense mutations. A range of multiplicities of infection (MOIs) are tested. In either case, reversion of the nonsense mutation to the wild type CFTR sequence is assessed. After 2-3 days in culture, genomic DNA is harvested, amplicons around the targeted sites are generated by PCR, and NGS is performed to determine editing rates at each locus similar to the methods described in Example 1. Because airway epithelial cells are used, AAV introduction and editing rates are as similar to an in vivo treatment as possible while using a cultured cell system. AAVs with different serotypes are compared to determine which serotype is optimal for delivery of the fusion protein/gRNA into airway cells. The editing rates achieved by AAV introduction of these systems are compared with the RNP editing rates observed in Example 4.2.</p><p id="p-0818" num="0798">Because cell lines for the nonsense mutations R553X, E60X, and Q493X are not available, fusion protein/gRNA systems targeting these mutations are evaluated in wild type 16HBE14o&#x2212; cells to assay for AAV introduction, base editor expression, and off-target editing rates at the location of interest. To determine the rate of stop codon correction, the mutant locus is cloned into GFP for a GFP restoration assay as described in Example 4.1.</p><p id="p-0819" num="0799">In parallel with determining editing rates by NGS, total protein lysates from cells harboring CFTR mutations edited with fusion protein/gRNA systems are collected and the levels of full-length CFTR protein assessed by western blotting. To test whether functional CFTR protein is formed, forskolin activation assays are performed using methods similar to those described by Devor et al (2000<i>, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol </i>279, C461-479, incorporated by reference herein) and/or Dousmais et al (2002<i>, J Gen Physiol </i>119, 545-559, incorporated by reference herein). In these experiments, edited CFTR mutant cells are treated with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, to increase intracellular levels of cAMP. Elevated cAMP levels then activate CFTR, and the influx of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is measured by either a genetically-encoded yellow fluorescent protein based Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> sensor or a small molecule fluorescent indicator of chloride such as MQAE. The G542X, R1162X, and W1282X edited cell lines are tested in this assay.</p><p id="p-0820" num="0800">To determine the rate of off-target mutations, a bioinformatic approach which is customized with information about the seed region and flexible off-target PAM recognition space of each specific nuclease is used. These pieces of information have been determined bioinformatically for each protein and are used to rank the likelihood of off-target activity for each protein.</p><p id="p-0821" num="0801">To complement bioinformatic prediction of off targets, biochemical detection of off-targets via a modified SITE-seq protocol (Cameron et al., 2017<i>, Nat Methods </i>14, 600-606, herein incorporated by reference) is also performed. Briefly, genomic DNA from human airway epithelial cells is obtained. This DNA is then treated with the RGN of interest at several different concentrations. Any DNA double stranded breaks are labelled, selectively isolated, and PCR amplified with adapter sequences that allow for NGS. Sequencing reads are then mapped to the genome and &#x201c;pileups&#x201d; of reads are identified at sites of double stranded breaks, marking putative off target locations. In a subsequent set of experiments, cells are edited with the RGN or RGN-deaminase fusion protein of interest and these putative sites are individually sequenced to confirm if they are bona fide off-targets. Since chromatin context, DNA accessibility, and other factors can impact the efficiency of genome editors in living cells, biochemical methods typically overestimate the number of off-targets. Therefore, both bioinformatic and biochemical methods together provide complementary methods to identify putative off-target sites, but these sites must be verified by amplicon sequencing to get an accurate assessment of off-target editing.</p><p id="p-0822" num="0802">Once putative off-target sites are identified, amplicon sequencing on 16HBE airway epithelial cells edited with the same optimized fusion protein and guide(s) ensures that the off-target profile established for these systems matches the expected profile in patient lungs as closely as possible.</p><p id="p-0823" num="0803">To determine if the fusion proteins described herein induce changes in cellular RNA, careful analysis of the cellular transcriptome following editing is necessary. Fortunately, RNA-seq techniques to assess adenine base-editing off-target effects have become routine (Grunewald et al, 2017, Nature 569, 433-437; Zhou et al, Nature 571, 275-278, both incorporated by reference herein). Briefly, after editing cells with the fusion protein/gRNA systems determined in Example 4.2, total cellular mRNA is collected and subjected to RNA-seq. Transcriptomes from edited cells are compared to cells transfected with the ABE alone, and significant differences in RNA sequence are identified.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 5: Targeted Base-Editing for Correction of Causal Disease Mutations</heading><p id="p-0824" num="0804">A database of clinical variants was obtained from NCBI ClinVar database, which is available through the world wide web at the NCBI ClinVar website. Pathogenic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from this list.

A selection of SNPs that can be corrected using base editing in combination with an RGN, such as for example an RGN listed in Table 30 or a variant thereof, to target the causal mutation (&#x201c;Casl Mut.&#x201d;) is listed in Table 34.

Biotech. 31:688-691). Briefly, an expression vector comprising an expression cassette capable of expressing in plant cells an RGN-deaminase fusion protein operably linked to a SV40 nuclear localization signal (SEQ ID NO: 43) and a second expression cassette encoding a guide RNA targeting one or more sites in the plant PDS gene that flank an appropriate PAM sequence are introduced into <i>Nicotiana benthamiana </i>mesophyll protoplasts using PEG-mediated transformation. The transformed protoplasts are incubated in the dark for up to 36 hr. Genomic DNA is isolated from the protoplasts using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The genomic region flanking the RGN target site is PCR amplified, products are purified, and the purified PCR products are analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing on Illumina MiSeq. Typically, 100,000 of 250 bp paired-end reads (2&#xd7;100,000 reads) are generated per amplicon. The reads are analyzed using CRISPResso (Pinello, et al. 2016 <i>Nature Biotech, </i>34:695-697) to calculate the rates of editing. Output alignments are analyzed for INDEL formation or introduction of specific adenine mutations.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 7: Testing mRNA Delivery</heading><p id="p-0827" num="0806">To determine if the base editors are capable of delivery in different formats, mRNA delivery was tested with primary T-cells. Purified CD3+ T-cells or PBMCs were thawed, activated using CD3/CD28 beads (ThermoFisher) for 3 days, then nucleofected using the Lonza 4D-Nucleofector X unit and Nucleocuvette strips. The P3 Primary Cell kit was used for both mRNA and RNP delivery. Cells were transfected using the EO-115 and EH-115 programs for mRNA and RNP delivery respectively. Cells were cultured in CTS OpTimizer T cell expansion medium (ThermoFisher) containing IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec) for 4 days post nucleofection before being harvested using a Nucleospin Tissue genomic DNA isolation kit (Machery Nagel).</p><p id="p-0828" num="0807">Amplicons surrounding the editing sites were generated by PCR using primers identified in Table 35 and subjected to NGS sequencing using the Illumina Nexterra platform using 2&#xd7;250 bp paired end sequencing. The estimated base editing rate was determined by calculating the overall substitution rate for each sample.
