An example of this includes a solid-state imaging device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 below. Specifically, in Patent Literature 1 described below, a light shielding film is provided partially to implement a phase difference detection pixel having a sensitivity that is asymmetric with respect to the incident angle of light. Alternatively, in Patent Literature 1 below, the shape of a lower electrode is formed different from the shape of the lower electrode of a normal pixel that generates a signal for image generation, and thereby achieves a phase difference detection pixel having asymmetric sensitivity with respect to the incident angle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: JP 2015-50331 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the technology disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a light shielding film is provided so as to cover a part of the phase difference detection pixel to block light, and thus, the light incident on the pixel is not considered to be sufficiently utilized. Therefore, the solid-state imaging device according to Patent Literature 1 has a limitation in improving the light detection sensitivity. Furthermore, in Patent Literature 1, a charge unnecessary for phase difference detection might be generated in detecting the phase difference, depending on the shape of the lower electrode. In such a case, it is necessary to provide a mechanism (such as a plug) for discharging an unnecessary charge in order to avoid generation of noise due to the unnecessary charge. However, in a case where a discharge mechanism is provided, it would be necessary to ensure a certain area in order to provide the mechanism, leading to limitation in miniaturization of the solid-state imaging device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above situation, the present disclosure proposes a novel and improved solid-state imaging device and electronic apparatus that can improve detection sensitivity while enabling miniaturization of pixels.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present

BACKGROUND OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE ON THE SIDE OF THE INVENTORS</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Next, before describing the details of individual embodiments according to the present disclosure, a background of embodiments of the present disclosure on the side of the inventors will be described.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">As described above, an imaging apparatus has adopted a method of detecting a phase difference using a pair of phase difference detection pixels having asymmetric sensitivity with respect to an incident angle of light, as an autofocus function. For example, in Patent Literature 1 described below, a light shielding film is partially provided to implement a phase difference detection pixel having a sensitivity that is asymmetric with respect to the incident angle of light. Alternatively, in Patent Literature 1 described above, the area of a lower electrode is set to half the area of the lower electrode of a normal pixel that generates a signal for image generation, and the lower electrode is disposed unevenly within the phase difference detection pixel formation region, and thereby achieves the phase difference detection pixel having asymmetric sensitivity with respect to the incident angle.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">However, in the technology disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a light shielding film is provided so as to cover a part of the phase difference detection pixel to block light, and thus, the light incident on the pixel is not sufficiently utilized. Therefore, the solid-state imaging device according to Patent Literature 1 has a limitation in improving the light detection sensitivity. Furthermore, when the light shielding film is provided, there is a possibility that light travels in an unintended optical path due to reflection on the shielding film to cause the light to be incident on the surrounding pixels, resulting in color mixing.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In the technology disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a charge unnecessary for phase difference detection might be generated in detecting the phase difference, depending on the shape of the lower electrode of the phase difference detection pixel. In such a case, at the time of phase difference detection, the unnecessary charge might leak to the lower electrode, leading to a failure in achieving a sufficient separation ratio or occurrence of noise or afterimages. In other words, the technology has had a limit in improving the detection sensitivity of the phase difference. In order to improve the detection sensitivity of the phase difference, it is conceivable to provide a mechanism (such as a plug) for discharging the unnecessary charge in the phase detection pixel. However, in a case where a discharge mechanism is provided, it is necessary to ensure a certain area in order to provide the mechanism, and thus there has been a limitation in miniaturization of the solid-state imaging device.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">Therefore, in view of such a situation, the present inventors have conceived embodiments according to the present disclosure that makes it possible to improve detection sensitivity while enabling miniaturization of pixels. Specifically, according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the lower electrode of the adjacent pixel <b>100</b><i>c </i>adjacent to the phase difference detection pixels <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>is provided across the section where the phase difference detection pixels <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>are provided, making it possible to improve detection sensitivity while enabling miniaturization of pixels.

Additionally, as described above, the difference signal PDSa and the difference signal PDSb tend to change more steeply than the incident angle, that is, the sensitivity is high with respect to the incident angle.
