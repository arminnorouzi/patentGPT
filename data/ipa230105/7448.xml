The rich message includes a message and a brand identity. The RSAPP receives a request to send a short message service (SMS) message to a mobile number of a user (MNU). The RSAPP processes the request to send the SMS message and determines whether the MNU is enabled on one or more rich messaging channels (RMCs). Upon determining that the MNU is enabled on the RMCs, the RSAPP creates and transmits the rich message to the MNU on the enabled RMCs. Upon determining that the MNU is not enabled on the RMCs, the RSAPP confirms whether a setting specifies transmission of the received SMS message to the MNU as a SMS message if the MNU is not enabled on the RMCs. and the RSAPP transmits the received SMS message as a SMS message to the MNU.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

application No. 63/216,921, filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jun. 30, 2021. The specification of the above referenced patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A brand, that is, an enterprise or an organization, typically sends one or more of notifications, promotional messages, transactional messages, etc., to a mobile number of a user by a short message service (SMS) message to inform the user about transactions, coupons, promotions, news, updates, emergencies, etc. Typically, the notifications or the promotional messages sent via an SMS contain a text description regarding the transactions, coupons, promotions, news, updates, emergencies, etc. Moreover, SMS notifications or SMS promotions may comprise a uniform resource locator (URL) link that directs the user to a specific web page corresponding to the transactions, coupons, promotions, news, updates, emergencies, etc. Conventional SMS notifications or SMS promotions do not contain rich elements, for example, rich cards, carousels, quick response (QR) codes, rich media, graphics interchange formats (GIFs), suggested replies, and suggested actions shown as interactive buttons, etc., for the user to interact with or take necessary action.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, the user receives one or more of the SMS notifications, the SMS promotions, SMS transactions, etc., on a user device from a short number, a long number, or from an alphanumeric sender mask. Often the user does not recognize the short number, the long number, or the sender mask as belonging to a brand. Conventional SMS notifications or SMS promotional messages can, therefore, sometimes be confusing to the user, and may also not be trustworthy. Furthermore, if a user does not recognize the sender, there is no easy way for the user to verify the authenticity of the SMS notifications or the SMS promotions. Therefore, there is a long-felt need for increasing trustworthiness of the SMS notifications or the SMS promotional messages by adding a brand identity, for example, a brand name, a brand icon, and/or a brand logo of the sender, optionally along with a verification mark, for example, a checkmark or a trust mark, to indicate that the brand identity has been verified and can be trusted by the recipient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, messages comprising rich elements such as image content, audio content, video content, contacts, other rich media content, etc., and verified sender identities are referred to as rich messages. These rich messages are sent to a user device directly using one or more of application programming interfaces (APIs), protocols, and other tools, for example, a campaign manager, designed specific to different rich messaging channels, for example, Rich Communication Services (RCS), WhatsApp&#xae; of WhatsApp LLC, iMessage&#xae; of Apple, Inc., Viber&#xae; of Viber Media SARL, Telegram&#xae; of Telegram FZ-LLC, Facebook&#xae; Messenger of Facebook, Inc., Google Business Messages of Google LLC, Signal&#xae; Private Messenger of Signal Technology Foundation, etc. However, these APIs are not designed for processing a typical short message service (SMS) to create a rich message. Furthermore, existing methods of sending rich messages require special techniques, APIs, and protocols. These existing methods can be expensive for conventional applications and current users of the SMS. For example, sending rich messages may require making extensive changes to the existing SMS applications that send messages to users using SMS APIs, protocols, or tools. As used herein, &#x201c;SMS applications&#x201d; refer to messaging applications that allow users to send SMS messages from various platforms.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, there is a long-felt need for a method and a system for creating and transmitting a rich short message service (SMS) message comprising rich elements. Furthermore, there is a long-felt need for a method and a system for creating a rich message with a brand identity of a sender, and optionally with a verification mark. Furthermore, there is a long-felt need for a method and a system for processing messages sent as SMS messages to create rich messages and automatically sending the created rich messages over a rich messaging channel, if a user is available on the rich messaging channel. Furthermore, there is a long-felt need for a solution that allows existing SMS applications to benefit from rich messaging.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further disclosed in the detailed description of the invention. This summary is not intended to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method and the system disclosed herein address the above-recited need for creating and transmitting a rich short message service (SMS) message comprising rich elements, for example, a verified sender identifier (ID), image content, audio content, video content, contacts, rich cards, carousels, interactive buttons, and other rich media content. The rich SMS messages are hereinafter referred to as rich messages. Furthermore, the method and the system disclosed herein address the need for creating a rich message with a brand identity, for example, a brand name, a brand icon, and/or a brand logo, of a sender, and optionally with a verification mark, for example, a checkmark, a trust mark, etc., for increasing trustworthiness of the rich message and indicating that the brand identity has been verified and can be trusted by the recipient. Furthermore, the method and the system disclosed herein address the above-recited need for processing messages sent as SMS messages to create rich messages and automatically sending the created rich messages over a rich messaging channel, if a user is available on the rich messaging channel. Furthermore, the method and the system disclosed herein address the above-recited need for a solution that allows existing SMS applications to benefit from rich messaging.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method disclosed herein comprises sending rich messages on one or more data messaging channels or rich messaging channels, for example, Rich Communication Services (RCS), WhatsApp&#xae; of WhatsApp LLC, iMessage&#xae; of Apple, Inc., Business Chat of Apple, Inc., Viber&#xae; of Viber Media SARL, Telegram&#xae; of Telegram FZ-LLC, Facebook&#xae; Messenger of Facebook, Inc., Google Business Messages of Google LLC, Signal&#xae; Private Messenger of Signal Technology Foundation, or any other messaging channels that use data to communicate a message or that support rich messaging features and rich elements comprising, for example, images, videos, rich cards, carousels, interactive buttons, etc. The interactive buttons, for example, buttons for suggested replies, suggested actions, etc., are buttons that a user can select or tap to send a response message or to take an action on a user device. A suggested reply allows the user to select or tap on the interactive button displayed on the user device to communicate a response to the brand. A suggested action allows the user to select or tap on the interactive button to take an action on the user device, for example, make a phone call, open a website, share a location, etc. On RCS, the suggested replies and the suggested actions are sent as part of a suggested chiplist, or along with a standalone rich card, or with a rich card as part of a carousel. Other messaging channels also support sending of the interactive buttons in the form of suggested replies and suggested actions, though these rich interactive elements may be referred to by a different term. For example, on the WhatsApp&#xae; instant messaging application, a suggested reply is called a quick reply and a suggested action is called a call-to-action, and on the Facebook&#xae; Messenger, a suggested reply is called a quick reply and a suggested action is called a button.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The data messaging channels or the rich messaging channels disclosed above are supported by a data messaging application on the user device, and a data messaging platform, for example, RCS, WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc. Most of these data messaging platforms support business messaging that enables a brand, or a developer on behalf of a brand, or an application on behalf of a brand, to send and receive messages over a data network to and from users of the data messaging applications. Some data messaging platforms such as Signal&#xae; do not currently support business messaging but may do so in the future. Some of the rich messaging platforms, for example, RCS, WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc., identify the user by their mobile number. Other rich messaging platforms, for example, Facebook&#xae; Messenger, not only allow users to use an identifier other than a mobile number, but also permit users to link a mobile number with their account. Some other rich messaging platforms, for example, Google Business Messages, use an identifier other than mobile number and do not currently support a mechanism to link their channel identifier with a mobile number at the platform level, but enable users that interact with a brand to provide and validate a mobile number to a chatbot, thereby establishing a mapping between an identifier used by the rich messaging platform and the mobile number of the user. As used herein, &#x201c;channel&#x201d; exemplarily refers to SMS, RCS, WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc. Also, as used herein, &#x201c;rich messaging channel&#x201d;, &#x201c;data messaging channel&#x201d;, &#x201c;data messaging application&#x201d;, &#x201c;data messaging platform&#x201d;, and &#x201c;rich messaging platform&#x201d;, exemplarily refer to RCS, WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method and the system disclosed herein employ a rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) configured to define computer program instructions executable by at least one processor for creating and transmitting a rich message. The rich message comprises a message and a brand identity. In an embodiment, the rich message further comprises a verification mark. The brand identity comprises, for example, one or more of a brand name, a brand icon, and a brand logo of a brand requesting to transmit the rich message to a mobile number of a user. In the method and the system disclosed herein, the RSAPP receives a request to send an SMS message from a brand, that is, a sender, to a mobile number of a user. The RSAPP checks whether the sender of the SMS message has signed up for a rich messaging service provided by the method and the system disclosed herein. If the sender has signed up for the rich messaging service, the RSAPP processes the request to send the SMS message, and determines whether the mobile number of the user, that is, a recipient, is enabled on one or more of multiple rich messaging channels by executing a channel specific command on each of the rich messaging channels. For example, the RSAPP executes the rich communication services contacts capability check command for the mobile number of the user to determine if the mobile number of the user is enabled for rich communication services (RCS). In an embodiment, the RSAPP determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more other rich messaging channels by executing an equivalent command specific to the other rich messaging channel(s). For example, the RSAPP executes a contacts method of the WhatsApp Business application programing interface (API) for determining whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on the WhatsApp rich messaging channel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) creates and transmits the rich message to the mobile number of the user, that is, the recipient, without explicitly checking whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels. The RSAPP executes a command to transmit the rich message to the mobile number of the user. If the mobile number of the user is enabled on the rich messaging channel(s), the command to transmit the rich message receives a status response indicating status of transmission as successfully sent. If the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the status response to the command to transmit the rich message indicates that the mobile number of the user is not enabled on the rich messaging channel(s).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, by searching for the mobile number of the user in a local cache created by the RSAPP. The RSAPP creates the local cache by saving the enabled status for each mobile number based on the status response to the explicit or implicit capability check command for RCS or to an equivalent command on other rich messaging channels.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Upon determining that the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) creates a rich message comprising a message and a brand identity, and transmits the created rich message to the mobile number of the user on the enabled rich messaging channel(s). In an embodiment, a service provider verifies the brand identity. In an embodiment, the rich message further comprises one or more of multiple interactive buttons. The interactive buttons comprise, for example, a suggested reply button, a suggested action button, and a brand-specific action button. The selection of the suggested reply button using a user device of the user allows the user to respond to the brand or send a user response to the brand. The selection of the suggested action button or the brand-specific action button allows the user to execute an action on the user device. In an embodiment, the RSAPP delivers the created rich message from a trusted sender identifier (ID). In another embodiment, the RSAPP delivers the created rich message from a sender-id of the brand. Upon determining that the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the RSAPP confirms whether a setting specifies transmission of the received SMS message to the mobile number of the user as a SMS message if the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels. The RSAPP transmits the received SMS message as a SMS message to the mobile number of the user. In an embodiment, the RSAPP sends a status message comprising one or more of a delivery receipt and a read receipt to the brand.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) monitors delivery of the created rich message to the mobile number of the user. As part of monitoring the delivery, the RSAPP delivers the created rich message to the mobile number of the user via one or more additional messaging platforms in case of a failure of the delivery or a delay in the delivery of the created rich message to the mobile number of the user via a first messaging platform. The additional messaging platforms comprise, for example, alternative data messaging platforms and short message service platforms. In another embodiment, the RSAPP concurrently sends the created rich message over the rich messaging channels that are enabled to increase chances of delivery of the created rich message. In this embodiment, the RSAPP revokes the created rich message from the other rich messaging channels that are enabled as soon as the created rich message is delivered via one of the rich messaging channels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, a brand enterprise or a developer registers for the rich SMS with a service provider. In executing the registration, the service provider receives information about the brand identity from the brand enterprise, and verifies the brand identity. In an embodiment, the brand enterprise or the developer specifies to the service provider one of multiple rich message templates to be used for sending rich messages. The service provider sends the rich messages to a user device of a user using the specified rich message template.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled for rich communication services. Furthermore, the RSAPP determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled for one or more of multiple messaging applications, for example, WhatsApp&#xae; or other instant messaging applications. In an embodiment, the RSAPP determines whether the mobile number of the user is linked to a user profile. In another embodiment, the RSAPP determines whether the mobile number of the user is linked to a chatbot created by the brand or a messaging platform. The RSAPP transmits the created rich message to the user profile or the chatbot of the brand on one or more of multiple messaging platforms comprising, for example, Facebook&#xae; Messenger, Google Business Messages, and Apple Business Chat. In an embodiment, the user profile is a part of a profile stored by one or more entities comprising, for example, Facebook, Google, and Apple.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) selects one or more of the rich messaging channels based on one or more of multiple parameters. The parameters comprise, for example, size of the SMS message; capabilities of multiple messaging platforms; cost of sending the SMS message via one or more of the rich messaging channels in terms of standard pricing and dynamic pricing based on traffic patterns; history of a recipient of the SMS message in terms of message delivery status and time, message read status and time, and user response; and maintenance of consistency by sending the SMS message on a single rich messaging channel instead of switching between multiple rich messaging channels.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) enhances the rich message through one or more of multiple automatic enhancements comprising, for example, replacing uniform resource locator (URL) links within the SMS message with one or more of an image, a video, and other rich media; and automatically adding suggested replies or suggested actions to the SMS message based on content of the SMS message.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the method disclosed herein, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) receives an SMS message from a brand, that is, a sender, to a mobile number of a user. The RSAPP checks whether the sender of the SMS has signed up for the rich SMS provided by the RSAPP. If the sender has signed up for the rich SMS, the RSAPP processes the received SMS message and creates a rich message comprising a message and a brand identity. In an embodiment, the rich message further comprises a verification mark, thereby rendering a verified brand identity. In an embodiment, the sender identifier (ID) of the SMS message is configured for the RSAPP by a messaging partner, an aggregator, or an RSAPP provider, without an explicit registration or sign up by the brand owning the sender ID. The RSAPP transmits the created rich message to the mobile number of the user over a network. In an embodiment, the RSAPP transmits the rich message over a data link, for example, a mobile data link or a Wi-Fi&#xae; data link of Wi-Fi Alliance Corporation. The RSAPP determines whether the mobile number is enabled for data messaging through a data messaging application, for example, Rich Communication Services (RCS), WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, or any other data messaging application that can support rich messages to be transmitted to the mobile number of the user via RCS, WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, or any other data messaging application. For some data messaging applications, for example, Facebook&#xae; Messenger, that allow an identifier other than a mobile number for identification of the user, the RSAPP determines whether the mobile number of the user is linked to the data messaging application. The mobile number of the user receives the rich message transmitted by the RSAPP. The RSAPP delivers the rich message into a data messaging application, for example, Android&#xae; Messages of Google LLC, Samsung&#xae; Messages of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., etc., on a user device with a subscriber identity module (SIM) that represents the mobile number of the user, or on another data messaging application such as iMessage&#xae;, WhatsApp&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc., on the user device where the data messaging application is registered with the mobile number of the user.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above-disclosed embodiments of the method disclosed herein are executed using one or more of an application programming interface (API) configured for sending a short message service (SMS) message; a protocol configured for sending the SMS message, for example, a Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) protocol; an application configured for sending the SMS message; an API configured for sending the rich message; a protocol configured for sending the rich message, and an application configured for sending the rich message. In an embodiment, the API for sending SMS messages is a pre-existing API for SMS messaging that is already in use.

embodied as a system, a method, or a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium having one or more computer-readable program codes stored thereon. Accordingly, various embodiments of the disclosure herein take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment comprising, for example, microcode, firmware, software, etc., or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that are referred to herein as a &#x201c;system&#x201d;, a &#x201c;module&#x201d;, an &#x201c;engine&#x201d;, a &#x201c;circuit&#x201d;, or a &#x201c;unit&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of an embodiment of a method for creating and transmitting a rich message. As used herein, &#x201c;rich message&#x201d; refers to a message that comprises a text message, a brand identity, an optional verification mark, an optional rich card, and optional interactive buttons. The method disclosed herein employs a rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) configured to define computer program instructions executable by at least one processor for creating and transmitting a rich message. In an embodiment, the RSAPP is implemented as a web-based platform hosted on a server or a network of servers accessible via a network. In another embodiment, the RSAPP is implemented in a cloud computing environment. As used herein, &#x201c;cloud computing environment&#x201d; refers to a processing environment comprising configurable, computing, physical, and logical resources, for example, networks, servers, storage media, virtual machines, applications, services, etc., and data distributed over a network, for example, the internet. The cloud computing environment provides an on-demand network access to a shared pool of the configurable computing physical and logical resources. In an embodiment, the RSAPP is a cloud computing-based platform implemented as a service for creating and transmitting a rich message. For example, the RSAPP is configured as a software as a service (SaaS) platform or a cloud-based software as a service (CSaaS) platform that creates and transmits a rich message. In another embodiment, the RSAPP is implemented as a cloud platform service also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS). In another embodiment, the RSAPP is implemented as an on-premise software installed and run on computers on the premises of an organization. The RSAPP receives <b>101</b> a request to send a short message service (SMS) message from a brand, that is, a sender, to a mobile number of a user. As used herein, the term &#x201c;brand&#x201d; refers to an enterprise or a division of an enterprise, or a brand used by the enterprise or an organization, that intends to send an SMS message to a user. Wherever reference is made to a brand taking or receiving an action, the reference refers to a developer or another person who takes or receives the action on behalf of the brand, or an application that takes or receives the action on behalf of the brand.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, the rich message comprises a text and a brand identity. The brand identity comprises, for example, one or more of a brand name, a brand icon, and a brand logo of the brand requesting to transmit the rich message to the mobile number of the user, as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>13</b></figref>. In an embodiment, a service provider verifies the brand identity as disclosed in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. On successful verification of the brand identity, a verification mark, for example, a checkmark, is disposed next to one or more of the brand name, the brand icon, and the brand logo, for indicating that the brand is verified and can be trusted by a recipient of the rich message. In another embodiment, the rich message comprises images, for example, where a uniform resource locator (URL) link to a webpage is enhanced with an image of the webpage. In another embodiment, the rich message further comprises one or more interactive buttons as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-<b>11</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The interactive buttons comprise, for example, suggested replies and/or suggested action buttons that a user can select, click, or tap to send a response message and/or take an action on a user device of the user, respectively. The interactive buttons allow the user to convey suggested replies to the brand or to take one or more suggested actions. The user can respond to the brand by selecting one of the suggested replies, or can take an action on the user device by selecting one of the suggested actions. A suggested reply allows the user to select, click, or tap on the interactive button displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) of a messaging client to communicate a response to the brand as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-<b>11</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. A suggested action allows the user to select, click, or tap on the interactive button to take an action on the user device, for example, make a phone call, open a website, share a location, etc., as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) receives a selection of one of the suggested replies or an indication of the user selecting a suggested action from the user device, and informs the brand and/or the developer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The rich short message service application (RSAPP) processes <b>102</b> the request to send the short message service (SMS) message, and determines <b>103</b> whether the mobile number of the user, that is, the recipient, is enabled on one or more of multiple rich messaging channels by executing a channel specific command for each of the rich messaging channels. For example, a rich communication services contacts capability check command, a WhatsApp Business API Contacts command, and an equivalent command for other channels for the mobile number of the user. The RSAPP <b>102</b> determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of multiple rich messaging channels by one of executing a command, calling an application programming interface (API) method, and searching from a database. The method for determining if the mobile number of the user is enabled on a particular rich messaging channel may vary depending on the rich messaging channel. In an embodiment the RSAPP executes a rich communication services contacts capability check command for the mobile number of the user to determine if the mobile number of the user is enabled for rich communication services (RCS). In another embodiment, the RSAPP executes a WhatsApp Business API contacts command of the WhatsApp Business On-Premise API to verify if the mobile number of the user belongs to a valid WhatsApp account and to get the WhatsApp identifier (ID) for the mobile number in order to send a message. The rich messaging channels comprise, for example, Rich Communication Services (RCS), WhatsApp&#xae; of WhatsApp LLC, iMessage&#xae; of Apple, Inc., Viber&#xae; of Viber Media SARL, Telegram&#xae; of Telegram FZ-LLC, Facebook&#xae; Messenger of Facebook, Inc., Google Business Messages of Google LLC, Signal&#xae; Private Messenger of Signal Technology Foundation, or any other messaging channels that use data to communicate a message or that support rich messaging features and rich elements comprising, for example, one or more of images, videos, rich cards, carousels, and interactive buttons. In an embodiment, the RSAPP checks whether the sender, that is, the brand, of the SMS message has registered or signed up for a rich messaging service, and if so, processes <b>102</b> the request to send the SMS message, and determines <b>103</b> whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels. Upon determining <b>104</b> that the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the RSAPP creates <b>104</b><i>a </i>a rich message comprising a message and a brand entity with an optional verification mark, and transmits <b>104</b><i>b </i>the created rich message to the mobile number of the user on the enabled rich messaging channel(s). In an embodiment, the RSAPP delivers the rich message from a trusted sender identifier (ID). In another embodiment, the RSAPP delivers the rich message from a sender identifier of the brand. Upon determining <b>105</b> that the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the RSAPP confirms <b>105</b><i>a </i>whether a setting specifies transmission of the received SMS message to the mobile number of the user as a SMS message if the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, as exemplarily illustrated as &#x201c;Fallback Routing&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. The &#x201c;Fallback Routing&#x201d; section of the rich message template <b>1402</b> enables the brand to one of send or don't send the received SMS message to the mobile number of the user if the mobile number is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels. The RSAPP transmits <b>105</b><i>b </i>the received SMS message as a SMS message to the mobile number of the user. In an embodiment, the RSAPP sends a status message comprising one or more of a delivery receipt and a read receipt to the brand.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) creates and transmits <b>106</b> the rich message to the mobile number of the user, that is, the recipient, without explicitly checking whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The RSAPP executes <b>107</b> a command to transmit the rich message to the mobile number of the user. Determine <b>108</b> if the mobile number of the user is enabled on the rich messaging channel(s). If the mobile number of the user is enabled on the rich messaging channel(s), the command to transmit the rich message receives <b>109</b> a status response indicating status of transmission as successfully sent. If the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the status response <b>110</b> to the command to transmit the rich message indicates that the mobile number of the user is not enabled on the rich messaging channel(s).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, the rich short message service application (RSAPP) receives <b>101</b> a request to send a short message service (SMS) message from a brand to a mobile number of a user. The RSAPP processes <b>102</b> the request to send the short message service (SMS) message, and determines <b>111</b> whether the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, by searching for the mobile number of the user in a local cache created by the RSAPP. The RSAPP creates the local cache by saving the enabled status for each mobile number based on the status response to the explicit or implicit capability check command for RCS or to an equivalent command on other rich messaging channels. Upon determining <b>112</b> that the mobile number of the user is enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the RSAPP creates <b>112</b><i>a </i>a rich message comprising a message and a brand entity with an optional verification mark, and transmits <b>112</b><i>b </i>the created rich message to the mobile number of the user on the enabled rich messaging channel(s). Upon determining <b>1113</b> that the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, the RSAPP confirms <b>113</b><i>a </i>whether a setting specifies transmission of the received SMS message to the mobile number of the user as a SMS message if the mobile number of the user is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels, as exemplarily illustrated as &#x201c;Fallback Routing&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. The &#x201c;Fallback Routing&#x201d; section of the rich message template <b>1402</b> enables the brand to one of send or don't send the received SMS message to the mobile number of the user if the mobile number is not enabled on one or more of the rich messaging channels.

In an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled for rich communication services (RCS) and creates the rich message to be transmitted to the mobile number of the user via the RCS channel. For example, a channel such as RCS supports rich elements comprising a carousel, suggested responses, and a suggested chiplist that are configured to be used to implement interactive buttons for user actions or replies such as copy, confirm, complete transaction, report potential fraud, unauthorized access, did not request, unrecognized transaction, open a website, open a map location, share a location, select a menu option where a user can tap on an interactive button exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-<b>11</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, to complete an action without leaving the messaging client <b>304</b><i>a </i>or having to type a reply as in person-to-application (P2A) messaging, etc. In an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> processes text in the received SMS message to add one or more interactive buttons for users to select or tap, for example, by taking an existing two-way interactive SMS channel and adding richness of suggested reply buttons thereto to make it easier for the user to engage with the brand or the developer <b>301</b> on behalf of the brand. In another embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> adds interactive buttons for suggested replies and suggested actions over and above the text in the received SMS message, based on details specified in a rich message template by the brand or the developer <b>301</b> on behalf of the brand, to add interactivity that was previously not supported in the SMS interaction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another embodiment, the rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) <b>302</b> determines whether the mobile number of the user is enabled for the WhatsApp&#xae; instant messaging application, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;WhatsApp&#x201d;, and creates the rich message to be transmitted to the mobile number of the user via WhatsApp. In an example, messaging channels such as WhatsApp may support delivery of images for the brand's logo, but may not support other rich elements to implement interactive buttons that users can click to complete an action as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>. For such channels, the RSAPP <b>302</b> sends a menu of options for suggested replies and suggested actions, for example, &#x201c;send or type 1 to confirm, 2 to report fraud&#x201d;. A user types the response to complete the action. Furthermore, in an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> sends weblinks in the rich message to confirm and to report fraud actions.

In an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> sends the rich message concurrently over multiple rich messaging channels that are enabled to increase chances of delivery of the rich message. Furthermore, the RSAPP <b>302</b> revokes the rich message from other rich messaging channels that are enabled as soon as the rich message is delivered via one of the rich messaging channels. Furthermore, in an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> determines the developer's preference in terms of the order of the rich messaging channels to be used to transmit the rich message, and the user's availability on one or more rich messaging channels. Furthermore, in an embodiment, the RSAPP <b>302</b> enhances the rich message through one or more of multiple automatic enhancements comprising, for example, replacing the uniform resource locator (URL) links within the SMS message with one or more of an image, a video, and other rich media; and automatically adding interactive buttons to convey suggested replies or suggested actions to the SMS message based on content of the SMS message. For example, (1) in case of a one-time-password (OTP), the RSAPP <b>302</b> adds a suggested action of Copy to the SMS message; (2) in case of a message with a URL, the RSAPP <b>302</b> adds a suggested action to open a website, to the SMS message; and (3) based on some other content, the RSAPP <b>302</b> adds a suggested action to open a map location, share a location, select a menu option, etc. The creation of the rich message, therefore, comprises addition of the automatic enhancements to the SMS message received from the brand/developer <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) <b>302</b> receives an acknowledgement of the rich message being delivered to the messaging client <b>304</b><i>a </i>on the user device <b>304</b> via one or more of the messaging platforms <b>303</b> and associated messaging application programming interfaces (APIs).

For example, if the rich message is read, the feedback module <b>302</b><i>h </i>informs the brand/developer <b>301</b> that the rich message has been read. In another embodiment, the feedback module <b>302</b><i>h </i>is configured to provide feedback to the brand/developer <b>301</b> about the messaging platforms <b>303</b> used to send the rich message to the mobile number of the user. In another embodiment, the feedback module <b>302</b><i>h </i>is configured to provide feedback to the brand/developer <b>301</b> when the routing module <b>302</b><i>c </i>determines that the mobile number is not enabled for any of the rich messaging channels, and the brand/developer <b>301</b> has not chosen the option to have the RSAPP <b>302</b> transmit a short message service (SMS) message as a standard SMS message to the mobile number of the user, thereby allowing the brand/developer <b>301</b> to take an alternative action, for example, sending the SMS message as the standard SMS message on its own.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">The routing module <b>302</b><i>c </i>is configured to determine rich data messaging capabilities of multiple messaging platforms <b>303</b>, and the rich message creation module <b>302</b><i>d </i>maps a request from the brand/developer <b>301</b> to messaging platform-specific capabilities to create the rich message and instruct the transmitting module <b>302</b><i>e </i>to transmit the created rich message to the user device <b>304</b>. The rich message creation module <b>302</b><i>d </i>is configured to translate the request for a rich message into a rich message that can be delivered to the messaging platform(s) <b>303</b> determined by the routing module <b>302</b><i>c</i>, using information in a rich message template defined by the brand or the developer <b>301</b> on behalf of the brand. The response module <b>302</b><i>f </i>is configured to monitor the delivery of the rich message to the mobile number of the user, and user replies/actions in response to the rich message. The re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is configured to potentially deliver the rich message to the user via one or more additional messaging platforms when there is a delivery failure or a delay in delivery of the rich message to the mobile number of the user via a first messaging platform. The additional messaging platforms comprise, for example, alternative data messaging platforms and short message service platforms. In an embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is configured to transmit the rich message via multiple rich messaging channels to increase the overall chances of successful delivery of the rich message. In an example, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>delivers the rich message to the mobile number of the user via the WhatsApp&#xae; messaging channel if the rich message is not delivered over the rich communication services (RCS) channel within a predetermined time interval.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In an embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>delivers the rich message to the mobile number of the user as a standard short messaging service (SMS) message if the rich message cannot be delivered over any rich messaging platforms or rich messaging channels within a predetermined time interval. In another embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is configured to revoke the rich message from a first messaging platform before attempting to deliver the rich message over a second messaging platform. Revoking the rich message from the first messaging platform is helpful to avoid duplicate rich messages being received by the user, and in an embodiment, helps avoid additional charges for delivery over multiple messaging platforms. The second messaging platform is another data messaging platform or an SMS platform. In an embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>uses the rich message creation module <b>302</b><i>d </i>and the transmitting module <b>302</b><i>e </i>to create and deliver the rich message to the user via the second messaging platform. In an embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is configured to monitor the delivery of the rich message to the mobile number of the user via the second messaging platform. The re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is further configured to deliver the rich message to the mobile number of the user via one or more of a third messaging platform and a fourth messaging platform if there is a delivery failure or a delay in the delivery of the rich message to the mobile number of the user via the second messaging platform. The rich message creation module <b>302</b><i>d </i>is configured to translate the SMS message to the rich message to be transmitted to the mobile number based on the selected second messaging platform, the third messaging platform, and the fourth messaging platform, and the rich message template defined by the brand or the developer <b>301</b> on behalf of the brand. In another embodiment, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g </i>is configured to revoke the rich message from other multiple rich messaging channels as soon as the rich message is delivered via one or more of multiple rich messaging channels.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">The billing module <b>302</b><i>i </i>is configured to charge the brand/developer <b>301</b> a fee for creating and transmitting the rich message to the user device <b>304</b>. Data messaging platforms, for example, Rich Communication Services (RCS), WhatsApp&#xae;, iMessage&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, etc., may charge a fee for application-to-person (A2P) messages, that could be at a premium or a fee lower than the fee for a short messaging service (SMS) message. Therefore, when the rich SMS application (RSAPP) <b>302</b> transmits the rich message to the mobile number of the user, the rich message would typically be charged an A2P message fee applicable to the data messaging platform used to send the rich message. Furthermore, some data messaging platforms may charge a per session fee in lieu of a per message fee when the user responds to the rich message. However, there may be a need to charge the rich message at a price different from the per A2P message fee or the per session fee charged for sending other A2P messages or for other sessions on the data messaging platforms. The processing module <b>302</b><i>b </i>keeps track of the number of rich messages sent and the suggested replies or suggested actions received, in the database <b>302</b><i>j</i>, and enables the billing module <b>302</b><i>i </i>to charge the rich message in a way that is different from standard A2P and session pricing, which helps in the implementation of flexible pricing for the rich messages sent by brands.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">The processor <b>5001</b> of the system <b>5000</b> disclosed herein retrieves instructions defined by the reception module <b>302</b><i>a</i>, the processing module <b>302</b><i>b</i>, the routing module <b>302</b><i>c</i>, the rich message creation module <b>302</b><i>d</i>, the transmitting module <b>302</b><i>e</i>, the response module <b>302</b><i>f</i>, the re-routing module <b>302</b><i>g</i>, the feedback module <b>302</b><i>h</i>, the billing module <b>302</b><i>i</i>, from the memory unit <b>5003</b> for executing the respective functions disclosed above.

For example, some of the elements of the rich message template may be common to all rich channels, for example, RCS, iMessage&#xae;, WhatsApp&#xae;, Viber&#xae;, Telegram&#xae;, Facebook&#xae; Messenger, Google Business Messages, Signal&#xae;, etc., whereas other elements may have values that are different and specific to a particular channel depending on the type of the rich messaging channel used to send the rich message. The rich short message service (SMS) application (RSAPP) provider performs a verification of the brand and the brand identity. The RSAPP provider also reviews and approves the submitted rich message templates. The brand or the developer specifies the approved rich message templates to be used by the RSAPP for sending rich messages. The RSAPP sends rich messages using the specified and approved rich message templates to the user device. Furthermore, the brand or the developer can add multiple rich message templates to the RSAPP, for use by the RSAPP in sending the rich messages to the mobile number of the user.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">It is apparent in different embodiments that the various methods, algorithms, and computer-readable programs disclosed herein are implemented on non-transitory, computer-readable storage media appropriately programmed for computing devices.
