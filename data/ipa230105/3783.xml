These systems are designed to detect fault events that typically require a fault to last at least 1 full cycle (1/60 seconds) before detection occurs. Events called incipient faults which are self-clearing in nature and tend to last less than &#xbd; a cycle can go above the fault trip threshold without being detected. These incipient faults can become more and more frequent over time leading to cable failure which causes a fault event and power outage to the neighboring area.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Incipient faults are caused by water penetrating defects in a splice or termination which causes an arcing fault. Water vapors caused by the high current evaporating the water extinguish the fault within the given time making the fault self-clearing.

The method includes calculation of total harmonic distortion (THD) just after the time of the disturbance for detection of transient voltages that are associated with incipient faults. Such analysis allows for comparison of load conditions before and after the event and for determining if the fault occurred near the apex of the voltage waveform. The method and system of the present invention also can detect incipient faults independent of waveform analysis techniques. The detection and identification of incipient faults in accordance with the method and system of the present invention can be utilized to predict future failure of a splice or termination and save customers from having unplanned outages and further equipment damage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">As described in further detail below, an exemplary system that employs a technique for communicating power quality, voltage and current magnitude, fault information, and other data back to a central server for processing can be used with the described incipient fault detection techniques. The system can alert the central server that an incipient fault has occurred and has been detected at a specific location (possibly multiple) with magnitude and accurate timestamp information and can keep track of the number of incipient fault events detected at that location. The system can provide information to a utility that can help them replace failing assets before a catastrophic fault event occurs and customers having to take an outage. This functionality would improve the overall grid reliability and save the customer time, resources, and/or money related to an outage.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary method <b>10</b> of detecting self-clearing, sub-cycle faults. The method utilizes data collected by a peak detector circuit that allows for much faster than one cycle detection of peak magnitude.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">In step <b>15</b>, a current condition and a voltage condition are sensed at a location along a power cable. For example, utilizing a system such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, described in further detail below, current flowing through three phase conductors is measured by Rogowski coils and converted to a voltage relative to the amplitude of the current by an integration circuit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">In step <b>20</b>, the sensed conditions are relayed to an analyzing device. In a preferred aspect, the analyzing device, such as EAU <b>120</b>, described further below, can include a current peak detector such as peak detector <b>70</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (or similar circuitry, as would be apparent to one of skill in the art). A peak detector circuit uses operational amplifiers in combination with a series diode and capacitor to hold a voltage value relative to the peak input current. This configuration allows for a system to check the value of the peak detector periodically without missing the actual peak value. The peak detector circuit can be used to trigger an alarm when the peak value of the current crosses some predefined threshold.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">If the peak value of the current does not cross the predefined threshold, no event is reported (step <b>22</b>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, instead of or in addition to using a peak detector, the analyzing device can include a fast fault detector or high-speed sampling that is sufficient to measure &#xbc;-&#xbd; cycle events.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">Returning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, if the peak value of the current crosses the predefined threshold, then in step <b>25</b>, the system performs a conventional faulted circuit indicator (FCI) analysis to determine the presence or absence of an FCI fault (i.e., a fault detected using traditional FCI logic). If such a fault has occurred, then the analysis is complete and the system reports the fault and the peak magnitude detected by the peak detector circuit in step <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">According to an aspect of the present invention, if the FCI logic does not determine a fault has occurred after the threshold, the incipient fault logic (step <b>35</b>) begins and is performed in steps <b>40</b> and <b>45</b>. In step <b>45</b>, the RMS current values before and after the threshold event are compared. When the two current values are within a certain predetermined percentage, such as within 10% or within 15%, of each other, (or, alternatively, other predetermined percentage values) the incipient fault logic continues by comparing the Voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) before and after the event (step <b>40</b>). If the two current values are within the certain percentage noted above (e.g., within 10% or 15%) and the THD values differ by a certain percentage, such as at least 30% or at least 25%, then an incipient fault is reported in step <b>55</b>. If either the two current values are not within the noted percentage above or the THD values do not differ by at least the percentage noted above, then an &#x201c;unclassified event&#x201d; is reported in step <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">As noted above, if the logic does not meet the criteria in these two cases, the &#x201c;unclassified event&#x201d; will be generated and reported back to a central server for further analysis. An unclassified event in this case would mean something that requires more attention, but that cannot be classified as an incipient fault by the algorithm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">As such, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as part of the incipient fault logic, in step <b>40</b>, for example, a total harmonic distortion (THD) analysis is performed. If an FCI fault is absent, a first total harmonic distortion value related to the voltage of the power cable at the location at the time the measured current value crosses the current threshold value or a time thereafter (THD<b>1</b>) is compared to a total harmonic distortion related to the voltage of the power cable at the location at a time prior to the sub-cycle event (THDO) to generate a total harmonic distortion comparison value (THDc).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The THD can be calculated using the instantaneous RMS values using the following formula:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mfrac>  <msqrt>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>V</mi>     <mi>rms</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>    <mo>-</mo>    <msubsup>     <mi>V</mi>     <mi>rmsf</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>   </mrow>  </msqrt>  <msub>   <mi>V</mi>   <mi>rmsf</mi>  </msub> </mfrac></math></maths></p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">where V<sub>rms </sub>is the RMS voltage including all measurable frequencies, and V<sub>rmdf </sub>is the RMS voltage of only the fundamental frequency (60 Hz in this case).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In more detail, for example, in step <b>45</b>, a first current value (I<sub>0</sub>) (from prior to the time the measured current value crosses the current threshold value) is compared to a second current value (I<sub>1</sub>) (after the time the measured current value crosses the current threshold value). The difference between I<sub>1 </sub>and I<sub>0 </sub>is Ic. The pre and post fault RMS current values are compared for a percent change within some predefined threshold (e.g., are the current values with 10% of each other?). If the values are reasonably similar, an incipient fault has occurred and can be reported along with the measured peak current value.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">In both steps <b>40</b> and <b>45</b>, in further detail, circular buffers can be used for monitoring THD and RMS current during the time of an incipient fault. At all times during normal operation, a small buffer will be used to keep track of a certain number (e.g., 10 or so) of the most recent values at a rate of 5 samples per cycle (2 cycles of data). As each newest data point gets added to the front of the buffer, the oldest data gets pushed out of the buffer. In solely traditional FCI analysis, this data is not examined by the application.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">At the time of an interrupt from the peak detector circuit to the CPU, a timer will start that lasts 1 cycle, and then copies the values from the circular buffer to a location that can be analyzed further and won't change. In this way, there are 5 samples from the cycle before the incipient fault, and 5 samples from the cycle just after:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>THD vals</entry><entry>time</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>THD_n</entry><entry>t_n</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>THD_n &#x2212;

Instantaneous means that the current crossed a threshold for at least one cycle (1/60 sec). Time Overcurrent means that there is some element of time involved in the trip logic. There can be two categories of TOC logics:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0036">1.

These example figures are further described in &#x201c;Incipient Fault Location Algorithm for Underground Cables,&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, Vol. 5, No. 3, May 2014. As shown, these incipient faults demonstrate the following features&#x2014;the current lasts less than &#xbd; cycle; the pre- and post-peak current values are of similar amplitude; and the voltage waveform has significant distortion (THD) after the peak occurs.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">As described further below, the method described herein can be included as part of software or firmware that is loaded onto logic that is part of an analytics unit of a fault detection system. By implementing the incipient fault logic in a data communication and fault detection system, a value can be sampled and cleared hundreds of times per cycle. Once the threshold event has been detected, the system's FCI logic (which mimics mechanical FCI functionality and requires one full cycle for detection) can be used for comparison to rule out an FCI fault. Thus, a comparison of load conditions before and after the fault to within some percent change can be detected to show that the fault was self-clearing and didn't significantly affect the amount of current flowing through the system. This method can utilize RMS current measurements and an to algorithm for comparison, independent of waveform analysis. As such, digital processor(s) which have substantial power requirements do not need to be included in the fault detection system.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">In another aspect of the invention, the aforementioned FCI analysis that includes detecting self-clearing, sub-cycle faults can be performed by the detection and communication system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">The system <b>100</b> can be utilized in an enclosure, such as a grade level, above ground or underground enclosure, that is used to house and protect utility assets, such as electrical equipment. In one aspect, the enclosure is an underground enclosure accessible via an entrance port and can include a separate vent pipe used to provide an exhaust outlet for gasses from the enclosure. The system <b>100</b> can be installed within the enclosure, and/or alternatively the vent pipe, to provide a means for communicating information about a condition, such as a fault or environmental condition, of the vault and or the utility asset disclosed therein. The communication can include a wireless communication, via a transceiver/antenna, and/or a visual communication, via a visible light indicator assembly, such as an LED array, disposed in or on the vent pipe. The mechanical packaging of the assembly and enclosure allows it to be installed into vent pipes at street level and is packaged for ingression protection. The antenna design allows it to transmit the signal through the vent pipe cover for security and anti-vandalism. The system <b>100</b> can include one or more sensors that provide data related to a real-time condition within the enclosure. In addition, a sensor analytics unit (also referred to as an electronic analytic unit) can process and analyze the real-time data from the one or more sensors and relay that processed data, including information about self-clearing, sub-cycle faults to the transceiver for communication outside of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">In more detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows one aspect of the present invention, a detection and communication system <b>100</b>. In this aspect, the system <b>100</b> is installed in an underground enclosure, such as a vault or manhole, here underground vault <b>90</b>. In this example implementation, enclosure or vault <b>90</b> includes a variety of equipment, such as switchgear for one or more high voltage electrical lines, such as electrical lines <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>(carrying e.g., low, medium or high voltage power), associated components and/or accessories, such as a splice or termination (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, three terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>will represent such associated components and/or accessories). Of course, a fewer or greater number of components can be provided in a such an enclosure. In some enclosures, a transformer may be included therein.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">The enclosure or vault <b>90</b> can be accessed from above ground via a portal or entrance port <b>95</b> that includes a conventional manhole cover <b>92</b>, which can be formed from a metal or non-metal, and can have a conventional circular shape. In a one aspect, the manhole cover can be mounted on a ring, frame or flange structure of the entrance port <b>95</b>. In this aspect, vault <b>90</b> is can be constructed as a conventional underground vault, commonly used by electric, gas, water, and/or other utilities. However, in alternative aspects, the detection system <b>100</b> can be utilized in another type of underground enclosure or similar structure, such as a manhole, basement, cellar, pit, shelter, pipe, or other underground enclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">The vault also includes at least one sensor or monitoring device disposed therein which can monitor a physical condition of the vault or of the components or equipment located in the vault. Such conditions would normally be difficult to gather or assess from above-ground. The detection system can provide a communication infrastructure to relay vault condition information (1) to an above ground network or SCADA, without having a service technician physically enter the vault to determine those conditions, (2) to an above ground technician via a wireless or Bluetooth communication system, and/or (3) via a visible light communication assembly to an observing technician.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this example, terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>each provide a terminal connection for a power cable, such as a low, medium or high voltage power cable <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c. </i>The sensor(s) can include a sensor disposed on the termination. In this embodiment, sensors <b>111</b><i>a</i>-<b>111</b><i>c </i>are provided. These sensors can provide sensing capabilities that measure a cable condition, such as voltage, current, and/or temperature. Thus, in this example, terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>can be referred to as sensored terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>that can provide real-time data about the condition of one or more connected power lines.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">For example, one or more of the sensored terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>of this aspect can include one or more sensors <b>111</b><i>a</i>-<b>111</b><i>c. </i>In one example, one or more sensors can comprise a Rogowski coil that produces a voltage that is proportional to the derivative of the current, meaning that an integrator can be utilized to revert back to a signal that is proportional to the current. Alternatively, a current sensor can be configured as a magnetic core current transformer that produces a current proportional to the current on the inner conductor. In addition, one or more of the sensored terminations can include a capacitive voltage sensor that provides precise voltage measurements. Because one or more of sensored terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>can include both a current sensor and a capacitive voltage sensor, the sensored terminations facilitate calculation of phase angle (power factor), Volt Amps (VA), Volt Amps reactive (VAr), and Watts (W). An exemplary sensored termination is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,742,180, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">While the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows sensors implemented as part of a sensored termination, in other aspects of the invention, sensors can be implemented as part of a more general sensored electrical accessory, such as a cable termination, cable splice, or electrical jumper.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">In addition, the system can include one or more sensors that comprise one or more of the following sensors: power, voltage, current, temperature, combustible materials or byproducts of combustion, mechanical strain, mechanical movement (e.g. revolutions per minute), humidity, soil condition (acidity, moisture content, mineral content), pressure, hazardous atmosphere, liquid flow, leakage, component end-of-life or lifetime (e.g., a cathodic protection sensor), personnel presence (e.g., has someone entered the enclosure), physical state (e.g., is the enclosure open or closed, is the door open or closed, is a switch or valve open or closed, has an item been tampered with), light sensor, vibration (seismic, tampering).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">In another aspect, data is communicated from the sensors inside the enclosure to a network, SCADA, or service technician located outside the enclosure via a transceiver <b>140</b>. In one aspect, the transceiver <b>140</b> can be incorporated in a transceiver device mounted in a vent pipe <b>15</b> (not shown) located outside the enclosure <b>90</b>, at, e.g., a distance of 2-10 meters away.

In one aspect of the present invention, the EAU <b>120</b> includes logic (e.g., a logic circuit) that is programmed to perform the incipient FCI logic that detects self-clearing, sub-cycle faults described above, in the form of pre-loaded software/firmware or post-installation loaded software/firmware. In one aspect of this invention, this detection occurs independent of waveform data analysis.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">The EAU <b>120</b> is also configured to communicate that analyzed data, e.g., via hardwire or a radio disposed therein, to the antenna of the transceiver <b>140</b>. The EAU <b>120</b> can also include an integrated GPS circuit or chip to generate GPS locations signals to the GPS antenna located in the transceiver antenna unit. The integration of GPS capabilities along with time synch events leads to finding key problems with early detection with set thresholds and algorithms for a variety of incipient applications/faults/degradation of key structural or utility components. For example, the EAU <b>120</b> can interpret sensor information to determine environmental conditions such as the presence of hazardous gases, moisture, dust, chemical composition, corrosion, pest presence, and more. In addition, the EAU <b>120</b> can perform some local actions, such as the opening and closing of switches. Further, the EAU <b>120</b> can send aggregated information such as periodic status or asynchronous alarm notifications upstream to another aggregation node and/or to the transceiver, which can forward that information to a cloud server above ground. The EAU <b>120</b> can also respond to messages sent to it by an upstream aggregation node or cloud (e.g., SCADA) service. Typical commands from an upstream node or cloud service can include &#x201c;transmit status,&#x201d; &#x201c;perform action,&#x201d; &#x201c;system management,&#x201d; &#x201c;data logging,&#x201d; &#x201c;set configuration parameter,&#x201d; &#x201c;load software,&#x201d; etc.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this example, data from the sensored terminations <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>can be communicated via one or more communication cables <b>135</b> (here with multiple cables connected to each sensored termination) to EAU <b>120</b>. In addition, a series of ground wires <b>134</b> can also be provided. The EAU <b>120</b> can be mounted at a central location within the enclosure or vault <b>10</b>, or along a wall or other internal vault structure. In an embodiment of the invention, EAU <b>120</b> can include a gateway unit (not separately shown). Alternatively, the gateway unit can be disposed within the transceiver <b>140</b> or configured as a stand-alone component.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">In a further alternative, the EAU <b>120</b> can be disposed outside the enclosure, such as in a vent pipe <b>15</b>, with extended cables connecting to the one or more sensors disposed within the vault or enclosure. In this alternative aspect, the vent pipe-mounted EAU can be easily accessed by a technician without having to enter the vault or enclosure, or without having to open the entrance port or manhole cover.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">As mentioned above, EAU <b>120</b> can include appropriate electronics and logic circuits to receive, manipulate, analyze, process, and/or otherwise transform such data signals into signals useable in a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. In addition, the logic circuits can perform some operations independently of the SCADA and can be programmed to perform fault identification and detection in accordance with the method described above. In other embodiments, the EAU <b>120</b> can also perform isolation, location and condition monitoring and reporting in accord. Moreover, in another aspect, the EAU <b>120</b> can be programmed to provide additional features, such as Volt, VAR optimization, phasor measurement (synchnophaser), incipient fault detection, load characterization, post mortem event analysis, signature waveform identification and event capture, self-healing and optimization, energy auditing, partial discharge, harmonics/sub-harmonics analysis, flicker analysis and leakage current analysis.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">As mentioned above, EAU <b>120</b> can be adapted to process data signals received from sensors <b>111</b>a-<b>111</b>c and transform such data signals into analyzed data signals which are useable in a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. In addition, EAU <b>120</b> can also be adapted to receive signals from the SCADA system (via the transceiver <b>140</b>) to control one or more components or equipment located in the vault. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, data can be communicated between EAU <b>120</b> and a transceiver unit <b>140</b> (described below) via cable(s) <b>130</b>, which can comprise one or more conventional cables, such as coaxial cable(s). In addition, power to the transceiver can also be delivered from the EAU via cable(s) <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">In another aspect, EAU <b>120</b> can be configured as a modular or upgradeable unit. Such a modular unit can allow for dongle or separate module attachment via one or more interface ports. For example, multiple sensors can be connected to EAU <b>120</b>. Such a configuration can allow for the monitoring of power lines and/or a variety of additional environmental sensors which can detect parameters such as gas, water, vibration, temperature, oxygen-levels, etc.). For example, in one alternative aspect, such an additional sensor can comprise a thermal imaging camera to observe a temperature profile of the environment and components within the enclosure. The aforementioned DSP/other chips can provide computational capabilities to interpret, filter, activate, configure, and/or communicate to the transceiver. Dongle or connector blocks can house additional circuitry to create an analog to digital front end. The dongle or connector blocks can also include a plug-n-play electrical circuit for automatically identifying and recognizing the inserted sensing module (and automatically set up proper synchronization, timing, and other appropriate communication conditions).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">In another aspect of the invention, the EAU <b>120</b> can be implemented with a wireless network radio/transmitter/receiver. Example wireless networks that can be used in an underground location include any combination of WiFi, ZigBee, ANT, Bluetooth, infrared, and others. Thus, EAU <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate wirelessly with transceiver <b>140</b> and/or the sensors/monitoring devices and/or equipment located in vault <b>90</b>. This equipment can include sensored terminations or any of the other sensor types previously mentioned with added wireless communication capability.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">Further, the EAU <b>120</b> can include one or more radios, such as cellular modem, UHF radio (e.g., 900 MHz band), 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, or wifi-mesh, for transmission of the analyzed data through the transceiver antenna to a network SCADA or a service technician outside the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">In another aspect of the invention, the system <b>100</b> can be configured to operate under low power conditions. For example, a power harvester (not shown) can be utilized to provide sufficient power to system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">As mentioned above, the FCI detection system <b>100</b> can further include a transceiver unit <b>140</b> that communicates information from (and to) the sensored termination(s) <b>110</b>/EAU <b>120</b> to (and from) the above ground SCADA or wireless communications network. In addition, the transceiver unit <b>140</b> can further include a visual communication device or system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In another aspect, the system's FCI logic/functionality can be configured to match the trip logic in protection relays installed on the distribution network that it is monitoring. In this way, the detection and communication system can detect the same faults that caused a relay to switch after a fault.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">Thus, the method and system described herein can alert the central server that an incipient fault has occurred and has been detected at a specific location (possibly multiple) with magnitude and accurate timestamp information and can keep track of the number of incipient fault events detected at that location.
