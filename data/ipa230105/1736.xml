The decorative layer normally has a certain colour and/or a decorative motif, such as, for example an image, wording, a logo, a mark, a pattern, a design motif etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyurethane-based multilayer films are generally obtained by spreading and/or extruding different layers and comprise at least one adhesive layer made of thermoplastic polyurethane or mixtures of polyurethane with other thermoplastic materials compatible with polyurethane, in varying percentages, also referred to as hot melt layer, and at least one upper decorative layer or top layer, likewise comprising a polyurethane or mixtures of polyurethane with other thermoplastic materials compatible with polyurethane, in varying percentages, and optionally one or more dyes and/or pigments. The top layer can also be composed of fabric. The top decorative layer can further undergo printing processes in order to obtain particular decorative motifs or it can undergo laser engraving or plotter cutting. For example, the top decorative layer can have a white colour obtained by adding the pigment TiO<sub>2 </sub>to the thermoplastic polyurethane or other types of pigments and/or dyes and can have decorative motifs, such as, for example images, wording, drawings, logos, pattern, design motifs etc. The lower adhesive hot melt layer, by contrast, is generally low melting point thermoplastic polyurethane which is activated with heat and enables the adhesion of the multilayer to the desired substrate (fabric, item of clothing etc.).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One problem that is commonly encountered in the sector during the step of applying the heat necessary to make the multilayer adhere to the substrate, for example by means of a hot press, an iron or a thermal welding machine, is that the dye of the substrate can migrate, over a shorter or longer term, through the various layers of the multilayer and become mixed with the dye of the decorative layer, thus spoiling and compromising the desired aesthetic effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, this problem is resolved by making a multilayer film comprising an intermediate layer interposed between the adhesive layer and the decorative layer. The function of the intermediate layer is that of a &#x201c;barrier layer&#x201d;, i.e. a layer consisting of a material that prevents the dye from being able to migrate from the substrate on which the multilayer is applied, rise to the top layer and thus mar the appearance of the finished product.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Materials that can be used for the barrier layer against dye migration are copolymers such as, for example, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyamides such as, for example, MXD6, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) or the like, materials that are commonly used successfully above all in other fields, such as, for example, in the food packaging industry, for their typical properties as a barrier against oxygen and odours.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the textile industry, however, one of the largest problems connected to the use of such materials lies in the poor adhesion between the barrier layer (based on such materials) and the other layers of the film, with a consequent delamination of the finished multilayer. In fact, as the multilayer is made with materials of a different chemical nature and with different properties of interaction, it poses problems of stability linked to the poor adhesion and compatibility among the various layers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the light of the foregoing, it is evident that there is a need in the sector to obtain a thermo-adhesive multilayer film based on thermoplastic polyurethane that comprises a barrier layer against dye migration and at the same time does not give rise to problems of delamination of the layers once co-extruded and once applied to the desired substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prior art, some attempts were made to solve this technical problem, for example by inserting additional intermediate layers within the multilayer structure of the film, such as is disclosed, for example, in the patent publication US2012121869. This document describes the use of a barrier layer made of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) to prevent dye migration in textile applications. In particular, it suggests using said barrier layer as a layer interposed between an upper decorative layer made of &#x201c;soft&#x201d; polyurethane and a lower layer, which can consist of a thermo-adhesive polymer with a function similar to that of a hot melt layer. In one of the embodiments described in US2012121869, the technical problem of the adhesion between the EVOH barrier layer and the other layers is confronted by using two polyurethane-based intermediate layers that have the function of favouring adhesion between the various film layers, as they are in fact interposed respectively between the decorative layer and the barrier layer and between the barrier layer and the lower layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this case, however, the final multilayer film obtained, though it comprises a dye migration preventing barrier layer, has the disadvantage that, in order to assure a more effective adhesion of the various layers within the multilayer film, at least two extra adhesive layers must be added, thus making the extrusion operations for obtaining the final thermo-adhesive film more difficult without, moreover, completely solving the technical problem of delamination of the layers, thermoplastic polyurethane and EVOH materials being by nature scarcely compatible.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There thus remains a need the sector to have a multilayer film with an anti-dye migration barrier effect that does not pose problems of delamination once co-extruded and bonded with the desired decorative layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this context, the object of the present invention is to provide a thermo-adhesive multilayer film that not only has improved anti-dye migration performance compared to the currently available thermo-adhesive multilayer films, but at the same time also has the desired mechanical and adhesion properties, thus overcoming the problems of delamination of the film layers known in the sector.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, the technical problem of the adhesion between layers is overcome by the present invention, which provides a thermo-adhesive multilayer film based on thermoplastic polyurethane that comprises at least one barrier layer comprising at least one material with anti-dye migration properties, whose compatibility with the adjacent multilayer film layers comprising thermoplastic polyurethane, is assured by the presence of a mixture of at least one compatibilizing polymer and a thermoplastic polyurethane.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The use of modified co-polymers (such as, for example, ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymers, known by the trade name OREVAC&#xae;, polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride, likewise known by the trade name OREVAC&#xae; or terpolymers based on polyolefins containing functional groups such as maleic anhydride or epoxides&#x2014;for example glycidyl methacrylate&#x2014;known by the trade name Lotader&#xae; or the like) as compatibilizers to increase the compatibility of mixtures of thermoplastic polyurethanes and polyamides (Pan, Xianlu et al., Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology, 2017, 31(9), pp. 943-957) or of thermoplastic polyurethanes and ethylene vinyl acetate (Ma, Jianzhong et al., Polymer Bulletin 2014, 71(9), pp. 2219-2234) is known in the literature, but the use thereof in mixtures with thermoplastic polyurethanes is not known, nor is it known that such mixtures are capable of increasing the compatibility and adhesion of layers comprising polyurethane or mixtures of polyurethane with other thermoplastic materials in different percentages to a barrier layer comprising at least one material with anti-dye migration properties, as has been demonstrated in the case of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The thermo-adhesive multilayer film of the present invention thus solves the problems of the prior art listed above, since it can be easily co-extruded, bonded with a decorative layer and subsequently applied to a variety of different substrates, for example textile substrates, using known industrial and non-industrial systems, without incurring the unpleasant and undesirable effects of dye migration and/or delamination of the layers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention relates to a thermo-adhesive multilayer film based on thermoplastic polyurethane comprising at least one barrier layer B, said barrier layer B comprising at least one material with anti-dye migration properties selected in the group consisting of: ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyamides, preferably MXD6, cellulose derivatives, preferably cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and combinations thereof, said barrier layer B being interposed between at least two layers A and C, each comprising a mixture of at least one thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with at least one compatibilizing agent, said at least one compatibilizing agent being selected in the group consisting of co-polymers modified with maleic anhydride, co-polymers modified with epoxy groups, co-polymers containing hydroxyl groups and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the invention layers A and C comprise a mixture consisting of from 60 to 99% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 1 to 40% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, preferably from 65 to 95% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 5 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, more preferably from 70 to 90% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 10 to 30% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, even more preferably from 65 to 80% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 20 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, even more preferably from 65 to 75% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 25 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent. The present invention also relates to a decorative multilayer film comprising the thermo-adhesive multilayer film of the invention and a further decorative layer D. Said layer D preferably comprises at least one material selected from among a thermoplastic polyurethane material, a fabric, a nonwoven fabric and combinations thereof; said layer D optionally comprises at least one pigment and/or at least one dye that provides an aesthetic effect. Alternatively, the aesthetic effect can be obtained by printing or laser engraving on the surface of the layer D.

In fact, the use of a layer A (or C) consisting solely of the at least one compatibilizing agent or, similarly, consisting solely of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane, would not allow an effective adhesion to be obtained between the barrier layer and the other layers of the multilayer film of the present invention. Therefore, for the purposes of the present invention, said mixture of at least one thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with at least one compatibilizing agent is to be understood and considered as the actual agent that performs a compatibilizing action between the layers. The at least one thermoplastic polyurethane is selected in the group consisting of a polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethane, polycarbonate-based thermoplastic polyurethane, polyether-based thermoplastic polyurethane, aliphatic-based thermoplastic polyurethane, aromatic-based thermoplastic polyurethane and combinations thereof. The at least one thermoplastic polyurethane is preferably an aromatic-based and polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethane. In one embodiment of the invention, layer B comprises the at least one material with anti-dye migration properties in an amount comprised from 90 to 100%, preferably from 95 to 100% by weight, preferably from 99 to 100% by weight. Said at least one material with anti-dye migration properties is preferably ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, layer B comprises from 90 to 100%, preferably from 95 to 100% by weight, preferably from 99 to 100% by weight of EVOH. In one embodiment of the invention, layer A and layer C each comprise a mixture consisting of 60 to 99% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 1 to 40% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, preferably from 65 to 95% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 5 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, more preferably from 70 to 90% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 10 to 30% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, even more preferably from 65 to 80% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 20 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent, even more preferably from 65 to 75% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 25 to 35% by weight of the at least one compatibilizing agent.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, layer A and layer C comprise a mixture comprising from 60 to 99% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 1 to 40% by weight of a co-polymer modified with maleic anhydride, preferably from 65 to 95% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 5 to 35% by weight of a co-polymer modified with maleic anhydride, more preferably from 70 to 90% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 10 to 30% by weight of a co-polymer modified with maleic anhydride, even more preferably from 65 to 80% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 20 to 35% by weight of a co-polymer modified with maleic anhydride, even more preferably from 65 to 75% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 25 to 35% by weight of a co-polymer modified with maleic anhydride.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, layer A and layer C comprise a mixture comprising from 60 to 99% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 1 to 40% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer, preferably from 65 to 95% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 5 to 35% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer, more preferably from 70 to 90% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 10 to 30% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer, even more preferably from 65 to 80% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 20 to 35% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer, even more preferably from 65 to 75% by weight of the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane and from 25 to 35% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer. In one embodiment of the invention, layer A and layer C comprise a mixture comprising from 65% to 75% by weight of a thermoplastic polyurethane and from 25% to 35% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer and layer B consists of 99% to 100% by weight of the at least one material with anti-dye migration properties, said material preferably being EVOH.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The Applicant has found that the presence of at least one compatibilizing agent in a mixture with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane of layers A and C makes it possible to avoid the problem of delamination of the various layers of the multilayer film both before and after the multilayer adhesive film has undergone dry cleaning or washing with water. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said mixture of the at least one compatibilizing agent with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane of layers A and C is a compound, obtained by means of a compounding process in an extruder, of the at least one compatibilizing agent and the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane in the same percentage amounts described previously. In other words, said layers A and C can comprise the at least one compatibilizing agent in a mixture with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane, said mixture being:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0033">(i) a mixture obtained by direct mixing, in an extruder, of the at least one compatibilizing agent with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0034">(ii) or, alternatively, according to a preferred embodiment, said mixture being obtained by extrusion of a compound obtained through a process of compounding, in a previous extruder, of the at least one compatibilizing agent with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">This second embodiment is particularly preferred, since the formation of said compound makes it possible to obtain a more homogeneous mixture of the at least one compatibilizing agent with the at least one thermoplastic polyurethane once layers A and C have been formed. For both embodiments, the Applicant has in any case demonstrated the advantages connected to said mixture, which enables the problems of delamination of the various layers of the multilayer film of the invention to be avoided or considerably reduced. This result is surprising if one considers that, as demonstrated by the Applicant in the comparative experiments included in the examples section, in the configuration wherein the at least one compatibilizing agent is used in a layer that is separate from the polyurethane layer, and interposed between the barrier layer B and the other polyurethane layers, delamination occurs. In other words, without wishing to be bound to a specific theory, the Applicant has found that using a layer consisting solely of the at least one compatibilizing agent does not provide the same performance in terms of adhesion between the layers of the multilayer film that one obtains, by contrast, when the same at least one compatibilizing agent is used in a mixture (as described above) with at least one thermoplastic polyurethane. The Applicant has also surprisingly found, as shown by the experiments conducted and included herein, that the best results in terms of resistance to delamination are obtained when the rheological properties, measured using the melt flow rate (MFR) measured at 190&#xb0; C. and 2.16 kg (according to standard ISO 1133), of the thermoplastic polyurethane, the material of the barrier layer and the compatibilizing agent are similar. Similar rheological properties means that the three materials show a value of the MFR measured at 190&#xb0; C. and 2.16 kg (according to standard ISO 1133) such that the difference between the MFR of the thermoplastic polyurethane and that of the material of the barrier layer is comprised between 10 g/10&#x2032; and 35 g/10&#x2032;, preferably between 12 g/10&#x2032; and 32 g/10&#x2032;, more preferably between 14 g/10&#x2032; and 20 g/10&#x2032;, and the difference between the MFR of the compatibilizing agent and that of the material of the barrier layer is comprised between 2 g/10&#x2032; and 5 g/10&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">The Applicant has also verified that the concentrations of the thermoplastic polymer and of the compatibilizing agent in layers A and C can be varied within the specified intervals (1-40% by weight, preferably 5-35% by weight, more preferably 25-35% by weight of compatibilizing agent) based on the properties in terms of the melt flow index of the same compared to the melt flow index of the material of the barrier layer B. For example, if it is desired to use a thermoplastic polyurethane with a melt flow index similar to that of the barrier layer material, it is possible to increase the concentration thereof and decrease that of the compatibilizing agent in the mixture of layer A or C; on the other hand, if the melt flow index of the thermoplastic polyurethane deviates from that of the barrier layer material, it will be necessary to decrease the concentration of the polyurethane and increase that of the compatibilizing agent. Furthermore, the Applicant has demonstrated with the experiments included herein that better anti-delamination properties and better aesthetic effects can be obtained when the mixture between the thermoplastic polymer and compatibilizing agent is obtained by extrusion, that is, when a compound is prepared. In particular, if the extruder used to form the compound is a twin-screw extruder, the process of mixing the two materials will be more intimate, with the consequent formation of a more uniform mixed compound that has better aesthetic effects. The thermo-adhesive multilayer film of the invention is obtained by means of an extrusion process that enables bonding of the various film layers. The extrusion process is preferably conducted with an extruder, preferably a triple-screw extruder for co-extruding layers A, B and C so as to obtain a multilayer film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. The extrusion process is preferably conducted at a temperature comprised between 170 and 220&#xb0; C. According to a preferred embodiment, layer A and/or layer C can be extruded using a support (support layer E) so as to obtain the thermo-adhesive multilayer film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>. Said support layer E is selected in the group consisting of: paper silicone-coated on one side, paper silicone-coated on two sides, PET and combinations thereof. Alternatively, said layer E can be a layer comprising polyethylene which is co-extruded simultaneously with the co-extrusion of the layers A, B and C. In one embodiment, the present invention relates therefore to a thermo-adhesive multilayer film <b>1</b><i>b </i>based on thermoplastic polyurethane comprising at least one barrier layer B, said barrier layer B comprising at least one material with anti-dye migration properties selected in the group consisting of: ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyamides, preferably MXD6, cellulose derivatives, preferably cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and combinations thereof, interposed between at least two layers A and C comprising a mixture of at least one thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with at least one compatibilizing agent, said thermo-adhesive multilayer film further comprising at least one support layer E applied to layer A and/or C. In one embodiment of the invention, layer A has a thickness comprised between 10 and 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 30 and 40 &#x3bc;m, more preferably between 35 and 45 &#x3bc;m, whilst layer C has a thickness comprised between 10 and 90 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 30 and 50 &#x3bc;m. The thickness of the barrier layer B, on the other hand, is comprised between 1 and 70 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 10 and 30 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 15 and 25 &#x3bc;m. Calibration of the thickness of the barrier layer makes it possible to obtain a thermo-adhesive multilayer film with excellent anti-dye migration properties, and which thus also works well as a protective barrier film. In fact, if layer B comprising at least one material with anti-dye migration properties is too thin, at the time of extrusion with the other layers there could be areas in which said at least one material with anti-dye migration properties is not present, with the consequence of impairing the desired barrier properties. However, if the thickness of layer B is too great, the thermo-adhesive multilayer film would have excessive stiffness as well as little elasticity; these are unpleasant, undesirable characteristics, particularly in the case of applications in the field of textiles, clothing or footwear. In one embodiment, the invention also relates to a decorative multilayer film <b>2</b> comprising the thermo-adhesive multilayer film as described above and a decorative layer D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">In the decorative multilayer film, the decorative layer D can be applied to layer A or, alternatively, to layer C.

In particular, the improvement effect is more visible in tests 25 and 26, which involve the use of TPU1, as opposed to tests 27 and 28, which involve the use of TPU-2 as the thermoplastic polyurethane. This is ascribable to the smaller difference in terms of MFR between the three components of the TPU, EVOH and TER multilayer and thus to the greater rheological compatibility between the materials. The adhesion results were comparable to those of test 24; consequently, there were no problems of delamination of the layers on the various fabrics.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0109">Example family 3 shows the dye migration tests performed on decorated articles of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 3.1</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0110">The samples of tests 25 and 26 (example 2.2), bonded to a decorative layer D according to parameters shown in Table 7, were subjected to migration tests following their application on fabrics which are known to lead to dye migration problems.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0111">For every sample, the decorative multilayer film was cut into the shape of a rectangle having dimensions of 3 cm&#xd7;4 cm and applied on the substrate by means of a press at 120&#xb0; C. for 20 seconds and at 6 bar.
