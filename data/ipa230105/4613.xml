Thus, those of ordinary skilled in the art shall understand that, variations and modifications can be made on the embodiments described herein, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. Likewise, for clarity and conciseness, descriptions of well-known functions and structures are omitted in the following description.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to describe a method for displaying map points of interest provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure more clearly, a possible application scenario of the method for displaying map points of interest provided by this embodiment of the present disclosure will be exemplarily described below. It is to be understood that, an example below is the possible application scenario of the method for displaying map points of interest provided by this embodiment of the present disclosure. In other optional embodiments, the method for displaying map points of interest provided by the present disclosure may also be applicable to other possible application scenarios. The example below does not impose any limitations thereto.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">There may be multiple places that a user may be interested in an area shown in a map. For example, assuming that the area shown in the map is an urban area of some city, a movie theater, a restaurant, a hotel, a museum, an airport, a train station, a shopping mall and the like in the urban areas may be the places of interest to the user. When all points of interest used for expressing these places are displayed in the map, there may be too many points of interest displayed in the map, causing the places that the user is actually interested in to be difficult to effectively find out. Therefore, points of interest are required to be selectively displayed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an implementation, relevant personnel, such as experts in the field of intelligent transportation, may set selecting rules based on experience, and select some points of interest from the points of interest for display according to the set selecting rules.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, the experience of the relevant personnel is often limited. Thus, the selecting rules set by the relevant personnel are often applicable to certain application scenarios, and are difficult to apply to other application scenarios. In other words, in some application scenarios, positions indicated by the points of interest that are selected according to the selecting rules set by the relevant personnel are not the positions that the user is actually interested in. That is, the accuracy of the selected points of interest is relatively low.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for displaying map points of interest according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At step S<b>101</b>, features corresponding to multiple candidate points of interest are acquired.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step S<b>102</b>, predicted popularity of the multiple candidate points of interest is determined according to a mapping relation between each feature and each popularity and the features of the multiple candidate points of interest, and the mapping relation is determined based on user operations in a historical time period.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step S<b>103</b>, the candidate points of interest of which predicted popularity meets a preset popularity condition is displayed in a map.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Through this embodiment, according to the mapping relation between each feature and each popularity, the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest is obtained by mapping the features of the candidate points of interest. Since the mapping relation is determined based on the frequency of operations performed by the user for each sample point of interest in the historical time period, and the user operations performed by the user are often targeted at objects of interest to the user, the frequency of the operations performed by the user on each sample point of interest in the historical time period can reflect, to a certain extent, the points of interest that the user is actually interested in. Thus, the predicted popularity determined according to the mapping relation can reflect the degree of interest of the user in each candidate point of interest. Therefore, when the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest meets the preset popularity condition, it can be considered that the user has a certain degree of interest in the candidate points of interest. That is, the candidate points of interest are the points of interest that the user is interested in. In this way, by displaying the candidate points of interest of which predicted popularity meets the preset popularity condition in the map, the points of interest that the user is interested in can be relatively and accurately displayed in the map, so that the accuracy of the displayed points of interest can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The places expressed by the candidate points of interest in step S<b>101</b> should be located in an area displayed in the map. Exemplarily, assuming that the area displayed in the map is an urban area of a city A, a point of interest expressing a train station of a city B is not the candidate points of interest. In addition, the places expressed by the candidate points of interest may include all places that the user may be interested in within the area displayed in the map, and may also include some places that the user may be interested in within the area displayed in the map. Exemplarily, assuming that the area displayed in the map is the urban area of the city A, and in the urban area A, the places that the user may be interested in include a train station, an airport, a cinema, and a hotel, the candidate points of interest may include the points of interest for expressing the train station, the airport, the cinema, and the hotel, and may also include the points of interest for expressing the train station and the airport, but does not include the points of interest for expressing the cinema and the hotel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The features corresponding to the points of interest may be any features that characterize factors related to the points of interest, including but not limited to at least some of the following features: user-side features used for characterizing each user who uses the map, scene features used for characterizing the scene at which each user uses the map, and points of interest features used for characterizing the points of interest corresponding to the features. The user-side features, the scene features, and the points of interest features will be described in detail below, so that details are not described again herein. It is to be understood that, points of interest are used to be displayed to each user who uses the map, so that this user can find the places of interest based on the displayed points of interest. Therefore, each user who uses the map is a factor related to the points of interest, and the points of interest are displayed in the map. Thus, the scene at which each user uses the map is the scene at which the points of interest are displayed to this user. In this way, the scene is the factor related to the points of interest. In addition, the points of interest are obviously the factor related to the points of interest.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step S<b>102</b>, the sample points of interest may be completely the same points of interest as the candidate points of interest, may also be partially the same points of interest as the candidate points of interest, and may further be points of interest completely different from the candidate points of interest. In addition, the quantity of the sample points of interest may be the same as or different from the quantity of the candidate points of interest. Exemplarily, assuming that the candidate points of interest are points of interest 1 to 4, the sample points of interest may be the points of interest 1 to 4, may also be the points of interest 3 to 7, and may further be the points of interest 5 to 10.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the user may include the user who is an executive subject of the method for displaying points of interest in the map provided in an embodiment of the present disclosure (hereinafter referred to as a target user), may not include the target user, and the quantity of the user may refer to one user or multiple users. The present disclosure does not impose any limitations thereto. The operations performed by the user for the points of interest include, but are not limited to: clicking the points of interest in the map, searching for the positions expressed by the points of interest, and so on.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is to be understood that, the user often perform the operations on the points of interest. Therefore, it may be considered that the higher the frequency of the user operating on one point of interest, the more the user interested in this point of interest. Exemplarily, assuming that the user has searched for the sample point of interest &#x201c;cinema&#x201d; for ten times within the historical time period and searched for the sample points of interest &#x201c;airport&#x201d; for one time, it may be considered that the user is more interested in the sample point of interest &#x201c;cinema&#x201d; than the sample point of interest &#x201c;airport&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, a certain commonality often exists between the candidate points of interest and the sample points of interest. For example, assuming that the candidate points of interest include a cinema A and the sample points of interest include a cinema B, although the cinema A and the cinema B are two different cinemas, a certain commonality exists between the cinema A and the cinema B as both the cinema A and the cinema B are cinemas. For another example, the candidate points of interest include a popular destination and the sample points of interest include a popular restaurant, although the popular destination and the popular restaurant are different points of interest, both the popular destination and the popular restaurant have a commonality of high popularity. Since the candidate points of interest and the sample points of interest often have a certain commonality, the interest of the user in the sample points of interest can reflect the interest of the user in the candidate points of interest to a certain extent. That is, based on the mapping relation obtained by determining the frequency of the operations performed by the user for each sample point of interest within the historical time period, the predicted popularity of the multiple candidate points of interest may be determined.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Different predicted popularity may be expressed according to different application scenarios. Exemplarily, the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest may be expressed in a manner of using a popularity value, and may also be expressed by using a relative comparison. Exemplarily, assuming that there are three candidate points of interest, which are respectively recorded as the candidate points of interest 1 to 3, the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest 1 to 3 may be expressed as follows: the candidate point of interest 1 has a popularity value of 0.8, the candidate point of interest 2 has a popularity value of 0.5, and the candidate point of interest 3 has a popularity value of 0.9. The predicted popularity may also be expressed as follows: the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest 3&#x3e;the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest 1&#x3e;the predicted popularity of the candidate points of interest 2.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, in an optional embodiment, the relative comparison may also be expressed in the form of a sequence. For example, the relative comparison may be expressed by the sequence obtained by sorting the multiple candidate points of interest in a descending order of the predicted popularity. For example, the relationship that the predicted popularity of the candidate point of interest 3&#x3e;the predicted popularity of the candidate point of interest 1&#x3e;the predicted popularity of the candidate point of interest 2 may be expressed with the sequence {the candidate point of interest 3, the candidate point of interest 1, the candidate point of interest 2}.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The determination of the mapping relation will be described in detail below, and is not described again herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>103</b>, the preset popularity condition may be different according to actual requirements and different expression forms of the predicted popularity. Exemplarily, when the predicted popularity is expressed in the form of the popularity value, the preset popularity condition may be that the popularity value is higher than a preset popularity threshold value. For example, by still taking the example in the foregoing S<b>102</b> as an example, assuming that the preset popularity threshold value is 0.7, the candidate point of interest 1 and the candidate point of interest 3 may be displayed in the map. The preset popularity threshold value may be calculated based on the actual requirements of the user or according to a preset rule. For example, the user may set the preset popularity threshold value to 0.6 based on the actual requirements. Alternatively, a statistic value of the predicted popularity of the multiple candidate points of interest may be counted as the preset popularity threshold value. The statistic value may refer to any of numerical values obtained through statistics, such as arithmetic mean and median.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the predicted popularity is expressed in the form of the relative comparison, or when the predicted popularity is expressed in the form of the popularity value, the preset popularity condition may also be the candidate points of interest that are located before a preset order when being sorted according to the predicted popularity in the descending order. For example, by still taking the example in the foregoing S<b>102</b> as an example, assuming that the preset order is the second place, since when the predicted popularity is sorted in the descending order, the candidate point of interest 1 and the candidate point of interest 3 are located in the top 2 positions, the candidate point of interest 2 is located at the third position, so that the candidate points of interest 1 and the candidate points of interest 3 may be displayed in the map.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The determination of the mapping relation is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for determining a mapping relation according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step S<b>201</b>, features corresponding to multiple sample points of interest are acquired.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A feature type corresponding to the sample points of interest should be the same as a feature type corresponding to the candidate points of interest. Exemplarily, when features corresponding to the candidate points of interest include the user-side features, features corresponding to the sample points of interest should also include the user-side features. In addition, when the features corresponding to the candidate points of interest do not include the user-side features, the features corresponding to the sample points of interest should also not include the user-side features.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step S<b>202</b>, observed popularity of the multiple sample points of interest is acquired based on the frequency of operations performed by the user for the multiple sample points of interest in the historical time period.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The frequency based on which the mapping relation is determined may be the frequency that the user actually performs the operations on each sample point of interest within the historical time period, and may refer to the frequency that the user expects to perform the operations on each sample point of interest within the historical time period. The frequency may be expressed either in the form of a numerical value, or in the form of the relative comparison.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Exemplarily, assuming that there are three sample points of interest, which are respectively recorded as the sample points of interest 1 to 3, in an optional embodiment, it may be the number of times that the user performs the operations on each sample points of interest within the historical time period. Assuming that within the historical time period, the user searches the sample point of interest 1 for five times, searches the sample point of interest 2 for three times, and searches the sample point of interest 3 for two times, the frequency of the operations performed by the user on the sample points of interest may be expressed as: the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 1 is 0.5, the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 2 is 0.3, and the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 3 is 0.2. The frequency of the operations performed by the user on the sample points of interest may also be expressed as: the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 1&#x3e;the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 2&#x3e;the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 3. In addition, the relative comparison may also be expressed in the form of the sequence. For example, the sequence {the sample point of interest 1, the sample point of interest 2, the sample point of interest 3} may be used for expressing the relationship of the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 1&#x3e;the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 2&#x3e;the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 3.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another optional embodiment, it may also be the frequency that a sample user expects to perform the operations on each point of interest within the historical time period based on self-experience. Exemplarily, assuming that the sample user thinks that this sample user has the most interest in the sample point of interest 1 according to self-experience, has an average interest in the sample point of interest 2, and has the least interest in the sample point of interest 3, the sample user annotates the sequence {the sample point of interest 1, the sample point of interest 2, the sample point of interest 3} according the self-experience. In other optional embodiments, the frequency annotated by the sample user may also be expressed in other forms other than the sequence. The other forms of frequency expression may refer to the relevant description in the preceding text, which will not be repeated herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, the observed popularity of the sample points of interest may be the frequency of the operations performed by the user on the sample points of interest within the historical period of time, and may also be calculated based on the frequency. Exemplarily, in an optional embodiment, the frequency of operations performed by the user for the multiple sample points of interest in the historical time period may be taken as the observed popularity of the sample points of interest. Exemplarily, by taking the foregoing example as an example, assuming that the frequency annotated by the user is expressed in the form of the sequence {the sample point of interest 1, the sample point of interest 2, the sample point of interest 3}, the sequence may be taken as the sequence for expressing the observed popularity of the sample points of interest.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another optional embodiment, the multiple sample points of interest are sorted based on the frequency, so as to obtain a sample point of interest sequence for expressing the observed popularity of the multiple sample points of interest. Exemplarily, assuming that there are three sample points of interest, which are respectively recorded as the sample points of interest 1 to 3, and further assuming that the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 1 is 0.5, the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 2 is 0.3, and the frequency of the operations performed on the sample point of interest 3 is 0.2, a sample point of interest sequence {the sample point of interest 1, the sample point of interest 2, the sample point of interest 3} may be obtained by sorting the multiple sample points of interest according to the descending frequency order (in other embodiments, it may also be in other order, for example, an ascending order). The sample point of interest sequence may be used for expressing a relationship of the observed popularity of the sample point of interest 1&#x3e;the observed popularity of the sample point of interest 2&#x3e;the observed popularity of the sample point of interest 3.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is to be understood that, in order to accurately determine the mapping relation between each feature and each popularity, it often needs to be based on the features and observed popularity of a large number of sample points of interest. When the observed popularity of each sample point of interest is obtained in a manner of manual annotation, a high manual cost of the determined mapping relation may be caused. Through this embodiment, based on the frequency of the operations performed by the user on the sample points of interest within the historical time period, the sample point of interest sequence used for expressing the observed popularity of each sample point of interest can be calculated, without manually annotating by the user. Therefore, the manual cost required for the determination of the mapping relation can be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At step S<b>203</b>, the mapping relation between each feature and each observed popularity is determined based on the features corresponding to the multiple sample points of interest and the observed popularity of the multiple sample points of interest.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The expression of the mapping relation may also be expressed in different forms according to different application scenarios. For example, it may be expressed in the form of a function, may also be expressed in the form of a neural network model, and may further be expressed in the form of other algorithm models other than the neural network model.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Exemplarily, in an optional embodiment, the mapping relation may be expressed in the form of a sorting model. In this embodiment, the sorting model for expressing the mapping relation between each feature and each observed popularity is obtained through training based on the features corresponding to the multiple sample points of interest, the sample point of interest sequence, and a preset sorting learning algorithm. In this example, the trained sorting model is the mapping relation between each feature and each popularity. Through this embodiment, the sorting learning algorithm may be utilized to enhance the accuracy of the determined mapping relation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The preset sorting learning algorithm may be different sorting learning algorithms according to actual requirements, including but not limited to a PointWise Approach, a PairWise Approach, a ListWise Approach, and the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Through the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, based on the frequency of the operations performed by the user on the multiple sample points of interest within the historical time period, the observed popularity of each sample point of interest may be determined, so that the mapping relation between each feature and each popularity based on the features of the sample points of interest and the observed popularity of each sample point of interest. That is, the accuracy of the determined mapping relation can be enhanced through this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The user-side features, the scene features, and the point of interest features will be separately described below.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The user-side features include, but are not limited to, at least some of the features of ages, genders, education levels, interests, whether the user owns a vehicle, residential addresses, office locations, and whether the user is in a different place. A remote location may mean that a city where the user is located is different from a city where the user lives, and may also mean that a city currently displayed in the map is different from the city where the user lives.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is to be understood that, users with different user-side features may be interested in different points of interest. For example, young people may be interested in movie theaters and amusement parks, but not in tea houses and bird and flower markets. The elderly may be interested in the teahouses and the bird and flower markets, but not in the movie theaters and the amusement parks. For another example, the users who own vehicles may be interested in car wash shops and car sales service 4s (Sale Sparepart Service Survey) shops, while the users who do not own vehicles may not be interested in the car wash shops and the car sales service 4s shops.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The scene features include, but are not limited to, at least some features in scale dimensions, operation sequence contexts of the users, and weathers. The scale dimensions are used for characterizing the scale of the map used by the user. For example, the scale dimensions may be used for characterizing the scale of the map used by the user as 1:1000, 1:500, 1:100, and so on. The operation sequence contexts of the users are used for characterizing a contextual relationship between the user operations performed by the user. Exemplarily, it may be used for characterizing the following user operations successively performed by the user. A keyword &#x201c;metro line 1&#x201d; is searched, and then the map is dragged. The weathers may refer to the weather when the user uses the map, such as sunny, light rain, heavy snow, etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is to be understood that, in scenes with different scene features, the user may be interested in different points of interest. For example, an area displayed in the map is relatively small when the scale is 1:100, and the points of interest that occupy a larger area may not be fully displayed in the map. The area displayed in the map is relatively large when the scale is 1:1000, so that the points of interest that occupy a small area is hard to relatively and accurately display in the map. In this way, when the user adjusts the scale of the map to be 1:100, the user is often interested in the points of interest that occupy a small area, such as a restaurant and a convenience store. When the user adjusts the scale of the map to be 1:1000, the user is often interested in the points of interest that occupy a large area, such as a train station and a museum.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For another example, when the operation sequence contexts of the users are used for characterizing the following user operations successively performed by the user. The keyword &#x201c;metro line 1&#x201d; is searched, and then the map is dragged. After that, it may be considered that the user is observing areas along the metro line 1 by dragging the map. Therefore, it may be considered that the user is interested in the points of interest along the metro line 1. When the operation sequence contexts of the users are used for characterizing the following user operations successively performed by the user: the keyword &#x201c;metro line 1&#x201d; is searched, and then the map is enlarged, after that it may be considered that the user is determining a specific position of an entrance of the metro line 1 by enlarging the map. In this case, it may be considered that the user is interested in the entrance of the metro line 1.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For another example, when it is sunny, the user may be interested in outdoor points of interest, such as a park and an outdoor basketball court. When it rained heavily, the user may be interested in indoor points of interest, such as a library and an indoor basketball court.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The points of interest features include, but are not limited to, at least some features of the size of the points of interest, search popularity, click popularity, whether a point of interest faces a street, and a distance between each point of interest and a target position.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The size of each point of interest may be used for either characterizing the floor area of this point of interest, or characterizing the building area of this point of interest. It is to be understood that, in some scenes, the user may be interested in a point of interest with a large floor area, while in other scenes, the user may be interested in the a point of interest with a small floor area. Exemplarily, the related examples of the foregoing scale dimensions may be referred to. Therefore, the size of the each point of interest can be used as a criterion for whether the user is interested in this point of interest.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The search popularity may be used for characterizing the frequency of the points of interest being retrieved. Exemplarily, assuming that within a same time window, each user has retrieved the point of interest A for a total of 100,000 times and the point of interest B for a total of 110,000 times, it can be considered that the point of interest B has the higher search popularity than the point of interest A. It is to be understood that, the points of interest retrieved by the user may be considered as the points of interest that the user is interested in. Therefore, when the search popularity of one point of interest is higher, it can be considered that the more users are interested in this point of interest, so that the more likely the user is to be interested in this point of interest. That is, the search popularity can be used as a criterion for whether the user is interested in each point of interest.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The click popularity may be used for characterizing the frequency of the points of interest being clicked. Exemplarily, assuming that within the same time window, each user has clicked the point of interest A for a total of 120,000 times and the point of interest B for a total of 100,000 times, it can be considered that the point of interest A has the higher click popularity than the points of interest B. It is to be understood that, the points of interest clicked by the user may be considered as the points of interest that the user is interested in. Therefore, when the search popularity of one point of interest is higher, it can be considered that the more users are interested in this point of interest, so that the more likely the user is to be interested in this point of interest. That is, the click popularity can be used as a criterion for whether the user is interested in this point of interest.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The point of interest faces a street is used for characterizing that this point of interest is adjacent to the street. It is to be understood that, the point of interest adjacent to the street have relatively convenient traffic, while the point of interest that is not adjacent to the street may have a relatively quiet environment due to a low pedestrian flow. In some scenes, the user may be more interested in the point of interest with the convenient traffic. In some other scenes, the user may be interested in the point of interest in a quiet environment. Exemplarily, when the user searches for a restaurant, the user may require the restaurant with convenient transportation. Therefore, the user may be more interested in the restaurant facing the street. When the user searches for a bookstore, the user may require a bookstore with the quiet environment, so that the user may be more interested in the bookstore that does not face the street. Thus, whether the point of interest faces a street may be used as a criterion for whether the user is interested in this point of interest.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The target position may refer to a position at which the user is located, may also be a destination of a trip of the user, and may further refer to any position specified by the user. The distance between the point of interest and the target position may refer to a linear distance between the position at which the point of interest is located and the target position, and may also refer to a path distance of any path between the position at which the point of interest is located and the target position. It is to be understood that, in some scenes, the user may be interested in the point of interest that is closer to the target position, while in other scenes, the user may be interested in the point of interest that is far away from the target position. Exemplarily, by taking the target position as the position at which the user is located as an example, the user may be more interested in the point of interest that are closer to the target position in order to reduce the time cost of arriving at the point of interest. The user may also be more interested in the point of interest that is far away from the target position due to the desire to improve moods by going on a long journey. Therefore, the distance of the point of interest from the target position may be used as a criterion for whether the user is interested in this point of interest.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It may be learned from the above analysis that, the user-side features, the scene features, and the points of interest features can all reflect, to a certain extent, whether the user is interested in the points of interest. Therefore, when the features include at least some of the user-side features, the scene features, and the points of interest features, logical relevance between each feature and each popularity is stronger, so that the robustness of the determined mapping relation can be better.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an apparatus for displaying map points of interest according an embodiment of to the present disclosure.
