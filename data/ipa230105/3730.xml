This cost is expected to increase due to the rising prevalence of the disease, attributed to an ageing population.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Almost 90% of prostate cancers are detected by means of screening. The current method of diagnosis relies on a combination of a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test and tissue biopsy. The PSA blood test fails to detect 15% of prostate cancers and although high levels of PSA can be a sign of prostate cancer, PSA levels may also be raised for other reasons, such as the presence of a urinary track invention (UTI), undertaking vigorous exercise, or taking certain medication. Testing PSA levels only is therefore prone to under- and over-diagnosis (aggressive cancers can be missed and false positive rates can be up to 75%).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PSA levels are also unable to differentiate between benign and aggressive forms of the disease, and therefore are not informative for disease prognosis or treatment selection. It is estimated that less than 15% of men diagnosed using PSA go on to develop fatal prostate cancer. The main issue with the PSA test is that it has a very low PPV (30-65%), which is caused by a number of factors, most important of which is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patients with BPH are unlikely to develop prostate cancer. At the moment, the only way to know for sure if a man has prostate cancer is to undergo a tissue biopsy, an invasive procedure that is expensive, painful, can lead to infections, and only provides a snapshot of the tumour. During the procedure, a doctor or nurse uses a thin needle to take small samples of tissue from the prostate (10 to 12 small pieces of tissue from different areas of the prostate). The tissue is then looked at under a microscope to check for cancer. If prostate cancer is detected the results will also show how aggressive it is based on its Gleason score.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is an urgent unmet clinical need to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer and to develop tests that distinguish between slow growing tumours which don't need treating, and aggressive prostate cancers that need urgent intervention.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Glycosylation enzymes are intracellular enzymes that are predominantly located in the Golgi or the endoplasmic reticulum of a cell (Stanley P, Golgi glycosylation; Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2011 Apr. 1; 3(4)). They are responsible for attaching glycans to proteins or other organic molecules via glycosylation, a co-translational and post-translational modification that occurs during protein synthesis within the cell.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has previously been observed that glycans change dramatically in prostate cancer and that they have key roles in driving tumour growth and spread. Furthermore, RNA levels of eight glycosylation enzymes have previously been shown to increase in clinical prostate cancer tissue (Munkley et al. 2016). Intracellular glycosylation processes therefore appear to be affected in prostate cancer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is based on the surprising finding that in men with prostate cancer a specific subset of intracellular glycosylation enzymes are secreted from cells into biological fluids such as blood and urine. The presence of these enzymes in biological fluids is unexpected, as they are not secreted out of the cell under normal circumstances. The levels of these glycosylation enzymes in biological fluids such as blood and urine may be used as biomarkers for prostate cancer, either individually, or in combination. Testing biological fluids (as opposed to tissue biopsy) is advantageous, as it does not require invasive, painful procedures. Furthermore, analysing circulating biomarkers provide a more comprehensive view of the tumour than a needle biopsy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors have tested for the presence of several glycosylation enzymes in urine or blood obtained from men with prostate cancer. Surprisingly, they found that changes in the protein levels of GCNT1, GALNT7, FUT8 and ST6GAL1 can be detected in urine or blood samples from men with prostate cancer, whereas other glycosylation enzymes (such as CSGALNACT1) could not be detected in these samples (data not shown). Assays that detect the presence of one or more of these proteins in such biological fluids may therefore be useful for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and patient stratification for treatment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The data presented herein shows that detection of GCNT1, GALNT7 and/or ST6GAL1 protein in blood or urine provides a means for distinguishing between prostate cancer and control samples (e.g. samples with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)) more accurately than PSA testing. This particular combination of three markers (GCNT1, GALNT7 and ST6GAL1; referred to as &#x201c;Glycoscore&#x201d; herein) is therefore particularly beneficial when testing for prostate cancer per se. The data presented herein show that detection of FUT8 protein in such biological fluids can also be used to distinguish between prostate cancer and control samples (e.g. samples with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The data also show that GCNT1, ST6GAL1 and FUT8 protein levels in blood or urine can be used to accurately distinguish between localised and metastatic prostate cancer, which cannot be done with PSA. This particular combination of three markers (GCNT1, ST6GAL1 and FUT8; referred to as &#x201c;metastatic Glycoscore&#x201d; herein) is therefore particularly beneficial when trying to distinguish between metastatic and localised prostate cancer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As will be noted by a person of skill in the art, the term &#x201c;glycoscore&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a value that is obtained from a combination of at least two markers. Typically, but not exclusively, the term &#x201c;glycoscore&#x201d; is used herein to refer to the combination of GCNT1, GALNT7 and ST6GAL1; and the term &#x201c;metastatic glycoscore&#x201d; is typically but not exclusively used herein to refer to the combination of GCNT1, ST6GAL1 and FUT8.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The markers provided herein are also shown to be useful in distinguishing between prostate cancers of different Gleason score cytologies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">GCNT1, GALNT7, FUT8 and/or ST6GAL1 are therefore useful biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and patient stratification, without the need for tissue biopsy. The methods and markers described herein may therefore be used to reduce the large number of unnecessary tissue biopsies performed each year and identify patients with aggressive cancers that might have been missed by current PSA testing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The markers described herein are typically detected in the biological fluid (e.g. blood or urine) at the protein level but they may also be detected by enzyme activity. They may be may be detected at the protein level using any suitable technique. For example, a sandwich ELISA test as described in the Examples section below may be used. Such methods can easily be implemented into a clinical workflow and can performed in a few hours using small quantities of amounts of bodily fluid (e.g. blood or urine). Measurement of protein levels is advantageous (over e.g. methods that measure RNA or DNA markers) as protein samples tend to be more robust, which makes handling easier.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The markers described herein have been detected in blood and urine. However, any other suitable biological fluids (into which the glycosylation enzymes GCNT1, GALNT7, FUT8 and/or ST6GAL1 may be secreted) may also be used. For example, a saliva sample, or a prostatic fluid sample (such as a prostatic secretion sample) may also be used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one aspect, the invention provides an in vitro method for diagnosing prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing prostate cancer in a subject, the method comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">a) determining the level of one or more biomarker in a biological fluid sample from the subject, wherein the one or more biomarker is selected from the group consisting of: GALNT7, ST6GAL1, FUT8 and GCNT1;<br/>b) comparing the level of the one or more biomarker with the level of the same biomarker in a control sample or with a pre-determined reference level for the same biomarker; and<br/>c) identifying a subject as having prostate cancer or as having an increased risk of developing prostate cancer if the comparison in step b) indicates that the subject has one or more of the following: an increased level of GALNT7 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of ST6GAL1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; a decreased level of GCNT1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of FUT8 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Suitably, the control sample may be from a control subject that does not have prostate cancer. Optionally the control sample may be from a subject that has benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis or an enlarged prostate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">Suitably, the pre-determined reference level may be the average level of the biomarker in a control subject that does not have prostate cancer. Optionally the pre-determined reference level may be the average level of the biomarker in a subject that has benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis or an enlarged prostate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The inventors have shown that GCNT1 levels decrease in the blood and urine of subjects with prostate cancer when compared to subjects that do not have prostate cancer or have BPH, and that the levels of GCNT1 correlate with Gleason score. In addition, they have shown that for patients with prostate cancer, levels of GCNT1 increase for metastatic prostate cancer subjects compared to subjects with non-metastatic, localised, prostate cancer. GCNT1 levels can therefore be used in diagnosing prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing prostate cancer in a subject (diagnosed by a decrease compared to controls with no prostate cancer or BPH), and also in diagnosing metastatic prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer in a subject (diagnosed by an increase compared to localised, non-metastatic cancer).

ST6GAL1, GCNT1, GALNT7 and/or FUT8 have also been found to be particularly useful when distinguishing between localised prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer in a subject. These markers can therefore be used to diagnose or determine the risk of developing prostate cancer per se, or more specifically be used to determine the type of prostate cancer (localised vs metastatic). One or more (e.g. two, three or four) of these biomarkers can advantageously be used in any of the methods, kits, assays, or uses described herein.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Methods for Diagnosing Prostate Cancer or Determining the Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer in a Subject</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0108">In one aspect, an in vitro method for diagnosing prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing prostate cancer in a subject is provided, the method comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0119" num="0000">a) determining the level of one or more biomarker in a biological fluid sample from the subject, wherein the one or more biomarker is selected from the group consisting of: GALNT7, ST6GAL1, FUT8 and GCNT1;<br/>b) comparing the level of the one or more biomarker with the level of the same biomarker in a control sample or with a pre-determined reference level for the same biomarker; and<br/>c) identifying a subject as having prostate cancer or as having an increased risk of developing prostate cancer if the comparison in step b) indicates that the subject has one or more of the following: an increased level of GALNT7 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of ST6GAL1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of FUT8 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; a decreased level of GCNT1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0109">In a further aspect, an in vitro method for diagnosing metastatic prostate cancer or determining the risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer in a subject is provided, the method comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0000">a) determining the level of one or more biomarker in a biological fluid sample from the subject, wherein the one or more biomarker is selected from the group consisting of: ST6GAL1, FUT8, GCNT1 and GALNT7;<br/>b) comparing the level of the one or more biomarker with the level of the same biomarker in a control sample or with a pre-determined reference level for the same biomarker, wherein the control sample is from a subject that has non-metastatic, localised, prostate cancer or the pre-determined reference level is the average level of the biomarker in a subject with non-metastatic, localised, prostate cancer; and<br/>c) identifying a subject as having metastatic prostate cancer or as having an increased risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer if the comparison in step b) indicates that the subject has one or more of the following: an increased level of ST6GAL1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of GCNT1 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level; an increased level of FUT8 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference value; or an increased level of GALNT7 compared to the control sample or the pre-determined reference level.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0110">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; as used herein refers to, for example, humans, chimpanzees, Rhesus monkeys, dogs, cows, horses, cats, mice, rats, chickens, zebrafish, fruit flies, mosquitoes, <i>C. elegans </i>and frogs (all of which have one or more of GALNT7, ST6GAL1, FUT8 and GCNT1; or orthologues thereof), provided that they also have a prostate. The subject is preferably a mammal, such as a human. The subject is most commonly male.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0111">The subject may be referred to herein as a patient. The terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d;, &#x201c;individual&#x201d;, and &#x201c;patient&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably. The subject can be symptomatic (e.g., the subject presents symptoms associated with prostate cancer), or the subject can be asymptomatic (e.g., the subject does not present symptoms associated with prostate cancer).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0112">The subject may be diagnosed with, be at risk of developing or present with symptoms of prostate cancer. The subject may have, or be suspected of having (e.g. present with symptoms or a history indicative or suggestive of), prostate cancer.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0113">Accordingly, in some examples, the subject has prostate cancer (and the method diagnoses, identifies, (or detects) that the subject has prostate cancer). In this context, the terms &#x201c;diagnose&#x201d; &#x201c;identify&#x201d;, and &#x201c;detect&#x201d; can be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0114">In particular examples, the subject has early stage prostate cancer. An example of an early stage of disease is when the subject has the initial symptoms of prostate cancer but has not yet developed sufficient symptoms for diagnosis of disease. in such examples, the method may be considered as a method for determining the risk of developing prostate cancer. In particular examples, the subject has localised prostate cancer. In other examples, the subject has metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0115">The terms &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; and &#x201c;cancerous&#x201d; refer to or describe the physiological condition that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include cancer of the urogenital tract, such as prostate cancer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;prostate cancer&#x201d; refers to all stages and all forms of cancer arising from the tissue of the prostate gland.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0116">Methods of diagnosing and staging prostate cancer are well known in the art. For example, according to the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (7th Ed., 2010), the various stages of prostate cancer are defined as follows: Tumor: T1: clinically inapparent tumor not palpable or visible by imaging, T1a: tumor incidental histological finding in 5% or less of tissue resected, T1b: tumor incidental histological finding in more than 5% of tissue resected, T1c: tumor identified by needle biopsy; T2: tumor confined within prostate, T2a: tumor involves one half of one lobe or less, T2b: tumor involves more than half of one lobe, but not both lobes, T2c: tumor involves both lobes; T3: tumor extends through the prostatic capsule, T3a: extracapsular extension (unilateral or bilateral), T3b: tumor invades seminal vesicle(s); T4: tumor is fixed or invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles (bladder neck, external sphincter, rectum, levator muscles, or pelvic wall). Node: N0: no regional lymph node metastasis; N1: metastasis in regional lymph nodes. Metastasis: M0: no distant metastasis; M1: distant metastasis present.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0117">The Gleason Grading system is also commonly used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, it is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging, which predicts prognosis and helps guide therapy. A Gleason &#x201c;score&#x201d; or &#x201c;grade&#x201d; is given to prostate cancer based upon its microscopic appearance. Tumors with a low Gleason score typically grow slowly enough that they may not pose a significant threat to the patients in their lifetimes. These patients are monitored (&#x201c;watchful waiting&#x201d; or &#x201c;active surveillance&#x201d;) over time. Cancers with a higher Gleason score are more aggressive and have a worse prognosis, and these patients are generally treated with surgery (e.g., radical prostectomy) and, in some cases, therapy (e.g., radiation, hormone, ultrasound, chemotherapy, immunotherapy). Gleason scores (or sums) comprise grades of the two most common tumor patterns. These patterns are referred to as Gleason patterns 1-5, with pattern 1 being the most well-differentiated. Most have a mixture of patterns. To obtain a Gleason score or grade, the dominant pattern is added to the second most prevalent pattern to obtain a number between 2 and 10. The Gleason Grades include: G1: well differentiated (slight anaplasia) (Gleason 2-4); G2: moderately differentiated (moderate anaplasia) (Gleason 5-6); G3-4: poorly differentiated/undifferentiated (marked anaplasia) (Gleason 7-10).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0118">The methods described herein may be used to identify subjects that have prostate cancer or that have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. In this context, the phrase &#x201c;increased risk&#x201d; indicates that the subject has a higher level of risk (or likelihood) that they will experience a particular clinical outcome. A subject may be classified into a risk group or classified at a level of risk based on the methods described herein, e.g. high, medium, or low risk. A &#x201c;risk group&#x201d; is a group of subjects or individuals with a similar level of risk for a particular clinical outcome.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0119">In general, the methods described are in vitro methods that are performed using a sample that has already been obtained from the subject (i.e. the sample is provided for the method, and the steps taken to obtain the sample from the subject are not included as part of the method).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0120">The methods may therefore include the step of providing a biological fluid sample from a subject.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0121">As used herein, &#x201c;provide&#x201d;, &#x201c;obtain&#x201d; or &#x201c;obtaining&#x201d; can be any means whereby one comes into possession of the sample by &#x201c;direct&#x201d; or &#x201c;indirect&#x201d; means. Directly obtaining a sample means performing a process (e.g., performing a physical method such as extraction) to obtain the sample. Indirectly obtaining a sample refers to receiving the sample from another party or source (e.g., a third party laboratory that directly acquired the sample).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0122">The methods provided herein comprise providing a biological fluid sample (for example a blood sample or a urine sample) from a subject. The samples being tested in the methods described herein are also referred to as &#x201c;test samples&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0123">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d;, &#x201c;test sample&#x201d;, &#x201c;sample&#x201d; and variations thereof refer to a sample obtained or derived from a subject. For the purposes described herein, the sample is, or comprises, a biological fluid (also referred to herein as a bodily fluid) sample.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0124">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biological fluid sample&#x201d; encompasses a blood sample, a urine sample, a saliva sample, or a prostatic fluid sample (such as a prostatic secretion sample).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0125">A blood sample may be a whole blood sample, or a processed blood sample e.g. serum, plasma etc. Methods for obtaining biological fluid samples (e.g. whole blood, serum, plasma, urine etc) from a subject are well known in the art. For example, methods for obtaining blood samples from a subject are well known and include established techniques used in phlebotomy. The obtained blood samples may be further processed using standard techniques to obtain e.g. a serum sample, or a plasma sample. Advantageously, methods for obtaining biological fluid samples from a subject are typically low-invasive or non-invasive.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0126">A whole blood sample is defined as a blood sample drawn from the human body and from which (substantially) no constituents (such as platelets or plasma) have been removed. In other words, the relative ratio of constituents in a whole blood sample is substantially the same as a blood in the body. In this context, &#x201c;substantially the same&#x201d; allows for a very small change in the relative ratio of the constituents of whole blood e.g. a change of up to 5%, up to 4%, up to 3%, up to 2%, up to 1% etc. Whole blood contains both the cell and fluid portions of blood. A whole blood sample may therefore also be defined as a blood sample with (substantially) all of its cellular components in plasma, wherein the cellular components (i.e. at least comprising the requisite white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets of blood) are intact.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0127">In a preferred example, the biological fluid sample is plasma, serum or urine.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0128">Methods for analysing (and optionally isolating, enriching for or extracting) protein biomarkers from blood, plasma, serum, saliva, prostatic fluid and urine samples have been described previously, see for example; Heitzer, E., Haque, I.

A biomarker is differentially present if the mean or median level of the biomarker in the different groups is calculated to be statistically significant. Common tests for statistical significance include, among others, t-test (e.g., student t-test), ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC curve), accuracy and odds ratio. Biomarkers, alone or in combination, provide measures of relative risk that a subject belongs to one phenotypic status or another.

The enzymatic transferase activity is located in the C-terminus of the protein. Membrane-tethered transferases are susceptible to proteolytic cleavages within its &#x201c;stem&#x201d; region. Proteolysis liberates a catalytically active, soluble form of the enzyme that may be released from the cell. ST6GAL1 has a b-secretase (BACE1) cleavage site in its luminal domain at EFQ41-43, which can result in its secretion.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0137">Sialylation by ST6GAL1 typically occurs in the trans-Golgi where the glycosyl transferase is anchored by a transmembrane domain. Attachment of sialic acid to galactose on IgG Fc glycans is catalyzed by the ST6GAL1. Sialylation of IgG by ST6GAL1 typically occurs in the /ra//.s-Golgi where ST6GAL1 is found anchored in the Golgi by a transmembrane domain. This trans-Golgi enzyme can attach terminal sialic acid to complex biantennary glycans.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0138">Several distinct promoters regulate the cellular and tissue specific expression of this transferase. For example, promoter 1 is used exclusively to express ST6GAL1 by hepatocytes, while B cells use promoter 2. Hepatocytes are responsible exclusively for production of soluble ST6GAL1 (sST6GAL1), which is cleaved and secreted into the circulation.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0139">Human ST6GAL1 can be identified using NCBI GenBank or UniProt.

Disruption of FUT8 function through various means leads to production of non-fucosylated proteins, including antibodies.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0142">In mammalian expression systems, GDP-fucose, an essential substrate of fucosylation, is synthesized in the cytoplasm through de novo and salvage pathways. In the de novo pathway of fucosylation, GDP-fucose is synthesized through conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-mannose, catalyzed by the enzyme GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0143">This GDP-Fucose is then transported inside the golgi and used as a substrate for protein fucosylation by the enzyme alpha-6 fucosyltransferase (FUT8).

Prostate Specific Antigen is a protein that is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland, including cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0147">Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein enzyme encoded by the KLK3 gene. KLK3 is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. PSA is a kallikrein-like serine protease that is produced exclusively by the columnar epithelial cells lining the acini and ducts of the prostate gland. PSA mRNA is translated as an inactive 261-amino acid preproPSA precursor. PreproPSA has 24 additional residues that constitute the pre-region (the signal polypeptide) and the propolypeptide. Release of the propolypeptide results in the 237- amino acid, mature extracellular form, which is enzymatically active. PSA is organ-specific and, as a result, it is produced by the epithelial cells of benign prostatic hyperplastic (BPH) tissue, primary prostate cancer tissue, and metastatic prostate cancer tissue.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0148">PSA is concentrated in prostatic tissue, and serum PSA levels are normally very low. Disruption of the normal prostate architecture, for example by prostatic disease, inflammation or trauma, allows greater amounts of PSA to enter the circulation. PSA is used to detect potential problems in the prostate gland and to follow the progress of prostate cancer therapy. PSA is not a specific marker for prostate cancer, since its levels increase due to other conditions, including prostatic hyperplasia, and PSA levels are also known to be affected by factors such as medication, urologic manipulation and inflammation. PSA is present in small quantities in serum of men with a healthy prostate, but is often elevated in individuals with prostate cancer and other prostate disorders. It has been established that between 40 and 45% of the variability in PSA levels in the general population is due to inherited factors.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0149">A blood test to measure PSA is considered the most effective test currently available for the early detection of prostate cancer, although but its clinical effectiveness has been questioned.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0150">Rising levels of PSA over time are associated with both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. In general, PSA values ranging from 2.5 ng/mL to 4 ng/mL are considered as cut-off values for suspected cancer, and levels above 10 ng/mL indicate higher risk. However, despite the widespread use of the PSA screening test, it is limited both in specificity and sensitivity and substantial controversy exists about its beneficial effect for patients. This is mainly due to the fact that PSA is not a specific marker of prostate cancer since its serum levels increase in prostatic hyperplasia and are affected by many other factors such as medication, urologic manipulations and inflammation. The probability that a patient with a positive (abnormal) PSA test result actually has prostate cancer is therefore relatively low, resulting in PSA testing in prostate cancer having a relatively low positive predictive value (PPV).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0151">The decision to proceed with prostate biopsy is usually made based on results of a PSA assay, which is sometimes also followed by a Digital Rectal Examination (DRE). Results of PSA assay, alone or in combination with results of DRE, are used to select those individuals for prostate biopsy. Further factors may be considered, including free and total PSA, age of the patient, the rate of PSA change with age (PSA velocity), family history, ethnicity, history of prior biopsy etc.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0152">PSA may be human PSA. Human PSA can be identified using NCBI GenBank or UniProt. Several different splice isoforms for PSA are known.

In one example, the predetermined reference level is the average or median level of the biomarker in at least one individual not suffering from prostate cancer from the same species. The predetermined reference value may be calculated as the average or median, taken from a group or population of individuals that are not suffering from prostate cancer.

In such examples, the control or predetermined reference are used as a bench line to determine whether the tested subject has or is at risk of having prostate cancer.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0182">In an alternative example, the control or predetermined reference value may be obtained from the same individual as the test sample, but at an earlier time point. This is particularly relevant for the methods described herein that monitor prostate cancer progression in a subject, determine the therapeutic effect of a treatment regimen for prostate cancer, and/or determine a subject's compliance or adherence with a prescribed treatment regimen for prostate cancer. In such examples, the control sample or predetermined reference level is used to determine any changes in the level of the biomarker(s) over a time interval for the same subject.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0183">The pre-determined reference level or control sample can therefore be from the same subject that the test sample is obtained from, for example obtained at an earlier time point.

It can be a range of cut-off (or threshold) values, such as a confidence interval. It can be established based upon comparative groups, such as where the risk in one defined group is a fold higher, or lower, (e.g., approximately 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, 16-fold or more) than the risk in another defined group. It can be a range, for example, where a population of subjects (e.g., control subjects) is divided equally (or unequally) into groups, such as a low-risk group, a medium-risk group and a high-risk group, or into quartiles, the lowest quartile being subjects with the lowest risk and the highest quartile being subjects with the highest risk, or into n-quantiles (i.e., n regularly spaced intervals) the lowest of the n-quantiles being subjects with the lowest risk and the highest of the n-quantiles being subjects with the highest risk. Moreover, the reference could be a calculated reference, most preferably the average or median, for the relative or absolute amount of a biomarker of a population of individuals comprising the subject to be investigated. How to calculate a suitable reference value, preferably, the average or median, is well known in the art. The population of subjects referred to before shall comprise a plurality of individuals, preferably, at least 5, 10, 50, 100, 1,000 subjects.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0185">Thus, in some cases the level of the protein biomarker in a subject being greater than or equal to the level of the biomarker of the control sample or pre-determined reference level is indicative of a clinical status (e.g., indicative of prostate cancer). In other cases the level of the biomarker in a subject being less than or equal to the level of biomarker of the control sample or predetermined reference level is indicative of a clinical status (e.g. indicative of a therapeutic improvement or reversal in prostate cancer staging). The amount of the greater than and the amount of the less than is usually of a sufficient magnitude to, for example, facilitate distinguishing a subject from a control subject using the methods described herein. Typically, the greater than, or the less than, that is sufficient to distinguish a subject from a control subject is a statistically significant greater than, or a statistically significant less than. In cases where the level of the biomarker in a subject being equal to the level of the biomarker in a control subject is indicative of a clinical status, the &#x201c;being equal&#x201d; refers to being approximately equal (e.g., not statistically different).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0186">The pre-determined value can depend upon a particular population of subjects (e.g., human subjects) selected. For example, an apparently healthy population will have a different &#x2018;normal&#x2019; range of the protein biomarker than will a population of subjects which have, or are likely to have, prostate cancer. Accordingly, the pre-determined values selected may take into account the category (e.g., healthy, at risk, diseased) in which a subject (e.g., human subject) falls. Appropriate ranges and categories can be selected with no more than routine experimentation by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0187">Suitably, the level of the specific biomarker detected in a sample (e.g. a test sample, a control sample etc) may be normalized by adjusting the measured level (amount or activity) of the biomarker using the level of a reference protein in the same sample, wherein the reference protein is not a marker itself (it is e.g., a protein that is constitutively expressed).

For example, an effective amount can depend upon the degree to which a subject has abnormal levels of certain analytes (e.g., biomarkers as described herein) that are indicative of prostate cancer. It should be understood that the therapeutic agents described herein are used to treat and/or prevent prostate cancer. Thus, in some cases, they may be used prophylactically in subjects at risk of developing prostate cancer. Thus, in some cases, an effective amount is that amount which can lower the risk of, slow or perhaps prevent altogether the development of prostate cancer.

Also, the kits, in some cases, will include written information (indicia) providing a reference (e.g., pre-determined values), wherein a comparison between the levels of the biomarkers in the subject and the reference (pre-determined values) is indicative of a clinical status (e.g., diagnosis of prostate cancer or risk of developing prostate cancer etc.). In some cases, the kits comprise software useful for comparing biomarker levels or occurrences with a reference (e.g., a prediction model).

Thus, if an identical or similar data set can be identified in the data collection, the test data set will be associated with prostate cancer. Consequently, the information obtained from the data collection can be used to diagnose prostate cancer or based on a test data set obtained from a subject.

This could be for a number of reasons e.g. how stable the protein is, or because ST6GAL1 is being secreted.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0375">To ensure that the data presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> herein is accurate, the inventors validated the antibody (previously validated and published by the inventors for use in western blot, Munkley et al., 2016), for IHC as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The data shown therein confirms that the chosen ST6GAL1 antibody works well by IHC. It also confirms that, using IHC, ST6GAL1 protein levels are reduced in cancer compared to benign tissue.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0376">Glycosylation enzymes therefore show differential expression patterns in prostate cancer tissue versus benign tissue. Due to their fundamental role in the regulation of glycoprotein and glycolipid biosynthesis, glycosylation enzymes are localised within the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, and remain within the intracellular compartment of the cell.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0377">The inventors have surprisingly found that certain glycosylation enzymes (GCNT1, GALNT7, FUT8 and ST6GAL1) are secreted into biological fluids such as blood and urine in males with prostate cancer (see below).
