Every customer service request becomes a two-way conversation in which the organization must assist their customer while maintaining an appropriate corporate tone. This is further complicated by organizations' reliance upon the conversational skills of their customer service representatives (CSRs), which may vary drastically from person to person. In written communication channels such as email or social media posts this problem manifests itself in many ways, ranging from simple spelling and grammatical mistakes to incorrect formality of language for a given situation. Disaffected CSRs may even send out intentionally unacceptable communications in response to communications from customers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Employing common tools such as spelling and grammar checkers can mitigate some of these issues, but subtler issues often require application of quality assurance (QA) processes by the organization. Such processes require dedicated staff to double check outgoing messages for errors and appropriate tone. Either the QA staff or the original sender can then rectify mistakes or make other necessary changes before the message is sent on to the customer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Maintaining a QA process like this can be costly to an organization. Inspecting individual messages is slow, delaying communication with customers. Smaller organizations cannot afford to set aside staff to look at every outbound communication. Larger organizations may have such a high volume of messages that a dedicated staff capable of handling the workload would be a significant drain on resources. This leads to inconsistent application of communication guidelines, sometimes ending in a poor experience for the customer. With the increase in online ratings and social media postings regarding customer experiences, publicized instances of poor communication can have a detrimental effect on a business.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is an unmet need in the art for a system capable of automatically intercepting and analyzing outgoing messages sent from a CSR and rerouting poor-quality messages for correction.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment of the present application is a method for text analysis and routing of outgoing messages.

No unnecessary limitations are to be applied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for descriptive purposes only and are intended to be broadly construed. The different systems and methods described herein may be used alone or in combination with other systems and methods. Various equivalents, alternatives and modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claims. Each limitation in the appended claims is intended to invoke interpretation under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112, sixth paragraph, only if the terms &#x201c;means for&#x201d; or &#x201c;step for&#x201d; are explicitly recited in the respective limitation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Customer engagement center (CEC) systems allow customer service agents to engage with customers in a controlled manner. By applying automated analysis of outgoing messages, the CEC system can allow an organization to achieve several key benefits. First, every message can receive a degree of analysis before it leaves the organization's control. Second, the organization can reduce costs. The quality assurance (QA) staff will spend their time working on messages selected for further investigation by the system, rather than wasting time inspecting messages without mistakes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, it is desirable for the system to automatically intercept and analyze the text of an outgoing message drafted by a customer service representative (CSR). This allows the system to route the outgoing message to the CSR or to QA staff if the outgoing message has a high analytical score, indicating, for example, that it contains too many errors or too much unacceptable language. In an embodiment, it is desirable to route the outgoing message directly to the CSR for correction. In an embodiment, it is desirable to route the outgoing message directly to the QA staff if the analytical score is too high, the CSR has already attempted to correct the outgoing message, the outgoing message contains predetermined &#x201c;red flag&#x201d; features, or if the company wants outgoing messages to automatically route to the QA staff. In an embodiment, it is desirable to repeat the check and routing (if necessary) to ensure that old errors were corrected and no new errors introduced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of CEC system <b>100</b> for text analysis and routing of outgoing messages.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">CEC system <b>100</b> includes at least one CEC desktop <b>110</b> used by a CSR for composing outgoing messages <b>120</b> and optionally reading incoming written communications. In the exemplary embodiment, at least one additional CEC desktop <b>110</b> is used by QA staff to review and if necessary correct outgoing messages <b>120</b>. By way of non-limiting example, outgoing messages <b>120</b> may include a response to written communication, a scheduled or spontaneous post on a social networking or content-sharing service, a post on a review site, a press release, or any other outgoing message.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">CEC system <b>100</b> also includes a text analytics service (TAS) unit <b>130</b> having a TAS software module <b>131</b> and an optional TAS storage <b>132</b>. TAS unit <b>130</b> may be a processor or a combination of a processing system and a storage system. TAS unit <b>130</b> intercepts outgoing messages <b>120</b> sent from CEC desktop(s) <b>110</b> and analyzes outgoing messages <b>120</b> using TAS software module <b>131</b> to generate an analytical score. Optionally, TAS unit <b>130</b> may also permanently or temporarily save a copy of the outgoing message to internal or external TAS storage <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The analysis may evaluate spelling, grammar, sentiment, tone, word choice, or any other characteristic of outgoing message <b>120</b>. TAS software module <b>131</b> may also identify outgoing messages <b>120</b> with predetermined red flag features, such as prohibited words, phrases, or expressions. Such red flag features, offensive sentiment, tone, or word choice, or grammatical or spelling errors in outgoing messages <b>120</b> result in an increased analytical score. Different types of characteristics or flagged features may be weighed differently. By way of non-limiting example, TAS software module <b>131</b> may score an otherwise-perfect outgoing message <b>120</b> containing an obscene word far higher than another outgoing message <b>120</b> with multiple misspelled words. By way of another non-limiting example, TAS software module <b>131</b> may score a first outgoing message <b>120</b> with a racial slur higher than a second outgoing message <b>120</b> with a misspelled word. If necessary, QA staff or another entity may update any of the analytical characteristics, scoring methodology, score weight, and flagged features at regular intervals or as-needed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">TAS software module <b>131</b> also compares the analytical score to a quality threshold. Outgoing messages <b>120</b> with analytical scores below the quality threshold are allowed to pass to their final destination. Outgoing messages <b>120</b> with analytical scores above the quality threshold require correction before passing to their final destination. Such outgoing messages <b>120</b> may return to the originating CSR or pass to QA staff. Once corrected, TAS software module <b>131</b> analyzes and compares the outgoing message again. A corrected outgoing message <b>120</b> is only allowed to pass if its analytical score has dropped below the threshold and it contains no red flag features; otherwise, outgoing message <b>120</b> returns to the originating CSR or QA staff. In embodiments where outgoing message <b>120</b> returns to the originating CSR, such as the exemplary embodiment, a CSR only has a certain number of attempts to correct their outgoing message <b>120</b> before it goes to QA staff. This ensures that CSRs with poor writing and correction skills do not overly delay communication. In certain other embodiments, the presence of a red flag feature in outgoing message <b>120</b> automatically passes outgoing message <b>120</b> to QA staff. This ensures that QA staff are aware of any uses of prohibited words, phrases, or expressions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Quality thresholds may vary according to the type of outgoing messages <b>120</b>. For example, an email message directly replying to a written communication from an important customer may have a much lower quality threshold than a general social media post to a high-volume account or a minor notice posted to the CSR's company intranet. The QA staff or another entity may update any of the quality thresholds as needed to ensure excellent communications. In the exemplary embodiment, a second threshold higher than the quality threshold, a QA threshold, automatically directs particularly high-scoring outgoing messages <b>120</b> to QA staff rather than to the originating CSR. This alerts QA staff if a CSR has extremely poor writing capability, potentially necessitating remedial training.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>depict a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of method <b>200</b> for text analysis and routing of outgoing messages.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In optional step <b>202</b>, a CSR views a written communication on a customer engagement center (CEC) desktop of a CEC system. The written communication may be an online posting, a direct message from a customer, a communication from a third party, a message from a customer forwarded by a third party, or any other written communication.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In step <b>204</b>, the CSR composes an outgoing message on the CEC desktop.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step <b>206</b>, the CSR transmits the outgoing message from the CEC desktop to the CEC system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>208</b>, the outgoing message is intercepted by a TAS unit in the CEC system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step <b>210</b>, the TAS unit performs an analysis of the outgoing message using a TAS software module. The analysis may evaluate the message's spelling, grammar, sentiment, tone, word choice, or any other characteristic. The analysis may also review outgoing messages to detect slurs, obscenities, insults, or other predetermined red flag words, phrases, or expressions. The TAS unit may also permanently or temporarily save a copy of the outgoing message to internal or external TAS storage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step <b>212</b>, the TAS unit assigns an analytical score to the outgoing message based on the analysis of step <b>210</b>. A message with numerous misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and poor word choices will have a higher score than one without any such errors.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step <b>214</b>, the TAS unit compares the analytical score to a quality threshold. The TAS software module may be programmed with multiple different quality thresholds for different outgoing messages.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In optional step <b>216</b>, the TAS unit transmits the outgoing message to the CSR if the analytical score is above the quality threshold. In the exemplary embodiment, the CSR does not receive the outgoing message if the analytical score is above a QA threshold; in such a scenario, the outgoing message is instead sent directly to QA staff. Likewise, in the exemplary embodiment, if the CSR is unable to bring the analytical score above the quality threshold after a given number of attempts (i.e., if an attempt number is above an attempt threshold), the QA staff receive the outgoing message for correction. In other embodiments, the CSR receives the outgoing message automatically. In certain other embodiments, QA staff receive the outgoing message automatically if the CSR includes red flag features in the outgoing message. The transmission may also include feedback pertaining to the quality of the outgoing message, such as, but not limited to, the analytical score, specific spelling mistakes, specific grammatical mistakes, suggested changes, at least one previous version of the outgoing message, at least one previous version of the outgoing message with highlighted changes, or information on any other message characteristic.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In optional step <b>218</b>, the TAS unit transmits the outgoing message to the QA staff if the analytical score is above the quality threshold. In the exemplary embodiment, the QA staff receive the outgoing message if the analytical score is above the QA threshold or if the CSR is unable to bring the analytical score above the quality threshold after a given number of attempts.
