The sheet can be cardboard or paper, and the foil is either a metallized plastic foil or a thin metal foil. Typically, the foil is pressed onto the surface of the sheet so that part of the foil is transferred to the sheet where it adheres.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A platen press comprises an upper and a lower platen. On the lower platen, a supporting plate is installed to perform the hot stamping of the foil. For achieving the desired pressure during the hot stamping process, the thickness of the supporting plate must be set with a precision to a few tens of microns.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To this end, the supporting plate can be made of two pieces, a lower base part and a top plate, called the compensating plate. Between the base part and a top plate, a so-called &#x201c;makeready sheet&#x201d; is placed at selected locations to control and/or set the pressure at each location of the whole surface of the platen. The compensating plate is lifted and kept in a lifted position to allow an operator to install the makeready sheet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In known hot foil stamping presses, the supporting plate must be removed from the platen press completely such that the top plate can be lifted to be in a vertical position during installation of the makeready sheet. However, such a setup requires a considerable amount of space in front of the platen press which is undesirable due to space constraints. This effect is especially problematic in case of so called cross-foil stamping presses, like the one shown in WO 2020/186470 A1, which require additional parts of the hot foil stamping press to extend towards an operator side of the press.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide a hot foil stamping press with reduced space requirements. Preferably, the hot foil stamping press should provide for an easy and fast set-up procedure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the invention is solved by a hot foil stamping press comprising a platen press, with a supporting plate comprising a base plate and a compensating plate being rotatably attached to the base plate for switching between an operating position and a makeready position and a hook element comprising a base part and a top part being arranged at an angle relative to the base part. The hook element is rotatably attached to a door of the platen press by a fixation axle for switching between a releasing position and a securing position of the hook element, wherein the top part retains the compensating plate in its makeready position when the hook element is in its securing position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A basic idea of the invention is that the top part of the supporting plate can easily be secured in its makeready position by the hook element provided at a door of the platen press. This allows a flexible arrangement of the top part in its makeready position relative to the base plate. Especially, the top part is not restricted to be brought into a vertical position, thereby allowing to optimize the makeready position in regard to the available space in front of the platen press.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The door is arranged at an operator side (OS) of the platen press to allow an operator of the hot foil stamping press to easily access the supporting plate and the hook element during setup of the supporting plate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the makeready position, the compensating plate is arranged close to the door of the platen press for interaction with the hook element. E.g., the compensating plate is arranged essentially parallel or at an angle relative to the door.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The expression &#x201c;at an angle&#x201d; means that there is an angle between the respective parts which is in the range between 0&#xb0; and 180&#xb0; , i.e. not equal to 0&#xb0; or 180&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The hot foil stamping press is preferably a cross-foil stamping press.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To ensure a reliable interaction between the hook element and the compensating plate, the hook element can be held in its securing position by an elastic element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">E.g., the elastic element is a spring, which preferably exerts a force on the compensating plate in the securing position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The top part of the hook element preferably comprises a manipulating element by which the hook element can be switched between the releasing position and the securing position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The manipulating element especially is manually operable by the operator of the hot foil stamping press. E.g., the manipulating element can be a knob, a grip, a handle or a recess.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the manipulating element is a recess which is operable by a single finger of the operator. Accordingly, in this alternative, the operator needs only one hand for manipulating the hook element such that the operator at the same time can handle the compensating plate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one variant, the door of the platen press comprises a first door section and a second door section being arranged at an angle relative to the first door section. Such a design of the door of the platen press allows for optimization of the space requirement of the overall hot foil stamping press.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Especially, the first and second door sections can be arranged such that they encompass, i.e. essentially fold around, parts of the platen press like bobbins or rolls which provide foil for the hot foil stamping operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">E.g., in the case the hot foil stamping press is a cross-foil stamping press, the first and second door section can encompass bobbins on which foil is wound which is provided to the sheets which are to be processed from a direction perpendicular to a feeding direction of the sheets.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To avoid that the hook element interferes with additional parts of the platen press, the base part of the hook element can be essentially parallel to the first door section or the second door section.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one variant, the compensating plate is arranged at an angle between 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; relative to the first door section, preferably at angle between 0&#xb0; and 40&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, opposite to the hook element along a width direction of the door, a second hook element is rotatably attached to the door of the platen press, wherein the second hook element comprises a second base part and a second top part being arranged at an angle relative to the second base part. The second base part of the second hook element is rotatably attached to the door by a second fixation axle for switching between a releasing position and a securing position.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second hook element allows a further increased stabilization of the compensating plate in the makeready position. Further, in case the compensating plate is made of a flexible material, the second hook element can prevent warping and/or tilting of the compensating plate when being held in the makeready position by the hook elements. Thus, mechanical stress on the compensating plate can be reduced, thereby minimizing the risk of damaging the compensating plate during set-up of the platen press.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the second hook element also has a second base part and a second top part like the hook element, the second hook element is not necessarily identical to the hook element.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To facilitate operation of the hook element and the second hook element, the hook element and the second hook element can be connected by a connection element such that the second hook element is in the releasing position when the hook element is in the releasing position and the second hook element is in the securing position when the hook element is in the securing position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With other words, the hook element and the second hook element undergo a coupled motion when switching between their respective releasing positions and securing positions. Further, only the hook element or the second hook element need to be manipulated by the operator of the hot foil stamping press when the compensating plate needs to be secured in its makeready position. This allows the operator to reliably secure the compensating plate with a single hand while the other hand can e.g. hold the compensating plate in the desired position.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a variant, the connection element is a bar rotatably connected at a first end to the base part of the hook element and rotatably connected at a second end to the second base part of the second hook element.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hook element and the second hook element can rotate into opposite directions when switching from their respective releasing position to their respective securing position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Such a kind of opposite motion can be realized by connecting the connection element on different sides of the respective fixation axles of the hook element and the second hook element.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further advantages and features will become apparent from the following description of the invention and from the appended figures which show non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention and in which:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a hot foil stamping press according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cut through selected parts of a platen press of the hot foil stamping press of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic front view of the platen press of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a side view of a hook element of the hot foil stamping press of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a back view of the hook element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a top view of the hook element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a back view of the hook element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> together with a second hook element of the hot foil stamping press of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically shows an arrangement of the hook element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> relative to the platen press of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> schematically shows an alternative arrangement of the hook element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a hot foil stamping press <b>10</b> comprising a series of processing stations that are juxtaposed but interdependent on each other and form a unitary assembly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The hot foil stamping press <b>10</b> includes, along a feeding direction F, a loading station <b>12</b> for loading sheets into the hot foil stamping press <b>10</b>, followed by an inspection table <b>14</b>, a platen press <b>16</b>, a foil feed module <b>18</b> and an evacuation station <b>20</b> for collecting and removing the processed sheets from the hot foil stamping press <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be apparent by the person skilled in the art that the kind and arrangement of the processing stations of the hot foil stamping press <b>10</b> can differ from the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depending on the type of operations to be performed with the sheets, as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sheets to be processed by the hot foil stamping press <b>10</b> can be cardboard or paper onto which metallized plastic foil or a thin metal foil is applied in the platen press <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the shown embodiment, the hot foil stamping press <b>10</b> is a cross-foil stamping press.
