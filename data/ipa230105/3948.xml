Data centers contain a wide range of IT and other communication equipment including, for example, servers, networking switches, routers, storage subsystems, etc. Data centers further include a large amount of cabling and equipment racks to organize and interconnect the communication equipment in the data center. For example, optical fiber cables and rack-mounted hardware to support optical connections are used extensively in data centers. Optical fibers can support very high bandwidths with lower signal loss compared to traditional data transmission mediums (e.g., copper wires).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The connections between communication equipment in large-scale data centers is typically not confined to a single building. Many modern data centers include multi-building campuses having, for example, one primary or main building and a number of auxiliary buildings in close proximity to the main building. All the buildings on the campus are interconnected by a local fiber optic network. More particularly, each of the auxiliary buildings are typically connected to the main building by one or more high fiber-count optical cables referred to as &#x201c;trunk cables&#x201d;. Each trunk cable may include thousands of optical fibers. Indeed, fiber counts of 3,456 or higher are now common.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To provide optical connectivity within a building, the optical fibers of a trunk cable are typically spliced to optical fibers of indoor distribution cables. The splices may be stored and organized in a splice cabinet from which the indoor distribution cables extends. More specifically, the splice cabinet holds numerous splice trays that each receives a group of optical fibers from the trunk cable that have been spliced to a group of optical fibers associated with the indoor distribution cables. Fusion splicing is commonly used as the primary technique for splicing the two groups of optical fibers together before the splices are stored and organized in the splice trays. The indoor distribution cables exit the splice cabinet and extend to desired locations within the building, such as to designated rows of equipment racks. Connections to the IT equipment in the equipment racks are ultimately made by the indoor distribution cables or cables that are part of a structured cabling system for the building.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The amount of labor and time for connecting a trunk cable to the IT equipment in the main building on the data center campus is significant. In a typical installation process, it may take two technicians approximately two-weeks of time to fusion splice the optical fibers of a trunk cable to corresponding internal optical fibers of the main building. Additionally, fusion splicing is a labor-intensive method for connecting optical fibers that is typically performed under field conditions, as opposed to under more highly controlled factory conditions. Thus, the quality of the splicing and the attenuation of the optical signal through the splice may vary widely depending on the field technicians' skill and experience.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of interconnect systems are provided in this disclosure, and particularly interconnect systems that may be used in environments where a large number of optical connections is needed and where there are competing demands for space, such as in hyperscale data centers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, an interconnect system comprises a cable assembly and at least one adapter panel for managing interconnections. The cable assembly includes: a cable jacket; different groups of optical fibers carried within the cable jacket and extending beyond an end of the cable jacket; a plurality of ferrules each terminating one or more respective groups of the different groups of optical fibers; and a plurality of ferrule push components corresponding to the plurality of ferrules. Each ferrule push component of the plurality of ferrule push components is installed on the one or more respective groups of the optical fibers that are terminated by the corresponding ferrule. Each adapter panel of the at least one adapter panel includes a plurality of adapters. The interconnect system further comprises a plurality of connector housings each coupled to a respective adapter of the plurality of adapters independently from the cable assembly (i.e., without being part of the cable assembly when coupled to the respective adapter). The plurality of connector housings are configured to receive and retain the plurality of ferrules and the plurality of ferrule push components without being removed from the plurality of adapters.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many embodiments are possible. Each ferrule of the plurality of ferrules may terminate a single group of the different groups of optical fibers, or each ferrule may terminate multiple groups of the different groups of optical fibers. Each group of the different groups of optical fibers may comprise an optical fiber ribbon, or each group of the different groups of optical fibers may include the respective optical fibers in a non-ribbon form.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, each ferrule of the plurality of ferrules includes a front end that defines an end face where the respective one or more groups of the different groups of optical fibers terminate, a back end opposite the front end, and a shoulder between the front end and the back end that defines a maximum height and a maximum width of the ferrule in a cross-sectional plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the ferrule. Each ferrule push component of the plurality of ferrule push components has a maximum height and maximum width in a cross-sectional plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the ferrule push that is substantially the same or less than the maximum height and maximum width of the corresponding ferrule.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, for each adapter panel of the at least one adapter panel, the plurality of adapters are arranged in a plurality of adapter rows, a plurality of adapter columns, or both a plurality of adapter rows and a plurality of adapter columns. The adapter panels may be located on a frame, tray, or other support member.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the pre-terminated cable assembly further comprises: a plurality of subunits within the cable jacket, wherein each subunit includes several of the different groups of optical fibers and several of the ferrules, and wherein each row of the plurality of adapter rows or each column of the plurality of adapter columns includes a sufficient number of the adapters to correspond to the ferrules associated with any of the subunits. There may be a plurality of adapter panels for the plurality of subunits.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the interconnect system further comprises a cabinet that includes a plurality of walls defining an interior volume. Each adapter panel of the at least one adapter panel has a storage position within the interior volume and is movable relative to the plurality of walls to a position at least partially outside the interior volume.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Methods of installing interconnect systems like the ones summarized above are also disclosed. According to one embodiment, such a method comprises: routing an end of the pre-terminated cable assembly that includes the plurality of ferrules from a remote location toward the at least one adapter panel; and installing the plurality of ferrules in the plurality of adapters by inserting the plurality of ferrule push components into the plurality of connector housings. The plurality of connector housings are coupled to the plurality of adapters before the installing step and remain coupled to the plurality of adapters during the installing step.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the installing step results in the plurality of ferrules and the plurality of connector housings being coupled together to define a corresponding plurality of optical connectors that are installed in the plurality of adapters. The installing step may be performed without any tools, and wherein once the installing step is complete, the plurality of optical connectors are removable from the plurality of adapters without any tools.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the routing step further comprises pulling the pre-terminated cable assembly through a duct using a pulling grip assembly that covers the plurality of ferrules and the plurality of ferrule push components. The routing step may also comprise routing the end of the pre-terminated assembly into a cabinet that includes the at least one adapter panel and thereafter removing the pulling grip to expose the plurality of ferrules, the plurality of ferrule push components, and portions of the different groups of optical fibers. Additionally, in some embodiments, the pulling grip is removed from the end of the pre-terminated cable assembly without a tool.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional features and advantages will be set out in the description that follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the technical field of optical connectivity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

In general, the description relates to an interconnect system for a building that involves a fiber optic cable being pre-terminated with some components of optical connectors and at least one adapter panel having adapters pre-populated (i.e., pre-installed) with other components of those optical connectors. The components terminating the cable and the components pre-installed on the adapters can be combined during installation of the interconnect system to result in functionable optical connectors populating the adapter panel(s). The combining can occur without removing the components that are pre-installed on the adapters.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be apparent based on the description below that the present disclosure is more than a mere disaggregation of known components for later assembly. In other words, the present disclosure is not merely about taking known components of an optical connector that are normally assembled together in one location to terminate a fiber optic cable, and then separating them into two groups&#x2014;one for installation on the cable at a first location, and another for installation on the cable at a second location. This disclosure instead takes advantage of new component designs that allow partial installation of an optical connector on a cable and partial installation of the same optical connector in an adapter. Complete installation of the optical connector on the cable and complete installation of the optical connector in the adapter take place simultaneously (i.e., both are completed at the same time). Thus, by the time the cable is terminated with the final optical connector, the optical connector is also installed in an adapter (e.g., of an adapter panel) and ready for mating with a complementary optical connector that may be received on an opposite side of the adapter.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The basic concept is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, which illustrate an example involving components of a multi-fiber push-on/pull-off (MPO) optical connector (e.g., some according to IEC 61754-7-2: 2019 or TIA/EIA 604-5-F: 2019; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). A brief overview of the concept is provided here to facilitate discussion; additional details will be provided later in this disclosure. Optical fibers are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> to simplify the figures and this introductory discussion.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, optical connectors are designed to provide two primary functions: alignment of optical fibers for optical coupling, and mechanical retention to maintain that alignment. In an MPO connector and many other plug-type connectors, the primary component for the purpose of alignment is a ferrule. To this end, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a ferrule <b>52</b> that may be installed on the ends of optical fibers to terminate the optical fibers. The ferrule <b>52</b> is an MT-type ferrule having bores designed to receive and support optical fibers in a row or array (more than one row). The optical fibers are secured to the ferrule <b>52</b> (e.g., using an adhesive) and are processed so that their ends are substantially flush with an end face <b>54</b> of the ferrule <b>52</b>, which may or may not be angled relative to a plane that is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the ferrule <b>52</b>. In this case, the presence of the guide pins <b>56</b> makes the ferrules male type ferrules, although this disclosure applies equally to female-type ferrules without guide pins. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also illustrates guide pins <b>56</b> protruding through the ferrule <b>52</b> and a ferrule push component <b>58</b> (or &#x201c;ferrule push <b>58</b>&#x201d;) located behind the ferrule <b>52</b>. Both of these components may also be installed on the optical fibers that are terminated by the ferrule <b>52</b>. Although the use of the guide pins <b>56</b> is well-known, the design and use of the ferrule push <b>58</b> is not. This component is what will primarily be described in further detail later in this Detailed Description section.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an MPO connector and many other plug-type connectors, the primary component for the purpose of retention is a connector housing (also referred to simply as a &#x201c;housing&#x201d;, or as &#x201c;connector body&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;body&#x201d;). The housing receives the ferrule and includes a coupling mechanism, such as a latch feature for cooperating with a complementary latching feature of an adapter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a connector housing <b>62</b> of an MPO connector is shown as being pre-installed in an adapter <b>60</b> (also of the MPO-type, e.g. according to IEC 61754-7 or TIA/EIA 604-5) to form an adapter assembly <b>64</b>. Although it cannot be seen it <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the connector housing <b>62</b> is engaged by structure of the adapter <b>60</b> so as to be retained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates the connector housing <b>62</b> in isolation to better appreciate this aspect. The connector housing <b>62</b> includes latch recesses <b>66</b> (or &#x201c;latch windows&#x201d;) on opposite sides that are engaged by adapter latch arms (not shown) of the adapter <b>60</b> when the connector housing <b>62</b> is installed in the adapter <b>60</b>. The latch recesses <b>66</b> (or more specifically, portions of the latch recesses <b>66</b>) define a mechanical reference datum upon which dimensions of the connector housing <b>62</b> can be consistently based for intermatability purposes. The same is true for the adapter latch arms. By defining certain dimension of the adapter <b>60</b> and the connector housing <b>62</b> based on their respective mechanical reference datums in a consistent manner, the associated optical connector <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; ferrule <b>52</b>+connector housing <b>62</b>, as discussed below) can mechanically intermate with other MPO-type optical connectors.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The structure of the connector housing <b>62</b> that has been described and that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, namely the exterior of the connector housing <b>62</b>, may be the same or similar to known designs for MPO connectors. Indeed, these aspects are what partially define the associated optical connector <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) as being of the MPO-type. Thus, as is the case with other connector housings of MPO-type optical connectors, the connector housing <b>62</b> may also include a polarity key <b>68</b> on one side that must be aligned with a keyway in the adapter <b>60</b> to allow insertion into the adapter <b>60</b>. The polarity key <b>68</b> therefore orients the connector housing <b>62</b> relative to the adapter <b>60</b>, and may also serve as a stop feature to ultimately limit travel of the connector housing <b>62</b> in the direction of insertion. Also like known MPO optical connectors, a coupling sleeve <b>72</b> may be provided on the connector housing <b>62</b> to assist with coupling and uncoupling the connector housing <b>62</b> to/from the adapter <b>60</b>. As is known, the coupling sleeve <b>72</b> is spring-biased relative to connector housing <b>62</b> to normally extend over the latch recesses <b>66</b> (and the adapter latch arms, if they are engaged with the latch recesses <b>66</b>), but may be moved rearward relative to the connector housing <b>62</b> to no longer extend over the latch recesses <b>66</b>, thereby releasing the adapter latch arms to release the optical connector <b>50</b> from the adapter <b>60</b>. The connector housing <b>62</b> can be removed from the adapter <b>60</b> manually, i.e. without any tools (the coupling sleeve <b>72</b>, if present, is part of an assembly with the connector housing <b>62</b> and not considered to be a separate tool).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Normally a ferrule and a connector housing of an optical connector are assembled together during the process of terminating the optical fibers with the optical connector. In other words, the final pre-terminated assembly includes both the ferrule and the connector housing. And since these components are the minimum components required to define an optical connector, the final pre-terminated assembly itself is considered to have an optical connector. This is not the case for the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The ferrule <b>52</b> (element for optical alignment) is installed on optical fibers, but the connector housing <b>62</b> (element for mechanical retention) is not. There is not yet an assembly including the minimum attributes of an optical connector.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be used to advance the ferrule <b>52</b> into the connector housing <b>62</b> that has been pre-installed in the adapter <b>60</b>. The ferrule <b>52</b> may be advanced until geometric features on the connector housing <b>62</b> engage and retain a portion of the ferrule push <b>58</b> in the end of the connector housing <b>62</b> that is outside the adapter <b>60</b>. For example, the connector housing <b>62</b> may have features to engage ferrule push latches <b>74</b> that are provided on opposed sides of the ferrule push <b>58</b>. By this point the ferrule <b>52</b> has been advanced such that the end face <b>54</b> protrudes slightly from the end of the connector housing <b>62</b> that is within the adapter <b>60</b> (note: an inner surface of the connector housing <b>62</b> may be designed to confront a front-facing surface on a flange/shoulder <b>132</b> and thereby prevent the ferrule <b>52</b> from falling out the end of the connector housing <b>62</b> during later use). With the ferrule <b>52</b> now retained with the connector housing <b>62</b> by way of the ferrule push <b>58</b> being coupled to the connector housing <b>62</b>, the resulting assembly has the minimum attributes of an optical connector&#x2014;an element for optical alignment (the ferrule <b>52</b>) and an element for mechanical retention (the connector housing <b>62</b> and its defined mechanical reference datum(s)). In other words, an optical connector <b>50</b> can now be considered as having been formed without ever removing the connector housing <b>62</b> from the adapter <b>60</b>. Simultaneously, installation of this optical connector <b>50</b> in the adapter <b>60</b> has been completed, as the optical connector <b>50</b> is ready for coupling with another MPO connector in the adapter <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The foregoing concept may be applied to any interconnect system that involves a fiber optic cable, an optical connector intended to terminate at least one fiber of the fiber optic cable, and an adapter intended to couple the optical connector to another optical connector. However, the concept may be especially advantageous for interconnect systems involving a large number of optical connections from a cable that includes a high fiber-count (e.g., 3,456 or more optical fibers), such as the trunk cables in hyperscale data centers. Despite being pre-terminated with some components of optical connectors according to this disclosure, the size of such a trunk cable assembly can remain within acceptable limits for being pulled through ducts and into buildings. Additionally, equipment to house the adapters <b>60</b> for the optical connectors <b>50</b> can be comparable in size or smaller than equipment used to store traditional optical connection to high fiber-count cables. As mentioned in the Background section above, those optical connections are traditionally in the form of fusion splices.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By having an interconnect system that uses a pre-terminated cable instead of one that requires splicing, the drawbacks associated with splicing can be avoided. There is no longer a need for installers to undertake the time-consuming process of fusion splicing potentially thousands of optical fibers to other optical fibers. Additionally, pre-terminated interconnect systems like the ones in this disclosure may require less skill to install and therefore be less prone to operator error. The ferrule push <b>58</b> of the interconnect system may also facilitate the installation process in other ways, as will be described in further detail.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">To facilitate discussion and provide context, an exemplary environment and use for high fiber-count cables will first be described below. A description of an example high fiber-count, pre-terminated cable assembly will then follow, before going into further detail on the ferrule push <b>58</b> and related features that may be provided. Finally, example installation methods involving the high fiber-count, pre-terminated cable assembly will be discussed.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Environment (Data Center Cable Network)</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a modern-day data center <b>10</b> may include a collection of buildings (referred to as a data center campus) having, for example, a main building <b>12</b> and one or more auxiliary buildings <b>14</b> in close proximity to the main building <b>12</b>. While three auxiliary buildings are shown, there may be more or less depending on the size of the campus. The data center <b>10</b> provides for a local fiber optic network <b>16</b> that interconnects the auxiliary buildings <b>14</b> with the main building <b>12</b>. The local fiber optic network <b>16</b> allows communication equipment <b>18</b> in the main building <b>12</b> to communicate with various communication equipment (not shown) in the auxiliary buildings <b>14</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the local fiber optic network <b>16</b> includes trunk cables <b>20</b> extending between the main building <b>12</b> and each of the auxiliary buildings <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The trunk cables <b>20</b> may be similar to any of the cables described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2019/010291 A1 (&#x201c;the '291 publication&#x201d;), the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Thus, although a brief description of one of the trunk cables <b>20</b> is provided below to introduce aspects related to this disclosure, reference can be made to the '291 publication for an understanding of other aspects and variations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an example one of the trunk cables <b>20</b> generally includes a high fiber-count arrangement of optical fibers <b>24</b> (e.g., 3,456 or more optical fibers) for passing data and other information through the local fiber optic network <b>16</b>. The trunk cable <b>20</b> includes a plurality of subunits <b>22</b>, and each subunit <b>22</b> is configured to carry a pre-selected number of optical fibers <b>24</b>. Although the trunk cable <b>20</b> is shown as including twelve subunits <b>22</b>, the number of subunits <b>22</b> may be more or less than this number in alternative embodiments. The subunits <b>22</b> may be arranged within an outer protective sheath <b>26</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;outer cable jacket <b>26</b>&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;cable jacket <b>26</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;outer jacket <b>26</b>&#x201d;), as is generally known in the industry. As mentioned above, each of the subunits <b>22</b> is configured to carry a pre-selected number of optical fibers <b>24</b>.

Alternative embodiments may include the optical fibers <b>24</b> in a non-ribbon form (e.g., &#x201c;loose&#x201d; optical fibers). Each ribbon <b>28</b> includes a plurality of the optical fibers <b>24</b> arranged in a generally side-by-side manner (e.g., a linear array, as shown, or a rolled/folded array).

Each ribbon <b>28</b> may include, for example, eight, twelve, sixteen, or any other number of the optical fibers <b>24</b>.

In an exemplary embodiment and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, each of the indoor cables <b>34</b> may be configured similar to the subunits <b>22</b>, at least in terms of fiber count and fiber groupings, and thereby be configured to carry a pre-selected number of optical fibers <b>36</b>. By way of example and without limitation, each indoor cable <b>34</b> may be configured to carry <b>144</b> or <b>288</b> of the optical fibers <b>36</b>.

Furthermore, each of the auxiliary buildings <b>14</b> may include indoor cables <b>34</b> that extend between communication equipment <b>18</b> and the one or more distribution cabinets <b>32</b> of the auxiliary building <b>14</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example Pre-Terminated Cable Assembly</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At least one end of at least one of the trunk cables <b>20</b> extending between buildings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be pre-terminated in a manner consistent with the introductory discussion in this Detail Description section. Thus, the optical fibers <b>24</b> of each ribbon <b>28</b> may be terminated by a ferrule <b>52</b> in the manner described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. Each ribbon <b>28</b> may be terminated with a respective ferrule <b>52</b>, such as 12-fiber ribbons each being terminated with a respective 12-fiber MT ferrule. Alternatively, groups of two or more ribbons <b>28</b> may be terminated with the same ferrule <b>52</b>, such as groups of two 12-fiber ribbons each being terminated with a respective 24-fiber MT ferrule. These terminations result in a pre-terminated trunk cable assembly (&#x201c;pre-terminated trunk cable&#x201d;) because they occur at the manufacturing site of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> rather than at the site of intended use. Thus, the word &#x201c;pre-terminated&#x201d; is used in this disclosure to refer to terminations that take place by the manufacturer of resulting cable assembly, prior to shipping to or deployment at a remote location/site of intended use (e.g., customer sites) (&#x201c;the field&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> schematically illustrates an end portion <b>82</b> of one of the trunk cables <b>20</b> pre-terminated with a plurality of the ferrules <b>52</b> to form a pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b>. Ferrule push components (e.g., ferrule push <b>58</b>) are not shown, but may be present as will be discussed below. The termination involves not only the installation of ferrules <b>52</b> and ferrule push components, but also preparing the end portion <b>82</b> of the trunk cable <b>20</b> for such installation. To this end, the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> includes a furcation body <b>84</b> associated with a first end <b>86</b> of the cable jacket <b>26</b>. For example, the furcation body <b>84</b> may be installed on the first end <b>86</b> such that the cable jacket <b>26</b> ends within the furcation body <b>84</b>. The furcation body <b>84</b> represents a &#x201c;breakout&#x201d;, &#x201c;branching&#x201d;, or &#x201c;fanout&#x201d; point on the trunk cable, as end sections <b>88</b> of the subunits <b>22</b> extend from the furcation body <b>84</b> and beyond the first end <b>86</b> of the cable jacket <b>26</b> so that the subunits <b>22</b> have more freedom to spread out. Various types of furcation bodies are known. In the embodiment shown, the furcation body <b>84</b> comprises a shell positioned on or near the first end <b>86</b> of the cable jacket <b>26</b> and polymer material filling the shell. The polymer material may be a cured adhesive, such as epoxy, so that the shell is secured to the cable jacket <b>26</b> and the subunit jackets <b>30</b>. In alternative embodiments, the furcation body <b>84</b> may have a different construction and/or be secured to the trunk cable <b>20</b> in a different manner.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the end sections <b>88</b> of the subunits <b>22</b> each include the associated subunit jacket <b>30</b> extending a certain length from the furcation body <b>84</b>, and the associated group of optical fibers <b>24</b> extending a certain length from (i.e., beyond) the associated subunit jacket <b>30</b>. For convenience, only a representative ribbon <b>28</b> and representative ferrule <b>52</b> is schematically shown for each subunit <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. A close-up of the representative ribbon <b>28</b> and representative ferrule <b>52</b> for two of the subunits <b>22</b> is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As mentioned above, each subunit <b>22</b> may actually include a plurality of ribbons <b>28</b>, such as twelve ribbons <b>28</b> that each have twelve optical fibers <b>24</b> (144 fiber count per subunit <b>22</b>), twenty-four ribbons <b>28</b> that each have twelve optical fibers <b>24</b> (288 fiber count per subunit <b>22</b>), or the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the end sections <b>88</b> of the subunits <b>22</b> are grouped in pairs, with the end sections <b>88</b> of a given pair having substantially the same length. For example, the lowermost pair in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> includes the subunit jackets <b>30</b> extending a length L<b>1</b> from the furcation body <b>84</b>, and the optical fibers <b>24</b> extending a length L<b>2</b> from the subunit jacket <b>30</b>. The total length of the end section <b>88</b> (i.e., L<b>1</b>+L<b>2</b>) may be referred to as the &#x201c;leg length&#x201d;. The different pairs of end sections <b>88</b> have different leg lengths to provide a staggered arrangement of the ferrules <b>52</b>. This staggering allows the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> to be placed within a smaller pulling grip/sock (compared to if there were no staggering), and therefore, fit within smaller ducts or the like. These aspects will be described in connection with example uses of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> further below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, each successive group of end sections <b>88</b> has a leg length that is a distance D longer than the leg length of the preceding group. Thus, each group of end sections <b>88</b> is D longer than the previous group such that there is substantially uniform (i.e., uniform or intended to be uniform) staggering of the different groups of the ferrules <b>52</b>. In alternative embodiments, the staggering may be non-uniform. The different leg lengths may be due to the subunit jackets <b>30</b> extending further from the furcation body <b>84</b>. Thus, the length L<b>2</b> that the optical fibers <b>24</b> extend beyond the corresponding subunit jacket <b>30</b> may remain substantially the same (i.e., the same or intended to be the same). A consistent length of exposed ribbons <b>28</b> may allow consistent processing by the manufacturer of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> when terminating the optical fibers <b>24</b>. In other words, termination processes may be based on a certain exposed length of each ribbon <b>28</b> (e.g., for fixtures, stripping equipment, etc.). When that length is provided, the termination processes may be performed in a repeatable manner. Alternative embodiments without consistent lengths of exposed ribbons <b>28</b> are nevertheless within the scope of this disclosure as well.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to being pre-terminated with the ferrules <b>52</b>, the trunk cable <b>20</b> may be pre-terminated with a plurality of the ferrule push components <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>) described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> do not illustrate the ferrule push components <b>58</b> and other, optional components to simplify the drawings. Instead, reference can be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, which illustrate a representative termination. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, two ribbons <b>28</b> are shown as being terminated by a ferrule <b>52</b> in the form of a 24-fiber, MT ferrule. Only a short length of each ribbon <b>28</b> is shown for convenience; to ease understanding of other components shown in the drawings. It will be appreciated that the ribbons <b>28</b> extend rearwardly from the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule push component <b>58</b>, and ultimately into a subunit jacket <b>30</b>, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and discussed above. A ferrule boot <b>94</b> received in a rear portion of the ferrule <b>52</b> supports the optical fibers <b>24</b> as they extend from the ferrule <b>52</b>. Because the termination of optical fibers with ferrules and the use of ferrule boots are generally known, these aspects will not be described in further detail.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> also illustrates a guide pin assembly <b>96</b> behind the ferrule <b>52</b>. The guide pin assembly <b>96</b> includes the guide pins <b>56</b> secured to a pin keeper <b>98</b>. The guide pins <b>56</b> are intended to extend through pin holes <b>100</b> in the ferrule and project beyond the end face <b>54</b>, while the pin keeper <b>98</b> is intended to rest against a back surface of the ferrule <b>52</b> and prevent the guide pins <b>56</b> from being removed. It may be possible, however, to actuate the pin keeper <b>98</b> (e.g., by squeezing or expanding tabs) to allow intentional removal of the guide pins <b>56</b> from the front of the ferrule <b>52</b>. Like the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule boot <b>94</b>, the use of guide pin assemblies is generally known such that this aspect will also not be described in further detail. Indeed, the guide pin assembly <b>96</b> is an optional component in any event.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">More pertinent to this disclosure is the ferrule push <b>58</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and an optional dust cap <b>110</b>. The ferrule push <b>58</b> is a generally elongate structure with a front end <b>112</b>, a back end <b>114</b>, and an internal cavity <b>116</b> extending between the front end <b>112</b> and the back end <b>114</b>. The internal cavity <b>116</b> allows the ferrule push <b>58</b> to be received over the ribbons <b>28</b>, which may be done prior to terminating the ribbons <b>28</b> with the ferrule <b>52</b>. The ferrule push <b>58</b> in the embodiment shown is designed to be installed on the ribbons <b>28</b> in a particular orientation. Specifically, one side of the ferrule push includes a polarity key <b>118</b> intended to be oriented on a particular side of the ribbons <b>28</b>. The ribbons <b>28</b> are considered to have sides in the sense that the optical fibers <b>24</b> have a predefined order. Individual optical fibers <b>24</b> of a ribbon <b>28</b> have different colors, and the colors are arranged in a pre-defined order that is well-known in the telecommunications industry. Reference can be made to textbooks or standards like TIA/EIA 598-B: 2001, for example. The first optical fiber <b>24</b> of a ribbon <b>28</b> has a blue color, while the twelfth optical fiber <b>24</b> has an aqua color. On one side of the ribbon <b>28</b> the optical fibers <b>24</b> will appear in the normal order of 1 to 12 (blue to aqua), while on the other side of the ribbon <b>28</b> the optical fibers <b>24</b> will appear in reverse order, i.e. 12 to 1 (aqua to blue).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Advantageously, the ferrule push <b>58</b> includes slots or openings <b>120</b> on opposed sides to provide visibility into the internal cavity <b>116</b>. The openings <b>120</b> allow at least the first and last optical fibers <b>24</b> in the ribbons <b>28</b> to be seen by a technician. Thus, when placing the ferrule push <b>58</b> on the ribbons <b>28</b>, the technician can verify that the polarity key <b>118</b> is on the desired side of the ribbons <b>28</b> (i.e., the side corresponding to the normal order or reverse order of the optical fibers <b>24</b>, whichever is desired). Additionally, a window (not shown) on the top or bottom of the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be provided to view the correct order of the optical fibers <b>24</b>. The polarity key <b>118</b> not only orients the ferrule push <b>58</b> relative to the ribbons <b>28</b>, but also serves to orient the ferrule push <b>58</b> relative to the connector housing <b>62</b> when forming the optical connector <b>50</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, it can be seen how the connector housing <b>62</b> includes an internal keyway <b>70</b> on one surface so that the ferrule push <b>58</b> can only be inserted into the connector housing <b>62</b> in a single orientation. Thus, ultimately, the ribbons <b>28</b> are oriented relative to the adapter <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the openings <b>120</b> on the sides of the ferrule push <b>58</b> are spaced from the front end <b>112</b>. A front portion <b>124</b> of the ferrule push <b>58</b> extending front the front end <b>112</b> to the openings <b>120</b> is shaped to receive the ferrule boot <b>94</b> in the internal cavity <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, after terminating the optical fibers <b>24</b> with the ferrule <b>52</b>, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be pushed forward against the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. This may occur after pushing the pin keeper <b>98</b> against the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>, or the latter may occur simultaneously. That is, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be used to push the pin keeper <b>98</b> against the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. Either approach results in the guide pins <b>56</b> being pushed through the pin holes <b>100</b> in the ferrule <b>52</b> until portions of the guide pins <b>56</b> project beyond the end face <b>54</b>. In the embodiment shown, the ferrule push <b>58</b> includes front stops <b>126</b> (or &#x201c;bumpers <b>126</b>&#x201d;) that extend past the pin keeper <b>98</b> to directly contact the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. Thus, although the pin keeper <b>98</b> may be sandwiched between the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule push <b>58</b>, there is still at least some direct contact between the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule push <b>58</b>. The presence of the front stops <b>126</b> ensures that the ferrule push <b>58</b> still registers to the back of the ferrule <b>52</b> regardless of whether a guide pin assembly <b>96</b> is present or absent (as is the case for female configurations of the ferrule <b>52</b>). The ferrule push <b>58</b> in the embodiment shown also includes guide pin slots <b>128</b> on the sides of the front portion <b>124</b> to accommodate portions of the guide pins <b>56</b> located behind the pin keeper <b>98</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Unlike a connector housing, the ferrule push <b>58</b> does not extend past a shoulder/flange <b>132</b> on the ferrule <b>52</b> that defines or is proximate to the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. The ferrule push <b>58</b> does not extend over the ferrule <b>52</b> at all in some embodiments, with the front stops <b>126</b> simply contacting the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. Indeed, another advantage of the design in the embodiment shown is that the ferrule push <b>58</b> may have the same or substantially the same cross-sectional footprint as the ferrule <b>52</b>. The term &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; as used in this disclosure refers to only height, only width, or both height and width of the component in question (e.g., the ferrule <b>52</b> and/or the ferrule push <b>58</b>) when viewed in a cross-sectional plane that is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the component. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates how the front portion <b>124</b> of the ferrule push <b>58</b> has a footprint that generally matches the back of the ferrule <b>52</b>. The polarity key <b>118</b> on the top of the ferrule push <b>58</b>, along with the rear flanges <b>130</b> on sides of the ferrule push <b>58</b>, may protrude no further than or only slightly further than the footprint defined by the shoulder/flange <b>132</b> of the ferrule <b>52</b>. By having a footprint that is substantially the same or less than that of the ferrule <b>52</b>, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be installed on the ribbons <b>28</b> of the trunk cable <b>20</b> without increasing (or at least without substantially increasing) the footprint beyond increases resulting from installation of the ferrules <b>52</b>. As a specific example, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may have a maximum height and maximum width that is less than 20%, less than 15%, or even less than 10%, larger than the maximum height and maximum width of the ferrule <b>52</b>, when viewed in cross-sectional plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the ferrule <b>52</b>. While the length of the ferrule push <b>58</b> is shown larger than a length of the ferrule <b>52</b>, this is not a requirement, as the ferrule push <b>58</b> may have the same length or a smaller length than the ferrule <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The ferrule <b>52</b>, the pin keeper <b>98</b> (if present), and the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be secured together using an adhesive. Alternatively or additionally, the dust cap <b>110</b> may be used to retain the components together. The dust cap <b>110</b> has an interior space <b>140</b> that accommodates the ferrule <b>52</b>, the guide pin assembly <b>96</b> (including the portions of the guide pins <b>56</b> that project from the end face <b>54</b>), the front portion <b>124</b> of the ferrule push <b>58</b>, and an adjacent portion of the ferrule push <b>58</b> that includes the openings <b>120</b> and the polarity key <b>118</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the ferrule push <b>58</b>, the guide pin assembly <b>96</b>, and the aforementioned portions of the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be inserted into the dust cap <b>110</b>. Or, stated differently, the dust cap <b>110</b> may be received over the ferrule <b>52</b>, the guide pin assembly <b>96</b>, and the aforementioned portions of the ferrule push <b>58</b>. In the embodiment shown, the ferrule push latches <b>74</b> reside in cutouts <b>144</b> on opposed sides of the dust cap <b>110</b> when the dust cap <b>110</b> is installed. Thus, in the embodiment shown, the dust cap <b>110</b> does not contact or cover the ferrule push latches <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">To accommodate the polarity key <b>118</b> without a substantial increase in footprint, a top surface of the dust cap <b>110</b> includes a window <b>150</b> in which the polarity key <b>118</b> resides when the dust cap <b>110</b> is installed. The portion of the dust cap <b>110</b> adjacent (and defining) a back edge of the window <b>150</b> may be considered as a crossbar <b>152</b>, and may include features to assist with travel over the polarity key <b>118</b> during installation of the dust cap <b>110</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the crossbar <b>152</b> may include a ramped or inclined surface <b>154</b> facing the interior of the dust cap <b>110</b> (note: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is merely schematic, with structural details within some elements omitted or simplified). The polarity key <b>118</b> may also include features to assist with the dust cap <b>110</b> traveling over the polarity key <b>118</b> during removal of the dust cap <b>110</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> a rearward-facing surface <b>156</b> of the polarity key <b>118</b> may be ramped or inclined to make it easier for a forward-facing surface of the crossbar <b>152</b> to slide back over the polarity key <b>118</b>. It will be appreciated that this embodiment is merely an example, and that other embodiments may not include features on the dust cap <b>110</b> and/or the polarity key <b>118</b> to assist with travel of the dust cap <b>110</b> over the polarity key <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a window <b>150</b> may also be provided on a bottom surface of the dust cap <b>110</b> so that the dust cap <b>110</b> can be installed in different orientations. It therefore does not matter whether the top surface or the bottom surface is aligned with the polarity key <b>118</b> when installing the dust cap <b>110</b>. The discussion above about features to assist with the dust cap <b>110</b> sliding over the polarity key <b>118</b> apply equally to the bottom surface, which may have the same features as the top surface.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the dust cap <b>110</b> may have a low profile; one that does not substantially increase the cross-sectional footprint of a sub-assembly <b>168</b> that comprises the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule push <b>58</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the dust cap <b>110</b> may have a maximum height and maximum width that is less than 15%, or even less than 10%, larger than the maximum height and maximum width of the ferrule <b>52</b>, when viewed in cross-sectional plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the ferrule <b>52</b>. By having a footprint that is only slightly larger than the ferrule <b>52</b>, a dust cap <b>110</b> may be installed on each of the ferrules <b>52</b> of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) without substantially increasing the overall footprint of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b>. This may allow the pre-terminated trunk cable to still fit within a desired sized of a pulling grip (and, therefore, desired sizes of ducts for the pulling grip). Thus, the dust caps <b>110</b> may be used not only to protect the ferrules <b>52</b> from dust, debris, and other contaminants in a conventional manner (e.g., during storage), but also to provide mechanical protection within a pulling grip during installation, when the ferrules <b>52</b> might otherwise be subject to scratches or the like (e.g., from contacting other ferrules or portions of the pulling grip) when being pulled through ducts. Additionally, as mentioned above, the dust cap <b>110</b> may assist in keeping the ferrule <b>52</b>, the guide pin assembly <b>96</b>, and the ferrule push <b>58</b> assembled together (as the sub-assembly <b>168</b>), instead of or in addition to using adhesive, tape, or some other means of retaining the components together.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> on a reel <b>170</b> and an example of a pulling grip assembly <b>172</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;pulling grip <b>172</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;pulling sock <b>170</b>&#x201d;) installed over an end portion of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> (e.g., the end portion <b>82</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The pulling grip <b>172</b> covers all of the ferrules <b>52</b>, the ferrule push components <b>58</b>, and the dust caps <b>110</b> associated with the end portion <b>82</b>. It has already been mentioned how the staggering of the ferrules <b>52</b>, the design of the ferrule push components <b>58</b>, and the design of the dust caps <b>110</b> can help minimize the footprint of the pulling grip <b>172</b>. For a given pulling grip design, the maximum width/diameter can be less than what it would need to be to accommodate the trunk cable <b>20</b> being pre-terminated with assemblies considered to be optical connectors. Additional details of the pulling grip <b>172</b> need not be discussed for the purpose of this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is merely provided for context to show how the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> may be delivered to an intended site of installation, such as the data center <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). At the site of installation, the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> is ultimately installed and used as part of an interconnect system. An example installation of such an interconnect system for the data center <b>10</b> will now be described.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example Installation and Interconnect System</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates one possible embodiment for the distribution cabinets <b>32</b> mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The distribution cabinet <b>32</b> may be similar to embodiments described in PCT Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 2019/079460 A1 (&#x201c;the '460 publication&#x201d;) and WO 2019/079425 A1 (&#x201c;the '425 publication&#x201d;), the disclosures of which of fully incorporated herein by reference. Indeed, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> generally corresponds to FIG. 1 of the '425 publication such that reference can be made to the '425 publication for a more complete understanding of aspects not discussed below. Only a brief overview is provided below before focusing on differences from the '425 publication that are specific to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> includes various walls that are assembled together to define an interior volume <b>178</b>. In particular, the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> includes a rear wall <b>180</b>, a first side wall <b>182</b> and a second side wall <b>184</b> coupled to opposite sides of the rear wall <b>180</b>, and a lower wall <b>186</b> and an upper wall <b>188</b> respectively coupled to a top and bottom of each of the rear wall <b>180</b>, the first side wall <b>182</b>, and the second side wall <b>184</b>. A front door <b>190</b> is pivotally coupled to the first side wall <b>182</b> (e.g., by hinges <b>192</b>) to provide selective access to the interior volume <b>178</b>. The distribution cabinet <b>32</b> also includes a tray assembly <b>194</b> within the interior volume <b>178</b> that comprises a tray housing <b>196</b> pivotally coupled to the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> and a plurality of trays <b>198</b> coupled to the tray housing <b>196</b>. The tray housing <b>196</b> may pivot/rotate outward from the interior volume <b>178</b> to facilitate access to the trays <b>198</b>. The trays <b>198</b> themselves may pivot or otherwise move relative to the tray housing <b>196</b> (including being removable from the tray housing <b>196</b>) to provide additional access to any given tray <b>198</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The '425 publication refers to the trays <b>198</b> as &#x201c;splice trays&#x201d; because they are intended to store fusion splice joints between the optical fibers of two different cables. Because the present disclosure relates to pre-terminated cables rather than ones that require splicing, the more generic term &#x201c;tray&#x201d; is used. The trays <b>198</b> are still intended to store joints between the optical fibers of two different cables, but the joints are in the form optical connectors mated (i.e., coupled) together using respective adapters. The trays <b>198</b> may therefore be referred to as &#x201c;adapter trays <b>198</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;patch trays <b>198</b>&#x201d; and the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> as a &#x201c;patch cabinet <b>32</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;patch enclosure <b>32</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a possible embodiment for a representative one of the trays <b>198</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the tray <b>198</b> includes a series or bank of the adapters <b>60</b> coupled to the tray <b>198</b>. Any common grouping and mounting of adapters may be considered as an adapter panel for the purpose of this disclosure. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the adapters <b>60</b> are commonly mounted in a support <b>202</b> that, in turn, is mounted to the tray <b>198</b>. The support <b>202</b> with the adapters <b>60</b> may be considered as an adapter panel, or more generally the tray <b>198</b> assembled with the adapters <b>60</b> may be considered as an adapter panel. Indeed, in alternative embodiments, the adapters <b>60</b> may be mounted to the tray <b>198</b> individually instead of by way of a common support. Embodiments of &#x201c;ganged&#x201d; adapters mounted to the tray <b>198</b> are also possible. Each of the adapters <b>60</b> includes a respective connector housing <b>62</b> pre-installed on one side, as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, thereby forming respective adapter assemblies <b>64</b> that are pre-populated with respective connector housings <b>62</b> that are not intended to be removed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Now referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>12</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> may be routed from one building (main building <b>12</b> or auxiliary building <b>14</b>) to another in the data center <b>10</b>. This may involve using the pulling grip <b>172</b> to pull the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> through ducts that extend into and out of the buildings, and possibly between the buildings. Ultimately the end portion <b>82</b> that includes the pulling grip <b>172</b> may be routed into the interior volume <b>178</b> of the distribution cabinet <b>32</b>. Various features may be provided in the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> to assist with receiving the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a transparent rear plate <b>210</b> without openings as a rear portion of the upper wall <b>188</b>, such a plate may include different sized openings for different types of cables. For example, there may be openings sized to receive the larger, high fiber-count pre-terminated trunk cables <b>80</b>, and openings sized to receive the relative smaller fiber-count indoor cables <b>34</b>. A front plate <b>212</b> defining a front portion of the upper wall <b>188</b> may also be removable to assist with accessing the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> and other cables as they are routed into the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> (e.g., through the openings in the rear plate <b>210</b>, if present). Additionally, the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> may include brackets <b>216</b> below the rear plate <b>210</b> that serve as mounting locations for the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> and other cables. Apertures <b>218</b> or other mounting features may be provided on the brackets <b>216</b> for cooperating with complementary mounting features of clips (not shown), which may be integral with the cables (e.g., part of the furcation body <b>84</b>) or mounted to the cables.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Ultimately the pulling grip <b>172</b> is removed from the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> to expose the end sections <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the subunits <b>22</b>. This may be done before or after securing the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> to the brackets <b>216</b>. Regardless, having routed the end portion <b>82</b> into the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> using the pulling grip <b>172</b>, the end sections <b>88</b> of the subunits <b>22</b> are positioned close the trays <b>198</b>. This may help minimize the amount of further routing or handling of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> after the pulling grip <b>172</b> is removed, thereby reducing the potential for damage that results from sections of the ribbons <b>28</b> now being exposed (the end portions of the optical fibers <b>24</b> that extend from the associated subunit jackets <b>26</b>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The connection of each subunit <b>22</b> of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> to the corresponding indoor cable <b>34</b> generally takes place in a corresponding one of the trays <b>198</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> may represent the tray <b>198</b> associated with the connection between one of the subunits <b>22</b> and a corresponding indoor cable <b>34</b>. When it is desired to make that connection, the tray <b>198</b> is accessed from the tray assembly <b>194</b>. Both the pre-terminated sub-assemblies <b>84</b> of the subunit <b>22</b> (the sub-assemblies that each comprise one or more ribbons <b>28</b> having a ferrule <b>52</b> and a ferrule push <b>58</b>) and the adapters <b>60</b> are then prepared for coupling. For each pre-terminated sub-assembly <b>84</b>, this involves removing the dust cap <b>110</b> from the ferrule <b>52</b> and the ferrule push <b>58</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, there may be a dust cover <b>220</b> (sometimes referred as &#x201c;dust plug&#x201d;) that has been pre-installed in the corresponding connector housing <b>62</b>. This may be done at the time of assembling the connector housing <b>62</b> with the adapter <b>60</b> to prevent dust, debris, and other sources of contamination from entering the connector housing <b>62</b> and the adapter <b>60</b> prior to use. Like conventional dust plugs for adapters, the dust cover <b>220</b> may simply be removed by pulling it out of the component in which it is received (the connector housing <b>62</b> in the case of the dust cover <b>220</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the dust cap <b>110</b> and the dust cover <b>220</b> have been removed from the pre-terminated sub-assembly <b>84</b> and the associated adapter assembly <b>64</b>, the ferrule push <b>58</b> may be used to insert the ferrule <b>52</b> into the connector housing <b>62</b>. As mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the ferrule <b>52</b> may be advanced until its end face <b>54</b> protrudes slightly from the end of the connector housing <b>62</b> within the adapter <b>60</b>. Geometric features within the connector housing <b>62</b> ultimately limit travel of the ferrule <b>52</b> in the direction of insertion. The connector housing <b>62</b> may also engage and retain a portion of the ferrule push <b>58</b> in the end of the connector housing <b>62</b> that is outside the adapter <b>60</b>. With the ferrule <b>52</b> now retained with the connector housing <b>62</b>, the resulting assembly has the minimum attributes of an optical connector&#x2014;an element for optical alignment (the ferrule <b>52</b>) and an element for mechanical retention (the connector housing <b>62</b> and its mechanical reference datum(s)). In other words, the optical connector <b>50</b> can now be considered as having been formed. At the same time, installation of this optical connector <b>50</b> in the adapter <b>60</b> is complete, as the optical connector <b>50</b> is ready for coupling with another MPO connector in the adapter <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The process described above may be repeated for each of the pre-terminated sub-assemblies <b>84</b> associated with the subunit <b>22</b> and the corresponding adapter assemblies <b>64</b> on the tray <b>198</b>. Connections to the corresponding indoor cable <b>34</b> may be done at the same time (e.g., if the indoor cable <b>34</b> is already coupled to the adapters <b>60</b>) or later. In other words, the order of these steps may vary. A subunit <b>22</b> of the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b> may be coupled to the adapters <b>60</b> of the corresponding tray <b>198</b> prior to the corresponding indoor cable <b>34</b> being coupled to the adapters <b>60</b>, or vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Regardless of the timing, the indoor cable <b>34</b> may be routed into the distribution cabinet <b>32</b> in a manner similar to the pre-terminated trunk cable <b>80</b>. Before or after securing the indoor cable <b>34</b> to the distribution cabinet <b>32</b>, optical connectors (not shown) that have been pre-installed on the indoor cable <b>34</b> are coupled to the corresponding adapters <b>60</b> on the tray <b>198</b>. The adapters <b>60</b> may each have a dust cover <b>220</b> pre-installed on the side intended to receive the optical connectors of the indoor cable <b>34</b>.
