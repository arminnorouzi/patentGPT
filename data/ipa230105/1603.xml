According to the known method, the panel is composed of a bearer material and a decorative top layer. The resulting folded panel is a base board. In folded condition, the transition section is supported by the adhesive that also acts as a filler.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Objective of the present invention is to provide an optimized method for manufacturing a folded panel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This objective is achieved by the method according to the present invention, wherein a template is inserted into the recess before the panel sections are folded relative to each other, which template has an end face with a shape such that the transition section in folded condition abuts the end face, and the transition section is bent over the end face when bending the panel sections, after which the template is removed and the panel folded in this manner is held in the folded condition and subsequently the adhesive is applied.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An advantage of the invention is, that the transition section is supported during the bending of the panel sections relative to each other, so that in all cases these have a predefined shape after bending. This guidance during folding minimizes the risk of breakage in the transition section. The procedure results in a folded panel, which can for instance be used as stair covering, but alternative applications are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the template is shaped in such a way that outer sides of the template situated at both sides of the end face of the template in the folded condition, abut the opposite sidewalls of the panel sections at the location of the recess, because this makes it easy to realize a predefined mutual angle of the panel sections.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a specific embodiment, the end face has a curvature with a constant radius. This means that the end face in cross-section of the template forms part of a circle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The end face may be located on a thickened part of the template. This saves adhesive in the non-thickened section that is within the recess after the folding of the panel sections.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The template can be removed in the folded condition by sliding it in the lengthwise direction of the recess out of the recess and/or by sliding the folded panel lengthwise away from the template.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a special embodiment, the panel is fitted with a core, wherein at the front side of the panel a top layer of material other than the core is bonded to the core, wherein the transition section at least comprises the top layer. The top layer may be a decorative layer as known in laminated panels, such as laminated floor panels. The core may for instance be HDF or MDF, but also a synthetic composite is conceivable, wherein the synthetic composite preferably comprises a thermoplastic synthetic and fillers, for instance CaCO3, talcum, wood particles or grass particles. In the case of a synthetic composite, the material of the top layer preferably differs from the material of the core at least in that the material of the top layer is free of fillers, while the core comprises fillers, or at least still comprises less fillers than the core. The synthetic of the synthetic composite is preferably chosen from the group of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The top layer preferably contains the same synthetic as the core.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">At least one pair of opposite side edges of the panel may be provided with coupling means for coupling the panel to a similar panel, wherein the recess is provided parallel to the coupling means. This allows the resulting folded panels to be coupled together, for instance for creating stair covering. The coupling means comprise for instance a tongue and groove. Preferably, the folded panels are elongated and the coupling means are at least provided along the pair of long side faces, and the recess is also provided in the longitudinal direction. It is not ruled out that the folded panels are also provided with coupling means on the opposite end faces, so those can also be coupled with the adjacent similarly folded panels. This may for instance be interesting in the event the folded panels are used to cover a broad step, that is a step broader than the length of one folded panel</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also relates to a folded panel comprising a front side and a rear side and two panel sections of equal thickness located at an angle relative to each other, interconnected through a curved transition section at the location of the front side and thus together forming one whole, wherein the panel sections and the transition section enclose a space filled with adhesive, wherein the smallest distance between the panel sections is greater than the thickness of the transition section. When the folded panel is manufactured using a template, as in the above method, the panel sections will in all cases be located at a distance from each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The distance between the panel sections at the location of the transition section may be greater than at a distance from that; this typically being the case when a template is used in manufacturing, of which the end face is at a thickened part of the template.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Below, the invention will be illustrated with the aid of drawings, which very schematically show the embodiment examples of the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-section view of a panel from which a folded panel is manufactured by a method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is the same view as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> after installing a recess in the panel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the same view as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wherein the resulting folded panel is shown.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is indicated there by IV, wherein the folded condition with a template in the recess is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the same view as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, but wherein the folded panel has a different shape in the folded condition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> are cross-sectional views of versions of stair covering using panels and folded panels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is the same view as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, wherein the template has been removed from the recess.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a panel <b>1</b> with a front side <b>2</b> and a rear side <b>3</b>.
