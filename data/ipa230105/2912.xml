In the real world, graphene is of finite size and includes impurities. Notwithstanding these imperfections, the physical properties of real-world graphene are dominated by sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that are surrounded by three other carbon atoms disposed in a plane at angles of 120&#xb0; from one another, thereby approximating an infinite sheet of pure carbon. As a result of this structure, graphene has a number of very unusual physical properties, including very high elastic modulus-to-weight ratios, high thermal and electrical conductivity, and a large and nonlinear diamagnetism. Because of these unusual physical properties, graphene can be used in a variety of different applications, including conductive inks that can be used to prepare conductive coatings, printed electronics, or conductive contacts for solar cells, capacitors, batteries, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although idealized graphene includes only a single layer of carbon atoms, graphene structures that include multiple carbon layers (e.g., up to 10 layers, or up to 6 layers) can provide comparable physical properties and can be used effectively in many of these same applications. For the sake of convenience, both single atomic layer graphene and such multi-layered structures with comparable physical properties are referred to as &#x201c;graphene&#x201d; herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are a variety of different types of graphene and other carbonaceous flake materials. Basic characteristics of some of these materials are now described.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Chemical Vapor Deposition: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be used to produce graphene monolayers that have large flake sizes and low defect densities. In some cases, CVD yields graphene with multiple layers. In some cases, CVD can yield graphene that has macroscopic flake sizes (e.g., approaching 1 cm in length).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of the use of CVD to produce graphene can be found in <i>Science </i>342: 6159, p. 720-723 (2013), <i>Science </i>344: 6181, p. 286-289 (2014), and <i>Scientific Reports </i>3, Art. No.: 2465 (2013). According to the abstract of this last example, &#x201c;[c]hemical vapor deposition of graphene on transition metals has been considered as a major step towards commercial realization of graphene. However, fabrication based on transition metals involves an inevitable transfer step which can be as complicated as the deposition of graphene itself.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Natural graphite: Graphite occurs in nature and can be found in crystalline flake-like form that includes several tens to thousands of layers. The layers are typically in an ordered sequence, namely, the so-called &#x201c;AB stacking,&#x201d; where half of the atoms of each layer lie precisely above or below the center of a six-atom ring in the immediately adjacent layers. Because graphite flakes are so &#x201c;thick,&#x201d; they display physical properties that differ from those of graphene and many of these physical properties are relevant to different applications. For example, graphite flakes are very weak in shear (i.e., the layers can be separated mechanically) and have highly anisotropic electronic, acoustic, and thermal properties. Due to the electronic interaction between neighboring layers, the electrical and thermal conductivity of graphite is lower than the electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene. The specific surface area is also much lower, as would be expected from a material with a less planar geometry. Further, in typical flake thicknesses, graphite is not transparent to electromagnetic radiation at a variety of different wavelengths. In some cases, graphite flakes can have macroscopic flake sizes (e.g., 1 cm in length).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example of a characterization of graphite-based systems by Raman spectroscopy can be found in <i>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. </i>9, p. 1276-1290 (2007).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Graphene Oxide: Chemical or electrochemical oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide followed by exfoliation can be used to produce graphene oxide flakes. One of the more common approaches was first described by Hummers et al. in 1958 and is commonly referred to as &#x201c;Hummer's method.&#x201d; <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>80 (6) p. 1339-1339 (1958). In some cases, the graphene oxide can subsequently be partially reduced to remove some of the oxygen.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, oxidative etching of graphite not only separates graphene layers from each other, but also attacks the hexagonal graphene lattice. In general, the resulting graphene oxide is defect-rich and, as a result, displays reduced electrical- and thermal-conductivity, as well as a reduced elastic modulus. In addition, the in-plane etching of graphene flakes typically leads to relatively smaller lateral dimensions, with flake sizes being below few micrometers. In some cases, the average size of graphene oxide flakes in a polydisperse sample can be increased using physical methods such as, e.g., centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Examples of methods for producing and/or handling graphene oxide can be found in <i>Carbon </i>50(2) p. 470-475 (2012) and <i>Carbon </i>101 p. 120-128 (2016).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Liquid phase exfoliation: Flakes of carbonaceous material can be exfoliated from graphite in a suitable chemical environment (e.g., in an organic solvent or in a mixture of water and surfactant). The exfoliation is generally driven by mechanical force provided by, e.g., ultrasound or a blender. Examples of methods for liquid phase exfoliation can be found in <i>Nature Materials </i>13 p. 624-630 (2014) and <i>Nature Nanotechnology </i>3, p. 563-568 (2008).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Although the researchers who work with liquid phase exfoliation techniques often refer to the exfoliated carbonaceous flakes as &#x201c;graphene,&#x201d; the thickness of the vast majority of flakes produced by such exfoliation techniques often appears to be in excess of 10 layers. This can be confirmed using, e.g., Raman spectroscopc techniques. For example, in Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006, 97, 187401, an asymmetric shape of the Raman band around 2700 reciprocal centimeters indicates that these flakes are thicker than 10 layers. Indeed, the predominant thickness of such flakes often appears to be in excess of 100 layers, which can be confirmed by x-ray diffraction, scanning probe microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. As a result of this large thickness, the material properties often do not correspond to the properties expected from graphene. At 10 layers, properties like thermal conductivity approach the values of bulk graphite with AB stacking, as described in Nat. Mater. 2010, 9, 555-558. Properties like the specific surface area also scale with the inverse of the flake thickness.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Exfoliation of expanded graphite: Graphite can be expanded using thermal techniques such as, e.g., microwave irradiation. Flakes of carbonaceous material can be exfoliated from the expanded graphite in a suitable chemical environment (e.g., in an organic solvent or in a mixture of water and surfactant). The exfoliation is generally driven by mechanical force such as, e.g., ultrasound or a shear force from a blender. Examples of methods for liquid phase exfoliation of expanded graphite can be found in <i>J. Mater. Chem. </i>22 p. 4806-4810 (2012) and WO 2015131933 A1.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the researchers who work with exfoliation of expanded graphite often refer to the exfoliated carbonaceous flakes as &#x201c;graphene,&#x201d; the thickness of most of these flakes also appears to be in excess of 10 layers and even in excess of 100 layers. Analytical techniques for determining the thickness of flakes exfoliated from expanded graphite&#x2014;and the consequences of this thickness&#x2014;are similar to those described above with respect to liquid phase exfoliation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reduction of graphite: Graphite can be reduced and graphene exfoliated in strongly reductive environments via, e.g., Birch reduction in lithium. As graphene is increasingly reduced, more and more carbon atoms become hydrogenated and sp3-hybridized. In theory, the atomic C/H ratio can approach one, i.e., the resulting material becomes graphane rather than graphene. Examples of methods for the reduction of graphite can be found in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>134, p. 18689-18694 (2012) and <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>52, p. 754-757 (2013).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Lithium and other reductants that can be used to reduce graphite are very strong, difficult to handle, and difficult to dispose.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Electrochemical expansion: Graphene can also be produced by electrochemical cathodic treatment. Examples of methods for electrochemical expansion can be found in WO2012120264 A1 and <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>133, p. 8888-8891 (2011). The reductive environment can also induce hydrogenation of the resulting flakes, as described in <i>Carbon </i>83, p. 128-135 (2015) and WO2015019093 A1. In general, electrochemical expansion at conventional conditions often cannot produce a significant amount of graphene flakes with a thickness below 10 layers, which can be confirmed using Raman spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For the sake of validating the various analytical techniques described herein, various materials have been used as references.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first such reference material is reduced graphene oxide obtained from Graphenea S.

Apparatus <b>1</b> basically includes a container <b>10</b> that is bounded by a container wall <b>101</b>. Container <b>10</b> can have a round base and a generally cylindrical shape.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In the illustrated embodiment, a cathode <b>3</b> is disposed in container <b>10</b> and either forms the bottom surface or substantially fills the entire bottom surface of container <b>10</b>. Cathode <b>3</b> includes a base body <b>31</b> that contains, for example, a metal, an alloy, or porous silicon. A diamond layer is deposited on the base body <b>31</b> and may be produced, e.g., by chemical vapor deposition. The diamond layer of the cathode <b>3</b> may have a thickness of about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to about 20 to um or from about 2 to about 5 um. The diamond layer of the cathode <b>3</b> may optionally be doped using an n- or p-type dopant to reduce the electric resistance of the cathode. In some implementations, boron may be used as a dopant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">An anode <b>4</b> is also disposed in container <b>10</b>. The anode has a shape and size that substantially occupies the entire base of the container <b>10</b>. In this manner, a largely homogeneous electrical field is generated in container <b>10</b> and a large percentage of the container volume can be utilized in the production of the graphene.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In some implementations, anode <b>4</b> can include or be formed of a metal or an alloy. In some implementations, anode <b>4</b> may also include or be formed of diamond. The diamond may be mounted on a base body, as described with regard to the cathode, or implemented as free-standing diamond layer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">An optional separator <b>5</b> is also disposed in container <b>10</b>. Separator <b>5</b> may include or be formed of, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), diamond, Al2O3 or other material. Separator <b>5</b> may include or be formed of a dielectric. Separator <b>5</b> can be provided with holes or with pores that, for example, have a diameter of less than 10 um, less than 5 um, less than 1 micrometer, or less than 0.5 um. This allows the passage of electrolyte (for example, liquid water) and ions through separator <b>5</b> while preventing particles of graphite or graphene that are found within container <b>10</b> from coming into contact with anode <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In the illustrated implementation, separator <b>5</b> separates a cathode chamber <b>30</b> from an anode chamber <b>40</b>. In other implementations, the separator <b>5</b> can be deposited directly on the anode <b>4</b> or fixed to the anode <b>4</b>, for example, by adhesive bonding. Accordingly, anode chamber <b>40</b> can be omitted in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">In operation, at least one electrolyte is disposed in the container <b>10</b> between anode <b>4</b> and cathode <b>3</b>. In some implementations, the electrolyte may be an aqueous electrolyte, and may optionally contain substances for increasing the electrical conductivity such as, for example, dilute acids or salts. In other implementations, the electrolyte may include or be formed of at least one organic solvent. In still other implementations, the electrolyte can include propylene carbonate and/or dimethylformamide and/or organic salts, whose ions inhibit the formation of a stable crystal lattice through charge delocalization and steric effects so that they are liquid at temperatures below 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">Further, graphite in the form of particles <b>2</b> is disposed in the cathode chamber <b>30</b> during operation of apparatus <b>1</b>. The graphite particles <b>2</b> are dispersed in the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">With this arrangement, an electrical voltage of between approximately 5 V and approximately 60 V, or between approximately 15 V and approximately 30 V is applied between cathode <b>3</b> and anode <b>4</b> by an electric voltage source <b>6</b>. This generates an electric field in the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">With such a high electric voltage present, the water and/or an organic solvent present in the electrolyte can be dissociated with high efficiency. This produces hydrogen at cathode <b>3</b> and oxygen at anode <b>4</b>. The graphite disposed in the cathode chamber <b>30</b> takes up this hydrogen by intercalation of individual atoms or molecules between the lattice planes of the graphite lattice and/or chemisorption of individual atoms or molecules on the surface. In other words, the graphite becomes hydrogenated. Separator <b>5</b> thereby prevents graphite from coming into contact with anode <b>4</b>, e.g., by penetrating into the anode chamber <b>40</b>. Thus, the graphite disposed in container <b>10</b> is kept away from the resulting oxygen at anode <b>4</b> and oxygen does not intercalate in the graphite.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">By rotation of separator <b>5</b> in container <b>10</b>, a shear flow can be produced in the cathode chamber <b>30</b> which leads to mixing of the electrolyte and the dispersed graphite. This mixing can provide a uniform treatment of the graphite particles.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Furthermore, apparatus <b>1</b> may include an optional feed apparatus <b>11</b> through which electrolyte and graphite can be introduced as a dispersion into the cathode chamber <b>30</b>. Moreover, apparatus <b>1</b> may include an optional discharge apparatus <b>12</b> through which hydrogenated graphite <b>7</b> can be discharged. Mass transport from a feed apparatus <b>11</b> that is generally concentric with the base of the container <b>10</b> to a discharge apparatus <b>12</b> that is arranged at a peripheral rim of container <b>10</b> may be encourages by the rotation of separator <b>5</b>. In this way, apparatus <b>1</b> can be operated continuously by continuously feeding graphite particles <b>2</b> through feed apparatus <b>11</b> and discharging hydrogenated graphite <b>7</b> through discharge apparatus <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic representation of the hydrogenated graphite produced by apparatus <b>1</b> and the impact of various subsequent processing steps on that material.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">In particular, reference numeral <b>105</b> designates the hydrogenated graphite suspension discharged from apparatus <b>1</b>.

For example, the defect density of the flakes <b>106</b> in suspension <b>125</b> and GRAPHENEA RGO is believed to be higher than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>defects per square centimeter or, for example, higher than 1&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>defects per square centimeter (Spectrosc. Eur. 2015, 27, 9-12).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">Hydrogenated graphite layers <b>106</b> from suspension <b>125</b> can be converted to dehydrogenated graphite layers <b>116</b> by drop-casting hydrogenated graphite layers <b>106</b> on a wafer and thermally treating the same wafer at 800&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes in nitrogen atmosphere at 2 mbar. After the thermal treatment, a D/G area ratio of 0.17&#xb1;0.06 can be measured in a single location. This indicates that more than 50% of the defects in hydrogenated graphite layers <b>106</b> before the thermal de-hydrogenation were chemical defects associated with chemisorption of hydrogen. Hydrogen chemisorption is known to be reversible (Science 2009, 323, 610-613). In contrast, graphene oxide generally does not exhibit D/G area ratios below 0.5 even after thermal reduction at comparable temperatures (Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 3583-3587). This is consistent with the measured D/G area ratio for GRAPHENEA RGO, which is reduced graphene oxide and still yielded a D/G area ratio larger than one.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">On the other hand, these results are believed to indicate that the defect density of dehydrogenated graphite layers <b>116</b> is less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>defects per square centimeter, for example, less than 5&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>defects per square centimeter or less than 3&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>defects per square centimeter.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">Further, although the defect density is quite low, some dehydrogenated graphite layers <b>116</b> retain characteristics that may be indicative of residual defects. For example, in some implementations, the full width half maximum of the G peak in &#x3bc;-Raman spectra collected at 532 nm excitation with a resolution better than 1.8 reciprocal centimeters is larger than 20 reciprocal centimeters, for example larger than 25 reciprocal centimeters or larger than 30 reciprocal centimeters. As another example, in some implementations, the &#x3bc;-Raman spectra of the de-hydrogenated graphite collected at 532 nm excitation with a resolution better than 1.8 reciprocal centimeters show a broad peak in the range between 1000 and 1800 reciprocal centimeters with a full width half maximum of more than 200 reciprocal centimeters, for example, more than 400 reciprocal centimeters.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">In summary, a significant reduction of factor two or more of the Raman D/G area ratio can be obtained by thermal treatments of hydrogenated graphite layers such as hydrogenated graphite layers <b>106</b> at temperatures in excess of 300&#xb0; C. The reductions in Raman area D/G area ratio are believed to be attributable to de-hydrogenation. The reduction in the Raman D/G area ratio can be, for example, by a factor of more than three, or, for example, by a factor of more than five. The reduction in Raman D/G area ratio is believed to be indicative of the production of a graphene with a low defect density. For example, in some implementations, more than 50% of the statistical spectra display a D/G area ratio below 0.8, for example more than 90% display a D/G area ratio below 0.8. In some implementations, 50% or more (e.g., more than 90%) display a D/G area ratio below 0.5. In some implementations, 20% or more (e.g., more than 50%) display a D/G area ratio below 0.2. The average D/G area ratio of at least 100 statistical spectra evaluated by the procedure described above in smaller than 0.8, for example, smaller than 0.5 or smaller than 0.2.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">Along with probing the defect density, Raman scattering of graphene also provides an indirect measure of the number of atomic layers is using the peak symmetry of the 2D band. For example, in Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006, 97, 187401, it is described that an asymmetric shape of the Raman band around 2700 reciprocal centimeters indicates that flakes are thicker than 10 atomic layers and that mechanically exfoliated graphene displays asymmetric peak shapes even for flakes of two or more atomic layers. Although it is believed that a direct, statistical determination of the average number of atomic layers has yet to be developed, the symmetry of the 2D band is believed to be the most suitable technique for relative comparisons of the average number of atomic layers in different samples.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">Peak &#x201c;symmetry&#x201d; can be quantified by a variety of different approaches. For example, the coefficient of determination for a Pseudo-Voigt peak fitting of a single peak is believed to be a relatively robust approach. For this purpose, a standardized procedure for preparing, fitting, and evaluating graphene Raman spectra has been developed and made available at https://github.com/graphenestandards/raman. For the evaluations below release v1.0 has been used and the permalink to the used script is https://github.com/graphenestandards/raman/blob/5cb74ed87545082bd587e4319c061ea2c50e3a6f/DtoG-2Dsymetry.ipynb. Use of this script allows recorded Raman data to be evaluated in a transparent and uniform manner and allows comparisons between values obtained in different laboratories.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">In further detail, Raman spectra are recorded using 532 nm laser excitation between 1260 and 2810 reciprocal centimeters and a spectral resolution better than 1.8 reciprocal centimeters. The spectral range for 2D band evaluation is cut to between 2555 and 2810 reciprocal centimeters. A linear baseline is subtracted by fitting a straight line to the data, while omitting the range of the 2D band between 2600 and 2790 reciprocal centimeters. The result is subtracted from the data. Spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio (determined as the squared variance of the data divided by the squared variance of the residuals of the baseline fit) below 5000 are discarded, since it is believed that they do not allow for reliable evaluation of the peak shape. It is believed to be necessary that more than 100 spectra should remain for sufficiently meaningful results to be obtained. A Pseudo-Voigt peak is fitted by a least-squares minimization to the baseline corrected data, with the center constrained between 2650 and 2750 reciprocal centimeters, the full width at half maximum constrained to 10 to 240 reciprocal centimeters, the Gaussian to Lorentzian fraction constrained to 0.01 to 1, and the amplitude to positive values. To limit the impact of detector noise, the fit residuals and the Raman intensity data are smoothed by calculating the running average of data between 2600 and 2790 reciprocal centimeters with a window of five datapoints after the fitting. From the obtained values, the coefficient of determination is calculated as the variance of the smoothed residuals divided by the variance of the smoothed Raman intensity data and subtracting the result from one.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">This procedure yields the coefficient of determination of the 2D single peak fitting (2D R<sup>2</sup>), which is believed to be a measure for the symmetry of the 2D Raman band of graphite and graphene. Values close to one are believed to indicate a high symmetry of the 2D band and lower values believed to indicate an increasing asymmetry of the 2D band.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">If the evaluated graphite or graphene is has a D/G area ratio below 0.5, the symmetry of the 2D band is believed to be indicative of the average thickness of flakes. In this regard, defect-rich materials often display 2D peak asymmetry for very thin layers and even monolayers. On the other hand, sometimes an otherwise clear asymmetry of thicker layers is screened by the very large width of the 2D peak, which is typical for materials with a high D/G area ratio. For these reasons, the 2D band symmetry evaluation of the flake thickness was only applied for materials fulfilling the criterion of a D/G area ratio below 0.5. A high symmetry is believed to indicate a relative low number of AB stacked layers, for example, less than 10 layers, for example, less than five layers or even a single layer. An increasing layer number corresponds to decreasing values of the coefficient of determination of the 2D single peak fitting (2D R<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">After de-hydrogenation, the D/G area ratio is below 0.5 and an evaluation of the 2D peak symmetry becomes possible.
