In terms of material types, the toughening agent <b>2</b> is a polyolefin elastomer (POE), which is also called a polyolefin thermoplastic elastomer. The toughening agent <b>2</b> dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> can be used to improve the impact strength of the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In terms of content range, based on the total weight of the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b>, a content range of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is preferably between 5 wt. % and 15 wt. %, and more preferably between 7-10 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the above configuration, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> can have high impact resistance through the addition of the toughening agent <b>2</b>. If the content of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is less than a lower limit of the above content range, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> will not have sufficient impact strength and cannot be applied to products with high impact resistance requirements. Conversely, if the content of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is greater than an upper limit of the above-mentioned content range, the toughening agent <b>2</b> will not be uniformly dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>. Accordingly, aggregation or precipitation of the toughening agent <b>2</b> may occur, thereby affecting formability of a final product and affecting performance of the impact strength.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">From another perspective, one of the objectives of the present disclosure is to improve the impact strength of polyester materials, so as to enable the polyester materials to have high impact strength, high rigidity, and low material cost at the same time. In order to achieve the foregoing objective, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> of the present embodiment adopts the polyolefin elastomer (POE) as a toughening agent (also called an impact-resistant modifier).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Compared with an acrylic elastomer or a polyester elastomer, the polyolefin elastomer (POE) has a better intrinsic toughness and a lower material price. Therefore, an application of the polyolefin elastomer for improving the impact strength of the polyester materials has considerable advantages. However, compatibility between the polyolefin elastomer and the polyester material is not good. If only the polyolefin elastomer is directly mixed with the polyester material by way of an additive modification method, the polyolefin elastomer is easy to agglomerate, and the impact strength of the polyester material cannot be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, a key technology of the present disclosure is to adjust a dispersed particle size of the polyolefin elastomer in the polyester material to be between 0.5 micrometers and 1.5 micrometers, and preferably between 0.5 micrometers and 1.2 micrometers, through compatibility modification, viscosity matching, and a kneading dispersion treatment between the polyolefin elastomer and the polyester material. Within the dispersed particle size, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> of the present embodiment can achieve characteristics of high impact resistance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, the compatibilizing agent (not shown in the drawings) is dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>. The compatibilizing agent is configured to assist in improving the compatibility between the toughening agent <b>2</b> and the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In terms of material types, the compatibilizing agent is a polyolefin elastomer compatibilizing agent. In particular, the compatibilizing agent is at least one of a polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA) and a polyolefin elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (POE-g-MAH). Preferably, the compatibilizing agent is the polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, the compatibilizing agent is configured to assist the toughening agent <b>2</b> to be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> with a particle size between 0.5 micrometers and 1.5 micrometers, so that the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> has an impact strength of not less than 20 kg-cm/cm. In other words, the compatibilizing agent can effectively improve the compatibility and the dispersibility of the toughening agent <b>2</b> in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the toughening agent <b>2</b> can be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> with a smaller particle size, and is less likely to agglomerate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the toughening agent <b>2</b> is dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> with a particle size of between 0.5 micrometers and 1.2 micrometers. The impact strength of the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> is between 28 kg-cm/cm and 50 kg-cm/cm, and is more preferably between 30 kg-cm/cm and 45 kg-cm/cm.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In terms of content range, based on the total weight of the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b>, a content range of the compatibilizing agent is preferably between 2 wt. % and 15 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the above configuration, the compatibilizing agent can effectively assist the toughening agent <b>2</b> to be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> with a smaller particle size. If the content of the compatibilizing agent is lower than a lower limit of the above content range, the compatibilizing agent cannot effectively assist the toughening agent <b>2</b> to be dispersed into the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> with a smaller particle size, and an auxiliary effect provided by the compatibilizing agent is poor. Conversely, if the content of the compatibilizing agent is higher than an upper limit of the above content range, the compatibilizing agent may affect formability of the polyester material, and an aggregation or precipitation phenomenon may occur.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the content range of the toughening agent <b>2</b> and the content range of the compatibilizing agent have a matching relationship there-between. Specifically, the content range of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is not less than the content range of the compatibilizing agent. Preferably, a weight ratio of the toughening agent <b>2</b> relative to the compatibilizing agent ranges from 1:1 to 4:1. More preferably, the weight ratio of the toughening agent <b>2</b> relative to the compatibilizing agent ranges from 1:1 to 2:1.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In terms of additives, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> further includes an antioxidant and a slip agent dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>. Based on the total weight of the impact-resistant polyester material being 100 wt. %, a content range of the antioxidant is between 0.1 wt. % and 1.0 wt. %, and a content range of the slip agent is between 0.1 wt. % and 1.0 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In terms of material types, the antioxidant is at least one material selected from a group consisting of a phenolic antioxidant, a phosphorous acid antioxidant, and a hindered phenolic antioxidant. The slip agent is at least one material selected from a group consisting of silicon dioxide, stearic acid, polyethylene wax, stearates, fatty acid esters, and composite slip agents, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In terms of usage, the antioxidant is used to improve an oxidation resistance of the polyester material <b>100</b>, and the slip agent is used to reduce a coefficient of friction or stickiness on a surface of the polyester material <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a molecular structure of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is all polyolefin elastomer (POE). A molecular structure of the compatibilizing agent has a main chain and a side chain, and the main chain is the polyolefin elastomer (POE). Therefore, the compatibilizing agent can have excellent compatibility with the toughening agent <b>2</b> through its main chain due to the same molecular structure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the compatibilizing agent is further defined as a polyolefin elastomer grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (POE-g-GMA). The molecular structure of the compatibilizing agent has a main chain and a side chain melt-grafted with the main chain, the main chain is the polyolefin elastomer (POE), and the side chain is the glycidyl methacrylate (GMA).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The glycidyl methacrylate can produce a ring-opening reaction during a mixing process, and an epoxy group in the glycidyl methacrylate can chemically react with an ester group in a molecular structure of the polyester resin matrix material after the ring-opening reaction, so that the toughening agent <b>2</b> is more uniformly dispersed in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, to improve the dispersibility of the toughening agent <b>2</b> (POE) in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> may be formed into a polyester master-batch by extrusion granulation, so that the toughening agent <b>2</b> is dispersed in the polyester material for a first time. The polyester master-batch is then molded into a molded product (such as an injection part or an extruded part) by injection molding or extrusion molding, so that the toughening agent <b>2</b> is dispersed in the polyester material for a second time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, to improve the dispersibility and the compatibility of the toughening agent <b>2</b> (POE) in the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>, a melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> and a melt flow index of the toughening agent <b>2</b> have a matching relationship there-between.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> (PET) has a first melt flow index, and the toughening agent <b>2</b> (POE) has a second melt flow index. The first melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> is between 55 g/10 min and 65 g/10 min. The second melt flow index of the toughening agent <b>2</b> is between 75% and 125% of the first melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b>, and is preferably between 80% and 120%. For example, the first melt flow index of the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> is about 60 g/10 min, and the second melt flow index of the toughening agent <b>2</b> (POE) is about 50 g/10 min.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that the &#x201c;melt flow index (MI)&#x201d; referred herein can also be called a melt flow rate (MFR). The melt flow index refers to a weight of a polymer melt that passes through a standard die (2.095 mm) every ten minutes under a certain temperature and a certain load.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> is a continuous phase, and the toughening agent <b>2</b> is a dispersed phase dispersed in the continuous phase. The dispersed phase and the continuous phase interact with each other, so that a material surface of the impact-resistant polyester material forms a sea-island structure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is worth mentioning that the above-mentioned &#x201c;sea-island structure&#x201d; refers to poor compatibility between two high molecular weight polymers (i.e., the polyester resin matrix material <b>1</b> and the toughening agent <b>2</b>). After the two high molecular weight polymers are blended with each other, a heterogeneous system is formed. The dispersed phase is dispersed in the continuous phase, which is like small islands scattered in the ocean. By using a mechanism of two-phase interaction of the sea-island structure, properties of a polymer can be improved.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the impact-resistant polyester material <b>100</b> can be molded into molded products (such as injection parts or extruded parts) by injection molding or extrusion molding.
