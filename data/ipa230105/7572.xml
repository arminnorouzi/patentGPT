Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any type of suitably arranged device or system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of fourth generation (4G) communication systems and to enable various vertical applications, 5G/NR communication systems have been developed and are currently being deployed. The 5G/NR communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 28 GHz or 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates or in lower frequency bands, such as 6 GHz, to enable robust coverage and mobility support. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G/NR communication systems.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, in 5G/NR communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancelation and the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The discussion of 5G systems and frequency bands associated therewith is for reference as certain embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented in 5G systems. However, the present disclosure is not limited to 5G systems, or the frequency bands associated therewith, and embodiments of the present disclosure may be utilized in connection with any frequency band. For example, aspects of the present disclosure may also be applied to deployment of 5G communication systems, sixth generation (6G) or even later releases which may use terahertz (THz) bands.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">5G enables setting up application services closer to the end user using edge computing architectures. When there is a need for relocation (e.g., when user moves to a different location, fault tolerance, etc.), the application services that were serving the user have to be relocated as well. This application covers the aspects of application service relocation for 5G multimedia edge services.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At different instances of times, depending on user demand, edge resource orchestration and scaling is performed to meet the demands for the application service. Since edge resources are usually shared by different application services and network slices, allocation and preemption of resources allocated to these application services become important. This disclosure covers the aspects of inferring optimum edge resource allocation for different edge services so resource sharing by different media application services can be optimized. In particular, this disclosure addresses prioritization of edge services by application service providers so resource allocation and preemption methods can be correctly implemented when the edge services share edge resources; defining methods for learning optimum edge resource allocation based on past allocation, current user feedback for the received service, and the currently allocated resource share; distribution and federated learning mechanisms to optimize resources allocated to an edge media service; fallback options if edge services cannot be allocated shared edge resources; and provisioning information by the application service provider to facilitate learning and inference of edge resources allocated to individual edge media services.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">5G architecture is more flexible and elastic compared to the older generations of telecom networks. Due to improvements in software technologies and component hardware, complex use cases that were otherwise difficult or impossible to provide are becoming possible. These complex use cases represent high complexity media communication services that could involve multiple service components, each of which could have been a separate service by itself. Due to various requirements (quality, experience, etc.), it may be required to provide individual service components with different quality and experience. Optimization and synchronization are issues with these individual service components. How to optimize service delivery, provisioning issues are being addressed in this application.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Edge computing is fast becoming a de-facto standard for deploying high fidelity applications that require very fast throughput and low latency enabler. Services are deployed in the edge networks of mobile operators to enable users of such services to avail the benefits of high bandwidth 5G networks. Resources allocated to edge services are shared across multiple application types and services. In this context, defining priority and preemption methods becomes imperative when multiple application services are deployed in the edge network. In addition, availability of dynamic and adaptive learning mechanisms is very useful to orchestrate and scale resources in edge network for different application services. This has to be done keeping in context the performance and experience of the application service and user feedback. This disclosure covers aspects related to sharing of edge resource allocation information for different application services, and how peer edge networks can use this information to optimally allocate resources for those services in their networks.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">This application covers aspects related to deployment of network slices to deliver individual components of a media communication service, slice identification across different service components for media communication service policy enforcement, and media communication service optimization using automatic enhancement of QoS parameters and offloading network slices to edge networks for compute intensive operations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This application also describes resource allocation and scaling for edge media services based on distributed and federated learning mechanisms; using service priorities configured by application service providers to prioritize allocation and scaling of edge resources to edge services; provisioning and configuration of edge service parameters by the application service provider to facilitate learning and inferring optimum edge resource allocation in a shared edge environment; and relocation of edge media service to core network or other edge networks based on inference of resource requirements.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Improvements described in this invention include media communication service optimization using automatic enhancement of QoS parameters of network slices of individual service components to meet service quality expectations of the media communication service, dynamic policy update of individual network slices for media communication service optimization, and media communication service optimization using offloading network slice resources to edge networks.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additional improvements described in this application include edge network service priorities provisioned by application service providers for determining priority in shared edge resource allocation and preemption; adaptive edge network resource orchestration and scaling based on user feedback and peer edge network learning of service resources; exchange of parameter collection with edge network service and resource profile information to enable optimum deployment of edge resources for different edge media services; and edge service relocation based on resource allocation inference information.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The use of computing technology for media processing is greatly expanding, largely due to the usability, convenience, computing power of computing devices, and the like. Portable electronic devices, such as laptops and mobile smart phones are becoming increasingly popular as a result of the devices becoming more compact, while the processing power and resources included a given device is increasing. Even with the increase of processing power portable electronic devices often struggle to provide the processing capabilities to handle new services and applications, as newer services and applications often require more resources that is included in a portable electronic device. Improved methods and apparatus for configuring and deploying media processing in the network is required.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Cloud media processing is gaining traction where media processing workloads are setup in the network (e.g., cloud) to take advantage of advantages of the benefits offered by the cloud such as (theoretically) infinite compute capacity, auto-scaling based on need, and on-demand processing. An end user client can request a network media processing provider for provisioning and configuration of media processing functions as required.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example communication system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of this disclosure.

The embodiment of the hybrid service <b>600</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is for illustration only. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> does not limit the scope of this disclosure to any particular implementation of an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, 3GPP SA4 SWG is studying the issue of hybrid services <b>600</b>, and the preliminary specification is provided in 3GPP TR 26.802. With hybrid services delivery, the same service is available on different delivery systems, for example on multicast, on broadcast or on unicast. In addition, a service available on one delivery system may be enhanced by additional resources available on a different delivery system. Finally, a service includes sufficient information such that a client can synchronize or seamlessly replace the service on one delivery system with the one on a different one.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition to using different delivery systems for same service, it is also possible that an application service may need sessions that were otherwise realized as individual services. In this disclosure, these services are referred to as media communication services. A first example of a media communication service is a volumetric conversational service where users interact with volumetric contents (e.g., 3D, pointcloud, lightfield, etc.). However, the conversational service can be enhanced with streaming aspects to download/upload content between the users and the network. For example, two users communicating with each other using volumetric content, but can download/upload media content during the service for an enhanced experience. Traditionally, volumetric conversational service is a different application and download/upload streaming is a different application, but it is theoretically possible to provide both these application within the same service, so the users have an enhanced user experience with a media communication service.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">A second example of a media communication service is a volumetric conversational service exists between multiple users instead of two users (e.g., conferencing service). It is possible to enhance a conferencing service with streaming aspects where the users in the conference can receive the same content using a multicast/broadcast delivery system. It is also possible that all the users in the conferencing session establish individual unicast sessions to download/upload content.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A third example of a media communication service is a simultaneous delivery using both 5G and non-3GPP access for the same service. For example, a user is using 5G download streaming to download media content sourced from an external application provider, but this service can be enhanced by allowing partial/offloaded content using non-3GPP access simultaneously. The non-3GPP access in this case could be a WIFI access or ATSC (TV broadcast) delivery systems.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Traditionally, each of the different service within the media communication service are provided to the user with a different user experience, quality, and expectation. When media communication services need to be realized it is important that methods be available to allow for synchronization of service quality and experience across multiple services that make up the media communication service. There are no solutions currently specified in standard organizations about realizing the delivery of hybrid and media communication services. In this invention, provided are technology enablers based on 5G network slicing about realizing hybrid and media communication services.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example hybrid service <b>600</b>, various changes may be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

A first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>can connects to a first data network <b>708</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the 5G IMS data network) for volumetric conversational service. A second network slice <b>728</b> can connect to a different, second data network <b>708</b><i>b </i>e.g., for downloading content using 5G Media Streaming as defined in 3GPP TS 26.501 and 3GPP TS 26.502. An application in the UE <b>702</b> may use these two network slices <b>728</b> based on implementation of the application running on the UE <b>702</b>. In this case, the UE application is responsible for utilizing two separate network slice connections, and then bridge (or utilize) the content retrieved using two different network slices <b>728</b>. However, since the support for network slicing is not natively available from the network to the UE <b>702</b>, it is entirely possible that there is a synchronization issue with content retrieved using the two different network slices <b>728</b>. For example, two UEs <b>702</b> are communicating with each other using the first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>(volumetric conversational service). As part of the interaction, the UEs <b>702</b> can agree on viewing some content together (e.g., some 2D/3D video content, images, shared collaboration etc.) for which they use the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b </i>to retrieve the content. It is possible that since the two services are not synchronized, the content the two users are trying to retrieve using the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b </i>are not available in time. This can happen because of a) different quality parameters attributed to the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b </i>compared to the first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>and the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b</i>) network issues. In certain embodiments, the UE <b>702</b> can negotiate similar QoS to both of the network slices <b>728</b> so some of the problems can be alleviated.

Similarly, once the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b </i>is setup, the first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>is updated with the slice identifier of the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b </i>so the control plane nodes of the first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>are aware that a corresponding network slice <b>728</b> (with slice identifier of the second network slice <b>728</b><i>b</i>) is setup.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In addition, to have the control plane nodes of all network slices <b>728</b> aware of other network slices <b>728</b> for the media communication/hybrid service, a &#x201c;Media-communication-Service-Id&#x201d; field can be included in all media service connection setup requests for each of the network slices <b>728</b> utilized for that media communication service. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the above steps and different signaling message fields for setting up media communication service with two network slices <b>728</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an example for a media communication service with two network slices <b>728</b>, which can be expanded to a media communication service with any number of network slices <b>728</b>.

For example, if an abstract QoS score scale is defined from 0 to 1 and a media communication service has a first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>with a performance of 0.9 on the QoS score scale and an nth network slice <b>728</b><i>n </i>with a performance of 0.5 on the QoS score scale, the quality of the nth network slice <b>728</b><i>n </i>can be enhanced to the level of the first network slice <b>728</b><i>a </i>so both network slices <b>728</b> together can provide the aggregated end-to-end quality of media communication service. To achieve this, while the service is provisioned by the external application provider, an additional field called &#x201c;enhance-to-highest-network-slice level&#x201d; is defined. The semantics of &#x201c;enhance-to-highest-network-slice level&#x201d; field can include a Boolean variable indicating whether all network slices <b>728</b> are to be collectively enhanced to match a quality of a best performing network slice <b>728</b>. The Boolean variable can be &#x201c;True&#x201d; to indicate that all the network slices <b>728</b> need to be enhanced to a quality of a highest performing network slice <b>728</b> and &#x201c;False&#x201d; to indicate that network slice parameter optimization is to be performed separately and optimization of a single network slice <b>728</b> may not affect optimization of other network slices <b>728</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a media communication service network slice parameter optimization <b>1200</b>, various changes may be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.

With the throughput estimation facility, network performs throughput estimation which allows the UE <b>702</b> to start a downlink streaming session at an appropriate bit rate for the network conditions at hand. The UE <b>702</b> can also perform throughput estimation based on its own measurement of incoming traffic. For the delivery boost, the UE <b>702</b> can indicate to the network that a temporary boost, i.e. a temporary increase in throughput would be needed in order to avoid risk of media playback stalling. When a downlink media streaming service is delivered to many users based on architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, every UE <b>702</b> receiving the stream can be performing both the actions of estimating throughput based on measurements of incoming traffic and estimating throughput to avoid risk of media playback calling.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">As media service traffic is delivered to different UEs <b>702</b> at different bit rates and throughput as network conditions are different for different users (e.g., a set of UEs <b>702</b> behind a gNB <b>704</b> could be suffering additional network latencies because of which the throughput could be suffering), it is feasible that a distributed learning mechanism can help the UEs <b>702</b> adopt to changing network conditions. To provide this feature, scaling of edge resources might be needed to balance out the effect for improper network conditions.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">If Thpt=f (R<sub>p</sub>), i.e. if downlink stream throughput is a function of edge service resource profile Rp, then the throughput can be based at different times because of network conditions. When all of the UEs <b>702</b> of the service are receiving traffic from edge-based servers at T<sub>0</sub>, the resource profile is Thpt=f (R<sub>p0</sub>), i.e. resource profile of edge resources at time T<sub>0</sub>. When one or fewer UEs <b>702</b> start seeing throughput degradation at T<sub>1</sub>, the resource profile is Thpt=f (R<sub>p1</sub>), i.e. resource profile of edge resources at time T<sub>1</sub>. When resources in the edge network <b>406</b> are enhanced to support adequate throughput to user at T<sub>0</sub>, the resource profile is Thpt=f (R<sub>p2</sub>), i.e. resource profile of edge resources at time T<sub>2 </sub>when resources are scaled to support required throughput to UEs <b>702</b>.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Given the above resource-profiles at different times for producing the respective throughput at the UEs <b>702</b>, then the change in resource profile &#x394;R=R<sub>p2</sub>&#x2212;R<sub>p1</sub>, should be observed. A change in resource profile should be observed given throughput estimation assistance information from the UE at one of the edge locations at times T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>1 </sub>respectively. The edge resources can be scaled up for an updated throughput request from the UE <b>702</b>. In this case, &#x394; R is positive giving increase in demand for throughput. In the same way, when the network conditions get better, the edge network <b>406</b> may need not have as much resource-profile, so the resources allocated to the edge service can be scaled down. In this case, the resources are scaled down with &#x394; R being negative.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">If the information above is collected for different edge locations, then it can be learned using inference techniques such as Logistic Regression, the expected throughput for any resource profile at any given location. Once this information is predicted, then the edge network resources for an expected network condition can be pre-scaled even before the network condition occurs, thereby scaling edge network resources automatically.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In addition, if network conditions are observed at edge location E<sub>i</sub>, because of which there is a drop off in Per-UE throughput, then other closer locations (e.g., geographically closer, service wise close&#x2014;i.e. could be geographically far but have strong service SLA relationships) can use &#x394;R at edge location E<sub>j </sub>to adjust the resource profile at their own locations. For edge location E<sub>j </sub>closer to location E<sub>i </sub>for I&#x2260;j and if &#x394; R is change in resource profile at location E<sub>i </sub>at time T<sub>N</sub>, then &#x394;R at E<sub>j</sub>=f (&#x394;R at E<sub>j</sub>). The scale up/down of resources at location E<sub>j </sub>is a function of scale up/down of resources at location E<sub>i</sub>. The function f( ) could be a linear function, a match function, a logarithmic function, an exponential function, etc. The linear function can indicate a linear increase or decrease in edge resources at E<sub>i </sub>based on a linear increase or decrease of resources at location E<sub>i</sub>. The increase or decrease is based on a number of UEs <b>702</b> behind the edge location or number of sessions that are being serviced through the edge location. For example, if there is a 5% scale up in Edge location E<sub>i </sub>that is serving &#x201c;N&#x201d; number of sessions, then for an Edge location E<sub>j </sub>servicing &#x201c;2N&#x201d; number of sessions, scale up by 10% (i.e. 2&#xd7;5%). Similarly, if there is a 5% scale up in Edge location E<sub>i </sub>that is serving &#x201c;N&#x201d; number of users, then for an Edge location E<sub>j </sub>servicing &#x201c;2N&#x201d; number of users, scale up by 10% (i.e. 2&#xd7;5%). A linear increase helps in scaling up enough resources at location Ej so it can be prepared for similar conditions that may arise.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">The match function can indicate a match of a number of resources in E<sub>j </sub>compared to that in location E<sub>i </sub>irrespective of number of UEs <b>702</b> or sessions the edge locations are processing. The logarithmic function can indicate a logarithmic increase or decrease in edge resources at E<sub>j </sub>based on increase or decrease of resources at location E<sub>i</sub>. The increase or decrease is based on number of UEs <b>702</b> behind an edge location or number of sessions that are being serviced through the edge location. The logarithmic increase helps in slowly scaling up resources at location E<sub>j </sub>so it can be little better prepared for similar conditions that may arise. The exponential function can indicate an exponential increase or decrease in edge resources at E<sub>j </sub>based on increase or decrease of resources at location E<sub>i</sub>. The increase or decrease is based on number of UEs <b>702</b> behind the edge location or number of sessions that are being serviced through the edge location. Exponential increase helps in quickly scaling up resources at location E<sub>j </sub>so it can be at most prepared for similar conditions that may arise.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">The type of function to use for resource scaling at other locations can be provisioned by the application service provider. The scale up or down of resources at edge locations can be performed by a central AF managing the media service, an AF deployed at an edge location, etc. The central AF can inform the edge application orchestration manager to scale up or down the resources allocated to the media service. The orchestration manager could be a separate AF <b>722</b> provisioned for managing edge media application service resources or a hardware orchestration entity. The AF <b>722</b> in each edge location can receive the scale-up or down information from AFs <b>722</b> deployed in other edge locations to do their own local scaling of resources for the media service.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In order to provide efficient sharing of resource profile information and offered throughput for a media service, a central database can be constituted that all edge locations can access. Resource profile information for each edge service can be persisted in this database along with how much throughput the media service is able to guarantee to the end users. This database can be queried by all edge locations to update their resource profile parameters instead of receiving this information from other edge locations.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">A procedure has been described where in edge service resource parameters are optimized using application throughput information from the end user or the network inferred client throughput. In an alternative embodiment, edge service resources can be optimally allocated by measuring different SLA parameters for the media service instead of just relying alone on throughput. Parameters that can be measured and inferred to assist with edge service resource allocation can include a number of SLA parameters described in TS 28.552, TS 28.554, Application parameters listed in TS 28.531, and slice level parameters. The core slice subnet and RAN slice subnet parameters can be provisioned, measured, and predicted similar to application throughput (as described in main embodiment).</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Some of the parameters mentioned above can be measured in the network, and the remaining are measured in the client. The parameters measured in the client can be informed to the network (e.g., the AF managing the media service) using the M5 interface. Interface enhancements are added to the M5 interface can include an application reporting type field and a report field. The application reporting type field can indicate a type of report, e.g. an application report, a network statistics report, etc. The report field can indicate an actual report with measurement data. The report could include one or more than one parameter that are being reported. Each parameter can include a param-name value for a name of an application parameter being reported, a param-value value that is a value of an application parameter, a measurement time that is a time the parameter was measured, and a measurement-renewal-interval that is an interval after which the parameter will be measured again.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Optionally, mechanisms listed in TS 28.531 can be used by the UE <b>702</b> to report application parameter measurements. Alternative, other analytics function such as 3GPP NWDAF can be used to retrieve measurements and predictions.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Parameter information measured in the network or collected from the UE <b>702</b> can be persisted in the central database. This information can then be used to predict the edge service resource profile information that can be relayed to all edge service locations which can then scale up or down the resources allocated to each media service. The type of parameters for measurement and prediction can be configured by the application service provider.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">A procedure where in optimum resource parameters in an edge location for an application service are learned using AI and machine learning algorithms for one parameter&#x2014;throughput has been previously described. This method can be extended for a number of parameters described earlier in the disclosure. A parameter collection can be constructed for different parameters. The parameter collection can include a parameter name field, a change in resource allocation per N UE per session field, a confidence field, etc. The parameter name field can indicate a name of a parameter that is measured and predicted for optimum resource allocation information. The change in resource allocation per N UE per session field can indicate information about a change in resource profile information because of the parameter &#x201c;N&#x201d; of UEs <b>702</b> or &#x201c;N&#x201d; number of media sessions. This method is similar to the disclosure related to the &#x201c;throughput&#x201d; parameter. The confidence field indicates the confidence information about the prediction.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The above parameter collection can be built at each of the edge location and shared with other edge locations. Alternatively, this information can be persisted in a shared central database so it can be read by all the edge locations.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">The 5G application service provider, when provisions the service at the 5G AF (e.g., using the M1 interface), can specify aspects related to shared network edge for that service.

A value for the edge-service priority field can range between 0-100 with a lower value indicating a higher priority. The edge-service-priority-evaluation-method field can include information that indicates how to resolves resource allocation issues if there are edge services with similar priorities. Possible value can include a lower resource requirement where services with lower resource requirements are given priority before services with higher resource requirements and shorter-time-to-completion where services with shorter time to completion are given priority before services with higher time to completion. The service-completion time field can indicate an expected running time of a service. The resource-preemption field can be represented by a Boolean value indicating whether resource preemption is supported based on edge-service-priority. The Boolean value can be set to &#x201c;True&#x201d; when resource preemption is allowed for this service and set to &#x201c;False&#x201d; when resource preemption is not allowed for this service. If the value is set to True as part of service provisioning, then the resources allocated to this service can be preempted when another service with higher priority requests for edge resources. If the value is set to False as part of service provisioning, then the resources allocated to this service cannot be preempted when another service with higher priority requests for edge resources.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The parameter-measurement-interval field can indicate an interval at which parameters are measured, either by client reporting or network measurement taken. The range field can indicate an area around which the statistics/prediction from an edge-network is applicable. Beyond a certain area, the inference information may not mean much in terms of using that prediction information. The scale-function field can indicate a scaling function to use to scale resources in an edge network <b>406</b> based on information received from other edge network. The scale-function-override field can be represented by a Boolean variable indicating if the scaling function can be overridden by the scale function enforcing entity. The Boolean variable can be set to &#x201c;True&#x201d; for overriding the scaling function and &#x201c;False&#x201d; for when the scaling function cannot be overridden. If the scaling function is set to True, the enforcing entity can override the scaling function configured by the application service provider. If the scaling function is set to False, the enforcing entity cannot override the scaling function configured by the application service provider. In this case, the scaling function has to followed regardless of what the inference information depicts the situation to be.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The enforcing entity field can indicate an entity that uses the information from another edge network <b>406</b> to update resource profile of current edge network <b>406</b>. The require-central-db field can be represented by a Boolean variable indicating whether a central db can be used for persisting statistics and prediction information. The Boolean variable can be set to &#x201c;True&#x201d; when the central database is to be used to persist statistics or inference information and set to &#x201c;False&#x201d; when the central database cannot be used to persist statistics or inference information. If the value of this variable is set to True, then this indicates that the application service provider intends that the network operator provision a central database where information from all the edge networks <b>406</b> can be persisted. The network operator shall provision a central database and inform the application service provider the endpoint details of the provisioned central database. The no-of-UEs-for-inference-validity field can indicate information about number of UEs to be available before inference from the edge network <b>406</b> to be valid. The no-of-session-for-inference-validity field can indicate information about number of UE sessions to be available before inference from the edge network <b>406</b> to be valid. The parameter-priority-map field can be represented by a map of parameters with a key, value pair. The key represents the parameter to be measured/predicted, and the value field represents the priority of the parameter to be used while using the inference information about that parameter.
