For example, when a holographic display is implemented by using an amplitude-type SLM, a single-sideband encoded hologram image may be displayed on the SLM, and then, a 4f system may be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and a complex hologram should be obtained by filtering only a meaningful signal area through a spatial filter in an angular spectrum domain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More specifically, a lens <b>0</b> and a lens <b>1</b> are to expand a laser beam, and &#x192; has a relatively larger value than &#x192;<b>0</b>. The collimated laser beam expanded as described above passes through the amplitude-type SLM, and the complex hologram may be obtained through the 4f-system formed of a lens <b>2</b> and a lens <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this case, an image size of the SLM may be magnified according to a ratio between focal distances of the lens <b>2</b> and the lens <b>3</b>, and in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lens <b>2</b> has a focal distance f and the lens <b>3</b> has a focal distance <b>2</b>&#x192;, such that the 4f system has a magnification of two times.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the angular spectrum domain of the SLM image is formed the focal distance &#x192; away from the lens <b>2</b>, the spatial filter may be positioned in this position to allow only a desired signal to pass therethrough.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thereafter, the beam passing through the lens <b>3</b> focuses the image of the SLM on a place that is the focal distance <b>2</b>&#x192; away from the lens <b>3</b>, and in this case, an intended complex field from which DC and a conjugate signal are removed is formed on this plane.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A lens <b>4</b> having a focal distance F is positioned on this plane, such that a viewing window is formed at the focal distance of the lens <b>4</b>, and observer's pupil is positioned on this position, such that the observer can view a hologram image of a viewing window method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The holographic display of the viewing window method configured as described above may show a complete 3D image, and may provide an augmented reality (AR) image with high reality when it is applied to an AR display.
