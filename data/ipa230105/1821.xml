Some electrified powertrains include an engine (e.g., internal combustion engine), motor/generator(s) and energy storage systems (e.g., battery(s)). Some electrified powertrains include motor/generator(s) and energy storage systems (e.g., battery(s)). When the battery(s) is(are) sufficiently charged, the electrified powertrain can operate without using the engine. Some electrified powertrains are powered only by electricity, such as battery(s). The batteries are rechargeable via variable means.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrified powertrains often include a high-voltage rechargeable energy storage system (REESS) (e.g., fuel cell(s), battery(s), battery bank, etc.) and a low-voltage rechargeable. The high voltage REESS is normally for propulsion and recuperation, the low voltage REESS is used for power supply of low voltage accessories, such as starting system, lighting system, etc. Electrified powertrains are capable of recuperating energy into the high-voltage REESS. The capacity of low voltage REESS is normally large and the low-voltage REESS is lower in cost with equivalent energy storage capacity of high-voltage REESS, while low-voltage REESS has low charging/discharging rate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the state of charge (SOC) of high-voltage REESS is high before recuperation and the charging capacity of the high-voltage REESS is limited, the energy recuperation cannot be all used in recharging the high-voltage REESS, such that the optimum fuel economy cannot be achieved. In some embodiments, a bidirectional converter is used to charge and discharge either high-storage REESS and low-voltage REESS. In certain embodiments, a predictive energy management system is configured to predict the timing and amount of upcoming energy recuperation and manage the energy flow between the high-voltage REESS and low-voltage REES to provide adequate energy capacity for vehicle operation and charging capacity for energy recuperation. For example, before energy recuperation occurs, the predictive energy management system is configured to reduce the charge level of the high-voltage REESS by transferring energy from the high-voltage REESS to the low voltage REESS.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As recited in examples, Example 1 is a system of predictive energy management for an electrified powertrain, the electrified powertrain comprising a high-voltage rechargeable energy storage system (REESS) and a low-voltage REESS.
