description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The long evolution of healthcare has reached a point in time where the promise of biomarker analysis is beginning to be realized. When physicians can stratify patients, even those who share many similar physiological traits and exhibit common symptoms of a given disease, into more specific groups, they can better tailor treatment and optimize the outcome for each patient. However, it is challenging to develop molecular diagnostics, and few are commercially available.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention features, inter alia, diagnostic methods for identifying cancer patients for treatment with a CDK7 inhibitor described herein (i.e., diagnostic methods for selecting a patient for treatment) and methods for treating identified patients with such an inhibitor, either alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents (e.g., a second anti-cancer agent), as described further below. The diagnostic methods include a step of identifying a patient suffering from a cancer that is likely to respond well to treatment with a CDK7 inhibitor disclosed herein, as shown and described further below. The treatment methods include a step of administering such a CDK7 inhibitor to an identified patient, whose response can be, for example, significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI; e.g., more than about 80-90% TGI and/or continued tumor suppression even after cessation of treatment).

One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that an RNA sequence can be reverse transcribed to generate a complimentary DNA (cDNA), and any of the methods and uses described herein can be carried out with cDNA that has been generated from an RNA described herein (i.e., a patient's biomarker status may have been determined using cDNA rather than an RNA). The state of a biomarker can be assessed in terms of any one or more of the features just listed regardless of the exact biomarker in use or the precise method or context in which the biomarker is being assessed. The state of a given biomarker (e.g., its copy number, associated enhancer, expression level, or activity) may be equal to or above a pre-determined threshold level or cutoff or equal to or below a pre-determined threshold level or cutoff, as described further below. In the methods of the present invention, one can analyze a biomarker selected from the genes BRAF, c-myc (also known as MYC), CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, and certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table below), or the proteins encoded thereby, by determining, having determined, and/or receiving information that the state of such a biomarker is equal to or above (e.g., above) a pre-determined threshold level (for RB1-E2F family members, see the Table below and the accompanying teaching). Alternatively, or in addition, one can analyze a biomarker selected from the genes BCL2-like 1, CDK7, CDK9, CDKN2A, and RB (also known as RB1 or another E2F pathway member), and/or the proteins encoded thereby, by determining, having determined, and/or receiving information that the state of such biomarker is equal to or below (e.g., below) a pre-determined threshold level (for RB/E2F family members, see the Table below). The choice of which biomarker(s) to utilize may depend, in part, on the particular cancer afflicting the patient, as well as other factors described herein. CDK18 encodes CDK18, and CDK19 encodes CDK19 (a component of the Mediator co-activator complex); CCNE1 encodes cyclin E1 (see Koff et al., Cell 66:1217-1228, 1991); FGFR1 encodes FGFR1, a cell surface membrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity; RB encodes pRB, which binds to the activator domain of activator E2F; BCL2-like 1 encodes BCL-xL, a transmembrane protein in mitochondria; CDK7 encodes CDK7; CDK9 encodes CDK9; and CDKN2A encodes p16 and p14arf.

Moreover, the definitions apply to linguistic and grammatical variants of the defined terms (e.g., the singular and plural forms of a term), and some linguistic variants are particularly mentioned below (e.g., &#x201c;administration&#x201d; and &#x201c;administering&#x201d;). The chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75<sup>th </sup>Ed. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry are well established and one of ordinary skill in the art can consult, if desired, <i>Organic Chemistry </i>by Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito, 1999; Smith and March, <i>March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, </i>5<sup>th </sup>Edition, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York, 2001; Larock, <i>Comprehensive Organic Transformations, </i>VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, 1989; and Carruthers, <i>Some Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>Edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0095">The term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; when used in reference to a value, signifies any value or range of values that is plus-or-minus 10% of the stated value (e.g., within plus-or-minus 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% of the stated value). For example, a dose of about 10 mg means any dose as low as 10% less than 10 mg (9 mg), any dose as high as 10% more than 10 mg (11 mg), and any dose or dosage range therebetween (e.g., 9-11 mg; 9.1-10.9 mg; 9.2-10.8 mg; and so on). As another example, a prevalence rank in a population of about 80% means a prevalence rank of 72-88% (e.g., 79.2-80.8%). In case of doubt, &#x201c;about X&#x201d; can be &#x201c;X&#x201d; (e.g., about 80% can be 80%). Where a stated value cannot be exceeded (e.g., 100%), &#x201c;about&#x201d; signifies any value or range of values that is up to and including 10% less than the stated value (e.g., a purity of about 100% means 90%-100% pure (e.g., 95%-100% pure, 96%-100% pure, 97%-100% pure etc. . . . )). In the event an instrument or technique measuring a value has a margin of error greater than 10%, a given value will be about the same as a stated value when they are both within the margin of error for that instrument or technique.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0096">The term &#x201c;administration&#x201d; and variants thereof, such as &#x201c;administering,&#x201d; refer to the administration of a CDK7 inhibitor described herein, including a compound conforming to a Formula disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an additional/second agent, or a composition containing one or more of any such compounds to a subject (e.g., a human patient) or system (e.g., a cell- or tissue-based system that is maintained ex vivo); as a result of the administration, the compound or composition containing the compound (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) is introduced to the subject or system. In addition to compositions of the invention and second agents useful in combination therapies, items used as positive controls, negative controls, and placebos, any of which can also be a compound, can also be &#x201c;administered.&#x201d; One of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of a variety of routes that can, in appropriate circumstances, be utilized for administration to a subject or system. For example, the route of administration can be oral (i.e., by swallowing a pharmaceutical composition) or may be parenteral. More specifically, the route of administration can be bronchial (e.g., by bronchial instillation), by mouth (i.e., oral), dermal (which may be or comprise topical application to the dermis or intradermal, interdermal, or transdermal administration), intragastric or enteral (i.e., directly to the stomach or intestine, respectively), intramedullary, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intratumoral, intravenous (or intra-arterial), intraventricular, by application to or injection into a specific organ (e.g., intrahepatic), mucosal (e.g., buccal, rectal, sublingual, or vaginal), subcutaneous, tracheal (e.g., by intratracheal instillation), or ocular (e.g., topical, subconjunctival, or intravitreal). Administration can involve intermittent dosing (i.e., doses separated by various times) and/or periodic dosing (i.e., doses separated by a common period of time (e.g., every so many hours, daily (e.g., once daily oral dosing), weekly, twice per week, etc.)). In other embodiments, administration may involve continuous dosing (e.g., perfusion) for a selected time (e.g., about 1-2 hours).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0097">Two events, two entities, or an event and an entity are &#x201c;associated&#x201d; with one another if one or more features of the first (e.g., its presence, level and/or form) are correlated with a feature of the second. For example, a first entity (e.g., an enzyme (e.g., CDK7)), gene expression profile, genetic signature (i.e., a single or combined group of genes in a cell with a uniquely characteristic pattern of gene expression), metabolite, or event (e.g., myeloid infiltration)) is associated with an event (e.g., the onset or progression of a particular disease), if its presence, level and/or form correlates with the incidence of, severity of, and/or susceptibility to the disease (e.g., a cancer disclosed herein). The biomarkers described herein are associated with an identified patient in the manner described herein (e.g., by virtue of their level of expression). Associations are typically assessed across a relevant population. Two or more entities are physically &#x201c;associated&#x201d; with one another if they interact, directly or indirectly, so that they are and/or remain in physical proximity with one another in a given circumstance (e.g., within a cell maintained under physiological conditions (e.g., within cell culture) or within a pharmaceutical composition). Entities that are physically associated with one another can be covalently linked to one another or non-covalently associated by, for example, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, magnetism, or combinations thereof. A CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be non-covalently associated with CDK7.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0098">The term &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d; refers to a sample obtained or derived from a biological source of interest (e.g., a tissue or organism (e.g., an animal or human patient) or cell culture). For example, a biological sample can be a sample obtained from an individual (e.g., a patient or an animal model) suffering from a disease (or, in the case of an animal model, a simulation of that disease in a human patient) to be diagnosed and/or treated by the methods of this invention or from an individual serving in the capacity of a reference or control (or whose sample contributes to a reference standard or control population). The biological sample can contain a biological cell, tissue or fluid or any combination thereof. For example, a biological sample can be or can include ascites; blood; blood cells; a bodily fluid, any of which may include or exclude cells (e.g., tumor cells (e.g., circulating tumor cells (CTCs) found in at least blood or lymph vessels)); bone marrow or a component thereof (e.g., hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, or stromal cells); cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); feces; flexural fluid; free-floating nucleic acids (e.g., circulating tumor DNA); gynecological fluids; immune infiltrates; lymph; peritoneal fluid; plasma; saliva; sputum; surgically-obtained specimens; tissue scraped or swabbed from the skin or a mucus membrane (e.g., in the nose, mouth, or vagina); tissue or fine needle biopsy samples; urine; washings or lavages such as a ductal lavage or broncheoalveolar lavage; or other body fluids, tissues, secretions, and/or excretions. Samples of, or samples obtained from, a bodily fluid (e.g., blood, CSF, lymph, plasma, or urine) may include tumor cells (e.g., CTCs) and/or free-floating or cell-free nucleic acids of the tumor. Cells (e.g., cancer cells) within the sample may have been obtained from an individual patient for whom a treatment is intended. Samples used in the form in which they were obtained may be referred to as &#x201c;primary&#x201d; samples, and samples that have been further manipulated (e.g., by removing one or more components of the sample) may be referred to as &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; or &#x201c;processed&#x201d; samples. Such processed samples may contain or be enriched for a particular cell type (e.g., a CDK7-expressing cell, which may be a tumor cell), cellular component (e.g., a membrane fraction), or cellular material (e.g., one or more cellular proteins, including CDK7, DNA, or RNA (e.g., mRNA (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA)), which may encode CDK7 and may be subjected to amplification). As used herein, the term &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; refers to an entity whose state correlates with a particular biological event so that it is considered to be a &#x201c;marker&#x201d; for that event (e.g., the presence of a particular cancer and/or its susceptibility to a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof). A biomarker can be analyzed at the nucleic acid or protein level; at the nucleic acid level, one can analyze the presence (e.g., copy number alterations (CNAs)), absence, or chromosomal location of a gene in wild type or mutant form, epigenetic alterations (in, e.g., methylation), its association with a super-enhancer, and/or its level of expression (as evidenced, for example, by primary RNA transcript or mRNA (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA) levels). At the protein level, one can analyze the level of expression and/or activity of a protein encoded by a biomarker gene. A biomarker may indicate a therapeutic outcome or likelihood (e.g., increased likelihood) thereof. Thus, a biomarker can be predictive or prognostic and is therefore useful in methods of identifying or treating a patient as described herein.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0099">The term &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; refers to a disease in which biological cells exhibit an aberrant growth phenotype characterized by loss of control of cell proliferation to an extent that will be detrimental to a patient having the disease. A cancer can be classified by the type of tissue in which it originated (histological type) and/or by the primary site in the body in which the cancer first developed. Based on histological type, cancers are generally grouped into six major categories: carcinomas; sarcomas; myelomas; leukemias; lymphomas; and mixed types. A cancer treated as described herein may be of any one of these types and may comprise cells that are precancerous (e.g., benign), malignant, pre-metastatic, metastatic, and/or non-metastatic. A patient who has a malignancy or malignant lesion has a cancer. The present disclosure specifically identifies certain cancers to which its teachings may be particularly relevant, and one or more of these cancers may be characterized by a solid tumor or by a hematologic tumor, which may also be known as a blood cancer (e.g., of a type described herein). Although not all cancers manifest as solid tumors, we may use the terms &#x201c;cancer cell&#x201d; and &#x201c;tumor cell&#x201d; interchangeably to refer to any malignant cell.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0100">The term &#x201c;combination therapy&#x201d; refers to those situations in which a subject is exposed to two or more therapeutic regimens (e.g., two or more therapeutic agents) to treat a single disease (e.g., a cancer). The two or more regimens/agents may be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When administered simultaneously, a dose of the first agent and a dose of the second agent are administered at about the same time, such that both agents exert an effect on the patient at the same time or, if the first agent is faster- or slower-acting than the second agent, during an overlapping period of time. When administered sequentially, the doses of the first and second agents are separated in time, such that they may or may not exert an effect on the patient at the same time. For example, the first and second agents may be given within the same hour or same day, in which case the first agent would likely still be active when the second is administered. Alternatively, a much longer period of time may elapse between administration of the first and second agents, such that the first agent is no longer active when the second is administered (e.g., all doses of a first regimen are administered prior to administration of any dose(s) of a second regimen by the same or a different route of administration, as may occur in treating a refractory cancer). For clarity, combination therapy does not require that two agents be administered together in a single composition or at the same time, although in some embodiments, two or more agents, including a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a second agent described herein may be administered within the same period of time (e.g., within the same hour, day, week, or month).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0101">The terms &#x201c;cutoff&#x201d; and &#x201c;cutoff value&#x201d; mean a value measured in an assay that defines the dividing line between two subsets of a population (e.g., likely responders and non-responders (e.g., responders and non-responders to a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof). In some instances, values that are equal to or above the cutoff value define one subset of the population, and values that are lower than the cutoff value define the other subset of the population. In other instances, values that are equal to or below the cutoff value define on subset of the population, and values above the cutoff value define the other. As described further below, the cutoff or cutoff value can define the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0102">As used herein, &#x201c;diagnostic information&#x201d; is information that is useful in determining whether a patient has a disease and/or in classifying (stratifying) the disease into a genotypic or phenotypic category or any category having significance with regard to the prognosis of the disease or its likely response to treatment (either treatment in general or any particular treatment described herein). Similarly, &#x201c;diagnosis&#x201d; refers to obtaining or providing any type of diagnostic information, including, but not limited to, whether a patient is likely to have or develop a disease; whether that disease has or is likely to reach a certain state or stage or to exhibit a particular characteristic (e.g., resistance to a therapeutic agent); information related to the nature or classification of a tumor; information related to prognosis (which may also concern resistance); and/or information useful in selecting an appropriate treatment (e.g., selecting a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for a patient identified as having a cancer that is likely to respond to such an inhibitor or other treatment). A patient classified (stratified) according to a method described herein and selected for treatment with a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is likely to respond well to the treatment, meaning that such a patient is more likely to be successfully treated than a patient with the same type of cancer who has not been so identified and is not in the same strata. Available treatments include therapeutic agents and other treatment modalities such as surgery, radiation, etc., and selecting an appropriate treatment encompasses the choice of withholding a particular therapeutic agent; the choice of a dosing regimen; and the choice of employing a combination therapy. Diagnostic information can be used to stratify patients and is thus useful in identifying and classifying a given patient according to, for example, biomarker status. Obtaining diagnostic information can constitute a step in any of the patient stratification methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0103">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term &#x201c;dosage form&#x201d; may be used to refer to a physically discrete unit of an active agent (e.g., a therapeutic or diagnostic agent) for administration to a patient. Typically, each such unit contains a predetermined quantity of active agent. In some embodiments, such quantity is a unit dosage amount (or a whole fraction thereof) appropriate for administration in accordance with a dosing regimen that has been determined to correlate with a desired or beneficial outcome when administered to a relevant population (i.e., with a therapeutic dosing regimen). Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that the total amount of a therapeutic composition or agent administered to a particular patient is determined by one or more attending physicians and may involve administration of multiple dosage forms.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0104">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term &#x201c;dosing regimen&#x201d; may be used to refer to a set of unit doses (typically more than one) that are administered individually to a patient, separated by equal or unequal periods of time. A given therapeutic agent typically has a recommended dosing regimen, which may involve one or more doses, each of which may contain the same unit dose amount or differing amounts. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen comprises a first dose in a first dose amount, followed by one or more additional doses in a second dose amount that is different from the first dose amount. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen is correlated with a desired or beneficial outcome when administered across a relevant population (i.e., the regimen is a therapeutic dosing regimen).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0105">As used herein, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of an agent (e.g., a chemical compound described herein), such as a compound of Formula (I) or other CDK7 inhibitor described herein, refers to an amount that produces or is expected to produce the desired effect for which it is administered. The effective amount will vary depending on factors such as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the compound administered, the condition being treated, the mode of administration, and characteristics of the patient, as discussed further below and recognized in the art. The term can be applied to therapeutic and prophylactic methods. For example, a therapeutically effective amount is one that reduces the incidence and/or severity of one or more signs or symptoms of the disease. For example, in treating a cancer, an effective amount may reduce the tumor burden, inhibit tumor growth, inhibit metastasis or prolong patient survival. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term does not in fact require successful treatment be achieved in any particular individual. Rather, a therapeutically effective amount is that amount that provides a particular desired pharmacological response in a significant number of patients when administered to patients in need of such treatment. In some embodiments, reference to a therapeutically effective amount may be a reference to an amount administered or an amount measured in one or more specific tissues (e.g., a tissue affected by the disease) or fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, serum, sweat, tears, urine, etc.). Effective amounts may be formulated and/or administered in a single dose or in a plurality of doses (e.g., as part of a dosing regimen).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0106">As used herein, an &#x201c;enhancer&#x201d; is a region of genomic DNA that helps regulate the expression of genes up to 1 Mbp or so away. An enhancer may overlap, but is often not composed of, gene coding regions. An enhancer is often bound by transcription factors and designated by specific histone marks.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0107">An &#x201c;mRNA&#x201d; is a single-stranded RNA product synthesized by transcription of DNA that includes one or more of the coding sequences of a gene. The mRNA may be in the form of a precursor (pre-mRNA) or may be further processed to a mature form of mRNA lacking introns.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0108">The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; refers to any organism that is or may be subjected to a diagnostic method described herein or to which a compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is or may be administered for, e.g., experimental, diagnostic, prophylactic, and/or therapeutic purposes. Typical patients include animals (e.g., mammals such as mice, rats, rabbits, non-human primates, and humans; domesticated animals, such as dogs and cats; and livestock or any other animal of agricultural or commercial value). A patient may be suffering from or susceptible to (i.e., have a higher than average risk of developing) a disease described herein and may display one or more signs or symptoms thereof.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0109">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable,&#x201d; when applied to a carrier used to formulate a composition disclosed herein (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition), means a carrier that is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to a patient (e.g., it is non-toxic in the amount required and/or administered (e.g., in a unit dosage form)).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0110">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable,&#x201d; when applied to a salt, refers to a salt form of a compound that is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans (e.g., patients) and lower animals (including, but not limited to, mice and rats used in laboratory studies) without unacceptable toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and that can be used in a manner commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Many pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art (see, e.g., Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19, 1977). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, or malonic acid or by using other methods known in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, MALATle, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N<sup>+</sup>(C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl)<sub>4 </sub>salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate, and aryl sulfonate.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0111">As used herein, the term &#x201c;population&#x201d; means some number of items (e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, or more) sufficient to reasonably reflect the distribution, in a larger group, of the value being measured in the population. Within the context of the present invention, the population can be a discrete group of humans, laboratory animals, or cells lines (for example) that are identified by at least one common characteristic for the purposes of data collection and analysis. For example, a &#x201c;population of samples&#x201d; refers to a plurality of samples that is large enough to reasonably reflect the distribution of a value (e.g., a value related to the state of a biomarker) in a larger group of samples. The items in the population may be biological samples, as described herein. For example, each sample in a population of samples may be cells of a cell line or a biological sample obtained from a patient or a xenograft (e.g., a tumor grown in a mouse by implanting a tumorigenic cell line or a patient sample into the mouse). As noted, individuals within a population can be a discrete group identified by a common characteristic, which can be the same disease (e.g., the same type of cancer), whether the sample is obtained from living beings suffering from the same type of cancer or a cell line or xenograft representing that cancer.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0112">The term &#x201c;prevalence cutoff,&#x201d; as used herein in reference to a specified value (e.g., the strength of a SE associated a biomarker disclosed herein) means the prevalence rank that defines the dividing line between two subsets of a population (e.g., a subset of &#x201c;responders&#x201d; and a subset of &#x201c;non-responders,&#x201d; which, as the names imply include patients who are likely or unlikely, respectively, to experience a beneficial response to a therapeutic agent or agents). Thus, a prevalence rank that is equal to or higher (e.g., a lower percentage value) than the prevalence cutoff defines one subset of the population; and a prevalence rank that is lower (e.g., a higher percentage value) than the prevalence cutoff defines the other subset of the population.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0113">As used herein, the term &#x201c;prevalence rank&#x201d; for a specified value (e.g., the mRNA level of a specific biomarker) means the percentage of a population that are equal to or greater than that specific value. For example, a 35% prevalence rank for the amount of mRNA (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA) of a specific biomarker in a test cell means that 35% of the population have that level of biomarker mRNA or greater than the test cell.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0114">A &#x201c;primary RNA transcript&#x201d; is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) product synthesized by transcription of DNA and processed to yield various mature RNA products such as mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs. The primary RNA transcripts designated as mRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences that include one or more gene coding regions (exons) and may include sequence transcribed from a regulatory region (e.g., an enhancer or super-enhancer) associated with the gene. These primary RNA transcripts are modified in preparation for translation. A precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is the first form of RNA created through transcription, and it is modified to become the mature mRNA that lacks introns.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0115">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;prognostic information&#x201d; and &#x201c;predictive information&#x201d; are used to refer to any diagnostic information that may be used to indicate any aspect of the course of a disease or condition either in the absence or presence of treatment. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the average life expectancy of a patient, the likelihood that a patient will survive for a given amount of time (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.), the likelihood that a patient will be cured of a disease, the likelihood that a patient's disease will respond to a particular therapy (wherein response may be defined in any of a variety of ways). Diagnostic information can be prognostic or predictive.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0116">As used herein, the term &#x201c;rank ordering&#x201d; means the ordering of values from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0117">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;RB-E2F pathway&#x201d; and &#x201c;RB-E2F family&#x201d; refer to a set of genes and the proteins encoded thereby, as the context will make clear, whose expression or activity regulates the activity of the RB gene family and in turn regulates the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors that are required for entry into and progression through the cell cycle. The table below contains a list of genes in the RB-E2F family, an indication of a currently understood function of the encoded proteins, and the status of these biomarkers in cancer. We use the shorthand &#x201c;activated or overexpressed&#x201d; to indicate that an attribute of a gene (e.g., its copy number or level of expression) or the protein it encodes (e.g., its level of expression or activity) is higher in some patients with certain cancers than it is in healthy subjects. A pre-determined threshold for such activated or overexpressed RB-E2F family members can be determined by comparative analysis and is a level (e.g., mRNA level (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA), protein level, gene copy number, strength of enhancer associated with the gene) that, when found or exceeded in a cancer patient, identifies that patient as a candidate for treatment as described herein. We use the shorthand &#x201c;inactivated or underexpressed&#x201d; to indicate that an attribute of a gene (e.g., its copy number, or level of expression) or a protein it encodes (e.g., its level of expression or activity) is lower in some patients with certain cancers than it is in healthy subjects. A pre-determined threshold for such inactivated or underexpressed RB-E2F family members can be determined by comparative analysis and is a level (e.g., mRNA level, protein level, gene copy number, strength of enhancer associated with the gene) that, when unattained in a cancer patient, identifies that patient as a candidate for treatment as described herein.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="154pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Gene</entry><entry>Function</entry><entry>Status in Cancer</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>E2F1</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F2</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F3</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F4</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F5</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F6</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F7</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>E2F8</entry><entry>E2F family-transcriptional control of cell cycle entry</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>RB1</entry><entry>RB family-E2F family inhibition</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>RBL1</entry><entry>RB family-E2F family inhibition</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>RBL2</entry><entry>RB family-E2F family inhibition</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDK4</entry><entry>RB family inhibition</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDK6</entry><entry>RB family inhibition</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDK2</entry><entry>RB family inhibition</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CCND1</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CCND2</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CCND3</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN2A</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN2B</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN2C</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN2D</entry><entry>CDK4/6 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CCNE1</entry><entry>CDK2 regulation</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CCNE2</entry><entry>CDK2 regulation</entry><entry>Activated or overexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN1A</entry><entry>CDK2 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN1B</entry><entry>CDK2 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>CDKN1C</entry><entry>CDK2 regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry>FBXW7</entry><entry>CCNE regulation</entry><entry>Inactivated or underexpressed</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0172" num="0118">As used herein, a &#x201c;reference&#x201d; refers to a standard or control relative to which a comparison is performed. For example, an agent, patient, population, sample, sequence, or value of interest is compared with a reference agent, patient, population, sample, sequence or value. The reference can be analyzed or determined substantially simultaneously with the analysis or determination of the item of interest or it may constitute a historical standard or control, determined at an earlier point in time and optionally embodied in a tangible medium. One of ordinary skill in the art is well trained in selecting appropriate references, which are typically determined or characterized under conditions that are comparable to those encountered by the item of interest. One will appreciate when sufficient similarities are present to justify reliance on and/or comparison to a particular possible reference as a standard or control.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0119">As used herein, a &#x201c;response&#x201d; to treatment is any beneficial alteration in a patient's condition that results from, or that correlates with, treatment. The alteration may be stabilization of the condition (e.g., inhibition of deterioration that would have taken place in the absence of the treatment), amelioration of, delay of onset of, and/or reduction in frequency of one or more signs or symptoms of the condition, improvement in the prospects for cure of the condition, greater survival time, and etc. A response may be a patient's response or a tumor's response.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0120">As used herein, when the term &#x201c;strength&#x201d; is used to refer to a portion of an enhancer or a SE, it means the area under the curve of the number of H3K27Ac or other genomic marker reads plotted against the length of the genomic DNA segment analyzed. Thus, &#x201c;strength&#x201d; is an integration of the signal resulting from measuring the mark at a given base pair over the span of the base pairs defining the region being chosen to measure.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0121">As used herein, the term &#x201c;super-enhancer&#x201d; (SE) refers to a subset of enhancers that contain a disproportionate share of histone marks and/or transcriptional proteins relative to other enhancers in a particular cell or cell type. Genes regulated by SEs are predicted to be of high importance to the function of a cell. SEs are typically determined by rank ordering all of the enhancers in a cell based on strength and determining, using available software such as ROSE (bitbucket.org/young_computation/rose), the subset of enhancers that have significantly higher strength than the median enhancer in the cell (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; &#x201c;treat,&#x201d; and &#x201c;treating&#x201d; require that signs or symptoms of the disease have developed or have been observed. In other embodiments, treatment may be administered in the absence of signs or symptoms of the disease or condition (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example, to delay or inhibit recurrence.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0124">As the invention relates to compositions and methods for diagnosing and treating patients who have cancer, the terms &#x201c;active agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;anti-cancer agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;pharmaceutical agent,&#x201d; and &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; are used interchangeably (unless the context clearly indicates otherwise) and the CDK7 inhibitors described herein and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art as active, anti-cancer, pharmaceutical, or therapeutic agents. As noted, the treatment methods and uses encompass combination therapies/uses in which a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered or used in combination with one or more additional agents (e.g., an additional anti-cancer therapeutic), as described herein. In keeping with convention, in any embodiment requiring two agents, we may refer to one as the &#x201c;first&#x201d; agent and to the other as the &#x201c;second&#x201d; agent to underscore that the first and second agents are distinct from one another.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0125">The invention also features kits that include a CDK7 inhibitor as described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and instructional materials that describe a suitable/identified patient, methods of identifying such a patient for treatment (e.g., by any one of the diagnostic stratification methods described herein), and/or instructions for administering the CDK7 inhibitor alone or in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent (e.g., an additional/second anti-cancer therapeutic).

Such a patient can be: treated with a platinum-based therapeutic agent (e.g., carboplatin or oxaliplatin) as a second agent; a patient whose cancer has developed resistance to a platinum-based therapeutic agent (e.g., carboplatin or oxaliplatin); or a patient undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor used alone or in combination with one or more of an aromatase inhibitor, a selective estrogen receptor modulator or a selective estrogen receptor degrader. The patient's cancer may have become resistant to the CDK4/6 inhibitor or at risk of becoming so. In the context of the uses described here (e.g., where the patient has been selected by virtue of having a level of BLC2-like 1 mRNA (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA) equal to or below the pre-determined threshold level), the cancer can be a breast cancer (e.g., a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an ovarian cancer, a lung cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer), or a blood cancer (e.g., acute myeloid leukemia (AML)), any of which may be newly diagnosed (treatment na&#xef;ve) or relapsed or refractory to a prior treatment.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0129">The patient can be one who has undergone, is presently undergoing, or who will undergo (e.g., has been prescribed) treatment with a Bcl-2 inhibitor, such as venetoclax.

The methods can further include a step of determining the level of BCL-xL mRNA present in a sample of cancer cells from the patient, and this is generally true for the methods of treatment described herein; regardless of the biomarker analyzed or the type of cancer in question, a method of treatment can either be carried out on an identified patient without an explicit step of analyzing the biomarker or with an explicit step in which the biomarker is analyzed (e.g., by obtaining a biological sample from a patient). The human patient may have been diagnosed as having a cancer sensitive to a CDK7 inhibitor responsive to the determination, and the state of the BCL-xL biomarker can be determined in any of the additional ways described herein. The pre-determined threshold is a cutoff value or a prevalence cutoff A patient who is determined to have a cancer sensitive to a CDK7 inhibitor can additionally be administered a Bcl-2 inhibitor (e.g., venetoclax (available as Venclexta&#xae;)), and a patient selected as described here (through an analysis of the state of BCL-XL) can be suffering from a breast cancer, an ovarian cancer, a lung cancer, or a hematological cancer.

The human patient may have been diagnosed as having a cancer sensitive to a CDK7 inhibitor responsive to the determination. A patient selected as described here (through an analysis of the state of MYC, CDK18, or FGFR1) can be suffering from a breast cancer (e.g., TNBC). A diagnosing step that identifies a patient can be based on the presence (or absence) or the strength of a MYC SE or a CDK18 SE.

A phase I dose-escalation study was designed to administer film-coated tablets containing 50 or 100 mg of S55746, in doses up to 1500 mg, to patients with CLL or a B cell NHL including FL, MCL, DLBCL, SLL, MZL, and MM (see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02920697). Venetoclax tablets have been approved for treating adult patients with CLL or SLL and, in combination with azacytidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine, for treating newly-diagnosed AML in patients who are at least 75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Dosing for CLL/SLL can follow the five-week ramp-up schedule and dosing for AML can follow the four-day ramp-up, both described in the product insert, together with other pertinent information (see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,546,399; 9,174,982; and 9,539,251, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties).

Identifying a SE can be achieved by obtaining a biological sample from a patient (e.g., from a biopsy or other source, as described herein). The important metrics for enhancer measurement occur in two dimensions: along the length of the DNA over which genomic markers (e.g., H3K27Ac) are contiguously detected and the compiled incidence of genomic marker at each base pair along that span of DNA, the compiled incidence constituting the magnitude. The measurement of the area under the curve (&#x201c;AUC&#x201d;) resulting from integration of length and magnitude analyses determines the strength of the enhancer. The strength of the BRAF, MYC, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, or certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table for those upregulated) SEs relative to an appropriate reference can be used to diagnose (stratify) a patient and thereby determine whether a patient is likely to respond well to a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, particularly in view of the instant specification, that if the length of DNA over which the genomic markers is detected is the same for each of BRAF, MYC, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, or certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table for those upregulated) and the reference/control, then the ratio of the magnitude of the BRAF, MYC, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, or certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table for those upregulated) SE relative to the control will be equivalent to the strength and may also be used to determine whether a patient will be responsive to a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The strength of the BRAF, MYC, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, or certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table for those upregulated) SE in a cell can be normalized before comparing it to other samples. Normalization is achieved by comparison to a region in the same cell known to comprise a ubiquitous SE or enhancer that is present at similar levels in all cells. One example of such a ubiquitous super-enhancer region is the MALAT1 super-enhancer locus (chr11:65263724-65266724) (genome build hg19).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0147">It has been determined through H3K27Ac ChIP-seq (ChIP-sequencing) methods that there is a SE locus associated with a SE locus associated with the CDK18 gene at chr1:205399084-205515396; a SE locus associated with the CDK19 gene at chr6:110803523-110896277; a SE locus associated with the CCNE1 gene at chr19:30418503-30441450; and a SE locus associated with the FGFR1 gene at chr8:38233326-38595483.

It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, ChIP-on-chip was the most common technique utilized to study these protein-DNA relations. Successful ChIP-seq is dependent on many factors including sonication strength and method, buffer compositions, antibody quality, and cell number (see, e.g., Furey, <i>Nature Reviews Genetics </i>13:840-852, 2012); Metzker, <i>Nature Reviews Genetics </i>11:31-46, 2010; and Park, <i>Nature Reviews Genetics </i>10:669-680, 2009). Genomic markers other than H3K27Ac that can be used to identify SEs using ChIP-seq include P300, CBP, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, components of the mediator complex (Loven et al., <i>Cell, </i>153(2):320-334, 2013), histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylated (H3K4me1), and other tissue-specific enhancer tied transcription factors (Smith and Shilatifard, <i>Nature Struct. Mol. Biol., </i>21(3):210-219, 2014; and Pott and Lieb, <i>Nature Genetics, </i>47(1):8-12, 2015). Quantification of enhancer strength and identification of SEs can be determined using SE scores (McKeown et al., <i>Cancer Discov. </i>7(10):1136-1153, 2017; DOI: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-0399).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0149">In some instances, H3K27Ac or other marker ChIP-seq data SE maps of the entire genome of a cell line or a patient sample already exist.

In some embodiments, one would simply determine whether the strength, or ordinal rank of the enhancer or super-enhancer in such maps at the chr1:205399084-205515396 (genome build hg19) locus was equal to or above the pre-determined threshold level.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0150">It should be understood that the specific chromosomal location of BRAF, MYC, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK17, CDK18, CDK19, CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1, ESR-1, FGFR1, PIC3CA, or certain genes encoding an E2F pathway member (see the Table herein) and MALAT1 may differ for different genome builds and/or for different cell types.

In the case of ChIP-chip, the signal is typically detected by intensity fluorescence resulting from hybridization of a probe and input assay sample as with other array-based technologies.

Most cancer patients eventually develop resistance to platinum-based therapies by one or more of the following mechanisms: (i) molecular alterations in cell membrane transport proteins decrease uptake of the platinum agent; (ii) molecular alterations in apoptotic signaling pathways that prevent a cell from inducing cell death; (iii) molecular alterations of certain genes (e.g. BRCA1/2, CHEK1, CHEK2, RAD51) that restore the ability of the cell to repair platinum agent-induced DNA damage. K. N. Yamamoto et al., PloS ONE 9(8):e105724, 2014. The term &#x201c;molecular alterations&#x201d; includes increased or decreased mRNA (e.g., pre-mRNA or mature mRNA) expression from the genes involved in these functions; increased or decreased expression of protein from such genes; and mutations in the mRNA/proteins expressed from those genes.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0170">Resistance is typically determined by disease progression (e.g., an increase in tumor size and/or numbers) during treatment or a decrease in the rate of shrinkage of a tumor. In some instances, a patient will be considered to have become resistant to a platinum-based agent when the patient's cancer responds or stabilizes while on treatment, but which progresses within 1-6 months following treatment with the agent. Resistance can occur after any number of treatments with platinum agents. In some instances, disease progression occurs during, or within 1 month of completing treatment. In this case, the patient is considered to have never demonstrated a response to the agent. This is also referred to a being &#x201c;refractory&#x201d; to the treatment. Resistance may also be determined by a treating physician when the platinum agent is no longer considered to be an effective treatment for the cancer.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0171">In some embodiments, the patient is or has been determined to be resistant to treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor administered as a monotherapy or in combination with a SOC agent.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0172">CDK4/6 inhibitors in cancer (e.g., a HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer as described herein) are known to block entry into S phase of the cell cycle by inducing G1 arrest. Resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in cancer (e.g., HR<sup>+</sup> metastatic breast cancer) has been shown to be mediated, in part, by molecular alterations that: 1) enhance CDK4/6 activity, such as amplifications of CDK6, CCND1, or FGFR1 (Formisano et al., SABCS 2017, Publication Number GS6-05; Cruz et al., SABCS 2017 Publication Number PD4-05), or 2) reactivate cell cycle entry downstream of CDK4/6, such as RB1 loss and CCNE1 amplification (Condorelli, Ann Oncol, PMID: 29236940, 2017; Herrera-Abreu, Cancer Research PMID: 27020857, 2016).</p><p id="p-0227" num="0173">Unlike platinum-based agents which are typically administered for a period of time followed by a period without treatment, CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, ribociclib or abemaciclib, are administered until disease progression is observed. In some instances, a patient will be considered to have become resistant to a CDK4/6 inhibitor when the patient's cancer initially responds or stabilizes while on treatment, but which ultimately begins to progress while still on treatment. In some instances, a patient will be deemed resistant or refractory to treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor if the cancer progresses during treatment without demonstrating any significant response or stabilization. Resistance may also be determined by a treating physician when the CDK4/6 inhibitor is no longer considered to be an effective treatment for the cancer.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0174">The methods of the present invention can employ pharmaceutical compositions that include a CDK7 inhibitor described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Representative compounds of the invention were tested at different concentrations (from 4 &#x3bc;M to 126.4 &#x3bc;M; 0.5 log serial dilutions) for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of A673 cells. Known CDK inhibitors dinaciclib or N-((1S,3R)-3-((5-chloro-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)cyclohexyl)-5-((E)-4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamido)picolinamide and triptolide were used as positive controls. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, +10% FBS+1 mM Sodium Pyruvate. The cells were cultured at 37&#xb0; C. in a humidified chamber in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Proliferation assays were conducted over a 72 hour time period. CyQUANT&#xae; (Life Technologies, Chicago, Ill. USA) was used to assess the anti-proliferative effects of the compounds following manufacturer's directions and utilizing the reagents supplied with the CyQUANT&#xae; kit. The results of the assay are shown below in Table 1 where &#x201c;A&#x201d; represents a calculated IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than 20 nM; &#x201c;B&#x201d; represents a calculated IC<sub>50 </sub>of between 20 nM and less than 200 nM; &#x201c;C&#x201d; represents a calculated IC<sub>50 </sub>of 200 nM and less than 5 &#x3bc;M; &#x201c;D&#x201d; represents a calculated IC<sub>50 </sub>of greater than 5 &#x3bc;M.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0198">HCC70 cells: HCC70 cells are a cell line derived from human triple negative breast cancer.
