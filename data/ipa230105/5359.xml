level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Property security is a concern for many homeowners and businesses. Those seeking to secure their property often use conventional security systems. These conventional security systems may be configured to detect potential burglaries, intrusions, and other criminal activity. When a conventional security system detects a potential security event, the conventional security system will transmit an alert/notification to a property owner or designated security response team, thus allowing the property owner or designated security response team to properly address the detected potential security event.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, this alert/notification may be inadvertently overlooked and left unaddressed if the property owner and/or the designated security response team are pre-occupied. Of course, such an oversight by the property owner or designated security response team may put a relevant party at a greater risk of harm-which are contrary to the goals of a security system. Accordingly, it is advantageous to have systems and methods that reduce the need of human involvement in addressing/mitigating detected security events/activities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present application described herein provide technical solutions that address, at least, the needs described above, as well as the deficiencies of the state of the art.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic representation of a system <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present application;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>200</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present application; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example schematic for automatically mitigating a potential security activity detected by a surveillance sensing device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(S)</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a method for intelligently evaluating and automatically mitigating detected security activities includes: implementing an on-premise security device that detects a potential security activity at a property of a subscriber based on sensing a dynamic object within a defined range of the on-premise security device; establishing a security channel between the on-premise security device and a remote machine learning-based security module operating in a cloud computing environment if the potential security activity satisfies escalation criteria; automatically transmitting, via the security channel, sensor data from the on-premise security device to the remote machine learning-based security module; computing, by the remote machine learning-based security module, a threat severity inference based on the sensor data, wherein the threat severity inference relates to a machine learning-based probability that the potential security activity poses a threat to the property of the subscriber or to an object/person associated with the property; deriving device control instructions based on the threat severity inference, wherein the device control instructions, when executed, informs a response of the on-premise security device to the potential security event; transmitting, via the security channel, the device control instructions to the on-premise security device; and mitigating the potential security activity by executing the device control instructions at the on-premise device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the potential security activity satisfies the escalation criteria if the on-premise security device determines that the potential security activity involves at least one human body.

In a non-limiting example, the enhanced AI security module may be configured or programmed for activation when one or more predetermined criteria (e.g., activate at night, etc.) may be satisfied. In such example, the surveillance sensing device may detect or identify a potential security event and evaluate contextual data (e.g., time of day) associated with the potential security event against AI instantiation criteria or the like (e.g., transmit at night).

In response to the abnormal condition detection/recognition machine learning model receiving the one or more frames of the surveillance data, the abnormal condition detection/recognition machine learning model may function to detect if those one or more frames include abnormal conditions, and if so, classify the one or more detected abnormal conditions into one or more atypical classes (e.g., fire, smoke, open door, shattered glass, etc.).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Estimating Threat Severity</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, after the enhanced AI surveillance module generates one or more threat-informative inferences for the received surveillance data, S<b>230</b> may function to compute a threat-severity score for the activity identified in the surveillance data and/or classify the activity identified in the surveillance data as &#x201c;malicious activity&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-malicious&#x201d; activity based on the one or more threat-informative inferences, as generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a first implementation, to estimate a severity of the activity identified in the surveillance data, S<b>230</b> may function to implement a severity-conscious machine learning ensemble specifically trained to compute a threat severity score and/or classify the intent of the activity identified in the surveillance data as malicious or non-malicious. In one or more embodiments, a composition of the severity-conscious machine learning ensemble may include a combination of distinct machine learning models producing the threat-informative inferences (e.g., weapon recognition model, identity recognition model, etc.). In some such embodiments, S<b>230</b> may function to route one or more of the above-described threat-informative inferences to the severity-conscious machine learning ensemble or threat-severity classification layer (e.g., a classification head) of the ensemble, which in turn, may cause the severity-conscious machine learning ensemble to produce a threat-severity inference or prediction that may be converted or normalized (e.g., statistical-based normalization of the raw inference onto a pre-defined scale or threat score range) into a threat-severity score based on the provided input.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, the threat-severity score produced by the severity-conscious machine learning model may be scaled between 0-100, wherein a threat-severity score of 0 indicates a 0% probability that activity identified in the surveillance data contains malicious activity and a threat-severity score of 100 indicates a 100% probability that activity identified in the surveillance data contains malicious activity.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additionally, or alternatively, in a second implementation, S<b>230</b> may function to estimate the severity of activity identified in the surveillance data via one or more heuristics/rules. For instance, in some such implementations, S<b>230</b> may function to automatically estimate that the activity identified in the surveillance data contains malicious activity if S<b>230</b> determines, via the one or more computed threat-informative inferences, that the surveillance data includes one or more weapons, includes one or more &#x201c;un-welcomed&#x201d; individuals, includes an acoustic threat (e.g., gunshot), includes an atypical condition/scenario (e.g., a fire), includes an unrecognized person, and/or includes a person listed on a public safety registry. That is, in this second implementation, S<b>230</b> may function to estimate a threat-severity of a subject activity based on one or more features extracted from the activity scene and/or threat-informative inferences satisfying threat-severity logic (e.g., logic-1: if Weapon detected then increase threat severity estimate, etc.), threat-severity thresholds (e.g., human body in a threatening manner detected beyond a maximum period, etc.), and/or threat-severity rules (e.g., weapon+unidentified person=increased threat severity, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">2.40 Device Engagement Control Instructions</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">S<b>240</b>, which includes generating device engagement control instructions, may function to generate device control instructions that, when executed by the security device, controls an engagement behavior of the security device with an entity involved in the potential security activity. In one or more embodiments, S<b>240</b> may function to generate device engagement control instructions based on detecting an entity (e.g., a person) within a surveillance scene of the security device. Additionally, or alternatively, S<b>240</b> may function to generate the device engagement control instructions contemporaneous with and/or based on the computation of the various security inferences and/or threat inferences of the enhanced AI module.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a first example, S<b>240</b> may function to generate device engagement control instructions based solely on the enhanced AI module using an objection detection machine learning algorithm that produces a security inference that indicates a probability of a presence of a person in the surveillance scene. In this first example, the security inference preferably informs a selection of one of a plurality of distinct automated security device engagement workflow or a generation of device engagement control instructions. In one or more embodiments, each of the plurality of distinct automated device engagement instructions may include a distinct sequence of instructions (actions) that, when executed by the security device, causes the security device to engage, interact, or respond to a target person within the surveillance scene in a distinct manner. In some embodiments, the generated device engagement control instructions may include a set of unique computer- or security device-executable instructions derived based on or informed by a confidence and/or probability value associated with the objection detection inference (i.e., the security inference). In such embodiments, S<b>240</b> may function to implement a plurality of distinct engagement thresholds (e.g., a set or defined confidence or probability value) having a corresponding distinct engagement level or scale that, if or when satisfied by a confidence or a probability of the security inference, may cause or trigger S<b>240</b> to automatically generate engagement instructions in a style or corresponding to the distinct engagement level or scale.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a second example, S<b>240</b> may function to generate device engagement control instructions based a security inference, such as an object detection inference, together with one or more threat inferences (e.g., weapon recognition, facial recognition, and/or the like). In this second example, S<b>240</b> may additionally use threat inferences or factors to inform a generation device engagement instructions and/or a selection of one or more distinct automated engagement workflows. Accordingly, inferences of threat probability may factor in to increase or decrease engagement level or scale.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Entity Engagement|Execution of Engagement Control Instructions</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, or alternatively, S<b>240</b> may function to transmit, via the bi-directional control channel, the device engagement control instructions, which may be executed by an on-premise software security agent or security device.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one or more embodiments, an execution of the engagement control instructions may function to control the security device to audibly prompt, using one or more output devices (e.g., one or more speakers), an intent-discovery question to an entity identified in the surveillance data and/or may function to collect a response to the intent-discovery question from the prompted entity. It shall be noted that, in some embodiments, one or more functions of S<b>240</b> may be performed based on determining that the estimated severity score computed in S<b>230</b> ambiguously indicates the maliciousness of the activity identified in the surveillance data (e.g., a severity score between 20 and 80). Conversely, it shall also be noted that, in some embodiments, one or more of the functions of S<b>240</b> may not be executed, by the system <b>100</b> or service, and that one or more functions of S<b>260</b> may be immediately executed, by the system <b>100</b>, based on determining that the estimated severity score computed in S<b>230</b> definitively indicates the maliciousness of activity identified in surveillance data (e.g., a severity score less than 20 or greater than 80).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, to prompt an intent-discovery question to an entity identified in the surveillance data, S<b>240</b> may function to utilize the bi-directional communication channel/session established between the surveillance sensing device and the enhanced AI surveillance module in S<b>220</b>. In some such embodiments, the enhanced AI surveillance module may function to generate engagement instructions that include a generic intent-discovery question, such as &#x201c;Hi, how can I help you?&#x201d; or generate an intent-discovery based on one or more of the previously computed threat-informative inferences, such as &#x201c;We have detected a gun in your left hand. Why is your gun unholstered?&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">After the enhanced AI surveillance module generates a relevant intent-discovery question, the intent-discovery question may be transmitted to the surveillance sensing device that detected the potential security activity via the established bi-direction communication channel/session.

In such embodiments, the enhanced AI surveillance module may implement one or more natural language processing and/or natural language understanding algorithms or machine learning models to decipher the communication of the entity to build or generate suitable response or engagement control instructions. It shall also be noted that, in some embodiments, the entity detected by the surveillance sensing device may not provide a response to the intent-discovery question, and thus, the microphone of the surveillance sensing may not always detect a response from the entity. If the microphone of the surveillance sensing device does not detect a response from the entity within a target amount of time from communicating the intent-discovery question to the entity, the surveillance sensing device may transmit a signal to the enhanced AI surveillance module indicating the lack of response from the entity.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, in some embodiments, based on the obtained response from the entity (or the lack of response from the entity), the enhanced AI surveillance module may function to generate one or more additional engage control instructions that may include intent-discovery questions and receive one or more response signals from the surveillance sensing device(s) until an intent of the entity can be unambiguously assessed by the enhanced AI surveillance module.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">2.50 Re-Computing a Threat Severity</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">S<b>250</b>, which includes re-computing a severity of the potential security activity, may function to re-compute the severity of the potential security activity based on the response(s) to the intent-discovery question(s) posed in S<b>240</b>. That is, in some embodiments, S<b>250</b> may function to re-estimate the severity of the potential security activity based on the conversational dialogue between the enhanced AI surveillance module and the one or more entities in S<b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">It shall be recognized that the AI-based surveillance and security threat mitigation may be an iterative process in which the one or more steps of the method <b>200</b> may be continually performed to autonomously and accurately predict at least a threat severity based on real-time and/or new data surrounding and/or related to circumstances of a potential security activity. Accordingly, a re-computation of the severity of the potential security activity may be performed in real-time as new streams of data are identified and transmitted, via the bi-directional control communication channel thereby enabling the enhanced AI surveillance module to assess a security risk of the potential security activity and generate updated or new device control instructions for mitigating and/or handling a real-time threat.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, to re-compute the severity of the potential security activity, the enhanced AI surveillance module described in S<b>220</b> may function to implement a machine learning-based conversational domain classifier. In some such embodiments, S<b>250</b> may function to provide the machine learning-based conversational domain classifier the one or more intent-discovery questions posed in S<b>240</b> and/or the one or more responses to the one or more intent-discovery questions also collected in S<b>240</b>. In turn, the machine learning-based conversational domain classifier may function to classify the overall conversation into one or more domains (e.g., solicitor domain, approved service-provider domain (e.g., gardener), unknown domain, or the like).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Based on the domain classification assigned to the conversation that occurred in S<b>240</b>, S<b>250</b> may function to assign a new severity score to the potential security activity detected by the surveillance sensing device(s). For instance, in a non-limiting example, if the machine learning-based conversational domain classifier determined that the conversation occurring between an entity and the enhanced AI surveillance module is related to a first domain, S<b>250</b> may function to update the original threat severity score assigned to the potential security activity in S<b>230</b> to a new threat severity score.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">It shall be recognized that a threat severity computation may be based on threat severity identification based on conversational inferences, S<b>250</b> may additionally or alternatively re-compute the threat severity based on any suitable pieces or points of surveillance data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">It shall also be noted that, in some embodiments, the new threat-severity score assigned to the potential security activity may be higher or lower based on the determined domain.

Alternatively, in another non-limiting example, if the machine learning-based conversational domain classifier determined that the conversation occurring in S<b>240</b> relates to a soliciting domain or an approved service provider domain, S<b>250</b> may function to decrease the threat-severity score of the potential security activity by a second amount or by a third amount, lesser than the second amount, respectively.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">2.60 Transmitting Security Response Instructions|Executing Threat Mitigation Actions</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0103">S<b>260</b>, which includes transmitting security response instructions, may function to transmit security response instructions to a target surveillance sensing device for appropriately remediating, mitigating, or handling the potential security activity. In a preferred embodiment, the security response instructions that are transmitted to the target surveillance sensing device may be based on an evaluation of the severity score (and/or the threat-informative inferences) computed for a potential security activity against one or more decisioning routes defined in one or more pre-configured automated security response workflows.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Automated Security Response Workflow Composition/Structure</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In such a preferred embodiment, the one or more pre-configured automated security response workflows may include one or more decisioning routes directed to handling/processing the detected potential security activity as confirmed malicious activity, one or more decisioning routes directed to handling/processing the detected potential security activity as confirmed non-malicious activity, and/or one or more decisioning routes directed to handling the potential security activity as suspected malicious activity (e.g., requiring further analysis/review by the subscriber or a subscriber appointed entity). It shall be noted that some of the one or more pre-configured automated security response workflows may include each type of route described above while other pre-configured automated security response workflows may only include a subset of the route described above.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one or more embodiments, the decisioning routes defined in a pre-configured automated security response workflow may correspond to a distinct route condition that governs when that associated route will be executed or triggered. Generally, the route conditions defined in an automated security response workflow may include any suitable security logic or triggering logic including one or more Boolean expressions that quantitatively evaluate the severity score computed for potential security activity in S<b>230</b> (or S<b>250</b>) and/or that quantitatively evaluate the threat-informative inferences computed in S<b>230</b> and/or threat features extracted from the corpus of surveillance data. For instance, in a non-limiting example, an exemplary automated security response workflow may include a plurality of decisioning routes corresponding to a plurality of route conditions. In such an example, a first route of the plurality of decisioning routes may correspond to a first route condition that may be satisfied if the threat severity score computed for the potential security activity is greater than a first pre-determined threshold and/or if one or more of the computed threat-informative inferences satisfy one or more other pre-determined thresholds. It shall be noted that the other routes of the automated security response workflow may be executed (or not executed), by the method <b>200</b>, for similar reasons described above. In another example, a second route of the plurality of decisioning routes may include a second route condition that includes (a) a threshold threat severity score and (b) a distinct threat feature (e.g., weapon detected) or security feature (e.g., person ID unknown) that may be logically combined, such that if satisfied triggers security response instructions or an automated security response workflow corresponding to the second route condition.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It shall also be noted that, in some embodiments, the route conditions defined in an automated security response workflow may be mutually exclusive from each other, such that the potential security activity may only be processed as confirmed malicious activity, confirmed non-malicious activity, or suspected malicious activity, but not a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Transmitting Security Response Instructions</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Accordingly, the security response instructions ultimately transmitted to a surveillance sensing device for addressing the potential security activity depends on which route condition(s) in the one or more automated security response workflows are satisfied.
