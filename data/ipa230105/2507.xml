id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an anti-FXII antibody for use in a method of treating or preventing hereditary angioedema (HAE) in a subject, wherein the antibody is administered subcutaneously to the subject.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Factor XII (Hageman Factor, FXII) is a serum glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 80 kDa. Besides an autoactivation by exposure to negatively charged surfaces, factor XII is additionally activated by kallikrein by proteolytic cleavage to form alpha-factor XIIa, which is then further converted, for example by trypsin, into beta-factor XIIa (FXIIa-&#x3b2;). Alpha-factor XIIa is composed of the N-terminal heavy chain of about 50 kDa, which contains the contact binding domain, and the C-terminal light chain of about 28 kDa, which contains the catalytic center. The heavy and light chains are connected by a disulfide bond. FXIIa-&#x3b2; is an active form of FXII of about 30 kDa, consisting of the complete light chain and a 2000 Da fragment of the heavy chain linked by a disulfide bond.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder classified into 3 disease types [Rosen, et al. 1965, Science 148; 3672:957-8; Bork, et al. 2000, Lancet, 356; 9225:213-7], including HAE type 1, HAE type 2, and HAE with normalC1-esterase inhibitor (nC1-INH). HAE type 1 and type 2 are caused by mutations of the SERPING1 gene, and are characterized by a quantitative decrease in C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) plasma concentrations (type 1) and dysfunctional C1-INH present in normal plasma concentrations (type 2) [Zuraw, et al. 2010, N Engl J Med, 363; 6:513-22; Cicardi, et al. 2014, Allergy, 69; 5:602-16]. Together, HAE type 1 and type 2 are grouped as HAE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH HAE). C1-esterase inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the generation of BK by the plasma contact system, and is the major inhibitor of a number of plasma contact system proteases including FXII and kallikrein [Davis, et al. 2010, Thromb Haemost, 104; 5:886-93]. Excessive BK formation due to pathological activation of the factor XII (FXII)-driven plasma contact system is a consistent finding in acute episodes of HAE [Bj&#xf6;rkqvist, et al. 2013, Thromb Haemost, 110; 3:399-407] (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">HAE with normal C1-INH (nC1-INH) is an inherited disorder not associated with C1-INH deficiency but missense mutations, deletions or insertions of base pairs of the FXII gene [Cicardi, et al. 2014, Allergy, 69; 5:602-16], a missense mutation of the plasminogen gene [Bork, et al. 2018, Allergy, 73; 2:442-50], [Dewald, 2018, Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 498; 1:193-8], or caused by an unknown genetic defect [Cicardi, et al. 2014, Allergy, 69; 5:602-16].</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Clinically, HAE attacks occurring in patients with HAE are characterized by local swelling of the skin (ie, edema of the extremities, facial edema, and edema of the genitals), abdominal pain, and, occasionally, life-threatening attacks of laryngeal edema [Bork, 2008, Exp Rev Clin Immunol, 4; 1:13-20]. The estimated prevalence of C1-INH HAE is commonly reported as 1:50,000, while the prevalence of nC1-INH HAE is unknown [Cicardi, et al. 2010, N Engl J Med, 363; 6:523-31; Nasr, et al. 2016, Exp Rev Clin Immunol, 12; 1:19-31].</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current treatment options for HAE can be subdivided into the acute treatment of attacks and prophylaxis. Acute and prophylactic treatments for HAE are based on blocking BK production through targeting different proteins in the kallikrein-kinin pathway. The treatment of choice in the event of an acute HAE attack is the rapid intravenous (IV) administration of C1-INH concentrate [Bork, 2008, Exp Rev Clin Immunol, 4; 1:13-20; Gompels, et al. 2005, Clin Exp Immunol, 139; 3:379-94; Longhurst, 2005, Int J Clin Practice, 59; 5:594-9]. Recently, compounds including a kallikrein inhibitor and a BK receptor antagonist have been added to the spectrum of medications available to treat acute HAE attacks [Cicardi, et al. 2010, N Engl J Med, 363; 6:532-41; Cicardi, et al. 2010, N Engl J Med, 363; 6:523-31].</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently approved C1-INH concentrates to treat acute HAE attacks intravenously are plasma-derived Berinert&#xae; and recombinant Ruconest&#xae;. Alternatively, Kalbitor&#xae; (icatibant), a kallikrein inhibitor, or Firazyr&#xae; (ecallantide), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, can be administered subcutaneously in case of an acute HAE attack. The treatment options for prophylactic treatment of HAE are limited to plasma-derived Cinryze&#xae; (IV) HAEGARDA/Berinert 2000/3000 (SC). Most recently, the kallikrein antibody product Takhzyro&#xae; (lanadelumab, SC) has been approved as an alternative option for prophylaxis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite the existing treatment options for acute HAE attacks and prophylactic treatment of HAE there is still an area of unmet medical need in particular in the field of prophylaxis. Limitations of current prophylactic therapies are an unfavorable side effect profile (attenuated androgens), a lack of effect (antifibrinolytics), or the frequency of administration (IV or SC C1-INH).

The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also includes an antibody fragment that maintains the ability to bind to FXIIa and FXII. Preferred antigen binding fragments are an Fab fragment, an Fab&#x2032; fragment, an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, an Fv fragment, a single chain antibody, a single chain Fv fragment, a disulfide stabilized Fv protein, or a dimer of a single chain Fv fragment. Antibodies also included in the invention are a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody, a murinized antibody or a bispecific antibody. Methods for producing these fragments and antibodies are well known in the art (see for example, Harlow &#x26; Lane: Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">Antibodies are usually comprised of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, each of which has a variable region at its N-terminus (V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>region). Usually a V<sub>H </sub>and a V<sub>L </sub>region will combine to form the antigen binding site. However, single domain antibodies, where only one variable region is present and binds to the antigen, have also been described.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">Typically, an antibody contains two heavy and two light chains, connected by disulfide bonds. There are 5 major isotypes of antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD), some of which occur as multimers of the basic antibody structure. The isotype is determined by the constant region of the heavy chains. There are two types of light chains, lambda and kappa.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; as used herein includes intact antibodies (also known as full length antibodies, or antibodies which comprise both heavy and light chain variable and constant domains), as well as variants and portions thereof that retain antigen binding. This includes fragments of antibodies such as Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, Fab&#x2032; fragments, single chain Fv fragments, or disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments. Thus, the term &#x201c;antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof&#x201d; when use herein is only precautionary, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; alone is already intended to cover the antibody and antigen-binding fragments thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">The terms &#x201c;full-length antibody,&#x201d; &#x201c;intact antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;whole antibody&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antigen binding fragment of an antibody. Specifically, whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains including an Fc region. The constant domains may be wild-type sequence constant domains (e.g., human wild-type sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">Each heavy and light chain consists of a variable region and a constant region. The variable regions contain framework residues and hypervariable regions, which are also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">As used herein, &#x201c;variable region&#x201d; refers to the portions of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody as defined herein that is capable of specifically binding to an antigen and includes amino acid sequences of complementarity determining regions (CDRs); i.e., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, and framework regions (FRs). Exemplary variable regions comprise three or four FRs (e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3 and optionally FR4) together with three CDRs.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complementarity determining regions&#x201d; (syn. CDRs; i.e., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain the presence of which are necessary for antigen binding. Each variable domain typically has three CDR regions identified as CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. The extent of the framework residues and CDRs is determined according to Kabat; the Kabat database is available online (Kabat E A, Wu T T, Perry H M, Gottesman K S, Foeller C (1991) <i>Sequences of proteins of immunological interest, </i>5<sup>th </sup><i>edn. U.S. Department of Health and Human services, NIH, </i>Bethesda, Md.). The CDR regions are important in binding to the epitope and therefore determine the specificity of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">&#x201c;Framework regions&#x201d; (FRs) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">A &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; is an antibody produced by a single clone of B lymphocytes, or by a cell line engineered to express a single antibody.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">A &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; is an antibody with the variable regions from one species grafted onto the constant regions from a different species. A &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody is an antibody where CDR regions from a different species, e.g. a mouse monoclonal antibody, are grafted into the framework of a human antibody. Analogously, a &#x201c;murinized&#x201d; antibody is an antibody where the CDR regions from a different species, e.g. a human monoclonal antibody, are grafted into the framework of a mouse antibody. A human antibody is an antibody that is wholly derived from human, i.e. human CDRs in a human framework and any constant region suitable for administration to a human.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">A &#x201c;germlined&#x201d; antibody is an antibody where somatic mutations that introduced changes into the framework residues are reversed to the original sequence present in the genome.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">&#x201c;Antigen binding fragment&#x201d; refers to any fragment of an antibody that retains the ability to specifically bind the epitope of the antigen that the antibody binds to. These include but are not limited to Fab, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, or single chain Fv fragments.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">&#x201c;Binding affinity&#x201d; refers to the affinity of the antibody to its antigen. It can be measured by a variety of techniques, e.g. surface plasmon resonance based technology (BiaCore&#xae;).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">&#x201c;Epitope&#x201d; is the antigenic determinant, it is defined by the residues or particular chemical structures that the antibody makes contact with on the antigen.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">&#x201c;Sequence identity&#x201d; relates to the similarity of amino acid sequences. The best possible alignment of two sequences is prepared, and the sequence identity is determined by the percentage of identical residues. Standard methods are available for the alignment of sequences, e.g. algorithms of Needleman and Wunsch (J Mol Biol (1970) 48, 443), Smith and Waterman (Adv Appl Math (1981) 2, 482), Pearson and Lipman (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1988) 85, 2444), and others. Suitable software is commercially available, e.g. the GCG suite of software (Devereux et al (1984), Nucl Acids Res 12, 387), where alignments can be produced using, for example, GAP or BESTFIT with default parameters, or successors thereof. The Blast algorithm, originally described by Altschul et al (J. Mol. Biol. (1990) 215, 403), but further refined to include gapped alignments (Blast 2), available from various sources such as the EBI, NCBI, will also produce alignments and calculate the % identity between two sequences.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">&#x201c;Specific binding&#x201d; refers to the binding to substantially only a single antigen.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">&#x201c;FXII/FXIIa&#x201d; refers to either or both of Factor XII and activated Factor XII (FXIIa). Thus &#x201c;FXII/FXIIa inhibitor&#x201d; includes inhibitors of either or both of FXII and FXIIa. Further, anti-FXII/FXIIa antibodies include antibodies that bind to and inhibit either or both of FXII and FXIIa.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">&#x201c;Treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; means the reduction of any symptoms associated with HAE, especially the reduction of the severity and/or frequency of HAE attacks.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">&#x201c;Preventing&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; means the prevention of any symptoms associated with HAE including the deterioration of the disease.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">As explained in more detail in the attached examples, the present inventors have been surprisingly able to show for the first time that the anti-FXII antibodies used in the context of the present invention are very active in reducing the number of attacks in hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients. In fact, the antibodies used in the context of the present invention are able to almost completely prevent such HAE attacks, even when administered subcutaneously. The repeat dosing of the anti-FXII antibodies of the present invention over the time and thereby maintaining an antibody concentration in the blood results in a remarkable reduction of the number of HAE attacks.

This includes antigen binding fragments of an antibody fused to a Fc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">Sequences of constant regions useful for producing the proteins of the present disclosure may be obtained from a number of different sources. In some examples, the constant region or portion thereof of the protein is derived from a human antibody. The constant region or portion thereof may be derived from any antibody class, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any antibody isotype, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">In one embodiment, the constant region is human isotype IgG4 or a stabilized IgG4 constant region.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">In one embodiment, the Fc region of the constant region has a reduced ability to induce effector function, e.g., compared to a native or wild-type human IgG1 or IgG3 Fc region. In one embodiment, the effector function is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Methods for assessing the level of effector function of an Fc region containing protein are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">In one embodiment, the Fc region is an IgG4 Fc region (i.e., from an IgG4 constant region), e.g., a human IgG4 Fc region. Sequences of suitable IgG4 Fc regions will be apparent to the skilled person and/or available in publicly available databases (e.g., available from National Center for Biotechnology Information).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">In one embodiment, the constant region is a stabilized IgG4 constant region. The term &#x201c;stabilized IgG4 constant region&#x201d; will be understood to mean an IgG4 constant region that has been modified to reduce Fab arm exchange or the propensity to undergo Fab arm exchange or formation of a half-antibody or a propensity to form a half antibody. &#x201c;Fab arm exchange&#x201d; refers to a type of protein modification for human IgG4, in which an IgG4 heavy chain and attached light chain (half-molecule) is swapped for a heavy-light chain pair from another IgG4 molecule. Thus, IgG4 molecules may acquire two distinct Fab arms recognizing two distinct antigens (resulting in bispecific molecules). Fab arm exchange occurs naturally in vivo and can be induced in vitro by purified blood cells or reducing agents such as reduced glutathione. A &#x201c;half antibody&#x201d; forms when an IgG4 antibody dissociates to form two molecules each containing a single heavy chain and a single light chain.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">In one embodiment, a stabilized IgG4 constant region comprises a proline at position 241 of the hinge region according to the system of Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Washington D.C. United States Department of Health and Human Services, 1987 and/or 1991). This position corresponds to position 228 of the hinge region according to the EU numbering system (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Washington D.C. United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2001 and Edelman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 63, 78-85, 1969). In human IgG4, this residue is generally a serine. Following substitution of the serine for proline, the IgG4 hinge region comprises a sequence CPPC. In this regard, the skilled person will be aware that the &#x201c;hinge region&#x201d; is a proline-rich portion of an antibody heavy chain constant region that links the Fc and Fab regions that confers mobility on the two Fab arms of an antibody. The hinge region includes cysteine residues which are involved in inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds. It is generally defined as stretching from Glu226 to Pro243 of human IgG1 according to the numbering system of Kabat. Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain disulphide (S&#x2014;S) bonds in the same positions (see for example WO2010/080538).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">Additional embodiments of stabilized IgG4 antibodies are antibodies in which arginine at position 409 in a heavy chain constant region of human IgG4 (according to the EU numbering system) is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine, or leucine (e.g., as described in WO2006/033386). The Fc region of the constant region may additionally or alternatively comprise a residue selected from the group consisting of: alanine, valine, glycine, isoleucine and leucine at the position corresponding to 405 (according to the EU numbering system). Optionally, the hinge region comprises a proline at position 241 (i.e., a CPPC sequence) (as described above).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">In another embodiment, the Fc region is a region modified to have reduced effector function, i.e., a &#x201c;non-immunostimulatory Fc region&#x201d;. For example, the Fc region is an IgG1 Fc region comprising a substitution at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 268, 309, 330 and 331. In another embodiment, the Fc region is an IgG1 Fc region comprising one or more of the following changes E233P, L234V, L235A and deletion of G236 and/or one or more of the following changes A327G, A330S and P331S (Armour et al., Eur J Immunol. 29:2613-2624, 1999; Shields et al., J Biol Chem. 276(9):6591-604, 2001). Additional examples of non-immunostimulatory Fc regions are described, for example, in Dall'Acqua et al., J Immunol. 177: 1129-1138, 2006; and/or Hezareh J Virol; 75: 12161-12168, 2001).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">In another embodiment, the Fc region is a chimeric Fc region, e.g., comprising at least one C<sub>H</sub>2 domain from an IgG4 antibody and at least one C<sub>H</sub>3 domain from an IgG1 antibody, wherein the Fc region comprises a substitution at one or more amino acid positions selected from the group consisting of 240, 262, 264, 266, 297, 299, 307, 309, 323, 399, 409 and 427 (EU numbering) (e.g., as described in WO2010/085682). Exemplary substitutions include 240F, 262L, 264T, 266F, 297Q, 299A, 299K, 307P, 309K, 309M, 309P, 323F, 399S, and 427F.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">The present disclosure also contemplates additional modifications to an antibody.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">For example, the antibody comprises one or more amino acid substitutions that increase the half-life of the protein. For example, the antibody comprises an Fc region comprising one or more amino acid substitutions that increase the affinity of the Fc region for the neonatal Fc region (FcRn). For example, the Fc region has increased affinity for FcRn at lower pH, e.g., about pH 6.0, to facilitate Fc/FcRn binding in an endosome. In one example, the Fc region has increased affinity for FcRn at about pH 6 compared to its affinity at about pH 7.4, which facilitates the re-release of Fc (and therefore of Fc region-comprising molecules) into blood following cellular recycling. These amino acid substitutions are useful for extending the half-life of a protein, by reducing clearance from the blood.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">Exemplary amino acid substitutions include T250Q and/or M428L or T252A, T254S and T266F or M252Y, S254T and T256E or H433K and N434F according to the EU numbering system.

Yet another cell is a yeast cell, such as <i>Saccharomyces</i>, e.g. <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, or <i>Pichia </i>pistoris. Bacterial host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>are also possible. Methods for introducing DNA into the respective host cells are well known in the art.

The key PD endpoint used for dose selection was FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity. The inhibitory capacity of CSL312 was studied using biomarker of the kallikrein-kinin system. Kallikrein activity informs how CSL312 contributes to the HAE pathophysiology. Plasma samples were activated ex vivo, mimicking a HAE attack and resulting in FXII-mediated amplification of the kallikrein-kinin pathway. FXIIa cleaves prekallikrein to generate kallikrein whose activity can be measured using chromogenic peptide substrates. It was hypothesized that inhibiting FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity consistently to a particular % target inhibition is expected to provide protection from HAE attacks. The exact % target FXIIa-mediated kallikrein inhibition to prevent HAE attacks was unknown. A PK/PD model was developed to quantify the relationship between CSL312 plasma concentrations and FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity in the phase 1 single ascending dose study after administration in healthy volunteers. The modeled relationship showed an increase in inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity with increasing concentrations of CSL312. Based on the relationship between CSL312 plasma concentration and FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity, the % target inhibition levels that were chosen included &#x2265;30, &#x2265;50, and &#x2265;90% to provide information along the entire spectrum of the curve allowing for a robust assessment of doses in this study. Simulations using the final PK/PD model determined that fixed doses of 75 mg, 200 mg, and 600 mg administered every 4 weeks would result in at least 75% of the patients reaching a % target inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity of &#x2265;30, &#x2265;50, and &#x2265;90%, respectively.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0177">Study Population</p><p id="p-0171" num="0178">To have entered the Run-in Period, subjects must have met all of the following inclusion criteria:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0179">1.

In addition, because of the pharmacological action of CSL312, a prolongation of aPTT is expected to be observed in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical experience with CSL312 in healthy volunteers in the phase 1 study and patients with HAE in the ongoing phase 2 study did not show an effect on either prothrombin time or abnormal bleeding. This is consistent with the observation that patients who have congenital deficiency of FXII do not exhibit a bleeding phenotype, despite having a prolonged aPTT. In addition, nonclinical studies in mice and rabbits showed no impairment in hemostasis after inhibition of FXIIa. Subjects will be monitored carefully for any signs of bleeding or thrombosis during the study.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0260">Severe Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic-type Reactions: Administration of therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies such as CSL312 is potentially associated with the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, some of which can be serious and life-threatening. Appropriate precautions will be taken when CSL312 is administered at the study site, with vigilant monitoring for potential severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Administration of CSL312, at least the first 2 to 3 doses, will be performed at the site under medical supervision with immediate access to emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity adverse reactions including and anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0261">Immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies): All protein therapeutics are potentially immunogenic.

Investigator's Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (IGART).</p><p id="p-0229" num="0281">Study Design</p><p id="p-0230" num="0282">This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of SC CSL312 administered once monthly as prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescent (12 to 17 years, inclusive) and adult subjects with C1-INH HAE type 1 and type 2. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the study consists of a Screening Period (up to 1 month), a Run-in Period (up to 2 months) for confirmation of disease activity and determination of subjects' baseline HAE attack rate, 1 Treatment Period (6 months) for confirmation of the safety and efficacy of the 200 mg CSL312 dose, and either a 2-month Follow-up Period (i.e., 3 months after last investigational product administration of investigational product) or entry into the open-label Phase 3b Study.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0283">Screening: Following informed consent, subjects will undergo a Screening Period of up to 1 month to determine eligibility for enrollment into the study. Screened subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter the Run-in Period.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0284">Run-in Period: After Screening, eligible subjects will enter the Run-in Period lasting at least 1 month and up to 2 months to confirm their underlying disease status and to assess their eligibility for participation in the Treatment Period. The first day of the Run-in Period may occur on the same day as Screening.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0285">Subjects must complete at least 1 month of the Run-in Period. Additionally, subjects must experience at least 2 HAE attacks during the Run-In period to be eligible to enter the Treatment Period. Subjects who experience at least 2 attacks during the required first month of the Run-in Period may enter the Treatment period. Subjects who do not experience an HAE attack during the first month of the Run-in Period will remain in the Run-in Period for up to an additional month during which time they would be required to experience at least 2 attacks to be eligible to enter the Treatment Period and randomization.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0286">Subjects are not permitted to use routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks during the Run-in Period; however, subjects may use on-demand HAE therapy to treat HAE attacks if that medication has previously been shown to be effective.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0287">Subjects who do not meet the minimum HAE attack rate during the Run-in Period or are otherwise determined to be ineligible due to Screening assessments, will be considered Run-in failures and will not be allowed to be rescreened for participation in the study.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0288">Treatment Period: Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will enter the Treatment Period after the Run-in Period.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0289">Eligible subjects will be randomized 3:2 to either the CSL312 active arm or the placebo arm. The duration of the Treatment Period is 6 months. Randomization will take age (&#x2264;17 years, &#x3e;17 years) and, for adults, baseline attack rate observed during the Run-in Period (1 to &#x3c;3 attacks/month, and 3 attacks/month) into account.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0290">Follow-Up Period/Open-label Phase 3b Study Entry:</p><p id="p-0239" num="0291">Subjects who successfully complete the current phase 3 study may have the option to roll over into an open-label phase 3b study (OLE). Subjects who choose not to participate in the OLE study are required to complete the follow-up visit (day 242, which is approximately 3 months after the last dose of investigational product). For subjects who choose to participate in the OLE study, assessments collected on day 182 will be used to fulfill applicable assessments for day 1 of the OLE study.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0292">Dose and Dosing Regimen</p><p id="p-0241" num="0293">The investigational products in this study are 200 mg CSL312 and placebo.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0294">Subjects randomized to the active arm will receive CSL312 SC once a month for 6 months. The first dose of CSL312 will be a 400 mg loading dose administered subcutaneously on the same day as 2 separate injections at the study site (i.e., month 1). Subsequent doses of CSL312 will be 200 mg administered SC once monthly for 5 consecutive months (i.e., months 2 through 6).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0295">Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will receive volume-matched placebo once monthly for 6 months. The first dose of placebo in the placebo arm will be volume-matched placebo administered SC as 2 separate injections (i.e., month 1). Subjects will then receive volume-matched placebo SC once a month for 5 consecutive months (i.e., months 2 through 6).</p><p id="p-0244" num="0296">The proposed dose of 200 mg was selected based on the efficacy and safety observed in TP1 of the phase 2 study (Example 2), CSL312 PK, inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity, and exposure-response (E-R) modeling.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0297">The 200 mg dose administered once every 28 days (&#xb1;3 days) was highly effective across various efficacy endpoints and had a favorable safety profile. In addition, the 200 mg dose resulted in &#x2dc;50% inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0298">To support phase 3 dose selection, an E-R model was used to simulate HAE attack rates over a wide range of CSL312 concentrations that would be expected after different dosing regimens. Based on the E-R model, the estimated daily average concentrations to achieve 50, 75, and 90% relative attack risk reduction in the baseline attack rate were 1.4, 3.3, and 7.8 &#x3bc;g/mL, respectively. The median predicted minimum daily average CSL312 concentrations at steady-state following 200 mg SC once a month regimen corresponds to the 90% relative attack risk reduction in baseline attack rate in 73% of patients.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0299">Additionally, the E-R model showed a cumulative effect of CSL312 concentration is evidenced in the reduction in the expected number of HAE attacks per month. The 200 mg SC once a month regimen is predicted to reduce the mean attack rate by approximately 91% compared to placebo. Increasing the dose beyond 200 mg is not predicted to result in significant further reductions in HAE attacks.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0300">Finally, the exposures at the 200 mg SC dose administered monthly are not expected to cause aPTT prolongation in the majority of subjects in the phase 3 study.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0301">Based on all the factors taken into consideration in selecting a dose, the 200 mg of CSL312 SC administered once monthly is expected to achieve clinically meaningful treatment effect and optimal benefit/risk ratio in subjects with C1-INH HAE type 1 and type 2.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0302">Eligibility Criteria</p><p id="p-0251" num="0303">The study population will be selected on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the sections below.
