The invention further also relates to the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols resulting from the process and to a process for preparing polyurethanes by reaction of the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Polyols based on renewable raw materials such as fatty acid triglycerides, sugar, sorbitol, glycerol and dimer fatty alcohols are already used in a variety of ways as raw materials in the manufacture of polyurethane materials. The use of such components will continue to increase in future, since products from renewable sources will be favorably assessed in life cycle assessments and the availability of raw materials based on petrochemicals will decrease in the long term. In addition, the targeted use of triglycerides in the preparation of alkylene oxide addition products based on starters having Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms makes it possible to prepare polyether ester polyols characterized by an increased dissolving power for blowing agents based on (partially halogenated) hydrocarbons and typically used in rigid foam formulations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP 1923417 A1 discloses a single-stage process for preparing polyether ester polyols by reaction of starter compounds having Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms (&#x201c;H-functional starter compounds&#x201d;) with alkylene oxides under base catalysis in the presence of fatty acid esters as a renewable raw material, wherein the fatty acid residues of the fatty acid esters contain no free OH groups. These polyether ester polyols are used as components in formulations with other polyols in the preparation of rigid PUR/PIR foams, wherein these PUR/PIR systems are characterized by good demolding characteristics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 2807199 A1 discloses a process for preparing a polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyol by reacting a Zerewitinoff-active starter compound with fatty acid esters and alkylene oxides using basic imidazole catalysts, wherein preparation is additionally carried out in the presence of a cyclic anhydride of dicarboxylic acids. The resulting polyetherester polyols are likewise used in the preparation of rigid foams. It is thought that the presence of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid units in the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyol end product should lead to improved flame retardant properties.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, EP 2807199 A1 failed to provide a process affording end products that are as light-colored as possible. However, when using aminic catalysts for the alkylene oxide addition, in particular those based on aromatic amines such as for example imidazole and its derivatives or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, which are a) characterized by a high activity and which b) distinguish themselves from the use of, for example, KOH as alkylene oxide addition catalyst in that they can remain in the end product, it is observed that very strongly discolored products are formed. Products with little discoloration are advantageous in applications intended to meet both technical and optical requirements. This applies to coatings for example.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Starting from the prior art the present invention has for its object to provide an improved process for preparing single-phase polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols, in particular those having number-average functionalities of not less than 2, that leads to polyol products that are less discolored. The polyoxyalkylene polyester polyol products shall moreover be obtainable by a process which is simple to perform and as energy efficient as possible, in particular the mixing power input to be supplied during preparation of the polyether ester polyols shall be in a range which is technically readily achievable.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object was surprisingly achieved by a process for preparing polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols by reaction of a starter compound (1) having Zerewitnoff-active H atoms, a cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) and a fatty acid ester (3) with an alkylene oxide (4) in the presence of a basic catalyst (5) comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(i) providing a mixture (i) comprising the starter compound (1) and the fatty acid ester (3), wherein the mixture (i) contains no cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2);</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(ii) reacting the mixture (i) from step (i) with a portion (v1) of the alkylene oxide (4), wherein at least 0.15 mol of alkylene oxide (4) per 1 mol of Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms of the starter compound (1) is added to form a compound (ii);</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(iii) reacting the compound (ii) formed in step (ii) by addition of the dicarboxylic anhydride (2) to form a compound (iii);</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(iv) reacting the compound (iii) from step (iii) with a portion (v2) of the alkylene oxide (4), wherein at least 1.15 mol of alkylene oxide (4) per 1 mol of the dicarboxylic anhydride (2) is added.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the context of the present invention polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols are to be understood as meaning products of the reaction of starter compounds (1) with Zerewitnoff-active H atoms, cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides (2), fatty acid esters (3) and alkylene oxides (4), wherein the reaction of the fatty acid esters and the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides affords ester units and the ring-opening products of the alkylene oxides can also lead to ether bonds. In such a process the Zerewitnoff-active H atoms form hydroxyl end groups and, intermediately, also carboxyl functions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the context of the present invention starter compounds (1) having Zerewitnoff-active H atoms (H-functional starter compounds) are to be understood as meaning compounds comprising at least one Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atom. Hydrogen bonded to N, O or S is referred to as Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen (or as &#x201c;active hydrogen&#x201d;) if it affords methane by reaction with methylmagnesium iodide by a method discovered by Zerewitinoff. Typical examples of compounds having Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen are compounds containing carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, imino or thiol groups as functional groups.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Suitable H-functional starter compounds (&#x201c;starters&#x201d;) preferably have functionalities of 2 to 8, but in particular cases also functionalities up to 35. The molar masses thereof are from 17 g/mol to 1200 g/mol Amino-functional starter compounds may also be used as well as hydroxy-functional starter compounds. Preferred starters have functionalities of not less than 2 to not more than 4. Examples of hydroxy-functional starter compounds are propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butane-1,2-diol, butane-1,3-diol, butane-1,4-diol, hexanediol, pentanediol, 3-methylpentane-1,5-diol, dodecane-1,12-diol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, triethanolamine, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, sucrose, hydroquinone, catechol, resorcinol, bisphenol F, bisphenol A, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene, methylol-containing condensates of formaldehyde and phenol or melamine or urea, and Mannich bases. It is also possible to use high-functionality starter compounds based on hydrogenated starch hydrolysis products. These are described, for example, in EP-A 1 525 244. Examples of starter compounds containing amino groups are ammonia, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, isopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine, ethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, aniline, the isomers of toluidine, the isomers of diaminotoluene, the isomers of diaminodiphenylmethane, and higher polycyclic products obtained in the condensation of aniline with formaldehyde to give diaminodiphenylmethane.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The starter compounds (1) are used either individually or as a mixture of at least two starter compounds.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The process may moreover additionally employ preprepared alkylene oxide addition products of the low molecular weight starter compounds mentioned, i.e. polyether polyols having OH numbers of 100 to 1000 mg KOH/g, as starters. The preparation of such a preprepared alkylene oxide addition product may, for example, also be carried out in situ before the addition of the fatty acid ester in step (i) by metered addition of a sufficient amount of alkylene oxide to the starter compound (1). European patent application EP 2177555 A2 teaches that such an approach is advantageous especially when starter compounds having melting points higher than room temperature are used in polyether ester production processes, since this significantly improves the conversion of such solid starting compounds. The process according to the invention may also employ polyester polyols having OH numbers in the range from 6 to 800 mg KOH/g in addition to the starter compounds. Polyester polyols suitable therefor may be prepared for example from organic dicarboxylic acids having 2 to 12 carbon atoms and polyhydric alcohols, preferably diols, having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the starter compound is one or more compounds and is selected from the list consisting of propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, trimethylolpropane, glycerol, triethanolamine, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, sucrose, ethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, aniline, the isomers of toluidine, the isomers of diaminotoluene, in particular those having amino groups positioned ortho to one another, the isomers of diaminodiphenylmethane and the higher polycylic products obtained in the condensation of aniline with formaldehyde to afford diaminodiphenylmethane.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Carboxylic anhydrides suitable for the process according to the invention are, in particular, cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides selected from the group comprising phthalic anhydride, 1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride, 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and alkenylsuccinic anhydrides and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the cyclic anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid may also be itaconic anhydride.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The alkenylsuccinic anhydrides may be selected from the group of C12-C20 alkyl chain-substituted succinic anhydrides and poly(isobutylene)succinic anhydrides having molar masses between 500 and 2000 g/mol.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) is an aromatic cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride, for example phthalic anhydride, 1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride. Phthalic anhydride is particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides (2) are employed either individually or as a mixture of at least two dicarboxylic anhydrides.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The umbrella term &#x201c;fatty acid esters&#x201d; refers hereinafter to fatty acid glycerides, especially fatty acid triglycerides, and/or fatty acid esters based on other mono- and polyfunctional alcohols. The fatty acid residues of the fatty acid esters may, as is the case in castor oil, themselves bear hydroxyl groups. It goes without saying that it is also possible to use fatty acid esters whose fatty acid residues have subsequently been modified with hydroxyl groups in the process according to the invention. Fatty acid residues that have been modified in this way may be obtained, for example, by epoxidation of the olefinic double bonds and subsequent ring opening of the oxirane rings using nucleophiles or by hydroformylation/hydrogenation. It is also possible to treat unsaturated oils with atmospheric oxygen for this purpose, frequently at elevated temperature.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">All triglycerides are suitable as substrates for the processes according to the invention. Examples include cottonseed oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, linseed oil, palm kernel oil, olive oil, corn oil, palm oil, castor oil, lesquerella oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, herring oil, sardine oil and tallow. It goes without saying that it is also possible to employ fatty acid esters of other mono- or polyhydric alcohols as well as fatty acid glycerides having less than 3 fatty acid residues per glycerol molecule in the process according to the invention. The fatty acid (tri)glycerides and the fatty acid esters of other mono- and polyhydric alcohols may also be used in the mixture.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the fatty acid ester (3) has no free hydroxyl groups in the fatty acid residues.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the fatty acid ester (3) without free hydroxyl groups in the fatty acid residues is one or more compounds and is selected from the group consisting of cottonseed oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, linseed oil, palm kernel oil, olive oil, corn oil, palm oil, jatropha oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, herring oil, sardine oil and tallow, preferably soybean oil.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the preparation of the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols according to the invention the fatty acid ester (3) is employed in amounts of 10% by weight to 70% by weight, preferably 10% by weight to 40% by weight and particularly preferably 10% by weight to 30% by weight, based on the sum of all components.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fatty acid esters (3) are used either individually or as a mixture of at least two starter compounds.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Suitable alkylene oxides are, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1,2-butylene oxide or 2,3-butylene oxide and styrene oxide. It is preferable to supply propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to the reaction mixture individually, as mixture or successively. If the alkylene oxides are metered in successively, the products prepared contain polyether chains having block structures. For example, step (iv) may comprise metered addition of an alkylene oxide other than that added in step (ii). Products having ethylene oxide end blocks are generally characterized by elevated concentrations of primary end groups, which impart the systems with the isocyanate reactivity necessary for molded foam applications. Preferably employed alkylene oxides are propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide and it is particularly preferable to employ ethylene oxide since the latter provides polyurethane materials prepared on the basis of such polyether esters with elevated flame retardancy.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention the sum of the portion (v1) of the alkylene oxide (4) added in step (ii) and the portion (v2) of the alkylene oxide (4) added in step (iv) is 90 mol %, preferably 95 mol % and particularly preferably 100% of the total amount (vT) of the alkylene oxide (4) added.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The alkylene oxides (4) are employed either individually or as a mixture of at least two alkylene oxides.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the basic catalyst (5) is added in step (i) and/or in step (iii) and/or in step (iv), preferably in step (i).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the basic catalyst used is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, preferably potassium hydroxide. The catalyst may be added to the reaction mixture in the form of aqueous solutions or in anhydrous form. Any water of solution present or water formed by the deprotonation of the OH groups is preferably removed before the fatty acid esters are added to the reaction mixture. The dehydration may be carried out, for example, by heat-treating under reduced pressure at temperatures of 80&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. and optionally assisted by stripping with inert gas. Residual traces of water may finally be removed from the reaction mixture by reaction with small amounts of alkylene oxide before addition of the fatty acid esters. 5% by weight of alkylene oxide based on the total amount of reaction mixture present in the reactor is generally sufficient therefor. The catalyst concentration here is 0.02% to 1% by weight, based on the amount of end product, preferably 0.05% to 0.6% by weight.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an alternative embodiment of the process according to the invention, the basic catalysts used are alkylene oxide addition products of hydroxy-functional starter compounds having alkoxylate contents of 0.05 to 50 equivalent % (&#x201c;polymeric alkoxylates&#x201d;). The alkoxylate content is to be understood as meaning the proportion of Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms removed by a base by deprotonation based on all Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms in the catalyst. The polymeric alkoxylate employed as catalyst may be prepared in a separate reaction step by alkali-catalyzed addition of alkylene oxides to the abovementioned starter compounds having Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms. The preparation of the polymeric alkoxylate typically comprises employing as catalyst an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, for example KOH, in amounts of 0.1% to 1% by weight based on the amount to be prepared, dewatering the reaction mixture under vacuum, performing the alkylene oxide addition reaction under an inert gas atmosphere at 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. until achievement of an OH number of 150 to 1200 mg KOH/g and subsequently establishing the abovementioned alkoxylate contents of 0.05 to 50 equivalent % by addition of further alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides and subsequent dewatering. Polymeric alkoxylates prepared in this way may be stored separately in an inert gas atmosphere. They have long been used in the preparation of long-chain polyether polyols. The amount of the polymeric alkoxylate employed in the process according to the invention is typically such that it corresponds to an amount of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide of 200 ppm to 1% by weight based on the end product according to the invention. It goes without saying that the polymeric alkoxylates may also be used as mixtures.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The preparation of the polymeric alkoxylate may also be performed in situ immediately before actual performance of the process according to the invention in the same reactor. The amount of polymeric alkoxylate necessary for a polymerization batch is prepared in the reactor according to the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph. It goes without saying that it is necessary in this procedure to ensure that the extremely small starter quantities at commencement of the reaction are also stirrable. This may optionally be achieved using inert solvents such as toluene and/or THF.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further, preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention the basic catalysts employed are amines, such as aliphatic or aromatic amines or alkanolamines. It is preferable to use aromatic amines.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Amines that may be employed as catalysts include for example aliphatic amines or alkanolamines such as N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, dimethylaminopropanol, N-methyldiethanolamine, trimethylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-methylpyrrolidine, N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethylethylenediamine, diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine or N-methylmorpholine.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred variant of this embodiment of the process according to the invention, the aromatic amine is one or more compounds and is selected from the group consisting of imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 2-methylimidazole, 4(5)-methylimidazole, 2,4(5)-dimethylimidazole, 1-ethylimidazole, 2-ethylimidazole, 1-phenylimidazole, 2-phenylimidazole, 4(5)-phenylimidazole, and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine. A comprehensive overview of amines that may be used has been given by M. Ionescu et al. in &#x201c;Advances in Urethanes Science and Technology&#x201d;, 1998, 14, 151-218. Tertiary aliphatic amines or alkanolamines are preferably used as well as imidazole and the imidazole or pyridine derivatives mentioned. The catalysts may be used in concentrations, based on the amount of end product, of 200 ppm to 10 000 ppm, wherein the concentration range from 200 ppm to 5000 ppm is preferred.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further, less preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the basic catalysts employed are carboxylic acid salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals. The underlying carboxylic acids may be monobasic or polybasic. Examples include salts of acetic, propionic and adipic acid. Such alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carboxylates are typically employed in amounts of 0.04% to 2% by weight, based on the amount of end product.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Steps (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the process according to the invention are performed specifically as described below:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Step (i) of the process according to the invention comprises providing a mixture (i) comprising the starter compound (1) and the fatty acid ester (3), wherein the mixture (i) contains no cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mixture (i) is prepared by stirring or pumped circulation via a dispersing unit. Mixture (i) is normally heterogeneous, since the starter compound (1) and the fatty acid ester (3), especially when this is a fatty acid triglyceride whose fatty acid residues bear no free OH groups or when preprepared alkylene oxide addition products of low molecular weight starter compounds are used, are often incompatible with one another. Stirring/recirculation may be effected at elevated temperature, for example at 50&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C., to facilitate mixing/dispersion of the components. It is generally unnecessary to adhere to a particular minimum stirring or minimum pumped circulation time.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The mixture (i) comprising the starter compound (1), the fatty acid ester (3) and optionally the catalyst (5) is initially charged in the reactor and reacted with the portion (v1) of the alkylene oxide (4) at temperatures of 80-170&#xb0; C., preferably 100-150&#xb0; C. (80-150&#xb0; C. when using amine catalysts) in an inert gas atmosphere. This alkylene oxide portion (v1) is at least 0.15 mol of alkylene oxide (4) per 1 mol of Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms in the starter compound (1). In order to rule out the presence of water with certainty, addition of the fatty acid ester (3) may be preceded by dewatering under vacuum at temperatures of 80-150&#xb0; C. (40-130&#xb0; C. when using amine catalysts), optionally by additional stripping with inert gas. If amines are used as catalysts these may also be added only after such a dewatering step. The alkylene oxide (4) is continuously supplied to the reactor in conventional fashion in such a way that the safety-related pressure limits of the employed reactor system are not exceeded. Such reactions are typically carried out in the pressure range from 10 mbar to 10 bar. Especially in the case of metered addition of ethylene oxide-containing alkylene oxide mixtures or pure ethylene oxide, it should be ensured that a sufficient partial inert gas pressure is maintained within the reactor during the startup and metering phase. This can be established, for example, by means of noble gases or nitrogen. The alkylene oxides (4) may be supplied to the reactor in different ways: One option is metered addition into the gas phase or directly into the liquid phase, for example via an immersed tube or a distributor ring close to the reactor base in a zone with good mixing. In the case of metered addition into the liquid phase, the metered addition units should be designed so as to be self-emptying, for example by situating the metered addition holes on the underside of the distributor ring. Backflow of reaction medium into the alkylene oxide-conducting conduits and metered addition units or into the alkylene oxide reservoir vessels can be advantageously prevented by apparatus measures, for example through installation of non-return valves. The reaction of the alkylene oxide portion (v1) with the mixture (i) is preferably carried out at a temperature of 70&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C., particularly preferably at a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. The temperature may be varied within the described limits during the alkylene oxide metered addition phase. To achieve an optimal balance between high alkylene oxide conversion and low by-product formation when using sensitive starter compounds (for example sucrose), alkoxylation may initially be performed at low reaction temperatures (for example at 70 to 110&#xb0; C.), a transition to higher reaction temperatures (for example to 110&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C.) being made only upon sufficient starter conversion (i.e. once at least 50% by weight of the starter compounds (1) employed have reacted with alkylene oxide at at least one Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atom). The end of the metered addition phase for the alkylene oxide portion (v1) is typically followed by a postreaction phase in which the remaining alkylene oxide reacts. Post-reactions may optionally be performed at higher temperatures (i.e. after raising the temperature to 100&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C., preferably 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C.). The end of such a post-reaction phase is reached when no further pressure drop or only a very slow remaining pressure drop is detectable in the reaction vessel.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The temperature of the exothermic alkylene oxide addition reaction is kept at the desired level by cooling. According to the prior art relating to the design of polymerization reactors for exothermic reactions (for example Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, volume B4, page 167ff., 5th edition, 1992), such cooling is generally effected via the reactor wall (e.g. double jacket, half-coil pipe) and by means of further heat exchange surfaces disposed internally in the reactor and/or externally in the pumped circulation circuit, for example in cooling coils, cooling cartridges, or plate, shell-and-tube or mixer heat exchangers. These should advantageously be configured such that effective cooling is possible even at commencement of the metering phase, i.e. at a low fill level and/or in the presence of possibly heterogeneous reactor contents (for example in the case of solid dispersions or suspensions).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) is then added to the reaction mixture resulting from step (ii). 0.05 to 1 mol of cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) per 1 mol of the Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms introduced via the starter compound (1) are typically used. Such cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides (2), which are often present in the form of solids, are advantageously supplied to the reaction mixture as a melt. At the customary reaction temperatures of 70&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C. the formation of the half-esters of the dicarboxylic acids on which the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides (2) are based by reaction of the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides with the starter compound (1) occurs very quickly, see also DE 3916340, and a separate hold time until completion of the half-ester formation can therefore generally be eschewed. On the contrary, it is advisable to proceed quickly with step (iv) after metered addition of the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) in order to inhibit esterification processes that may occur to the greatest possible extent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Step (iv) of the process according to the invention comprises reacting the compound (iii) obtained from step (iii) with the portion (v2) of the alkylene oxide (4) in an inert gas atmosphere at temperatures of 80-170&#xb0; C., preferably 100-150&#xb0; C. (80-150&#xb0; C. in the presence of the catalyst (5)), preferably in the presence of amine catalysts. The alkylene oxide portion (v2) is at least 1.15 mol per 1 mol of the cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride (2) added in step (iii). The recommended reaction conditions and apparatus parameters correspond to those already described for step (ii). Step (iv) generally also ends with a post-reaction step which may likewise be performed at relatively high temperatures (i.e. after raising the temperature to 100&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C., preferably 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C.). The end of such a post-reaction phase is reached when no further pressure drop or only a very slow remaining pressure drop is detectable in the reaction vessel. If long-chain polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols are prepared, for example those having OH numbers below 100 mg KOH/g, and strong bases, for example alkali metal hydroxides, are used therefor as catalysts, it is recommended that the post-reaction phase at elevated temperature or at reaction temperature should last no longer than absolutely necessary. If, for example, a pressure drop rate specified as an endpoint criterion for the post-reaction time is reached or falls short, the temperature should be reduced to values below 100&#xb0; C., preferably to values below 80&#xb0; C., to inhibit the formation of undesired secondary components. If the pressure drop rate falls to a value of 20 mbar/h or below, the post-reaction phase can generally be considered to have ended.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the basic catalyst (5) is added in step (i) and/or in step (iii) and/or in step (iv). It is preferably added in step (i).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The crude polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyol resulting from step (iv) may optionally be subjected to work-up steps to remove any catalyst traces. In the case of alkylene oxide addition reactions catalysed with amines, such aftertreatment steps are generally not required. The optional removal of the catalyst from the crude polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyol resulting from step (iv) may be carried out in different ways: For example, the basic catalyst, for example KOH, may be neutralized with dilute mineral acids such as sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid. If neutralization is effected using strong diluted mineral acids (pKa of 1st dissociation stage &#x3c;2.8) the neutralization should be carried out at relatively low temperatures, for example at 20&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., preferably at 20-60&#xb0; C., and the amount of acid required for neutralization should be supplied to the alkaline alkylene oxide addition product as quickly as possible to ensure that the basic reaction products are hydrolyzed and neutralized at the same time. It is therefore advisable to eschew a separate hydrolysis step before addition of the neutralization acid. Such a procedure ensures that side reactions at the ester bonds of the polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols are avoided to the greatest possible extent. The salts formed in the course of neutralization are removed, for example by filtration. The polyether polyol preparation processes described in EP-A 2028211 and WO-A 2009106244 are exceptions. Alternatively, the neutralization may be effected with hydroxycarboxylic acids (for example lactic acid, as described in WO-A 9820061 and US-A 2004167316). Carboxylic acids such as for example formic acid (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 4,521,548) or else adipic acid are likewise suitable for neutralization. In order to achieve a proton concentration in the polyoxyalkylene polyetherester polyol that is sufficiently high for the intended application, (hydroxy)carboxylic acids are often used in an amount that is in marked excess relative to the amount of basic catalyst to be neutralized. The metal carboxylates formed after neutralization with some carboxylic acids (for example hydroxycarboxylic acids or formic acid) are soluble in the polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols to give a clear solution and removal of the salts may therefore be dispensed with here. The neutralization may also be carried out for example by addition of cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides, such as phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride or succinic anhydride, to obtain salts which are likewise soluble in the polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols according to the invention. Also possible is the use of ring-opening products of cyclic carboxylic anhydrides with polyols, i.e. of dicarboxylic acid half-esters, as neutralizing agents. It should finally be noted that the incompletely alkoxylated oxo acids of phosphorus are likewise suitable as neutralization acids. It is likewise possible to remove the catalyst by using acidic cation exchangers as described for example in DE-A 100 24 313. The catalysts may moreover be removed using adsorbents such as for example phyllosilicates (bentonite, attapulgite), diatomaceous earth or else synthetic magnesium silicates (such as AMBOSOL&#xae; or BriteSorb&#xae;). Such purification processes are described in RO 118433, U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,475, EP-A 0693513 and EP-A 1751213. Phase separation processes in principle represent a further possibility for separating catalyst residues, but the water solubilities of the polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols are generally too high for phase separation processes to be carried out effectively. Phase separation processes are described, for example, in WO-A 0114456, JP-A 6-157743, WO-A 9620972 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,823,145.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols according to the invention may be admixed with antioxidants (for example based on phenol derivatives and/or based on aromatic amines). If an alkali metal hydroxide is used to catalyze the alkylene oxide addition onto the employed starter compounds it is advisable to add such antioxidants only after neutralization/removal of these catalyst traces since this makes it possible to obtain less strongly discolored polyoxyalkylene polyether ester polyols.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the power input introduced is between 0.8 and 5 W/1, preferably between 0.8 and 3 W/1, based on the liquid volume after termination of step (iv), i.e. after completed metered addition of all reactants.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Good mixing of the reactor contents in all reaction phases should generally be ensured through configuration and use of commercially available stirrer units, wherein suitable stirrer units here especially include stirrers arranged over one or more levels or stirrer types which act over the full fill height (see, for example, Handbuch Apparate; Vulkan-Verlag Essen, 1st ed. (1990), p. 188-208). Of particular technical relevance here is a mixing power which is introduced on average over the entire reactor contents and at the end of the metered addition of all reactants is in the range from 0.8 to 5 W/1, preferably in the range from 0.8 to 3 W/1, with correspondingly higher local power inputs in the region of the stirrer units themselves and possibly in the case of relatively low fill levels. In order to achieve an optimal stirring effect, combinations of baffles (e.g. flat or tubular flow baffles) and cooling coils (or cooling candles) may be arranged within the reactor according to the general prior art and may also extend across the vessel base. The stirring power of the mixing apparatus may also be varied as a function of the fill level during the metered addition phase to ensure a particularly high energy input in critical reaction phases. For example, it may be advantageous to particularly vigorously mix solids-containing dispersions which may be present at the start of the reaction, for example, in the case of use of sucrose. Moreover, particularly when solid H-functional starter compounds are used, it should be ensured through the selection of the stirrer unit that sufficient dispersion of the solids in the reaction mixture is assured. It is preferable here to employ stirrer stages with close base clearance and particularly stirrer units suitable for suspension. In addition, the stirrer geometry should contribute to reducing foaming of reaction products. Foaming of reaction mixtures can be observed, for example, after the end of the metered addition and post-reaction phases when residual alkylene oxides are additionally removed under vacuum at absolute pressures in the range from 1 to 500 mbar. For such cases, stirrer units that achieve continuous mixing of the liquid surface have been found to be suitable. As required, the stirrer shaft has a base bearing and optionally further support bearings within the vessel. The stirrer shaft can be driven from the top or bottom (with a central or eccentric arrangement of the shaft).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is alternatively also possible to achieve the necessary mixing and the necessary mixing power input exclusively via a pumped circulation circuit passing through a heat exchanger or to operate this pumped circulation circuit as a further mixing component in addition to the stirrer unit, thus effecting pumped circulation of the reactor contents as required (typically 1 to 50 times per hour). The specific mixing power introduced by means of pumped circulation, for example through an external heat exchanger or, in the case of recycling into the reactor, through a nozzle or injector, likewise amounts to values averaging from 0.8 to 5 W/1, preferably 0.8 to 3 W/1, wherein this is based on the liquid volume present in the reactor and the pumped circulation system after completed metered addition of all reactants.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is recommended not only to perform the preparation of the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols according to the invention in the absence of oxygen but also to handle and to store finished, salt-free and antioxidant-stabilized polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols according to the invention in the absence of oxygen. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are, for example, noble gases or nitrogen or carbon dioxide, noble gases or nitrogen being particularly suitable. The prevention of ingress of oxygen very substantially prevents further product discoloration and this is especially true at elevated temperatures which are generally utilized to facilitate handling of the finished products by lowering product viscosity. An inert gas atmosphere moreover results in the formation of markedly fewer peroxide groups which, through cleavage of polyether bonds present, contribute to the formation of further low molecular weight oxidative degradation products, for example acetaldehyde, methanol, formic acid, formic esters, acetone and formaldehyde. It is thus possible to minimize reductions in quality, lower the content of volatile organic compounds and prevent odour nuisance and impairment to health during the storage of the finished products.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention further provides polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols obtainable by the process according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, the resulting polyoxyalkylene polyester polyol has an OH number between 100 and 300 mg KOH/g, wherein the OH number is determined according to the specification of DIN 53240.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The number-average OH functionality of the polyoxyalkylene polyester polyols obtainable by the process according to the invention is preferably at least 1.8, particularly preferably 1.8 to 3, wherein the number-average functionality F<sub>n </sub>is calculated according to the following formula (1),</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Fn</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msubsup>         <mo>&#x2211;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mn>1</mn>         </mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mi>n</mi>         </mrow>        </msubsup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>f</mi>           <mi>i</mi>          </msub>          <mo>&#xb7;</mo>          <msub>           <mi>m</mi>           <mi>i</mi>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <msubsup>         <mo>&#x2211;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>j</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mn>1</mn>         </mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>j</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mi>m</mi>         </mrow>        </msubsup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>f</mi>           <mi>j</mi>          </msub>          <mo>&#xb7;</mo>          <msub>           <mi>m</mi>           <mi>j</mi>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msubsup>         <mo>&#x2211;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mn>1</mn>         </mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mi>n</mi>         </mrow>        </msubsup>        <mrow>         <mi>m</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>i</mi>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <msubsup>         <mo>&#x2211;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>j</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mn>1</mn>         </mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>j</mi>          <mo>=</mo>          <mi>m</mi>         </mrow>        </msubsup>        <mi>mj</mi>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">where f<sub>i </sub>is the H-functionality of the H-functional starter compound i and m<sub>i </sub>is the number of moles employed of H-functional starter compound i and f<sub>j </sub>is the H-functionality of the fatty acid ester j and mm is the number of moles of fatty acid ester j employed.
