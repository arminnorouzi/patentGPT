id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an axial piston pump, in particular an axial piston pump with inclined plate for high pressures and usable with low viscosity fluids.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Axial piston pumps with inclined plate generally comprise a head in which there is at least partially a plurality of cylinders arranged in parallel to each other and in each of which a piston slides to pump a liquid. Said cylinders are connected to a liquid source to pump through a suction channel, usually comprising a primary duct and a plurality of branch ducts that place the primary duct in fluid communication with the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Axial pumps with inclined plate for high pressures with three pistons are known, which on one hand are of relatively simple design and construction, particularly as regards the construction and design of the suction channels, and on the other hand have significant fluctuations in flow rate during operation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention is to make available an axial piston pump with reduced delivery flow rate fluctuation which is at the same time of compact and efficient construction in fluid-dynamic terms, all within a rational and affordable solution. Such object is achieved by the features of the invention indicated in the independent claim.

solution makes available an axial piston pump with reduced delivery flow rate fluctuation which is robust and compact and particularly efficient in fluid-dynamic terms.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">According to an aspect of the invention, the suction channel may be made in the head.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">In this way the axial compactness of the pump is improved and the assembly

opposing each other, each one with respective curved surfaces each one having respectively a single transversal axis of curvature in relation to a plane perpendicular to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">With this solution, the branch ducts are simpler and cheaper to make compared to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">For example, the curved surfaces

water.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">For example, the axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032;,<b>1</b>&#x2033;,<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; is of the type fitted with a fixed inclination rotating plate, as better described below. Furthermore it is of the type fitted with automatic valves for controlling the pumping flow.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032;,<b>1</b>&#x2033;,<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; may comprise a crankcase <b>5</b>, a rotating inclined plate <b>10</b>, adapted to receive a rotating motion from a crankshaft external to the axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032;,<b>1</b>&#x2033;,<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and for example a fixing flange <b>6</b> fixed to a motor equipped with the said crankshaft.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">The inclined plate <b>10</b> is housed in the crankcase <b>5</b>, it is rotatably associated to it on a pivot axis A, and for example comprises a flat annular surface <b>15</b> lying on an inclined plane in relation to the pivot axis A. In particular, the inclined plate is rotatably associated by a bearing to the flange <b>6</b>, which is bolted to the crankcase <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032;,<b>1</b>&#x2033;,<b>1</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; comprises a head <b>20</b> fixed to the crankcase <b>5</b>, or fixed without residual degrees of freedom to the crankcase <b>5</b>, in which there is a plurality of cylinders <b>25</b>, that is cylindrical holes, each one adapted to contain respective liquid pumping chambers <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">The head <b>20</b> can be made in a unitary body, that can be obtained by processing a single body obtained from the solidification of a single cast or injection of material into a mould.
