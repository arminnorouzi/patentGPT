It is expected to enable a fully connected society, in which a rich set of Use Cases&#x2014;some of them are still not yet conceptualized&#x2014;will be supported from the Enhanced Mobile Broadband through media distribution, Massive Machine Type of Communication (M-MTC) to the Mission Critical Services (Critical Machine Type of Communication&#x2014;C-MTC).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The C-MTC Use Case group covers a big set of applications, but most of them can be characterized by low latency and high reliability, as well as high availability. It should be mentioned that although the low latency is an important criterion in numerous Use Cases, high reliability is expected to be a basic requirement in a much wider range of services. For example, low latency and high reliability may be very important factors, for example, in Industry (Factory) Automation Use Cases (e.g., high speed motion control, packaging, printing, etc.), and several special subtasks of Smart Grid service. In the above Use Cases, the guarantees on latency and reliability requirements together may provide/guarantee sufficient service quality. However, high reliability is still important in such Use Cases, where relaxed requirements on latency (e.g. higher delay and/or higher jitter can be tolerated) may be allowed. Illustrative examples could include the following Use Cases, such as Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), remote control (with or without haptic feedback), robotized manufacturing, Smart Grid, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Drone Controlling, tele-surgery, etc. In these cases, extreme low latency may not be a crucial factor, but the high (and in some cases, the extreme high) reliability of the connectivity between the application server and the C-MTC device may be the most important requirement. In summary, reliability may be an important requirement for Use Cases with low latency requirements, but the reliability, in itself, could be a basic characteristic of C-MTC services.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there continues to exist a need for improved reliability in wireless communication networks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some embodiments of inventive concepts, a method may be performed by a network entity of a wireless communication network. A first PDU session for a wireless terminal may be communicated using a first NodeB base station and a first user plane function (UPF) entity. A second PDU session for the wireless terminal may be established using a second NodeB base station and a second UPF entity. Moreover, the first and second PDU sessions may be established for the wireless terminal using the first and second NodeB base stations so that the first and second PDU sessions are provided concurrently using dual connectivity DC to provide redundant data paths for communication of data for the wireless terminal through the wireless communication network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some other embodiments of inventive concepts, a method may be provided to operate a wireless communication network including a first NodeB base station, a second NodeB base station, a first user plane function (UPF) entity, and a second UFP entity. Communication of a plurality of data frames for a wireless terminal may be provided using a first PDU session using the first NodeB base station and the first UPF entity. Communication of the plurality of data frames for the wireless terminal may also be provided using a second PDU session using the second NodeB base station and the second UPF entity so that the first and second PDU sessions provide redundant data paths for communication of the plurality of data frames using dual connectivity DC for the wireless terminal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some embodiments of inventive concepts, independent user plane paths may thus be set up over the radio interface to provide redundancy. This may increase reliability of a communication, as communication may continue without any delay in case of single failures in the user plane. For example, in case of temporary radio link problems due to interference or loss of coverage on one path, the communication may continue on the other path, and/or a wired link in a fixed part of the network on one path may break but the communication may continue on the other path uninterrupted.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosure and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate certain non-limiting embodiments of inventive concepts.

It may then be possible to set up disjoint paths from these UEs. An approach is discussed in International Publication No. WO2017137075 A1 (also referred to as Reference [2]), and this approach presents a way to select different RAN entities for UEs based on a static grouping, whereas an approach in International PCT Application No. PCT/IB2017/052739 (also referred to as Reference [3]) describes a dynamic selection to provide/guarantee that the UEs in the same device use independent RAN entities. The approach in international PCT Application No. PCT/EP2016/064214 A1 (also referred to as Reference [4]) addresses the selection of CN entities in a way that the different UEs in the device can use different CN entities.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another approach may be to use the Dual Connectivity (DC) feature of 5G or 4G/LTE. Dual connectivity allows a single UE that is suitably equipped with two transceivers to have user plane connectivity with two base stations, while it is connected to a single base station only in the control plane. 3GPP TS 36.300 V14.4.0 (also referred to as Reference [5]) and 3GPP TS 38.300 V2.0.0 (also referred to as Reference [6]) provide more information on dual connectivity in 4G/LTE and 5G. The use of dual connectivity for redundant data transmission is described in 3GPP TS 38.300 V2.0.0 (also referred to as Reference [7]).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The use of two UEs in a single device may imply practical limitations. It may require special purpose-built devices that incorporate two UEs with the additional integration and configuration effort in the UE. This may not be readily available in all UEs, and requiring the integration of two UEs may in certain cases bear unreasonable additional costs. Furthermore, support for multiple UEs per device may have to be coordinated between device vendors and network suppliers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With the single-UE approach using a dual connectivity approach, the UE may still be required to have two transceivers to be capable of communicating with two base stations, but a single UE with only a single identity may be used. As dual connectivity is a standardized feature, it is expected to be available in the UEs, hence no/little additional complexity or integration effort may be required on the device side. Support for dual connectivity is also expected to be available in networks, both in RAN (Radio Access Network) and CN (Core Network).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">However, there may still be a drawback of using dual connectivity for redundancy as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a 5G setup (see, 3GPP TS 23.501 V2.0.1, also referred to as Reference [8] for a description of the 5G architecture entities), but the same/similar concept can apply to 4G/LTE as well. Dual connectivity can be used for redundancy between the UE and the MgNB (Master gNB), provided on the PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer. At the same time, the fixed transport network between the 5G entities can also apply redundancy, e.g., using the TSN/DetNet approach. Redundancy can also be provided using TSN/DetNet above the 5G network. In this way, there is a redundant user plane path in both in 5G radio and above the 5G network; but the MgNB-UPF connection may not provide redundancy. Note that the UPF may be collocated with the MgNB, but that may still result in the MgNB/UPF being a single point of failure in the user plane. Therefore, it may be important to address this issue, and have two disjoint user plane paths in the user plane all the way from end to end.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to some embodiments of inventive concepts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the RAN (Radio Access Network, e.g., 5G Network) may be set up using dual connectivity over the air interface and the CN (Core Network) in a new way, such that one traffic flow T<b>1</b> traverses the MgNB and UPF<b>1</b> (User Plane Function <b>1</b>), while another traffic flow T<b>2</b> of the same UE traverses the SgNB and UPF<b>2</b> (User Plane Function <b>2</b>). This setup may not be currently possible with dual connectivity, because in existing approaches, either the MgNB is an anchor point of the user plane making other disjoint paths impossible/impractical, or alternatively, there may be a single anchor point in the core network (see, Reference [5] section 4.9.3.2 for current user plane options).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to some embodiments of inventive concepts, the following operations/elements may be used:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0046">Triggering multiple PDU (Protocol Data Unit) sessions per UE for redundant traffic handling;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0047">The RAN gets information from the CN that it should apply redundant user plane setup, and which traffic flows should be separated in a redundant way;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0048">Based on the information received from the CN, the RAN sets up dual connectivity whenever applicable, so that the redundant flows are separated;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0049">The CN selects different UPF entities for the redundant traffic flows; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0050">The UPFs in the CN are informed about the RAN user plane endpoint that they should use.<br/>For the end device, the two redundant traffic flows may appear as two different Ethernet interfaces (as an example), and existing TSN solutions for setting up redundant paths, with frame replication and elimination, may be used.

This may significantly increase a reliability of the communication, as communication may continue without any delay in case of single failures in the user plane (e.g., in case of temporary radio link problems due to interference or loss of coverage, the communication may continue on the other path). Moreover, in a fixed part of the network, a wired link may break, but the communication may continue on the other path uninterrupted.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">Setting up multiple PDU sessions for redundancy reasons can be triggered either from the terminal UE, or from the network.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">According to some embodiments, the UE may trigger setup of multiple PDU sessions. If the UE triggers setup of multiple PDU sessions, the UE initiates the setup of the second (or additional) PDU sessions for redundancy reasons. This can be based on per UE configuration indicating the need for additional redundancy. Such UE configuration can be provided in advance, or via SIM configuration, or using OTA (Over The Air) configuration methods that is dynamically provided to the UE.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">The trigger to set up an additional PDU session for redundancy may also come from the upper layers (e.g., an Ethernet/IP end host may indicate via an API option to the UE that another PDU session for redundancy reasons is needed, which results in a UE request for a new PDU session). Note that the end host may in turn also be triggered from a central network controller via the air interface (i.e., an already established PDU session).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">As an optional feature, it may be possible to defer the setup of additional PDU sessions until Dual Connectivity (DC) is set up. This can be realized based on a configurable timer, so that a minimal period of time is kept after the setup of the first PDU session before a second PDU session is attempted, so that the time period is configured in such a way that it is typically sufficient for setting up DC. Alternatively, the deferral can be done until an explicit indication is received over RRC from the MgNB that DC has been set up.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">According to some other embodiments, the network may trigger the setup of additional PDU session for redundancy. The network may have information about the need for redundancy either based on subscription or local configuration, or based on UE indication (which may be encoded into the DNN). Alternatively, the network may also get information about the need for redundancy based on explicit indication from a central controller in the local network (e.g., &#x201c;TSN MNGR&#x201d;), indicating that a given UE or set of UEs require redundant treatment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">The network trigger may take place immediately at the establishment of the first PDU session. For example, when the PDU Session Establishment Accept message is sent back to the UE, it may include an indication to the UE to set up an additional PDU session. Alternatively, a trigger with an indication to set up an additional PDU session may be sent separately with an explicit message to the UE. The message to the UE may also include some parameters of the PDU session, such as a DNN (Data Network Name).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">Similarly, as with the UE triggered option, it may be possible to defer the setup of the additional PDU session until DC has been set up. This can be done based on a timer, so that a configurable amount of time must pass after the first PDU session has been set up. Or alternatively, triggering the second PDU session can be deferred until the CN gets an indication from RAN that DC has been set up.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">A need for redundant handling may be indicated to RAN as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">In some systems, Dual Connectivity DC may be under RAN control, meaning that it is the RAN's responsibility to decide whether or not to apply DC, and how to configure it. According to some embodiments of inventive concepts, however, the redundant user plane handling may require the use of DC whenever applicable, hence the CN may need to instruct the RAN to apply it. This may be accomplished in several ways discussed below:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0061">The CN may send an indication to RAN to apply DC with a different gNB for each PDU session, using a new information element on a per UE basis.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0062">The CN may send a Redundancy Sequence Number, RSN, for each PDU session, so that whenever possible, RAN tries to use different gNBs for each PDU session that has a different number. This could be more flexible, as it could be possible to direct RAN to either use different or the same gNB for two PDU sessions (where some PDU sessions may not require redundancy).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0063">The CN may define groups of PDU sessions, and indicate which group a given PDU session belongs to. PDU sessions in the same group are preferably served by different gNBs for redundancy. It may be possible for a PDU session to not belong to any of the groups, in which case they can be served by any gNB (no redundancy required).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0064">The CN may indicate explicitly which gNB (i.e., the MgNB or an SgNB) should handle a given PDU session, using an identifier or index of a gNB. This is especially well suited to local network cases where the UPF is close to or collocated with the gNB. In that case, the RAN should use the gNB close to the corresponding UPF, rather than another gNB.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0065">Instead of providing information on a per PDU session basis, the CN may also provide the information on a per flow basis as well, using the per flow QoS marking. Then the RAN can map the flows to one or the other gNB and corresponding radio bearer.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0066">The RAN may be informed that different UPFs are used for the different PDU sessions via checking the UPF tunnel endpoint addresses. For example, in the case of a local network, RAN could use the gNB that is close to or collocated with the UPF, as determined by its address. Detecting different UPFs (or special address ranges of UPFs) may also provide a trigger for the RAN to establish redundancy via the use of DC.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0057" num="0067">As an alternative, the information about which PDU sessions to handle redundantly via DC may also be provided by the UE to the RAN. Similar information as described above may be sent from the UE to the MgNB using RRC signaling. However, even in this case the RAN should receive information from the CN to indicate whether the UE is authorized to request redundancy based on DC, so that the network operator can remain in control of using DC for redundancy purposes. Also in this case, the CN may need to provide different UPFs for the PDU sessions. For this, the UE may also indicate on the NAS level which PDU sessions to handle redundantly.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0068">As will be discussed below with respect to dynamic selection of an SgNB, it may be possible that the CN needs to request RAN to set up DC even before the corresponding PDU sessions are established. This may be requested via an explicit trigger.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0069">Normally, the selection of an SgNB is under RAN control in the MgNB, and the MgNB may also change the selection (e.g., if RAN radio conditions so dictate). Changing the SgNB may be problematic, however, since it may lead to non-redundant paths, and also it may require the UPF to be changed, since the UPF selection can be done based on the SgNB selection. Not all deployments may be able to cope with such consequences of SgNB change (or the removal of the SgNB). Hence, it may also be indicated to RAN, possibly using an explicit indication, that the selected SgNB should not be changed while the UE is connected. A network which is not able to handle such SgNB changes may send such an indication.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0070">If there is a need to change (or remove) the SgNB (e.g., due to radio conditions) while the CN is not able to cope with it, then the RAN (i.e., MgNB) may send an indication about the needed SgNB change to the CN, and the CN can then decide to release the given PDU session. The CN may also indicate the need to re-establish the PDU session, and in that case the re-established PDU session may use the new SgNB.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0071">Selection of UPFs for the PDU sessions will now be discussed.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0072">Two main aspects may need to be considered for selecting UPFs. First, in order to provide/guarantee independent paths, the UPFs may need to be different for the different PDU sessions. Second, the UPFs should be close to the respective MgNB or SgNB to provide/guarantee efficient, short paths, and/or to simplify the management of the independent paths and provide that the underlying transport network links are independent for the MgNB-UPF<b>1</b> and SgNB-UPF<b>2</b> connectivity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0073">There can be two approaches to provide/ensure that the UPFs for the multiple PDU sessions are separate. One approach is based on using a single SMF for the PDU sessions, and one approach does not require the SMFs to be the same. Both approaches are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0074">Single SMFs may be provided for PDU sessions.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0075">Once providing that the PDU sessions for the UE use the same SMF, that SMF can provide/guarantee that different UPFs are selected. There could be a number of ways for that to happen.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0076">One part of the Data Network Name DNN may indicate to the Access and Mobility Management Function AMF that the PDU session is part of a set of PDU sessions which should be handled redundantly. Another part of the DNN may uniquely identify the set of PDU sessions handled redundantly for the given UE (e.g., a DNN may take this value: session<b>1</b>.group<b>1</b>.reliable.localindustry.org for one PDU session and this value: session<b>2</b>.group<b>1</b>.reliable.localindustry.org for one PDU session for another PDU session. The part reliable.localindustry.org indicates that this is a PDU session to be handled redundantly. Group<b>1</b> indicates the group of PDU sessions that realize the redundancy and need a common SMF. Session<b>1</b> and session<b>2</b> indicate the PDU sessions within the group.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0077">Alternatively, a special field may indicate in the PDU Session Request the need for redundant handling, and another special field may identify the group of PDU sessions that belong together for redundant handling, and yet another special field may identify the PDU session within the group of PDU sessions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0078">The AMF entity may be responsible for selecting the SMF. The AMF can select the same AMF for the PDU sessions in the same redundancy group once the information is available to the AMF using the DNN or special fields.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0079">According to some embodiments, no single SMFs may be provided for PDU sessions.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0080">If the AMF does not guarantee the same SMF for the PDU sessions, there may still be ways to make sure that the UPFs are selected separate.

For that reason, the UPFs for the PDU sessions may initially not be disjoint, and it may take some time before a new UPF is selected that is different. This approach also shows how an SgNB change later on may be handled, something that may apply to other embodiments as well, and an SgNB change may need to be reflected in an UPF change.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0101">Note that the possibility of UPF change may need different handling for Ethernet and IP based approaches. In an Ethernet based approach, there may not be a need to maintain a single PDU session anchor point, since the Ethernet network may learn that the UE is reachable at another location based on, for example, MAC learning. In the case of Ethernet, it may be possible to use a local UPF as a point of interconnect to the Ethernet network, and change it as needed.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0102">On the other hand, for IP based sessions, it may not be possible to change the PDU session anchor. Instead, the PDU session may be released and a new PDU session may be established in case the UPF acting as the session anchor needs to be changed. This is also a possible approach according to some embodiments of inventive concepts, even though it might not be very efficient. As another alternative, it may be possible to assign a more central PDU session anchor which does not change during a session even if an intermediate UPF is changed. However, having multiple UPFs for a single PDU session may not be very efficient, either.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0103">For this embodiment, it may be possible for the CN to receive notification about the changes in the SgNB, and update the user plane path accordingly. This is shown in the signaling chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref> below, where UPF<b>1</b> is initially used for the second PDU session as well. Once DC is set up, the UPF<b>2</b> is selected based on the location of the chosen SgNB for the second PDU session, and hence SMF<b>2</b> changes PDU Session <b>2</b> to UPF<b>2</b>. (Here SMF<b>1</b> and SMF<b>2</b> refer to the SMF responsible for PDU session <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively&#x2014;in this case the is no assumption that the two SMFs are always the same.)</p><p id="p-0084" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref> provide a message diagram where RAN changes trigger a UPF change when DC is established.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0105">In operations <b>1</b>-<b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, PDU session <b>1</b> is established, as described in section 4.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 V2.0.0 (also referred to as Reference [9]), where the location of MgNB is used to select UPF<b>1</b>. In operations <b>13</b>-<b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, PDU session <b>2</b> is established in a similar way, where the same MgNB is indicated as the location as DC is not yet set up. In operation <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, DC is set up, which may require some time, including UE measurement reports sent to MgNB. In operation <b>26</b>, a modification is indicated from MgNB towards the CN that SgNB is used for the user plane of session <b>2</b>. Based on a mapping of the location of the SgNB, it is suggested to use UPF<b>2</b> instead of UPF<b>1</b> for session <b>2</b>. As a consequence, SMF<b>2</b> establishes UPF<b>2</b>, and MgNB is informed in operations <b>27</b>-<b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.

Further, the change of UPF can complicate the management of the disjoint path&#x2014;in case of a TSN/DetNet network where the paths are managed by a central controller &#x201c;TSN/DetNet MNGR&#x201d;, that central controller would have to detect&#x2014;based on reporting from the network entities&#x2014;that the UE gets connected to a new UPF, and update the path accordingly.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0107">According to some embodiments of inventive concepts, PDU session re-establishment may be triggered by an SgNB change.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0108">As noted above, a change in the SgNB (e.g., due to DC setup) may require a UPF change which may be complex to handle in some deployments. An indication may be sent to RAN that SgNB change should be avoided, nevertheless in some cases this may still be needed due to changes in the radio conditions.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0109">As another possibility compared to UPF change for the ongoing PDU session, the CN can decide to release the PDU session and request the establishment of a new one in case of SgNB changes. Given that there is another PDU session that can carry traffic due to redundancy, this re-establishment might not cause a packet loss.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0110">The approach of re-establishing the PDU session may be well suited for an IP based solution, where&#x2014;as opposed to Ethernet approach&#x2014;it is not possible to change the anchoring UPF which owns the IP address.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0111">This approach is shown in the message diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C</figref>.

Once DC is set up, RAN indicates it to the CN (e.g., by signaling from MgNB to AMF to SMF). This approach may be simpler, as there may be no/reduced need to change the UPF later on. This approach may also simplify interaction with the transport network and the task of the TSN/DetNet MNGR.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0116">This signaling may indicate the selected SgNB which is then mapped to the UPF; or alternatively, the RAN may indicate the preferred UPF corresponding to the selected SgNB. The indication from RAN to the CN may then trigger a message to the UE to set up the second PDU session. (Alternatively, the MgNB may directly trigger the UE via RAN signaling to set up the second PDU session.) The SgNB or UPF to be used may also be indicated during the PDU session establishment (or this information could be queried from the MgNB during the PDU session establishment).
