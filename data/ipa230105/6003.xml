In the accompanying drawings, thicknesses of layers and sizes of regions are enlarged for clarity. Thus, variations in shape relative to the accompanying drawings due to, for example, manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances may be envisaged. Therefore, the exemplary embodiments should not be construed to be limited to the shapes of regions shown herein, but to include deviations in shape due to, for example, manufacturing. For example, an etched region shown in a rectangular shape generally has a curved feature. Therefore, the regions shown in the accompanying drawings are schematic in nature, and their shapes are not intended to show actual shapes of the regions in a device, and are not intended to limit the scope of the exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the related art, for a large-sized display panel such as a vehicle-mounted display panel or a notebook, due to a large light-emitting area of the display panel, a large current is required to drive a light-emitting device. On this basis, cathodes of light-emitting devices in an electroluminescent display panel are formed into a whole layer by evaporation (that is, the light-emitting devices share a whole cathode layer). Moreover, in order to ensure a light extraction efficiency of the light-emitting device, the cathode layer is usually made thin, which results in a large sheet resistance of the cathode layer. In this way, a brightness of an end of the electroluminescent display panel proximate to an integrated circuit is higher than a brightness of an end of the electroluminescent display panel away from the integrated circuit, thereby resulting in a non-uniform display.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Based on this, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display substrate.
