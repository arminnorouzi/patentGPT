an energy generating means without fear of environmental contamination and exhaustion. If solar cells are used outside such as the roof of a building, generally, a module type of the solar cells is used. In order to obtain a crystalline solar cell module when manufacturing a solar cell module, protection sheet for solar cell module (surface side protection member)/solar cell encapsulant/crystalline solar cell device/solar cell encapsulant/protection sheet for solar cell module (back side protection member) are stacked in order. In addition, when manufacturing a thin film-based solar cell module, thin film-type solar cell device/solar cell encapsulant/protection sheet for solar cell module (back side protection member) are stacked in order. As the encapsulant of the solar cell, generally, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer or ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer having excellent transparency, flexibility, adhesiveness, etc. is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, the solar cell module is generally used at the outside for a long time, and defects including performance degradation due to various external stimuli are consistently observed. Particularly, the resolution of potential induced degradation (PID) phenomenon found in high-powered power plant types is urgently needed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a large-capacity generating system for obtaining high voltage by connecting multiple solar cell modules, the volume resistance of an encapsulant decreases according to the increase of the temperature and humidity at an installed place, and a potential difference is generated between the cell of the solar cells and a frame. At last, toward the end of an array of multiple solar cell modules connected in series, the potential difference between the cell of the solar cells and the frame increases. In the presence of such potential difference, leakage current may be generated, and generating efficiency may be rapidly reduced, and this is called as PID phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on such backgrounds, the development of an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer which may improve volume resistance without degrading light transmittance and may consistently prevent PID phenomenon is required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">(Patent Document 1) Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 2010-258439</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a composition for an encapsulant film showing high volume resistance and excellent insulation by including an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer maintaining a narrow degree of molecular weight distribution and showing high crystallinity distribution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the composition for an encapsulant film and an encapsulant film manufactured using the composition for an encapsulant film.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To solve the above tasks, the present invention provides a composition for an encapsulant film including an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer satisfying the following conditions (a) to (d):</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(a) a density is 0.85 to 0.89 g/cc;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(b) molecular weight distribution is 1.8 to 2.3;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(c) a melt index (MI, 190&#xb0; C., 2.16 kg load conditions) is 1 to 100 dg/min; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">(d) a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a crystallization peak shown during measuring a crystallization temperature by cross-fractionation chromatography (CFC) is 15 or more.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the present invention provides an encapsulant film including the composition for an encapsulant film.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention utilizes an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer having high crystallinity distribution and a small free volume, and shows excellent volume resistance and light transmittance, and accordingly, may be widely used for various uses in electric and electronic industrial fields.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail to assist the understanding of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be understood that words or terms used in the present disclosure and claims shall not be interpreted as the meaning defined in commonly used dictionaries.

Particularly, for preparing the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention, transition metal compounds represented by Formula 1 and Formula 2 are mixed and used as a catalyst. The introduction of an alpha-olefin-based monomer into the transition metal compound represented by Formula 1 is difficult due to the structural characteristics of the catalyst, and a copolymer of a high-density region tends to be prepared, and a large amount of alpha-olefin may be introduced into the transition metal compound represented by Formula 2, a polymer (elastomer) in a very low-density region may be prepared. Accordingly, if each of the two transition metal compounds is used solely, copolymerization properties of mixing and introducing an alpha-olefin-based monomer are different.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer of the present invention, prepared by using the mixture composition as a catalyst is a copolymer in which both a low-density region in which a large amount of an alpha-olefin-based monomer is mixed and introduced and a high-density region in which a small amount of an alpha-olefin-based monomer is mixed and introduced, are present, and have wide crystallinity distribution and a small free volume, and accordingly, charge mobility is low, and electrical insulation is excellent.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention is a polymer having a low density in a range of 0.85 to 0.89 g/cc, and in this case, the density may mean a density measured according to ASTM F-792. More particularly, the density may be 0.850 g/cc or more, 0.860 g/cc or more, or 0.870 g/cc or more, or 0.874 g/cc or more, and may be 0.890 g/cc or less, or 0.880 g/cc or less, 0.878 g/cc or less.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the density deviates from the range, problems of degrading the volume resistance or light transmittance of the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer may arise.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally, the density of the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer is influenced by the type and amount of a monomer used for polymerization, a polymerization degree, etc., and is largely influenced by the amount of a comonomer in case of a copolymer. In this case, if the amount of the comonomer increases, an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer of a low density may be prepared, and the amount of the comonomer introduced into the copolymer may be dependent on the intrinsic copolymerization properties of a catalyst.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention is a copolymer prepared using the compounds represented by Formula 1 and Formula 2 as catalysts, and has a low density as described above, and as a result, excellent processability may be shown.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention has narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) in a range of 1.8 to 2.3. More particularly, the molecular weight distribution may be 1.80 or more, 1.90 or more, and 2.30 or less, 2.20 or less, 2.10 or less, 2.05 or less.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Generally, if two or more types of monomers are polymerized, molecular weight distribution increases, and as a result, impact strength and mechanical properties are reduced, and there is possibility of generating blocking phenomenon. Particularly, since the polymerization properties of a monomer are different according to the catalyst, the molecular weight of a polymer finally prepared may be influenced by the type of the catalyst. If two or more types of catalysts are mixed and used in polymerization reaction, and if the difference of the polymerization properties of the catalysts is large, there are problems of increasing the molecular weight distribution of a polymer.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to reduce the molecular weight distribution to prevent the degradation of the crosslinking properties, impact strength, mechanical properties, etc. of a copolymer, a suitable amount of hydrogen may be injected during polymerization reaction to prevent the generation of optional &#x3b2;-hydride elimination reaction in a polymer chain and induce uniform termination reaction, and in this case, the weight average molecular weight and melt index of the copolymer tend to decrease according to the injection of hydrogen. Accordingly, appropriate catalyst type and hydrogen injection amount are determined in ranges for achieving both the intrinsic properties of a catalyst structure influencing the weight average molecular weight and the melt index and the reducing effects of molecular weight distribution according to the injection of hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Considering the above-described points, in the present invention, since a transition metal compound represented by Formula 1 and a transition metal compound represented by Formula 2 are mixed and used as a catalyst, and an optimum amount of hydrogen is injected during preparation, the above-described range of narrow molecular weight distribution may be obtained, the degradation of crosslinking properties, impact strength, mechanical properties, etc. may be prevented, and high volume resistance and electrical insulation may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular weight (Mn) are polystyrene conversion molecular weights analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the molecular weight distribution may be calculated from the ratio of Mw/Mn.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer may have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 40,000 to 150,000 g/mol. More particularly, the weight average molecular weight may be 45,000 g/mol or more, 50,000 g/mol or more, or 60,000 g/mol or more, and 130,000 g/mol or less, 100,000 g/mol or less, or 90,000 g/mol or less.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention has a meld index (MI, 190&#xb0; C., 2.16 kg load conditions) of 1 to 100 dg/min. Particularly, the melt index may be 1 dg/min or more, 2 dg/min or more, 3 dg/min or more, or 4 dg/min or more, and 100 dg/min or less, 20 dg/min or less, or 15 dg/min or less.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the melt index is less than 1 dg/min, a production rate may be reduced due to high load, and if the melt index is greater than 100 dg/min, there are problems in that the volume resistance or light transmittance of the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer may be degraded, or film molding is difficult, and the use of an encapsulant composition for a solar cell is unsuitable.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer may have a melt flow rate ratio (MFRR, MI<sub>10</sub>/MI<sub>2.16</sub>) which is a value of melt index (MI<sub>10</sub>) measured at 190&#xb0; C. and 10 kg load conditions with respect to the melt index (MI<sub>2.16</sub>) measured at 190&#xb0; C. and 2.16 kg load conditions of 8.0 or less, particularly, 4.0 or more, 4.2 or more, 4.5 or more, and 8.0 or less, 7.0 or less, 6.8 or less. The melt flow rate ratio is an index of the degree of long chain branching of a copolymer, and the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer of the present invention satisfies the melt flow rate ratio together with the above-described physical properties and has excellent physical properties, and thus, may be suitably applied to an encapsulant composition for a solar cell with excellent physical properties.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Particularly, if the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer of the present invention has a low melt index of 1 to 100 dg/min as described above, the melt flow rate ratio may be low and 8.0 or less. Since the copolymer of the present invention has such a low melt index and melt flow rate ratio, the copolymer is characterized in having a high molecular weight, the small long chain branch content, and an excellent crosslinking degree.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, it is difficult for the conventional copolymer to have such a low melt index and melt flow rate ratio, and at the same time, have a high full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a crystallization peak, which will be explained later, of 15 or more and have wide crystallinity distribution, but in the present invention, since a copolymer is prepared by using the compounds represented by Formula 1 and Formula 2 as catalysts and an appropriate amount of hydrogen, and polymerization is terminated by the injection of hydrogen, the terminal of the copolymer is a saturated state, a long chain branch is not formed, and the characteristics of a low melt flow rate ratio are achieved. Also, a copolymer having wide crystallinity distribution is prepared by using two types of catalysts having different crystallization degree properties.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention has the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a crystallization peak shown during measuring a crystallization temperature by cross-fractionation chromatography (CFC) of 15 or more. Here, the full width at half maximum of the peak is a value derived from a crystallinity distribution graph drawn by dw/dT value in accordance with the temperature measured in bivariate distribution by cross-fractionation chromatography.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The cross-fractionation chromatography is a method combining temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) with gel filtration chromatography (GPC) and is a type of method for getting the crystallinity distribution and molecular weight distribution of a copolymer at the same time.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Particularly, a specimen solution of high temperature in which an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer is completely dissolved in a solvent is injected into a column filled with an inert carrier, the temperature of the column is lowered to attach the specimen on the surface of the filler, and the temperature of the column is gradually elevated while flowing o-dichlorobenzene in the column. The concentration of a copolymer eluted at each temperature is detected, and at the same time, the component eluted at each temperature is sent to GPC via online for each fraction to obtain a chromatogram, and after that, the molecular weight distribution of each component is calculated therefrom. In this case, since the elution temperature is elevated according to the increase of the crystallinity of the eluted component, the crystallinity distribution of the copolymer may be found by obtaining the relation of the elution temperature and the elution amount (wt %) of the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer has a high FWHM value of 15 or more, and this indicates that the crystallinity distribution of the copolymer is high. At last, the free volume in the copolymer is small, the charge mobility is low, volume resistance is high, and insulation properties are excellent.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As above, in order to prepare an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer having excellent volume resistance and light transmittance, it is important to increase the FWHM value and decrease the molecular weight distribution. The FWHM is related to the uniformity of crystallinity according to the copolymerization properties for mixing and introducing an alpha-olefin-based monomer, and the molecular weight distribution is related to the uniformity of a chain length according to the propagation rate of ethylene, etc. In a catalyst, if a part capable of reacting with a monomer is a single site, the chain propagation may be uniform, and molecular weight distribution may be narrow, but by the same principle, copolymerization properties may be uniform, crystallinity distribution may be narrow, and the FWHM value may become small. Accordingly, the preparation of a copolymer having narrow molecular weight distribution and a high FWHM of 15 or more by using one catalyst is difficult.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">On the contrary, by using two types of catalysts having similar propagation rate of ethylene but different copolymerization properties, an ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer having a high FWHM value of 15 or more and showing narrow molecular weight distribution of 1.8 to 2.3 is prepared.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Particularly, the FWHM value may be 15 or more, 16 or more, 16.5 or more, 16.8 or more, and 50 or less, 40 or less, 30 or less, 25 or less, 21 or less.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer included in the composition for an encapsulant film of the present invention may have a melting temperature (Tm) of 70&#xb0; C. or less.

By having the melting temperature in such a temperature range, excellent thermal stability may be shown.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer may have a crystallization temperature (Tc) of 70&#xb0; C. or less, 60&#xb0; C. or less, 55&#xb0; C. or less, 51&#xb0; C. or less, and 30&#xb0; C. or more, 35&#xb0; C. or more, 40&#xb0; C. or more, 42&#xb0; C. or more. Such a low crystallization temperature is due to the non-uniform distribution of a comonomer in the ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer and high crystallinity distribution, and by having the above-described temperature range, excellent volume resistance and electrical insulation may be shown.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The melting temperature and crystallization temperature may be measured using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Particularly, a copolymer is heated to 150&#xb0; C. and maintained for 5 minutes, and the temperature is reduced to 20&#xb0; C. again and elevated again. In this case, the elevating rate and decreasing rate of the temperature is controlled to 10&#xb0; C./min.

Then, the column was cooled to 95&#xb0; C. and stabilized for 45 minutes. Then, the temperature of the TREF column was decreased to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. in a rate of 0.5&#xb0; C./min and maintained at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. After that, an elution amount (mass %) was measured using an infrared spectrophotometer. Then, the temperature of the TREF column was elevated in a rate of 20&#xb0; C./min to a preset temperature and at the reached temperature, the temperature was maintained for a preset time (that is, about 27 minutes), and this work was repeated until the temperature of the TREF reached 130&#xb0; C., and the amount (mass %) of an eluted fraction in each temperature range was measured. In addition, a molecular weight (Mw) was measured by the same GPC measurement principle except for sending the eluted fraction at each temperature to a GPC column and using o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent. A FWHM value was calculated after fitting an elution amount graph according to temperature (dW/dT vs T) obtained through CFC on a program (Origin) into a Gaussian curve shape.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="8" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Density</entry><entry>MI</entry><entry>MFRR</entry><entry>Tm</entry><entry>Tc</entry><entry>Mw</entry><entry>MWD</entry><entry>FWHM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>g/cm<sup>3</sup></entry><entry>dg/min</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#xb0;
