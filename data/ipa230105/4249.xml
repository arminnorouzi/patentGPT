More particularly, exemplary embodiments relate to an OLED device having a mirror function and a touch function, and a method of manufacturing the OLED device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flat panel display (&#x201c;FPD&#x201d;) device is widely used as a display device for an electronic device due to its lightweight and thinness compared to a cathode-ray tube (&#x201c;CRT&#x201d;) display device. Typical examples of the flat panel display device include a liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) device and an organic light emitting diode (&#x201c;OLED&#x201d;) display device. Compared to the LCD, the OLED has many advantages such as a higher luminance and a wider viewing angle. In addition, the OLED display device can be made thinner than the LCD because the OLED display device does not require a backlight. In the OLED display device, electrons and holes are injected into an organic thin layer through a cathode and an anode, and then recombined in the organic thin layer to generate excitons, thereby emitting a light of a predetermined wavelength.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a mirror OLED device reflecting an image of an object (or target) that is located in the front of the OLED device by including a reflective member has been developed.

It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. In an exemplary embodiment, when the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements.

When the reflection member includes only the first reflection member, scattered reflection may be occurred at an edge of the first reflection member.
