to an airbag module provided with an airbag cushion and a case type housing for stowing the airbag cushion.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Airbag devices have generally become standard equipment in vehicles in recent years. An airbag device is a safety device which is operated in the event of an emergency such as a vehicle collision, retaining and protecting passengers utilizing an airbag cushion which expands and deploys based on gas pressure. Prior to expansion and deployment, the airbag cushion is folded or rolled into a small, stowed form for installation in various places in a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, patent Document 1 discloses a knee protection airbag device including an airbag that is folded and stowed on a lower surface side of a column cover covering a steering column and an inflator that supplies inflation gas to the airbag. In the knee protection airbag device of Patent Document 1, an airbag into which the expansion gas discharged from the inflator flows protrudes from the stowed site on the lower surface side of the column cover, and expands and deploys so as to cover the lower surface side of the column cover. This enables protecting both knees of the driver.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application 2007-203937</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an emergency, an airbag needs to rapidly expand and deploy. However, if the housing does not readily open, the expansion and deployment of the airbag will be hindered, and expanding and deploying an airbag at the desired timing will be difficult. Therefore, there has been a demand for the development of technology enabling housing to open more readily.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of these issues, an object of the present invention is to provide an airbag module where the housing opens readily during expansion and deployment of the airbag.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means to Solve the Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To resolve the problems described above, a typical configuration of an airbag module according to the present invention includes:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">a folded or rolled airbag cushion,<br/>an inflator equipped in this airbag cushion, and<br/>housing for stowing this airbag cushion, wherein<br/>the housing has a convex polygonal shape in cross-section and has an opening on the upper side, and when the airbag cushion expands and deploys, a first pair of mutually opposed side surfaces expand separating from each other,<br/>the airbag module further comprises a cover covering the opening and side surfaces of the housing, and<br/>of the cover, the upper surface portion that covers the opening of the housing is formed with a first weak portion that extends in the longitudinal direction of the upper surface portion, is weaker than the area surrounding thereof, and is cleaved by the separation of the first pair of side surfaces.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">With the configuration described above, the pair of side walls of the housing are separated by the expanding and deploying airbag cushion. As a result, the opening on the upper side of the housing opens up. Therefore, when the airbag cushion expands, the airbag cushion can be easily deployed to the outside through the opening of the housing. As the housing opens readily in this manner, the speed of airbag cushion deployment can be increased. As a result, the deployment behavior is stable and the occupant can be restrained more quickly, so that occupant injury value can be reduced. In addition, the housing opening readily improves resistance of internal pressure reduction of the cushion during airbag cushion deployment. Therefore, the amount of cushion base material is anticipated to be reduced and the housing plate thickness is anticipated to be reduced enabling potential cost reduction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Here, if a cover is used to cover the opening of the housing, the pair of side walls of the housing will separate before the airbag cushion breaks the cover and expands and deploys to the outside, especially when the height of the housing is high. Therefore, only deformation of the housing occurs, and deployment of the airbag cushion may be delayed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Therefore, in the configuration described above, the cover is provided with a first weak portion extending in the longitudinal direction of the upper surface portion of the housing. This causes the cover to cleave at the first weak portion as the airbag cushion expands and deploys. Therefore, the airbag cushion can efficiently be expanded and deployed to the outside from the first weak portion that has been cleaved. Therefore, the airbag cushion can be rapidly expanded and deployed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The convex polygonal shape described above is preferably a quadrangular shape. The aforementioned effect can be obtained by this manner of configuration as well. The &#x201c;convex polygon&#x201d; is in plan view, a polygon surrounded by three or more straight lines or curved line segments, where the inside angle of all of the angles is smaller than two right angles. Further, the cross-sectional view is defined as a plane observed in a plane orthogonal to the vertical direction from above or below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The portion of the cover that covers the mutually opposed second pair of side surfaces of the housing is formed with second weak portions respectively extending downward from both ends of the first weak portion that are weaker than the area surrounding thereof and cleave subsequent to cleaving of the first weak portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">With the configuration described above, the second weak portion of the cover also cleaves during expansion and deployment of the airbag cushion. As a result, the opening of the cover when the airbag cushion expands and deploys can be opened wider. Therefore, the effects as described above can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The direction in cross-section view of the second pair of side surfaces extending in the longitudinal direction intersects with the direction in cross-section view of the first pair of side surfaces extending in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">The cover described above may include a third weak portion that extends along the boundary of the portion that covers the opening of the housing and the portion that covers the second pair of side surfaces of the housing, that is weaker than the surrounding area thereof, and is cleaved subsequent to the first weak portion cleaving. With this manner of configuration, the cover is cleaved in the first weak portion and the third weak portion. As a result, the opening of the cover can be further widened, and the airbag cushion can be expanded and deployed more quickly.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The present invention enables providing an airbag module with the housing readily capable of opening when the airbag expands and deploys.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an airbag module according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A of the cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram describing Embodiment 2 of the cover.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram describing Embodiment 3 of the cover.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view describing a first housing structure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the leg part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> taken along the line A-A.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram explaining the behavior of the first housing structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> during expansion and deployment of the airbag cushion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view explaining a second housing structure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which the extendable walls of the housing structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> open up.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view describing a third housing structure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an expanded perspective view of the vicinity of the connecting member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a vehicle equipped with the airbag module of the present embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Preferred embodiments according to the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.
