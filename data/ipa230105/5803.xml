The input and output contacts of a semiconductor chip or other comparable device are generally disposed in grid-like patterns that substantially cover a surface of the device (commonly referred to as an &#x201c;area array&#x201d;) or in elongated rows which may extend parallel to and adjacent to each edge of the device's front surface, or in the center of the front surface. Typically, devices such as chips must be physically mounted on a substrate such as a printed circuit board, and the contacts of the device must be electrically connected to electrically conductive features of the circuit board.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor chips are commonly provided in packages that facilitate handling of the chip during manufacture and during mounting of the chip on an external substrate such as a circuit board or other circuit panel. For example, many semiconductor chips are provided in packages suitable for surface mounting. Numerous packages of this general type have been proposed for various applications. Most commonly, such packages include a dielectric element, commonly referred to as a &#x201c;chip carrier&#x201d; with terminals formed as plated or etched metallic structures on the dielectric. These terminals typically are connected to the contacts of the chip itself by features such as thin traces extending along the chip carrier itself and by fine leads or wires extending between the contacts of the chip and the terminals or traces. In a surface mounting operation, the package is placed onto a circuit board so that each terminal on the package is aligned with a corresponding contact pad on the circuit board. Solder or another bonding material is provided between the terminals and the contact pads. The package can be permanently bonded in place by heating the assembly so as to melt or &#x201c;reflow&#x201d; the solder or otherwise activate the bonding material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many packages include solder masses in the form of solder balls, typically about 0.1 mm and about 0.8 mm (5 and 30 mils) in diameter, attached to the terminals of the package. A package having an array of solder balls projecting from its bottom surface is commonly referred to as a ball grid array or &#x201c;BGA&#x201d; package. Other packages, referred to as land grid array or &#x201c;LGA&#x201d; packages, are secured to the substrate by thin layers or lands formed from solder. Packages of this type can be quite compact. Certain packages, commonly referred to as &#x201c;chip scale packages,&#x201d; occupy an area of the circuit board equal to, or only slightly larger than, the area of the device incorporated in the package. This is advantageous in that it reduces the overall size of the assembly and permits the use of short interconnections between various devices on the substrate, which in turn limits signal propagation time between devices and thus facilitates operation of the assembly at high speeds.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Packaged semiconductor chips are often provided in &#x201c;stacked&#x201d; arrangements, wherein one package is provided, for example, on a circuit board, and another package is mounted on top of the first package. These arrangements can allow a number of different chips to be mounted within a single footprint on a circuit board and can further facilitate high-speed operation by providing a short interconnection between packages. Often, this interconnect distance is only slightly larger than the thickness of the chip itself. For interconnection to be achieved within a stack of chip packages, it is necessary to provide structures for mechanical and electrical connection on both sides of each package (except for the topmost package). This has been done, for example, by providing contact pads or lands on both sides of the substrate to which the chip is mounted, the pads being connected through the substrate by conductive vias or the like. Solder balls or the like have been used to bridge the gap between the contacts on the top of a lower substrate to the contacts on the bottom of the next higher substrate. The solder balls must be higher than the height of the chip in order to connect the contacts. Examples of stacked chip arrangements and interconnect structures are provided in U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2010/0232129 (&#x201c;the '129 Publication&#x201d;), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite all of the above-described advances in the art, further improvements in making and testing microelectronic units would be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A microelectronic package has a first side, a second side, a microelectronic element and an encapsulation which may overly the sidewalls of the microelectronic element. The microelectronic package may have a plurality of electrically conductive elements at its front face, which may be at the first side of the package for connection with a component external to the microelectronic package. The microelectronic package can have electrically conductive connector elements which may have ends adjacent either the first or second side of the package.

The method may include the steps of: forming an electrically conductive redistribution structure on a carrier and providing a plurality of microelectronic element attachment regions, which may be spaced apart from one another in at least a first direction parallel with a surface of the carrier. The method may include forming multiple electrically conductive connector elements between adjacent attachment regions. Each connector element may have a first end, a second end and edge surfaces, the first end may be adjacent the carrier and the second end may be at a height greater than 50 microns above the carrier. The method may also include forming a dielectric encapsulation over portions of the edge surfaces of the connector elements and subsequently singulating the assembly into a plurality of microelectronic units. Each of the microelectronic units may include one or more microelectronic elements, either stacked upon one another or side by side. The surface of the microelectronic unit, opposite the redistribution structure, may have the front face of the microelectronic element and the second ends of the connector elements available for connection with a component external to the microelectronic unit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method for simultaneously making a plurality of microelectronic packages. The method may include the steps of: providing a carrier with a plurality of microelectronic element attachment regions spaced apart from one another. Then forming a plurality of electrically conductive connector elements, which may lie between adjacent attachment regions. Each connector element may have a first end, a second end and edge surfaces. The first end of each connector element can be adjacent the carrier and the second end of each connector element can be at a height greater than 50 microns above the carrier.

As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> there are example substrate-less packages <b>10</b> that may include microelectronic element <b>12</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), connector elements <b>14</b>, encapsulant <b>16</b> and redistribution structure <b>18</b>. The microelectronic element <b>12</b> may have a front face <b>20</b> or &#x201c;active face,&#x201d; a rear face <b>22</b>, and sidewalls <b>24</b> extending between the front and rear faces. The front face <b>20</b> may be at a first side <b>11</b> of the microelectronic unit or package <b>10</b>. As used in this disclosure with reference to a component, e.g., connector element, first end, second end, free end, conductive element, microelectronic element, etc., a statement that an element is &#x201c;at&#x201d; a surface of a component indicates that, when the component is not assembled with any other element, the electrically conductive element is available for contact with a theoretical point moving in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the component toward the surface of the component from outside the component. Thus, a terminal or other conductive element which is at a surface of a microelectronic unit <b>12</b> may project from such surface; may be flush with such surface; or may be recessed relative to such surface in a hole or depression in the substrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Connector elements <b>14</b> may include first ends <b>28</b> (e.g., bases), second ends <b>26</b> (e.g., tips) and edges extending vertically between the first and second ends. The first ends <b>28</b> may comprise conductive elements <b>29</b> (e.g., pads) made of copper, nickel, aluminum, tin, palladium or other similar conductive material or combination of conductive materials. Connector elements <b>14</b> may be arranged in a pattern to form area array <b>31</b>, which may surround microelectronic element <b>12</b> and have a grid-like appearance, such as further seen in a corresponding plan view thereof in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Area array <b>31</b> may be filled in with encapsulant <b>16</b> such that the free ends <b>34</b> of connector elements <b>14</b> are at the surface of the encapsulant <b>16</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> the free ends <b>34</b> of the connector elements may be arranged into a grid or an array and exposed at the surface of the dielectric encapsulation <b>16</b>. The free ends <b>34</b> of the connector elements <b>14</b> can be characterized as being &#x201c;free&#x201d; in that they are not electrically connected or otherwise joined to other electrically conductive features within microelectronic unit <b>12</b> that are proximate to the free ends <b>34</b>. In other words, free ends <b>34</b> are available for electronic connection, either directly or indirectly to a conductive feature external to the microelectronic unit <b>12</b>. The fact that free ends <b>34</b> held in a predetermined position by, for example, encapsulation <b>16</b> or otherwise joined or electrically connected to another conductive feature does not mean that they are not &#x201c;free&#x201d; as described herein, so long as any such feature is not proximate to the free end. As seen above, depending on the configuration either the first end or the second end may be the free end, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> the second ends <b>26</b> (e.g., tips) are the free ends, whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> the first ends (e.g., bases) are the free ends <b>34</b>. In either situation, the free ends <b>34</b> and the front face of the microelectronic element <b>12</b> may be at the same side of the package and remote from redistribution structure <b>18</b>. Conversely, the ends of the connector elements that are adjacent the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may not be free ends because they are directly or indirectly electrically coupled to the redistribution structure <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, there is an exemplary pattern of the connector elements' free ends <b>34</b> forming area array <b>31</b>. In one example, area array <b>31</b> may have a plurality of rows and columns that surround the microelectronic element <b>12</b> along the perimeter portion of the microelectronic unit <b>12</b>. The area array <b>31</b> may extend beyond the edge of the microelectronic element toward the edge of the microelectronic unit <b>10</b>. The area array <b>31</b> may be arranged such that there are no connector elements <b>14</b> within distance <b>55</b> (e.g., less than 4 mm) extending outward from the edge of the microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The area array <b>31</b> may also be arranged such that the connector elements <b>14</b> are subset a small distance <b>56</b> (e.g., less than 4 mm) inward from the package edge. In One example there may be no connector elements within 0.5 mm of the edge of the microelectronic element <b>12</b> and 0.5 mm of the edge of the microelectronic unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The quantity of connector elements <b>14</b> (e.g., I/O connections) may depend on the portion of the microelectronic unit that includes connectors as well as the density of the connector elements <b>14</b>. The density relates to the thickness of each connector as well as how close the connector elements are to one another (e.g., pitch). The connector elements may have different dimensions depending on the particular structure, for example for wirebonds the thickness may be approximately 500 &#x3bc;m, whereas solder material may have a larger thickness. The pitch may vary from 0.05 millimeters (mm) to 4 mm and is preferably in the range of 0.1-0.6 mm. The lower the pitch the higher the density of I/O connections. In one example, a microelectronic unit with dimensions of 14 mm&#xd7;14 mm may have approximately 1440 connector elements <b>14</b> by having five rows with a pitch that is approximately equal to 0.2 mm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in one example of the disclosure the second ends <b>26</b> (e.g., tips) of the connector elements <b>14</b> may be at the first side <b>11</b> of the microelectronic unit <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the second ends <b>26</b> may project above the surface of the encapsulant. As used herein, a statement that an electrically conductive element is disposed &#x201c;above a surface&#x201d; or &#x201c;overlying a surface&#x201d; means at a region which is in an orthogonal direction away from the surface. A statement that one element is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;upward from&#x201d; a reference plane means at a region in an orthogonal direction away from the reference plane. Movement of an element in an &#x201c;upward&#x201d; direction means in a direction to a greater height above a reference plane defined by the surface. Conversely, movement of an element in a &#x201c;downward&#x201d; direction means in a direction to a lower height above a reference plane defined by the surface. All such statements and meanings of the foregoing terms are not in a gravitational reference, but rather in the frame of reference defined by the element itself.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the connector elements <b>14</b> may be electrically connected to the redistribution structure. In one embodiment, the connector elements <b>14</b> and/or the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be free of electrical connections with the microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The rear face of microelectronic element <b>12</b> may be attached to redistribution structure <b>18</b> at attachment region <b>32</b>, which may be covered by an adhesive layer or adhesive film. The attachment region <b>32</b> may be located in the center portion of each microelectronic unit. The redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be electrically coupled to or in direct contact with the first ends <b>28</b> (e.g., bases) of connector elements <b>14</b>. In one example, the bases may be conductive pads.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in another example microelectronic unit, the connector elements' first ends <b>28</b>, as opposed to second ends <b>26</b>, may be at the first side <b>11</b> of the microelectronic unit and adjacent active face <b>20</b> of microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The second ends <b>26</b> (e.g., bases) may be in direct physical and/or electrical contact with the redistribution structure <b>18</b>. The redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be separated from the microelectronic element by encapsulation <b>16</b>, which may completely cover microelectronic element <b>12</b> and surround the rear face and all the sidewalls.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The microelectronic units discussed above as well as other variations may be formed according to various stages of formation seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. In some examples, the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be formed prior to the connector elements <b>14</b> and be electrically coupled to or in contact with the first ends <b>28</b> (e.g., bases), in another example, the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be formed after the connector elements <b>14</b> and contact the second ends <b>26</b> (e.g., tips).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method of fabrication may utilize a reconstituted assembly approach (e.g., reconstituted wafer). A reconstituted assembly <b>8</b> may be formed by placing a plurality of singulated microelectronic elements <b>12</b> onto carrier <b>13</b> for further processing. Carrier <b>13</b> may be any structure (e.g., wafer) capable of mechanically supporting a plurality of microelectronic elements while being operated on. Microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may be placed directly on the carrier or may be placed on a layer(s) previously formed on the carrier. The microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may be spaced apart and attached directly or indirectly to the carrier <b>13</b> by an adhesive material or vacuum. The plurality of microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may then be processed while in form of the reconstituted wafer and then subsequently singulated to form individual packaged microelectronic units.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One aspect of the disclosure includes a method of processing microelectronic units by forming the redistribution structure <b>18</b> at a relatively early stage in the process, which may result in a structure similar to that seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a temporary attachment layer <b>33</b> (e.g., adhesive layer) and electrically conductive terminals <b>30</b> can be provided on a carrier <b>13</b>. Temporary attachment layer <b>33</b> may be formed by depositing an adhesive material or attaching an adhesive material over the carrier <b>13</b>. In one example, forming the conductive terminals <b>30</b> may be formed subtractively by patterning the conductive material to form individual conductive terminals <b>30</b>. In another example, the conductive terminals can be formed by additive processing, e.g., by plating, deposition, printing, etc. The conductive terminals may include copper, aluminum, nickel or any other electrically conductive material such as, without limitation, conductive matrix material, conductive ink, conductive polymer, conductive paste, etc. In one example, terminals <b>30</b> may be in the form of conductive pads that may function as package terminals on the surface of the microelectronic unit (e.g., Ball Grid Array (BGA)).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be created on carrier <b>13</b> by forming a dielectric layer <b>9</b> and traces <b>21</b> electrically coupled with conductive terminals <b>30</b>. The redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be formed by a single dielectric layer (e.g., single spin coat) or may comprise multiple dielectric layers. At a surface of the redistribution structure <b>18</b> remote from carrier <b>13</b> there may be conductive elements <b>29</b>, which in one example may be formed by forming another conductive layer and subsequently patterning it to form conductive elements <b>29</b>. Alternatively, the conductive elements <b>29</b> may be pads or conductive masses (e.g., solder balls) and may function as the first ends (e.g., bases) of the Bond Via Array (BVA).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the method may include forming attachment regions <b>32</b> and conductive connector elements <b>14</b>. Attachment regions <b>32</b> may be positions overlying the carrier where microelectronic elements may be placed. The placement of the microelectronic elements may occur before or after forming the connector elements <b>14</b>, before or after forming the encapsulation or before or after singulation. Attachment regions <b>32</b> may comprise adhesive pads and/or an adhesive film and may be formed at regions spaced apart from one another in at least a first direction parallel with the surface of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Connector elements <b>14</b> may be formed between adjacent attachment regions <b>32</b> and may partially or fully surround each attachment region <b>32</b>. Each connector element may have a first end <b>28</b>, a second end <b>26</b> and an edge surface <b>27</b> extending vertically between the first and second ends. First end <b>28</b> may be adjacent and electrically coupled to redistribution structure <b>18</b> and second end <b>26</b> may be a free end remote from the redistribution structure <b>18</b>. First ends <b>28</b> may overlie and be electrically coupled (e.g., bonded or joined) with conductive elements <b>29</b> and/or the first ends may comprise the conductive elements <b>29</b> and be formed integrally therewith, as seen by first ends <b>28</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one example, connector elements <b>14</b> may be wire bonds that are joined to metal bonding surfaces (e.g., conductive elements <b>29</b>) using a wire bonding tool. In one example, the method for forming the wirebonds may include heating the leading end of a wire segment and pressing it against the receiving surface to which the wire segment bonds, typically forming a ball or ball-like base joined to the surface of the conductive element <b>29</b>. The desired length of the wire segment needed to form the wire bond is drawn out of the bonding tool, which may then sever or cut the wire bond at the desired length.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another technique for forming connector elements <b>14</b> may include wedge bonding or stich bonding. Wedge bonding may include dragging a portion of the a wire along the receiving surface to form a wedge that lies generally parallel to the surface. The wedge bonded wire bond can then be bent upward, if necessary, and extended to the desired length or position before cutting. In a particular embodiment, the wire used to form a wire bond can be cylindrical in cross section. Otherwise, the wire fed from the tool to form a wire bond or wedge bonded wire bond may have a polygonal cross section such as rectangular or trapezoidal, for example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may be placed at attachment regions <b>32</b> and surrounded by dielectric encapsulation <b>16</b>. The microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may be attached before, after or during the forming of the dielectric encapsulation <b>16</b>. Each microelectronic element <b>12</b> may have a front face <b>20</b>, rear face <b>22</b> and sidewalls <b>24</b> extending between the front and rear faces. The front face <b>20</b> may be an active face with active or passive elements (e.g., contacts) and the rear face <b>22</b> may or may not have active or passive electrical elements (e.g., contacts). In one example, the attachment regions may be located on a surface of the redistribution structure <b>18</b> and the microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may be attached with the rear face facing toward the carrier. As such, front face <b>20</b> may be remote from and face away from the redistribution structure <b>18</b> and carrier <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The microelectronic elements <b>12</b> may then be surrounded by encapsulation <b>16</b> such that the encapsulation is adjacent and overlies all of the sidewalls of microelectronic element <b>12</b>. During this step, the encapsulation may also be formed over portions of the connector elements edge surfaces <b>27</b> within area arrays <b>31</b>. The dielectric encapsulation may have a major surface <b>17</b> that may be parallel with the front face <b>20</b> of microelectronic element <b>12</b> and at a height that is substantially aligned with the height of the microelectronic element <b>12</b> (e.g., greater than 50 mils). The surface of the encapsulation may also be at a height above, below or approximately equal to the height of the second ends <b>26</b> of connector elements <b>14</b>. This may allow the second ends to project above the encapsulation <b>16</b> as seen or alternatively the second ends may be recessed or flush with the major surface <b>17</b> of the encapsulation. Following the encapsulation step there may be additional or optional processing that may occur before singulation. For example, contact elements on the front face of the microelectronic element and second ends <b>26</b> may have conductive masses (e.g., solder balls) formed on them (e.g., bumped), as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the additive and subtractive processing is completed, the resulting reconstituted assembly may include numerous microelectronic units as a continuous or semi-continuous structure such as a strip, tape or sheet. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows no visible borders between the individual microelectronic units, they may be subsequently singulated, for example along cut line <b>36</b> and released from the carrier <b>13</b> to form individual packaged microelectronic elements, similar to the microelectronic unit seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The microelectronic unit may be used to mechanically support and electrically connect the microelectronic element to another microelectronic structure, such as to a printed circuit board (&#x201c;PCB&#x201d;), or to other packaged microelectronic elements. In such a stacked arrangement, connector elements <b>14</b> can carry multiple electronic signals therethrough, each having a different signal potential to allow for different signals to be processed by different microelectronic elements in a single stack.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another aspect of the disclosure includes a method of processing microelectronic units by forming the redistribution structure <b>18</b> later in the process, which may result in a structure similar to that seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The steps and structures used in this method may include many of the same steps discussed above. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a carrier <b>13</b> may be used to form a reconstituted assembly (e.g., reconstituted wafer) and may include attachment regions <b>32</b>, microelectronic elements <b>12</b>, conductive layer <b>23</b>, conductive elements <b>29</b>, and connector elements <b>14</b>. The attachment regions <b>32</b> may be provided directly on the carrier <b>13</b>, as opposed to on the redistribution structure <b>18</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Alternatively the attachment regions <b>32</b> may be provided on an intermediate layer (e.g., conductive layer) disposed directly on carrier <b>13</b>. The microelectronic elements <b>12</b>, may be placed face down on the attachment regions, such that the front face is adjacent the carrier. As such, rear face <b>22</b> may be remote from or face away from the carrier. The conductive elements <b>29</b> may be formed by forming an additional conductive layer (e.g., foil) and subsequently patterning the layer to form conductive elements <b>29</b>. In one example, conductive elements <b>29</b> may be in the form of pads that may function as both package terminals for the microelectronic unit and first ends (e.g., bases) of the connector elements <b>14</b>. The connector elements <b>14</b> may be formed via the same process discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the dielectric encapsulation <b>16</b> may be formed over microelectronic elements <b>12</b> and among connector elements <b>14</b> as discussed above. However, unlike in the example discussed above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be formed above the encapsulation and in direct contact with the second ends of the connector elements <b>14</b>. In this case, although the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may be formed using a process similar to that discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the redistribution structure <b>18</b> may now be located remote from the carrier and may form the second side of the reconstituted assembly and the microelectronic units which will be singulated therefrom. In one example, the redistribution structure <b>18</b> is accessible (e.g., exposed) while still on the carrier, which may allow the area array to be available for electrical coupling for testing at a larger pitch.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At this point, the reconstituted assembly may be ready for singulation, however there may also be additional or optional processing that may occur before singulation. For example, conductive joining masses <b>35</b> (e.g., solder balls) may be provided at the ends of the connector elements and on contacts of the microelectronic elements, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. After the additive and subtractive processing is completed the reconstituted assembly may be singulated along cut line <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) and released from the carrier <b>13</b> to form individual packaged microelectronic elements, similar to the microelectronic unit seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The microelectronic unit may then be attached to a printed circuit board, or be part of a stack of microelectronic units, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref>, the microelectronic unit <b>10</b> may be formed without forming a redistribution structure <b>18</b> and thus the redistribution structure can be omitted from the final structure and connector elements <b>14</b> may be at both sides of the microelectronic unit. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, and microelectronic unit <b>12</b> may have a first side <b>15</b> (e.g., top) and a second side <b>15</b> (e.g., bottom) opposite from the first side and a microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The microelectronic element <b>12</b> may have an active face <b>20</b> at a second side <b>15</b> of the microelectronic unit <b>10</b> alongside the connector elements <b>14</b>. The connector elements <b>14</b> may be formed such that they extend vertically between the first and second surfaces of the microelectronic element and stand parallel with the microelectronic element's sidewalls. Each connector element may be free of electrical connections with other connector elements and/or free of electrical connections to the microelectronic element. This may allow an underlying or overlying substrate (e.g., PCB, interposer, another microelectronic package) to supply the interconnections.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>, the connector elements <b>14</b>H and <b>14</b>I may comprise a single conductive mass <b>19</b>. The conductive mass may be rounded as seen in <b>14</b>H or it may be elongated into an elliptical shape as seen in <b>14</b>I. Each conductive mass may also include a series of stacked conductive masses, as seen in examples of connectors <b>14</b>J, <b>14</b>K and <b>14</b>L. The conductive masses may be formed of or may include a bond metal such as tin, indium, solder, or gold. Alternatively, the conductive masses may be formed of or may comprise a curable material. In some cases, a curable material can be allowed to cure before forming additional conductive mass above it. In this case, the first and second connector ends may be the bottom and top portions respectively of a single conductive mass <b>19</b> or it may be the top and bottom conductive mass respectively when there are a plurality of conductive masses stacked.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the microelectronic unit <b>10</b> may also include a heat spreader <b>50</b> adjacent the microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The heat spreader <b>50</b> may consist of or include a portion of conductive layer <b>23</b>. In one example, the heat spreader <b>50</b> may be adhered directly or indirectly to the rear face of the microelectronic element <b>12</b>. The heat spreader <b>50</b> may occupy a larger or smaller area then the rear face of the microelectronic element.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-D</figref>, the encapsulation <b>16</b> may be formed at different regions and at different points in the procedure resulting in microelectronic units with different configurations. In one example, the encapsulation may be formed prior to the placement of the microelectronic element onto the reconstituted assembly, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. Alternatively, the encapsulation may be formed after the placement of the microelectronic element, which may allow the encapsulant to directly contact the microelectronic elements. In the latter example, the dielectric encapsulation may cover a large portion of the microelectronic element and surround all of the sidewalls and the rear face of the microelectronic element (i.e., five of the six sides of the microelectronic element), as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> the encapsulation may surround the sidewalls of the microelectronic elements but may only extend laterally outward in a horizontal direction from the microelectronic element and overly neither the front face nor the rear face of the microelectronic element <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, there may be a configuration where the encapsulant is formed such that it surrounds the microelectronic element but there is a substantial gap <b>7</b> between one or more sidewalls (e.g., all the sidewalls) of the microelectronic element and the surrounding encapsulation.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A-C</figref> there is an example technique for forming encapsulation <b>16</b>, which may result in unencapsulated portions of the connector elements <b>14</b> projecting beyond a surface <b>17</b> of the encapsulation <b>16</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, a film-assisted molding technique may be used by which a temporary film <b>42</b> is placed between a plate <b>44</b> of a mold and a cavity <b>46</b> in which a subassembly including the substrate, connector elements <b>14</b> joined thereto, and a component such as a microelectronic element may be joined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> further shows a second plate <b>45</b> of the mold which can be disposed opposite the first plate <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-C</figref>, when the mold plates <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> are brought together, the free ends <b>34</b> of connector elements <b>14</b> can project into the temporary film <b>42</b>. When a mold compound is flowed in the cavity <b>46</b> to form encapsulation <b>16</b>, the mold compound does not contact the free ends of the connector elements <b>14</b> because they are covered by the temporary film <b>42</b>. After this step, the mold plates <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> are removed from the encapsulation layer <b>16</b>, the temporary film <b>42</b> can now be removed from the mold surface <b>17</b>, which then leaves the free ends of the connector elements <b>14</b> projecting beyond the surface <b>17</b> of the encapsulation layer <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The film assisted molding technique may be well adapted for mass production. For example, in one example of the process, a portion of a continuous sheet of the temporary film can be applied to the mold plate. Then the encapsulation layer can be formed in a cavity <b>46</b> that is at least partially defined by the mold plate. Then, a current portion of the temporary film <b>42</b> on the mold plate <b>44</b> can be replaced by automated means with another portion of the continuous sheet of the temporary film.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a variation of the film assisted molding technique, instead of using a removable film as described above, a water soluble film can be placed on an inner surface of the mold plate <b>44</b> prior to forming the encapsulation layer. When the mold plates are removed, the water soluble film can be removed by washing it away so as to leave the ends of the connector elements <b>14</b> projecting beyond the surface <b>17</b> of the encapsulation layer as described above.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The encapsulation may also be formed using an alternate techniques, for example, encapsulation <b>16</b> may be formed by completely covering connector elements <b>14</b>, including ends (e.g., ends <b>26</b>) with the encapsulation. The encapsulation may include a sacrificial portion (e.g., layer) which may be subsequently removed to expose the second ends. The sacrificial portion may be removed by etching, planarizing, lapping, grinding, wet blasting (e.g., aluminum slurry), polishing or the like. This may reduce the height of the encapsulant to the desired height for connector elements <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The planarization of the sacrificial portion (e.g., sacrificial layer) can begin by reducing the height thereof to a point where the connector elements <b>14</b> become exposed at the surface of the sacrificial layer. The planarization process can then also planarize the connector elements <b>14</b> simultaneously with the sacrificial layer such that, as the height of the sacrificial layer is continued to be reduced, the heights of the connector elements <b>14</b> are also reduced. The planarization can be stopped once the desired height for the connector elements <b>14</b> is reached. It is noted that in such a process the connector elements <b>14</b> can be initially formed such that their heights, while being non-uniform, are all greater than the targeted uniform height. After planarization processes the connector elements <b>14</b> to the uniform or reduced height, the sacrificial layer can be removed such as by etching or the like. The sacrificial portion may be formed from a material that is the same as the encapsulant or may be different, which may allow for removal by etching using an etchant that will not significantly affect the encapsulant material. In one example, the sacrificial layer can be made from a water soluble plastic material.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, the carrier used for the reconstituted assembly may have a substantially flat surface or the surface may include recessed and/or raised attachment regions.
