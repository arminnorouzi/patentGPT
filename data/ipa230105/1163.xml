The computing server can be configured to perform operations including: deploying a machine learning model (or models) to generate predictions of future rate of flow of the cerebrospinal fluid; and transmitting (e.g., wirelessly) the predictions to an application installed on a computing device coupled to the computing server. The machine learning model(s) can be a supervised model, wherein the supervised model is a regression model or a classification model. The machine learning model(s) can include an unsupervised model, wherein the unsupervised model includes one or more of a clustering model and a dimensionality reduction model. The machine learning model(s) can be stored in the computing server. The machine learning model(s) can be stored in another computing server that is remote to the computing server.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The computing server can include: a normalization processor configured to communicate with the device, a software development kit configured to communicate with a first application installed on a computer configured to be operated by the human patient, and a web module configured to communicate with a second application installed on a computer configured to be operated by a clinician.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In general, in another aspect, the disclosure features a device for monitoring a flowrate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt implanted in a human patient. The device includes multiple sensors arranged in a housing configured to be placed external to the human patient above the VP shunt and generate signals responsive to a flow of the CSF in the VP shunt, a controller within the housing and configured to receive the signals from the plurality of sensors, wherein the controller is configured to determine, based on the signals, a rate of flow of the CSF in the VP shunt, and a communications transceiver to transmit data indicative of the rate of flow to a computing server.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the device can include one or more of the following features and/or features of other aspects. For example, the housing can defines a first channel and a second channel, the first channel being sized and shaped to overlay a portion of the VP shunt, the second channel being sized and shaped to overlay a portion of the human patient above their clavicle. The first and second channels can extend non-parallel to each other. For example, the first and second channels can extend perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sensors can include one or more of: at least one infrared sensor, at least one ultrasonic sensor, or at least one thermal sensor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, in another aspect, the disclosure features a non-transitory computer program product storing instructions that, when executed by at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations that include: receiving data sensed by a plurality of sensors within a device and placed above a ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt implanted in a human patient and configured to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the human patient's brain; determining, based on the sensed data, a rate of flow of the CSF in the VP shunt; and transmitting data indicating the rate of flow to a computing server. The subject matter described herein may provide one or more of the following advantages. For example, the device described herein can detect whether the VP shunt is potentially malfunctioning, which can cause an improper drainage, or stoppage of drainage, of the CSF from the brain. Data indicating potential malfunctioning of the VP shunt can be output (e.g., displayed) on applications (e.g., browser or native applications) on the patient's computer or a clinician's computer so that the problem with the VP shunt can be rectified. Further, the computing server described herein can deploy one or more machine learning models to predict future CSF flow, which can indicate to a clinician whether the VP shunt is expected to continue functioning properly as well as whether and when medical intervention may be needed. In some implementations, the drainage within the VP shunt may be automatically varied based on (a) data indicating VP shunt malfunction and/or (b) the predictions so as to automatically rectify the problems with the VP shunt. Such implementations can avoid complications due to internal blockage, over-drainage, under-drainage of VP shunt in hydrocephalus patients.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The details of one or more variations of the subject matter described herein are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

The majority of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, which is a plexus of cells that arises from the tela choroidea in each of the ventricles <b>104</b> of the brain <b>106</b>. The CSF moves through the ventricles <b>104</b>, subarachnoid cisterns, and subarachnoid space. Subarachnoid cisterns are spaces formed by openings in the subarachnoid space. Subarachnoid space refers to locations around the brain <b>106</b> between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, through which major blood vessels pass. The CSF generally moves through the brain <b>106</b> and the spinal cord, and is soaked into the bloodstream. An example direction of the CSF flow is shown using arrows.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The choroid plexus in an adult can produce approximately 500 milliliters of CSF, around 135 milliliters of which is replaced every six hours as about that amount of CSF is reabsorbed by the body.
