As to software applications, an enclosure management module is available to detect the operation of the device in real time, including temperature, voltage, fans, etc. In order to ensure that the device may operate stably and reliably for a long time, the information of the peripheral hardware needs to be detected in real time. The enclosure management module is divided into two parts: an SCSI Enclosure Service (SES) program running on an SAS expander and an enclosure management (EM) thread in a main program.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to improve the high reliability and high performance of storage devices, multiple controllers are available in a set of devices to establish clusters to process data services in a unified manner; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a common dual-control device consists of two controllers, and the controllers have hardware that each SES program may control independently. The two controllers are assembled in a device frame, and the frame is provided with hardware shared by the frames, such as hard disk control lights, system lights, VPD information with consistent dual control, etc. However, two sets of SES programs will introduce some problems. For example, simultaneous control of hardware that may be controlled by dual control will be abnormal. There are also problems in the interaction between two SES programs.

Therefore, in consideration of establishing a channel by means of dual-control to increase the transmission of dual-control information, the main program may conveniently obtain the information of two nodes and facilitate timely processing based on the integrated information of dual control.

It should be noted that, in addition to the interaction variables between the main program and the SES program, in order to expand the application, the variable set may also contain important data in each function module; and the data may be added flexibly and freely.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the name of the first variable is defined as a variable xxx_local to store the data of this node, and the name of the second variable is defined as a variable xxx_remote to receive and store the data of node on the opposite terminal.
