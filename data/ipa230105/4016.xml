They integrate various functionalities in one small package thus providing tremendous convenience for use. Most, if not all, of today's mobile multipurpose devices include at least one camera. The camera may include at least one optical lens that passes through light to an image sensor to generate imaging signals, based on which an image may be produced. Therefore, the image quality of the camera depends heavily on the spatial alignment between the optical lens and the image sensor. Misalignment, such as tilt, between the lens and image senor can cause negative impact on the image quality, such as unexpected sharpness variation across an image. Therefore, it is desirable for cameras to have the capability to compensate for the tilt.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate an example camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> show perspective views of an example camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C-<b>2</b>D</figref> show top views of an example camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> show operations of an example tilt actuator, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows operations of an example autofocus (AF) and optical image stabilization (OIS) actuator, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> show example fixtures for tilt coils of a camera, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>E</figref> show an example process to form fixtures for tilt coils, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>E</figref> show another example process to form fixtures for tilt coils, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> show an example embodiment for connecting a rigid circuit board and a flexible circuit, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a high-level flowchart showing techniques to compensate for tilt of a camera, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a high-level flowchart showing techniques to adjust a focus of a camera, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a schematic representation of an example device that may include a camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of an example computer system that may include a camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This specification includes references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment.&#x201d; The appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment.

In some embodiments, the camera may include one or more lenses and an image sensor. The lenses may pass through light to the image sensor to generate imaging signals, which may be further processed by a processor to produce an image. In some embodiments, the camera may include a tilt actuator, e.g., a voice coil motor (VCM) actuator, that may cause tilt movement of the lenses relative to the image sensor. For instance, the lenses may be rotated approximately around one or more axis (e.g., X- and/or Y-axis) orthogonal to an optical axis (or Z-axis) of the lenses relative to the image sensor. In some embodiments, the tilt actuator may include one or more tilt magnets and one or more tilt coils. In some embodiments, the tilt magnets may be fixedly coupled with the lenses, e.g., through attachment with a lens holder of the lenses, whilst the tilt coils may be fixedly coupled with one or more stationary fixtures of the camera. Here, the term &#x201c;stationary&#x201d; may broadly refer to a component of the camera that is not supposedly to move. A stationary component may still experience unexpected movement, e.g., during sudden drop of the camera. However, such unexpected movement is not purposeful and especially is not caused by an actuator. In some embodiments, the camera with tilt compensation may be part of a mobile multipurpose device such as a smartphone, a tablet, a pad device, and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the tilt magnets and tilt coils may generate motive force (e.g., Lorentz force) to tilt the lenses (e.g., through rotation around X- and/or Y-axis) or autofocus the lenses (e.g., through movement in a direction approximately parallel to Z-axis) relative to the image sensor of the camera. In addition, the camera may include one or more actuators, e.g., one or more VCM actuators, separate from the tilt actuator and dedicated to perform autofocus (AF) and/or optical image stabilization (OIS) functions. For instance, the camera may include an AF actuator primarily used to move the lenses relative to the image sensor along the optical axis (or Z-axis) of the lenses, and an OIS actuator to move the image sensor relative to the lenses in one or more directions approximately in the X-Y plane orthogonal to the optical axis (or Z-axis) of the lenses. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the AF and OIS functions may be implemented by moving either the lenses or the image sensor alone. For instance, in some embodiments, the image sensor may be movable relative to the lenses along (1) the optical axis (or Z-axis) and (2) one or more axes (e.g., X- and/or Y-axis) orthogonal to the optical axis (or Z-axis) of the lenses and the lenses may remain stationary, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The tilt actuator described in this disclosure provides several benefits. One, the tilt actuator may move the lenses to one or more desired tilt positions, e.g., according to measurement of one or more tilt sensors, to accurately compensate for unexpected tilt and misalignment between the lenses and image sensor, thus greatly improving the image quality for the camera. Two, the tilt actuator may operate independently from the AF and/or OIS actuator(s) of the camera, thus minimizing potential interference with the camera's AF and/or OIS functions. Three, the tilt in a camera generally has only a relatively small value. Therefore, its compensation may only require a relatively low-power tilt actuator. The tilt actuator may be implemented using relatively simple and small form factor components, resulting in minimal mass and size additions to the camera.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate an example camera with tilt compensation, according to some embodiments. To simplify illustration, only relevant components are illustrated in these figures. For purposes of illustration, this disclosure defines Z-axis as the optical axis of one or more lenses that passes through the lenses in a direction perpendicular to an image sensor of the camera. In the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in this example, camera <b>100</b> may include a tilt actuator having one or more tilt magnets <b>105</b> and one or more tilt coils <b>110</b>.

As shown in the figure, in some embodiments, camera <b>100</b> may include one or more lenses <b>140</b> that may pass through light to image sensor <b>145</b> that may generate imaging signals (e.g., light activated electrical signals) to be further processed to produce an image. In some embodiments, camera <b>100</b> may include infrared cutoff filter (IRCF) <b>150</b> positioned optically between lenses <b>140</b> and image sensor <b>145</b> such that IRCF <b>150</b> may block at least some infrared light from reaching image sensor <b>145</b>. In some embodiments, image sensor <b>145</b> and IRCF <b>150</b> may be attached to substrate <b>155</b>. As described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, tilt magnets <b>105</b> may be fixedly coupled with lenses <b>140</b>. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, tilt magnets <b>105</b> may be attached with AF carrier <b>127</b> that may be further attached to lens holder <b>125</b>. Thus, tilt magnets <b>105</b>, AF carrier <b>127</b>, lens holder <b>125</b>, and lenses <b>140</b> collectively may be considered a single rigid body that may be movable altogether relative to image sensor <b>145</b>. In some embodiments, camera <b>100</b> may include one or more suspension structures (not shown), such that lenses <b>140</b> may be able to move relative to image sensor <b>145</b>. For instance, in some embodiments, camera <b>100</b> may include one or more springs connecting AF carrier <b>127</b> with a stationary portion of camera <b>100</b> (e.g., fixture <b>132</b>). The springs may be compressed or stretched to allow lenses <b>140</b> (contained within lens holder <b>125</b>) to move along Z-axis, and/or rotate around X- and/or Y-axis, relative to image sensor <b>145</b>.

Tilt sensors <b>135</b> may measure relative distance, position, speed, and/or proximity between tilt magnets <b>105</b> and tilt coils <b>110</b>, which may be used to detect unexpected tilt between lenses <b>140</b> and image sensor <b>145</b> and determine a tilt position for tilt lenses <b>140</b> to compensate for the unexpected tilt. In some embodiments, current of tilt coils <b>110</b> may be regulated, e.g., using a controller or driver of the tilt actuator, according to the feedback from tilt sensors <b>135</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the fixtures for the tilt coils may include one single fixture wrapping around a periphery of one or more lenses of camera <b>600</b>. The single fixture may be implemented following the steps indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B-<b>6</b>E</figref>. For instance, the process may start with a single rigid-flex circuit board including rigid circuit boards <b>631</b>, <b>632</b>, <b>633</b>, and <b>634</b> connected by flexible circuits <b>641</b>, <b>642</b>, and <b>643</b>. A rigid-flex circuit board may broadly refer to any hybrid circuit board that integrates components from both a rigid or hardboard and a flexible circuit. The flexible circuit may be folded or continuously flexed in various shapes to fit a specific space or area. In addition, the rigid circuit board (e.g., rigid circuit boards <b>631</b>, <b>632</b>, <b>633</b>, and/or <b>634</b>) may include multiple layers, and the flexible circuit (e.g., flexible circuits <b>641</b>, <b>642</b>, and/or <b>643</b>) may be buried internally and penetrate the rigid section of the rigid circuit board. As a result, the rigid-flex circuit board including the rigid circuit board (e.g., rigid circuit boards <b>631</b>, <b>632</b>, <b>633</b>, and <b>634</b>) and flexible circuit (e.g., flexible circuits <b>641</b>, <b>642</b>, and <b>643</b>) may become one single connected piece. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>E</figref>, the rigid-flex circuit board may further include one or more service loops to provide further flexibility to fold or bend flexible circuits <b>641</b>, <b>642</b>, and/or <b>643</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C-<b>6</b>E</figref>, the rigid-flex circuit board may be folded, e.g., around the three corners of camera <b>600</b> at the service loops, to become wrapped around the perimeter of camera <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>E</figref> show another example process to form fixtures for tilt coils, according to some embodiments.

The single fixture may be implemented following the steps indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B-<b>7</b>E</figref>. For instance, the process may start with two rigid circuit boards <b>731</b> and <b>733</b>, a first rigid-flex circuit board (including rigid circuit board <b>734</b> and flexible circuits <b>741</b> and <b>742</b>), and a second rigid-flex circuit board (including rigid circuit board <b>732</b> and flexible circuit <b>743</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B-<b>7</b>C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>D-<b>7</b>E</figref>, the first rigid-flex and the second rigid-flex circuit boards may be folded around the corners of camera <b>700</b> to be connected to rigid circuit boards <b>731</b> and <b>733</b>. For instance, flexible circuit <b>741</b> of the first rigid-flex circuit board may be folded around the northeast and southeast corners of camera <b>700</b> and then soldered to rigid circuit board <b>733</b>, e.g., using jet soldering at <b>751</b> and <b>752</b>. In addition, flexible circuit <b>743</b> of the second rigid-flex circuit board may be folded around the southwest corner of camera <b>700</b> and soldered to rigid circuit board <b>732</b>, e.g., using jet soldering at <b>753</b>. As a result, rigid circuit boards <b>731</b> and <b>733</b>, the first rigid-flex circuit board (including rigid circuit board <b>734</b> and flexible circuits <b>741</b> and <b>742</b>), and the second rigid-flex circuit board (including rigid circuit board <b>732</b> and flexible circuit <b>743</b>) may form a single fixture surrounding around a periphery of the lenses of camera <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> show an example embodiment for connecting a rigid circuit board and a flexible circuit, according to some embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, rigid circuit board <b>731</b> may include one or more pads <b>761</b>. In some embodiments, pads <b>761</b> may individually have an elongated shape, e.g., with a larger width than height, to accommodate length changes of flexible circuits <b>742</b> and <b>743</b>.

In some embodiments, tilt between lens(es) and an image sensor of a camera may be detected by a tilt actuator, e.g., based on measurement of one or more tilt sensors, as indicated in block <b>905</b>. As described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the camera may include one or more tilt sensors (e.g., position sensors) arranged surrounding a peripheral of the lenses of the camera. In some embodiments, the tilt sensors may operate in pairs to detect tilt around X- and/or Y-axes. For instance, two tilt sensors positioned opposite each other along X-axis may measure relative positions between corresponding tilt magnets and tilt coils arranged along X-axis. The measurement from the two tilt sensors may be processed, e.g., to produce a &#x201c;differential mode&#x201d; component indicating tilt between the lens(es) and image sensor around Y-axis and/or a &#x201c;common mode&#x201d; component indicating a position or distance between the lens(es) and image sensor along Z-axis. Similarly, other two tilt sensors arranged along another axis (e.g., Y-axis) may be used to detect tilt between the lens(es) and image sensor around X-axis. Note that in some embodiments, the camera may use more or less tilt sensors (e.g., three position sensors) to detect the unexpected tilt.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In response to detecting the tilt, a compensation angle may be determined for the lens(es) to compensate for the detected tilt, according to some embodiments, as indicated in block <b>910</b>. For instance, when it is detected that the lens(es) are tilted relative to the image sensor around X-axis clockwise at 0.02 degrees (e.g., +0.02 degrees), a compensation angle may be determined to be 0.02 degrees counter-clockwise around X-axis (e.g., &#x2212;0.02 degrees) for the lens(es). Next, current of one or more tilt coils of the tilt actuator may be regulated (e.g., in terms of values and/or polarities) to move the lens(es) according to the compensation angle to re-align the lens(es) with the image sensor of the camera, as indicated in block <b>915</b>. As described above, in some embodiments, the tilt coils of the camera may operate in pairs. Thus, depending on the tilt between the lens(es) and image sensor, one or more pairs of the tilt coils may be controlled to rotate the lens(es) approximately around one or more axes to compensate for the detected tilt.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a high-level flowchart showing techniques to adjust a focus of a camera, according to some embodiments. As described above, a tilt actuator of a camera may move lens(es) relative to an image sensor of the camera in a direction approximately parallel to an optical axis (e.g., Z-axis) of the lens(es). As indicated in block <b>1005</b>, a command position for the lens(es) relative to the image sensor may be obtained by the tilt actuator for adjusting a focus of the camera, according to some embodiments. The command position may indicate a relative distance and/or position of the lens(es) with respect to the image sensor along the optical axis (or Z-axis). Next, current of one or more tilt coils of the tilt actuator may be regulated to move the lens(es) relative to the image sensor to the command position, as indicated in block <b>1010</b>. As described above, in some embodiments, the tilt coils of the camera may operate in pairs. For the focus adjustment, one or more pairs of the tilt coils may be activated to generate the motive force (e.g., like counter-acting force F<b>1</b> and F<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) in a same direction to move the lens(es) relative to the image sensor along the optical axis (or Z-axis).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a schematic representation of an example device <b>1100</b> that may include a camera with tilt compensation, e.g., as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, according to some embodiments.
