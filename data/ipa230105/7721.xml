For this reason, 5G or pre-5G communication systems are called &#x2018;beyond 4G network&#x2019; communication systems or &#x2018;post Long Term Evolution (post-LTE)&#x2019; systems. To achieve high data rates, implementation of 5G communication systems in an ultra-high frequency or millimeter-wave (mmWave) band (e.g., a 60 GHz band) is being considered. To reduce path loss of radio waves and increase a transmission distance of radio waves in the ultra-high frequency band for 5G communication systems, various technologies such as beamforming, massive multiple-input and multiple-output (massive MIMO), full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antennas, analog beamforming, and large-scale antennas are being studied. To improve system networks for 5G communication systems, various technologies such as evolved small cells, advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (cloud RAN), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving networks, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), and interference cancellation have been developed. In addition, for 5G communication systems, advanced coding modulation (ACM) technologies such as hybrid frequency-shift keying (FSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC), and advanced access technologies such as filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA), have been developed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Internet has evolved from a human-based connection network, where humans create and consume information, to the Internet of things (IoT), where distributed elements such as objects exchange information with each other to process the information. Internet of everything (IoE) technology has emerged, in which the IoT technology is combined with, for example, technology for processing big data through connection with a cloud server or the like. To implement the IoT, various technological elements such as sensing technology, wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure, service interface technology, and security technology are required and, in recent years, technologies related to sensor networks for connecting objects, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and machine-type communication (MTC) have been studied. In the IoT environment, intelligent Internet technology (IT) services may be provided to collect and analyze data obtained from connected objects to create new value in human life. As existing information technology (IT) and various industries converge and combine with each other, the IoT may be applied to various fields such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, smart cars or connected cars, smart grids, health care, smart home appliances, and advanced medical services.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, various attempts have been made to apply the 5G communication systems (or New Radio (NR)) to the IoT networks. For example, technologies related to sensor networks, M2M communication, and MTC are being implemented by using 5G communication technology including beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud RAN as the above-described big data processing technology may be an example of convergence of 5G communication technology and IoT technology.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure provides a method and device for efficiently managing power in a wireless communication system when a terminal switches to a connected mode.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment, a method, performed by a terminal, for providing power preference information in a wireless communication system may include receiving, from a base station, configuration information about a connection release request, identifying a condition for transmission of a connection release request message, based on the received configuration information about the connection release request, and transmitting a connection release request message including whether there is a mode preferred by the terminal among an idle mode and an inactive mode or a preferred mode of the terminal, based on the identified condition.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an operation of transmitting, by a terminal, a connection release request message to a base station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram for describing a connection release request message according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram for describing a connection release request message according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram for describing a method of operating a prohibition timer of a connection release request message according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram for describing a method of operating a prohibition timer of a connection release request message according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an operation of transmitting a connection release request message according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an operation of transmitting a connection release request message according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an operation of transmitting a connection release request message according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a structure of a base station according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a structure of a terminal according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BEST MODE</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An embodiment of the disclosure may provide a terminal for transmitting state information in a wireless communication system.

Hereinafter, embodiments of the disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following description, terms for identifying access nodes, terms referring to network entities, terms referring to messages, terms referring to interfaces between network entities, terms referring to various identification information, and the like are used for convenience of description. Thus, the disclosure is not limited to the terms described below and other terms referring to objects having equivalent technical meanings may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the following description, terms and names defined in the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) standards may be used for convenience of description. However, the disclosure is not limited to such terms and names and may be similarly applied to systems according to other standards.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a representative example of the broadband wireless communication systems, LTE systems employ orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for a downlink (DL) and employs single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) for an uplink (UL). The uplink may refer to a radio link for transmitting data or a control signal from a terminal (e.g., a user equipment (UE) or a mobile station (MS)) to a base station (e.g., an eNode B (eNB) or a base station (BS)), and the downlink may refer to a radio link for transmitting data or a control signal from the base station to the terminal. The above-described multiple access schemes distinguish between data or control information of different users by allocating time-frequency resources for the data or control information of the users not to overlap each other, that is, to achieve orthogonality therebetween.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As post-LTE systems, 5G systems may have to support services capable of simultaneously satisfying various requirements because they may have to freely reflect various requirements of users, service providers, and the like. Services considered for the 5G systems may include enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliability low-latency communication (URLLC) services.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some embodiments, the eMBB may aim to provide an improved data rate than the data rate supported by the existing LTE, LTE-A, or LTE-Pro. For example, in a 5G communication system, the eMBB should be able to provide a peak data rate of 20 Gbps in a downlink and a peak data rate of 10 Gbps in an uplink from the viewpoint of a base station. Also, the 5G communication system may have to provide an increased user-perceived data rate of a terminal while providing a peak data rate. In order to satisfy this requirement, the 5G communication system may require the improvement of various transmission/reception technologies including a more improved Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) transmission technology. Also, the 5G communication system may satisfy a required data rate by using a frequency bandwidth wider than 20 MHz in the 3 GHz to 6 GHz or 6 GHz or more frequency band while transmitting signals by using a transmission bandwidth of up to 20 MHz in the 2 GHz band used in the current LTE.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Simultaneously, the mMTC is being considered to support application services such as Internet of Thing (IoT) in 5G communication systems. In order to efficiently provide the IoT, the mMTC may require the support for access of large terminals in a cell, improved terminal coverage, improved battery time, reduced terminal cost, and the like. Because the IoT is attached to various sensors and various devices to provide a communication function, it should be able to support a large number of terminals (e.g., 1,000,000 terminals/km<sup>2</sup>) in a cell. Also, because a terminal supporting the mMTC is likely to be located in a shadow area failing to be covered by the cell, such as the basement of a building, due to the characteristics of the service, it may require wider coverage than other services provided by the 5G communication systems. The terminal supporting the mMTC should be configured as a low-cost terminal and may require a very long battery life time of about 10 years to about 15 years because it is difficult to frequently replace the battery of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Lastly, the URLLC may be used in services for remote control of robots or machinery, industrial automation, unmanned aerial vehicles, remote health care, emergency alerts, and the like, as cellular-based wireless communication services used for mission-critical purposes. Thus, the communication provided by the URLLC may have to provide very low latency (ultra-low latency) and very high reliability (ultra-high reliability). For example, a service supporting the URLLC should satisfy an air interface latency of less than 0.5 milliseconds and simultaneously may have a requirement for a packet error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or less. Thus, for the service supporting the URLLC, the 5G system should provide a smaller transmit time interval (TTI) than other services and simultaneously may have a design requirement for allocating wide resources in frequency bands in order to secure the reliability of communication links.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The above three services of eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC considered in the 5G communication systems may be multiplexed and transmitted in one system.
