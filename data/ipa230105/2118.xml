However, once the food or item has left the restaurant, grocery store, or other seller, opportunities abound for intentional or accidental tampering of the food or other item. Tampering of the food or other item, or simply exposing the contents, not only impacts the safety/quality/quantity available, but these instances increase operational and customer service-related costs for both the delivery service and the supplier. Further still, the coronavirus pandemic has heightened awareness of the chain of custody of items prepared (e.g., food from restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, cruise lines, etc.), gathered (e.g., delivery services that shop at grocery stores on other's behalf), and packaged (e.g., prescription drug deliveries). A secure and economical secure mechanism for transport of food and other items is needed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification, illustrate exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, and, together with the detailed description below, serve to explain features of the disclosure.

The exemplary clips detailed herein can be used to secure/seal; one, or multiple bags/items. The exemplary clips detailed herein can be formed of any material capable of allowing the clips to function as detailed herein, but generally will be formed of plastic to allow the removable tab or pull tab to be flexible for detachment from another portion of the clip. In some cases, the peg(s) can pierce through the item being sealed. Optionally, as desired in other embodiments, a separate tool or device such as a hole punch, can be used to create hole(s) for the pegs. The peg can include tiered barbs/ribs to make the clip adjustable in a way, that in it can hold more layers of, and or thicker material in general, of the bags/items being sealed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0072">Although not shown in the exemplary figures, in at least one embodiment, the clip with or without a hinge could include three or more pegs and corresponding peg receivers. Additional pegs/receivers may be needed to secure lengthier versions of the clip. In at least one embodiment, the clip can use one pull tab to release every or all peg(s). In at least one embodiment, the clip can could use a separate pull tab to release each peg individually. Optionally, in at least one embodiment, the pull tab could release the peg receiver instead of the peg. In at least one embodiment, the pull tab could release multiple/all peg receivers.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0073">In at least one embodiment, the clip can incorporate barcodes, RFID tags, microchips, or any other technology for the purpose of tracking the clip and item(s) being sealed. Tracking can record either of, or any of the following data points; time, location, contents of items, names and contact information of the sender/shipper/merchant, the delivering/transporting party and any other intermediaries, and the intended recipient/customer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0074">In at least one embodiment, the exemplary clips detailed can include a hole or tunnel therethrough for adding an additional layer of security by providing an opening for a zip tie or other locking mechanism. Additionally, a hole or tunnel could also be used for storing and organizing the clips before use, e.g., with the use of a string, ring, or rod. Further, the holes could also be used to string or strap a number of closed clips together to make transportation easier.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0075">The exemplary clips detailed herein can be formed of any applicable method, including, for example, single injection molding, or could be manufactured in separate molds&#x2014;with the pegs and/or peg receivers being separately manufactured and then attached to the clip. In one exemplary design, the pegs and peg receivers could be inserted into pre built-in holes, allowing extra strength and security to be added as needed.
