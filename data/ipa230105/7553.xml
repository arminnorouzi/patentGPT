It has been agreed that carrier aggregation (CA) which is used in Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced to increase the bandwidth will be supported in the NR system. When CA is used, there are a number of serving cells. Generally, a primary cell (PCell) and at least one secondary cell (SCell) are provided. A beam failure may occur when the quality of beam pair(s) of a serving cell falls low enough (for example, comparison with a threshold or time-out of an associated timer).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A beam failure recovery (BFR) procedure is a mechanism for recovering beams when all or part of beams serving user equipment (UE) has failed. BFR may be also referred to as link reconfiguration or link recovery. Aim of BFR is to detect when one or more physical downlink control channels (PDCCH) links are considered to be in failure conditions and recover the link. To recover the link, UE initiates signaling towards network to indicate beam failure and a new potential link (beam) called candidate link (beam). As a response to beam failure recovery request (BFRR) received from the UE, the network may configure UE with a new PDCCH link. BFR of a SCell (which is also referred to as SCell BFR herein) event is reported to the network by means of dedicated uplink signal and SCell BFR media access control (MAC) control element (CE) or just SCell BFR MAC CE.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, example embodiments of the present disclosure provide a solution for failure recovery for serving cell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first aspect, there is provided a terminal device.

To better understand the principle and example embodiments of the present disclosure, a brief introduction to the beam failure detection (BFD) and BFR is now described below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">As mentioned above, SCell BFR event is reported to the network device by means of SCell BFR MAC CE. The SCell BFD is performed per cell and the BFD mechanism for SpCell is adopted for SCell BFD. Furthermore, there can be multiple beam failure detection triggers triggering the transmission of the SCell BFR MAC CE while the SCell BFR MAC CE is already pending for transmission.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">As a result, in beam failure detection and recovery procedure, for each serving cell configured for beam failure detection, if beam failure instance indication has been received from lower layers (for example, physical layer), the MAC entity shall start or restart the timer for the beam failure detection, such as the beamFailureDetectionTimer, and further increments BFI_COUNTER, which is the counter for beam failure instance indication and is initially set to 0, by 1. When the BFI_COUNTER is equal to or exceeds a threshold, for example beamFailureInstanceMaxCount, the MAC layer shall trigger BFR if the serving cell is SCell.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">If the BFR procedure determines that at least one BFR has been triggered and not cancelled, the MAC entity shall determine whether uplink shared (UL-SCH) resources are available for a new transmission and whether the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SCell BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization. If it is determined that UL-SCH resources are available and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SCell BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization, the MAC entity shall instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the SCell BFR MAC CE. Otherwise, the MAC entity shall trigger a Scheduling Request (SR) for SCell BFR.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">The BFR triggering (which occurs for the SCell specifically) as well as the result of the MAC action (MAC entity specifically) is described above. In general, the MAC entity will check if it has UL resources to send SCell BFR MAC CE and if it has the UL resources, it will generate SCell BFR MAC CE and send the SCell BFR MAC CE by using the given UL resources. If it does not have the UL resources, it will trigger the SR procedure to request UL resources and to send the SCell BFR MAC CE by using the UL resources allocated for BFR.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">A network device may configure a terminal device with a set of reference signals (RSs) for monitoring the quality of the link. For example, the terminal device (such as a UE) may be provided, for a serving cell, a set <o ostyle="single">q</o><sub>0 </sub>of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes. In non-discontinuous reception (DRX) mode operation, the physical layer in the terminal device provides an indication to higher layers (for example, the MAC layer) when the radio link quality for all corresponding resource configurations in the set <o ostyle="single">q</o><sub>0 </sub>that the terminal device uses to assess the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q<sub>out,LR</sub>. The physical layer informs the higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q<sub>out,LR </sub>with a periodicity determined by the maximum between the shortest periodicity among the periodic CSI-RS configurations and/or SS/PBCH blocks in the set <o ostyle="single">q</o><sub>0 </sub>that the terminal device uses to assess the radio link quality and 2 msec. In DRX mode operation, the physical layer provides an indication to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q<sub>out,LR </sub>with a periodicity determined as described in TS 38.133.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">The indication provided by the physical layer to the higher layers refers to the beam failure instance indication described above with respect to the MAC entity. As can be seen, the physical layer indicates the beam failure instance indication periodically to the MAC layer when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q<sub>out,LR</sub>, i.e. when all the failure detection resources in set of <o ostyle="single">q</o><sub>0 </sub>are determined to be in failure condition. When link quality is not worse than threshold, no indication is provided to the MAC layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">In view of the above, whenever the beams are in failure condition on a given cell, the physical layer will indicate the beam failure instance indication to the MAC layer periodically as described above. Given this principle about the MAC behavior for SCell BFR, every indication will trigger a new SCell BFR MAC CE (and trigger the dedicated SR transmission/CBRA in case no uplink resources are available) even though the terminal device would have already sent the SCell BFR MAC CE to the network device concerning the same beam failure event.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The beam failure detection procedure is only reset when the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) acknowledgement (ACK) is received on the HARQ process that that was used to transmit the SCell BFR MAC CE or an UL grant for new transmission is received for the HARQ process which is considered as an ACK for the previous transport block (TB) since there is no Physical HARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH) in NR system. Even in the case of successful beam failure recovery based on successful delivery of SCell BFR MAC CE, the failure detection reference signals are not reconfigured as part of the procedure and the terminal device still performs failure detection based on the BFD-RS of the failed cell. This will most likely trigger new beam failure recovery for the same SCell. Hence, the terminal device may end up sending the same SCell BFR MAC CE with information about the same cell(s) unnecessarily for multiple times.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">In contrast, SpCell BFR may be triggered similarly subsequently while the other one is still ongoing. However, for SpCell BFR, this may not matter as the BFR procedure is using the random access (RA) procedure and only one RA procedure can be concurrently ongoing in the terminal device. In addition, the contention free random access (CFRA) procedure is not considered to be complete (from physical layer perspective) until the terminal device has been reconfigured with new active Transmission Configuration Indication (TCI) state for PDCCH reception (i.e., with new PDCCH beam).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Therefore, regarding BFR for a serving cell, especially for the SCells, it is desirable to have a solution to avoid unnecessary beam failure report. In particular, a solution for preventing unnecessary SCell BFR MAC CE transmission is needed. Similar issues also occur when the terminal device reports UL LBT failure on a serving cell. Hence, it is also desirable to have a solution to avoid unnecessary LBT failure report.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, there is proposed a solution for failure recovery for a serving cell, and in particular for beam failure recovery of SCell or for reporting consistent UL LBT failure of SCell. In the present disclosure, a solution about how to prevent successive unnecessary failure reports (for example, SCell BFR MAC CE reports and UL LBT MAC CE reports) due to frequent recovery triggers is exemplified. If a failure such as a beam failure or an LBT failure is detected on a serving cell of a terminal device, the terminal device may initiate a first recovery procedure and transmit information concerning the detected failure to a network device in the first recovery procedure. The terminal device then disables further transmission of the already transmitted information.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">The terminal device may disable the further transmission based on whether one or more criterion or condition has been satisfied, for example whether a corresponding timer is running, whether a response has been received or whether the information has been updated. The solution for failure recovery in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure can be adapted to the beam failure recovery and LBT failure recovery. In this way, unnecessary failure reports can be avoided, for example, unnecessary SCell BFR MAC CE reports and unnecessary UL LBT MAC CE reports can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">Principle and implementations of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which illustrates a flowchart illustrating an example process <b>200</b> for beam failure recovery according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. For the purpose of discussion, the process <b>200</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The process <b>200</b> may involve the network device <b>110</b> and the terminal device <b>120</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">In the example process <b>200</b>, the terminal device <b>120</b> detects <b>205</b> a failure on a serving cell of the terminal device <b>120</b>. If the failure is detected on the serving cell, the terminal device <b>120</b> may obtain information concerning the detected failure, which may be referred to as failure information or failure recovery information herein. The detected failure may be an UL LBT failure and/or a beam failure on the serving cell. In the case of beam failure, such information may include an identification of the serving cell and identification(s) of one or more candidate beams for the serving cell and may be referred to as beam failure information herein. In the case of UL LBT failure, such information may include an identification of the serving cell.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">For example, in the case of beam failure, for the SCell <b>102</b>, a lower layer (e.g. the physical layer) may provide the beam failure instance indication to the MAC layer of the terminal device <b>120</b> and the MAC layer may increment the BFI_COUNTER by 1. When the value of BFI_COUNTER exceeds or equal to a threshold, the terminal device <b>120</b> may determine that a beam failure is detected on the SCell <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">In response to the failure being detected, a recovery procedure for the serving cell is initiated and this procedure may be referred to as a first recovery procedure for purpose of discussion. For example, the MAC entity of the terminal device <b>120</b> may trigger BFR for the serving cell, such as for the SCell <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">Then, in the first recovery procedure, the terminal device <b>120</b> transmits <b>210</b> the failure information of the service cell (e.g., the SCell <b>102</b>) to the network device <b>110</b>, which is associated with the serving cell or in other words provides the serving cell to the terminal device <b>120</b>. For example, in the case of beam failure, the beam failure information of SCell <b>102</b> may be included in a SCell BFR MAC CE. If more than one BFR have been triggered, the SCell BFR MAC CE may include beam failure information of all the serving cells for which BFR has been triggered and/or is pending. For example, if beam failure is also detected on the SCell <b>103</b>, the SCell BFR MAC CE may also include beam failure information of the SCell <b>103</b>. If available UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SCell BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization, the terminal device <b>120</b> may transmit the SCell BFR MAC CE by using the available UL-SCH resources. Otherwise, the terminal device <b>120</b> may trigger a scheduling request for SCell BFR to transmit the SCell BFR MAC CE after receiving an UL grant. It is to be understood that the SCell BFR MAC CE may also include beam failure information of the SpCell, for example PCell <b>101</b>. In the case of consistent UL LBT failure, UL LBT MAC CE similar to the SCell BFR MAC CE is transmitted to the network device <b>110</b> to indicate the failed serving cell(s).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">After transmitting the failure information, the terminal device <b>120</b> disables <b>215</b> further transmission of the same failure information to the network device <b>110</b>. As an example, the terminal device <b>120</b> may disable transmission of the same failure information in another recovery procedure for the same serving cell, which may be referred to as a second recovery procedure for purpose of discussion. For example, after transmitting the SCell BFR MAC CE which includes the beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b>, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent another SCell BFR MAC CE including the same beam failure information from being transmitted in another BFR procedure for the SCell <b>102</b>. As used herein, the act &#x201c;disable&#x201d; may be implemented by means of the acts &#x201c;prevent&#x201d;, &#x201c;prohibit&#x201d; or the like. Disabling the further transmission of the failure information may mean directly preventing or prohibiting the failure information from being transmitted, or means preventing or prohibiting a recovery procedure in which the same failure information would otherwise be transmitted from being triggered or initiated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">In one example aspect, one or more criterions or conditions can be utilized by the terminal device <b>120</b> to determine whether to disable the further transmission of the failure information. If the one or more criterions or conditions are satisfied, the further transmission of the failure information may be disabled. Some example embodiments are described now. Only for purpose of discussion without any limitation, in the following description, the SCell <b>102</b> is taken as an example of the serving cell on which failure has been detected.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">In some example embodiments, a timer with a valid period may be introduced and the terminal device <b>120</b> may disable the further transmission of the failure information based on whether the timer is running or not. For example, new recovery procedure for the SCell <b>102</b> may be prevented from being triggered if the timer is running. Such a timer may be referred to as a prohibit timer for purpose of discussion without any limitation. In the case of beam failure, the prohibit timer may be used to prevent the MAC entity of the terminal device <b>120</b> from triggering another BFR for the SCell <b>102</b> when the terminal device <b>120</b> is waiting for a response from the network device <b>110</b> to the transmitted SCell BFR MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">In one example embodiment, the terminal device <b>120</b> may start the prohibit timer associated with the SCell <b>102</b> upon the transmission of the failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> in the first recovery procedure, for example upon the transmission of the SCell BFR MAC CE which includes the beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> or upon instructing the multiplexing and assembly entity to generate the SCell BFR MAC CE which includes the beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b>. The terminal device <b>120</b> may disable the further transmission of the failure information in the new recovery procedure for the SCell <b>102</b> before the prohibit timer expires or when the prohibit timer is running. For example, new BFR for the SCell <b>102</b> cannot be triggered while the prohibit timer is running or the BFR for the SCell <b>102</b> can be triggered but the SCell BFR MAC CE cannot be instructed to be generated by the multiplexing and assembly entity.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">In one example embodiments, if the prohibit timer expires, the terminal device <b>120</b> may enable the second recovery procedure for the SCell <b>102</b> and transmit the failure information again to the network device <b>110</b>. For example, when the prohibit timer expires, the MAC entity of the terminal device <b>120</b> may trigger another BFR for the SCell <b>102</b> in case further beam failure instance indication is received from the lower layers. In other words, when further beam failure instance indication is received from the lower layer, the terminal device <b>120</b> may initiate a new beam failure recovery procedure and transmit the SCell BFR MAC CE including the beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> to the network device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">In one example embodiments, if the terminal device <b>120</b> receives from the network device <b>110</b> a response to the failure information of the SCell <b>102</b>, the terminal device <b>120</b> may stop the prohibit timer. For example, the prohibit timer can be stopped when a response from the network device <b>110</b> to the transmitted MAC CE (for example, SCell BFR MAC CE or UL LBT MAC CE) is received. Such a response from the network device <b>110</b> may be e.g., HARQ ACK or an UL grant for new transmission to the HARQ process where the MAC CE was transmitted.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">As such, the prohibit timer may be used as a criterion for disabling the further transmission of the failure information for SCell <b>102</b>. In other words, the terminal device <b>120</b> may enable transmission of the failure information in a new recovery procedure when the prohibit timer expires and may disable transmission of the failure information in a new recovery procedure while the prohibit timer is running. For example, the terminal device <b>120</b> may trigger new BFR after the prohibit timer expires but shall not trigger new BFR while the prohibit timer is running.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">The prohibit timer may be configured either per serving cell or per MAC entity. The prohibit timer may also be configured per group of SCells. The group may be a set of SCells determined by the terminal device <b>120</b> (e.g. based on configured TCI states for PDCCH or based on the failure detection reference signals used for beam failure detection) or the group may be explicitly configured by the network device <b>110</b>. The group of SCells may also refer to PUCCH group (of SCells) e.g. SCells that have the same associated PUCCH configuration (e.g. one of the SCells have the PUCCH configured for uplink control transmission and the uplink control of one or more SCells are associated with the said PUCCH configuration). The terminal device <b>120</b> may be configured with one or more PUCCH groups.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">In the case where the prohibit timer is configured per serving cell, the SCell <b>102</b> may have a dedicated timer. In the case where the prohibit timer is configured per MAC entity, the prohibit timer is common for all the failed cells of which the failure information has been included in the MAC CE. For example, a BFR procedure for another serving cell (e.g, the SCell <b>103</b>) of which the failure information has not been included in the previously transmitted MAC CE can still be triggered even if the prohibit timer is running. In this case, the terminal device <b>120</b> may generate a new MAC CE with a multiple entries which includes the failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> and failure information of the other serving cell (e.g, the SCell <b>103</b>). Alternatively, the new MAC CE may not include the failure information of SCell <b>102</b> but includes failure information of the other serving cell (e.g., the SCell <b>103</b>). Upon transmission of the newly generated MAC CE which can indicate all the failed cells, the prohibit timer is restarted.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">In some example embodiments, when the terminal device <b>120</b> transmits failure information of one or more failed SCells and cannot accommodate all the information (e.g. failed SCell index and potential candidate beam if exists) in the granted uplink resources, it may prioritize specific SCells which to report or it may prioritize candidate beam information on specific failed cells. In one example, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prioritize the reporting of SCell that has been configured with PUCCH i.e. a PUCCH SCell. In another example, the prioritization may be used when the terminal device <b>120</b> reports a single entry BFR MAC CE (e.g. the terminal device <b>120</b> may need to generate multiple MAC CEs to indicate information of multiple failed SCells) or when the terminal device <b>120</b> reports multi-entry BFR MAC CE where the terminal device <b>120</b> can indicate information on multiple failed SCells in a single MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">In the example embodiments where the prohibit timer is used as a criterion or condition, the network device <b>110</b> may configure the prohibit timer to the terminal device <b>120</b>. For example, the length of the valid period can be configured by the network device. The network device <b>110</b> may determine the configuration information concerning the prohibit timer and transmit the configuration information to the terminal device <b>120</b>, for example via RRC signaling.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">In some example embodiments, whether a response to the transmitted <b>210</b> failure information has been received from the network device <b>110</b> may be used as a criterion or condition. For example, the terminal device <b>120</b> may disable the further transmission of the failure information in the second recovery procedure before the response to the transmitted failure information (for example, previously transmitted SCell BFR MAC CE) is received from the network device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">In some example embodiments, such a response may be at least one of a HARQ ACK to the transmitted failure information, an UL grant for transmission other than retransmission of the failure information, a command to activate or reconfigure a TCI state for the SCell <b>102</b>, or an indication that the SCell <b>102</b> is de-configured, deactivated or switched into a dormant state. For example, in the case of beam failure, such a response may be a HARQ ACK or an UL grant for new transmission to the HARQ process where the SCell BFR MAC CE was transmitted; TCI state activation command or reconfiguration command for the given failed SCell <b>102</b>; an indication that the SCell <b>102</b> is de-configured, deactivated or put to into dormant state; any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">In some example embodiments, the terminal device <b>120</b> may enable the second recovery procedure for the SCell <b>102</b> if the failure information needed to report the network device <b>110</b> has been updated. If the terminal device <b>120</b> determines that the failure information for the SCell <b>102</b> has been updated, the terminal device <b>120</b> may enable the second recovery procedure, and transmit the updated failure information to the network device <b>110</b> in the second recovery procedure. For example, even if the prohibit timer is running or a response to the previously transmitted failure information has not been received from the network device <b>110</b>, a MAC CE including the updated failure information can be transmitted to the network device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">In some example embodiments, the transmitted <b>210</b> failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> is included in a first MAC CE, and the first MAC CE may also include failure information of another serving cell, for example the SCell <b>103</b>. If the failure information of the SCell <b>103</b> has been updated, then the terminal device <b>120</b> may enable a recovery procedure for the SCell <b>103</b> and generate a second MAC CE which comprises the failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> and the updated failure information of the SCell <b>103</b>. Then, the terminal device <b>120</b> may transmit the second MAC CE to the network device <b>110</b> in the recovery procedure for the SCell <b>103</b>. The first and second MAC CE information may be transmitted in a single MAC CE or separate MAC CEs.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">In any of the example embodiments herein, the SCell BFR information may be provided in a single entry format (only information on one of the failed SCells is provided) or multi entry format (information of multiple SCells is accommodated in single MAC CE). A plurality of single entry MAC CEs may be included in a single MAC PDU and/or UL resource.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">As an example, beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> and SCell <b>103</b> may be included a SCell BFR MAC CE which has been transmitted to the network device <b>110</b>. If the terminal device <b>120</b> determines that the beam failure information of the SCell <b>103</b> has been updated, then a new BFR for the SCell <b>103</b> may be triggered and a new SCell BFR MAC CE including the beam failure information of the SCell <b>102</b> and the updated beam failure information of the SCell <b>103</b> may be generated and transmitted to the network device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">In some cases, the terminal device <b>120</b> may transmit single entry MAC CE to indicate failure information on failed SCell, and while the MAC CE is pending and one or more SCells are determined to be in failure condition, the terminal device <b>120</b> may generate and trigger multi-entry SCell BFR MAC CE. In some examples, the terminal device <b>120</b> may disregard the prohibit timer and transmit the MAC CE or transmit an indication (dedicated SR for BFR).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">For the case of beam failure, some examples of update to the failure information are described. As an example, if the terminal device <b>120</b> has previously reported no candidate beam for the failed SCell in the previously transmitted MAC CE and a candidate beam (i.e. candidate RS that has signal quality above RSRP/RSRQ/SINR-threshold) is identified and needed to report to the network device <b>110</b>, then the terminal device <b>120</b> may determine that the failure information has been be updated. In this case, the terminal device <b>120</b> may trigger dedicated SR transmission/Contention Based Random Access (CBRA) to provide a new MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0081">As another example, the terminal device <b>120</b> has previously reported a candidate beam above the threshold but the previously reported candidate beam is not above the threshold anymore and another candidate beam that is above the threshold can be indicated. In this case, the terminal device <b>120</b> may determine that the failure information of the failed cell has been updated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0082">As a further example, the terminal device <b>120</b> has previously reported a candidate beam above the threshold but the previously reported candidate beam is not above the threshold anymore and no other candidate can be indicated.

In another example aspect, disabling the further transmission of the same failure information in the second recovery procedure may be implemented at a variety of levels. As an example, the lower layer(s) may be prevented from detecting the failure or from providing an indication of the failure to a higher layer, for example the MAC layer. As another example, the MAC layer may prevent the second recovery procedure from being triggered or initiated even if failure detection is performed by the lower layers. As a further example, the MAC CE including the same failure information as the previously transmitted MAC CE may be prevented from being transmitted even if the second recovery procedure has been triggered. Some example embodiments in this regard are now described.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">In some example embodiments, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent a lower layer from providing an instance indication for the failed serving cell (for example, the SCell <b>102</b>) to a MAC layer of the terminal device <b>120</b>. The instance indication may be used for triggering a recovery procedure for the failed serving cell. In the case of beam failure, the physical layer is prevented from providing the beam failure instance indication for the SCell <b>102</b> to the MAC layer when BFR for the SCell <b>102</b> is pending. For example, when the prohibit timer associated with the SCell <b>102</b> is running or before a response to the transmitted SCell BFR MAC CE is received from the network device <b>110</b>, the physical layer is prevented or prohibited from providing the beam failure instance indication to the MAC layer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">In some example embodiments, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent the MAC layer of the terminal device <b>120</b> from initiating the second recovery procedure. In other words, the terminal device <b>120</b> will not trigger the second recovery procedure before the previous, first recovery procedure has been canceled. For example, if there is a pending/triggered BFR for the failed SCell <b>102</b>, the MAC entity does not trigger a new BFR before the previous BFR has been cancelled, even if the beam failure instance indication(s) is received from the lower layer.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">In some example embodiments, the terminal device <b>120</b> may not react on or response to the beam failure instance indication(s) from the lower layer for the failed SCell <b>102</b>. In one example embodiment, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent a counter for instance indication from being increased, and the instance indication is used for triggering a recovery procedure for the SCell <b>102</b>. For example, in the case of beam failure, the BFI_COUNTER for the SCell <b>102</b> may not be incremented even if the beam failure instance indication for the SCell <b>102</b> is received from the physical layer. In one example embodiment, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent a timer for failure detection of the SCell <b>102</b> from being started. In the case of beam failure, the beamFailureDetectionTimer for the SCell <b>102</b> may not be started even if the beam failure instance indication for the SCell <b>102</b> is received from the physical layer.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0087">In some example embodiments where the failure information of the failed cell(s) is included in a MAC CE, the terminal device <b>120</b> may prevent a further MAC CE with the same information as the previously transmitted MAC CE from being transmitted.

In one example, the terminal device <b>120</b> cancels the pending SR for beam failure recovery and/or the pending SCell BFR MAC CE concerning failure information of, e.g. SCell <b>102</b> only when the SCell BFR MAC CE is multiplexed into a MAC PDU that is transmitted on a non-failed SCell (e.g., SCell <b>103</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the terminal device <b>120</b> performs the cancelling only if the SCell BFR MAC CE is multiplexed into a MAC PDU that is transmitted on SpCell (PCell/PSCell). In these cases, the terminal device <b>120</b> may not disable triggering beam failure recovery for SCell <b>102</b>, transmission of BFR SR for beam failure recovery, or transmission of SCell BFR MAC CE including the failure information of SCell <b>102</b> unless the SCell BFR MAC CE is transmitted on a non-failed SCell (e.g., SCell <b>103</b>). In other words, if SCell BFR MAC CE is transmitted in SCell <b>102</b> where beam failure is detected, the disabling is not enforced. By doing this, the network device <b>110</b> losing the failure information of SCell <b>102</b> reported by the terminal device <b>120</b> can be mitigated as well as failure reporting procedure can be faster.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0089">In one further example embodiment, if the SR configuration for beam failure recovery is provided on PUCCH SCell and in case beam failure is detected on PUCCH SCell, the terminal device <b>120</b> triggers Random Access procedure on SpCell (PCell/PSCell). This is to ensure that UL resources are granted on SpCell which can be used to transmit the SCell BFR MAC CE when the SR for beam failure recovery is likely going to fail on PUCCH SCell (in case beam failure is detected on that PUCCH SCell).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0090">Aspects described above are equally applicable to consistent UL LBT failure detection.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0091">Aspects described above with respect to different example embodiments can be combined.
