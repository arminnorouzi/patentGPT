Both technologies have high requirements about the intensity and incident angle of laser source and the sensitivity of photo detector. Additionally, these sensor chips used are made of precious metals (e.g., gold for SPR) or integrated with specific micro/nano structures (e.g., diffraction grating for SPR) which increase the difficulties of manufacture and their associated costs. Moreover, the whole systems are difficult to miniaturize, hindering their applications accordingly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The commonly used optical biosensors for living cell detection employ surface plasmon resonance and resonant waveguide. Both technologies exploit evanescent waves to characterize the dynamic behaviors of a biological layer at or near the sensor surface. However, these optical sensors highly rely on laser system which are costly and may lead to potential optical cytotoxicity for living cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another commonly used biosensing technique relies on detecting electrical signals (e.g., impedance) to monitor change in cell status (number, morphology, adherence); however, this method might be disturbed by external electromagnetic wave because it commonly works at a fixed frequency to calculate the impedance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention.

So far, many techniques have been developed to fulfill the requirement of real-time and high-throughput cellular analysis, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), resonant waveguide grating biosensor (RWG), electric cell-substrate impedance method (ECSI) etc. Although these technologies can be employed for cellular adhesion analysis, their complicated preparation process, equipment dependence and high costs may restrict their wide applications. As described herein, the label-free detection of cellular physiological activities using a low-cost miniaturized photonic chip is demonstrated. Specifically, the local refractive index changes are monitored, as well as the morphological changes, associated with cellular activities, by using a single ultracompact LED chip serving as a refractometer.

Unfortunately, existing approaches such as fluorescent staining and impedance-based methods are often hindered by their multiple time-consuming preparation steps, sophisticated labeling procedures, and complicated apparatus. The cost-effective, monolithic GaN photonic chip is demonstrated herein as an ultrasensitive and ultracompact optical refractometer. Here, for the first time, the so-called GaN chipscope to quantitatively monitor the progression of different intracellular processes in a label-free manner. Specifically, the GaN-based monolithic chip enables not only a photoelectric readout of cellular/subcellular refractive index changes but also the direct imaging of cellular/subcellular ultrastructural features using a customized differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. The miniaturized chipscope adopts an ultra-compact design, which can be readily mounted with conventional cell culture dishes and placed inside standard cell incubators for real-time observation of cell activities. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the following applications are explored: 1) cell adhesion dynamics monitoring, 2) drug screening, and 3) cell differentiation studies, highlighting its potential in broad fundamental cell biology studies as well as in clinical applications.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">Moving beyond the mere &#x201c;snapshot&#x201d; provided by conventional endpoint assays (e.g., colorimetry), live cell sensing technologies have become more popular recently in biosensor development due to their ability to achieve real-time monitoring of biological processes such as adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis. This ability may eventually lead to important new applications in drug discovery, cell invasion and migration monitoring, and toxicity detection. In particular, the rapidly advancing biotechnology industry has called for sensors with features such as miniaturization, intellectualization, expansibility, multi-functionalization and low cost.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">Herein, described is the development of a low-cost, highly integrated, and incubator-compatible GaN-based RI chipscope for label-free monitoring of cellular activities. Specifically, the chip incorporating a mini-DIC microscope allows not only to perform real-time photocurrent measurement (and hence track changes in cell morphology, motions and cell-cell interactions), but also to collect brightfield live-cell images simultaneously. Utilizing this chipscope, the adhesion-spreading-detaching dynamics of cells is successfully tracked. The device is also capable of capturing drug-induced cancer cell apoptosis and immune cell differentiation, demonstrating its potential for use in practical biosensing applications.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Design of GaN Chipscope for Sensing and Imaging</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Real-time monitoring of the activities of living cells and their therapeutic responses is vital for applications such as disease diagnosis and pharmacodynamic analysis. Here, an integrated miniature sensing and imaging system is employed to achieve this. Specifically, the system consists of two core components: i) a monolithic optoelectronic chip; and ii) a mini-differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy unit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> <i>a </i>and <i>b</i>). The former integrated light-emitting diode (LED) and photodetector (PD) on a GaN/sapphire chip through wafer-scale processes (See Methods). Importantly, the LED and PD parts were electrically isolated to each other, but can work independently by connecting to a current source and an ammeter, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>d</i></figref>. In this sense, a triangular LED with a side length of 238 &#x3bc;m was located at the center of the chip, whereas the surroundings corresponded to the light-detecting region, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>. The DIC unit used a prism to split the linearly polarized light into two rays which experienced different optical paths due to the varied thickness of the specimen. Hence, the light beams with different phases caused by optical path differences underwent interference and generate amplitude fluctuations to form the DIC images (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>). The exposed sapphire substrate is favorable in direct contact with cells, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>. Several such miniature systems were fabricated on a 1&#xd7;1 mm<sup>2 </sup>chip, bonded on a printed circuit board (PCB), to connect with a current source and ammeter easily. Additionally, to ensure that cells could be cultured on the chip, a mini-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber (1&#xd7;1 cm<sup>2</sup>) is fabricated to enclose the chip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Importantly, the dimensions of the device were only 7&#xd7;17&#xd7;37 cm, allowing it to be placed and work in a cell incubator (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>). Detailed setup descriptions are provided in Methods below.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Sensing Principle of the Optoelectronic Chip</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0047">As a monolithic integration design of the chip, the same shared sapphire substrate can realize the light coupling from the LED to the PD without any external optics, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>. In particular, when the lights emitted from LED reached external media with a low RI (i.e., n<sub>media</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>sapphire</sub>), total internal reflection occurred at the sapphire/media interface, causing some light to be reflected into the light-detecting region. The intensity of the reflected light is then detected by the PD. Since the critical angle enlarges as the refractive index increases, less light is reflected back to the PD, resulting in a decrease in the photocurrent. When the cells are in contact with the chip surface, the sensor provides a rapid photocurrent response due to the obvious RI change from sapphire-culture medium (1.78 to 1.337) to sapphire-cells (1.78 to 1.343-1.48). Furthermore, the formation of strong cell-substrate adhesion and/or the evolution of cell morphology could also result in changes in the recorded photocurrent.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Demonstration of Optical and Electrical Performance and Sensing Ability</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0048">Before applying this chip device for monitoring cellular behaviors, some basic electrical characteristics of the on-chip LED and PD were conducted (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Glycerin/water mixtures are used to test the sensing sensitivity, response speed, and stability of the chip device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the detected photocurrent as a function of glycerin concentration, varying from 0% to 50% and therefore altering the medium RI. Extracted from the fitted linear slope, the sensitivity of the sensor is found to be around 18.93 nA/% (or 149216 nA/RIU). The sensing resolution of the chip device was found to be 2.641&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>%, which is determined by the resolution of the Keithley 2450 ammeter of 0.05 nA. Next, the chip response speed was quantified by a cycle test by switching the testing mediums between glycerin solution and air. The chip device responded very quickly showing only 0.169 s for the decline time T1 (from air to glycerin) and 0.386 s for the rise time T2 (from glycerin to air) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>). The rapid response time was mainly contributed to the fast photon-electron conversion property of the chip device incorporating InGaN/GaN MQWs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Additionally, compared with reported methods in sensing media refractive index, this sensor exhibited a comparable sensing resolution but a much larger sensing range (RI: 1.333-1.48) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>c</i></figref>). Herein, the theoretical sensing range will be larger (up to 1.78 of sapphire) based on the working principle of this sensor. Lastly, we conducted the simulation by building a sandwich model with sapphire-intermediate-sensing layer to characterize the vertical sensing range of the chip in water. The maximum theoretical vertical sensing ranges is 500 nm and 300 nm in water and air, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>). The demonstration of the chip device in high sensing sensitivity, range, resolution, vertical sensing ranges and rapid response speed demonstrates its potential ability to detect more challengeable cell behaviors.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Assessing Visible Cellular Dynamics Via the Monolithic GaN Photonic Chipscope</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0049">As a proof of concept that the GaN chipscope is capable of tracking the activities of living cells, the ability to sense cell adhesion is studied, a process that is critical for the formation of tissues and organs and participates in a large number of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell differentiation, immune response, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. In general, cell adhesion includes three steps: cell precipitation and initial cell-substrate contact, cell flattening and full spreading (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref>). During these processes, the main observable change is the morphological transition of the cell from being spherical to flat, resulting in a gradual increase in the coverage of cells on the chip surface. This significantly changes the average RI contrast at the cell-chip interface, thereby altering the photocurrent generated by the PD.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">NIH 3T3 cells are used in the present study due to their rapid adhesion response and significant cell area changes during spreading. First performed a live/dead assay test to evaluate the potential phototoxicity of the chip to the cells. The results showed that cells exposed to green light in both continuous and pulsed modes maintained relatively high viability (&#x3e;80%) even after 24 h of treatment, indicating that our sensor chip is biocompatible for long-term cell measurement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Next, after the chip was stabilized in the incubator at 37&#xb0; C., the cell suspension was added into the chip chamber. Interestingly, the photocurrent dropped sharply by approximately 2.17%) in the next 30 min (despite some initial signal fluctuations), then decreased much more slowly for another 4.5 h before becoming saturated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>c</i></figref>). Benefitting from the integrated mini-DIC imaging system, we can clearly capture the cell morphology changes in real-time. As shown in the top panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>, the round cells gradually precipitated onto the chip surface in the first 30 min (step 1), and then started to extend in the next 4 h (step 2). After that, they continued to flatten and formed a dense monolayer sheet covering the entire chip surface (step 3). These observed cell morphology changes closely matched the optical response of the chip, indicating the successful integration of GaN chip-based sensing and DIC imaging units in our system for cellular activity monitoring. Additionally, to mimic the cell detachment process (step 4), we treated the cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a known surfactant that can detach and lyse adhering cells from culture dishes or flasks. Unsurprisingly, the cell monolayer became completely detached from the chip surface within a few seconds of SDS loading (figures not shown). Accordingly, the signal showed a rapid increase (4.24%) after the addition of SDS, and then slowly returned to the level corresponding to the photocurrent value before cell seeding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>d</i></figref>). This demonstrated that our platform could not only capture the instant RI changes at the chip-medium interface, but also exhibited excellent stability for long-term measurement.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">As a control experiment, we also coated the chip surface with antifouling polymers (see the detailed protocol and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> in 11) that can effectively prevent cell-surface adhesion. Under such circumstances, cells were found to roll onto (rather than attach to) the chip surface in the first hour. Aggregation of cells took place in the next 8 hours, while no cell spreading was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>). Interestingly, despite a slight decrease of photocurrent by 0.55% in the first 60 min, the signal largely remained constant throughout the experiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>c</i></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Accessing Invisible Cellular Dynamics Via the Monolithic GaN Photonic Chipscope</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0052">To investigate the ability of the GaN chipscope to recognize intracellular dynamics, the chipscope responses under the stimulation of cells with various biomolecules and chemicals are measured and compared in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The photocurrent signals with DIC images taken at different time intervals after the stimulation are used to determine the morphological origin of the photocurrent signals variations. As a negative control, PBS is utilized to stimulate the cells to address the possibility of photocurrent changes being solely affected by the interference from the liquid shear force in the chip chamber. As expected, no apparent variations in the photocurrent signal are observed after the PBS was loaded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>). The imaging unit confirmed this result, showing no detectable change in the cell morphology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Next, the cells were stimulated with thrombin at two different doses. Thrombin is a serine protease that is well known to be implicated in hemostasis and vascular endothelium permeability. Actually, cells can interact with thrombin through the thrombin receptors, which have been identified on many types of cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, fibroblasts, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, etc. A low dose of thrombin has been shown to temporarily increase the internal elastic tension by enhancing the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> based myosin light chain. By contrast, a high dose of thrombin is toxic and induces cell death by cleavage of DNA into fragments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, after stimulation with a low dose of 2 U/mL thrombin, the cells showed a biphasic response. In the first 10 min, the signal dramatically decreased (0.94%), probably as a result of the increase in RI induced by the sharp increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration after thrombin (low dose) loading. In the next 30 min, the signal returned to its initial level. Since the working time of thrombin is within a range of minutes, the local concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradually returned to the normal state, resulting in a recovery phase of photocurrent in the following 30 min. The result is further confirmed by a living cell calcium tracking experiment, where a similar biphasic cell response is observed in the presence of low-dose thrombin. This result perfectly matched the data recorded by the GaN chipscope (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). Importantly, the cell spreading area and cell morphology monitored by the imaging system showed no visible changes, and there was only slight cell extension after thrombin treatment (yellow arrows labeled, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c</i></figref>), indicating that the intracellular dynamics dominate the photocurrent generation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">We then increased the dose of thrombin to 150 U/mL and observed a rapid increase of photocurrent throughout the tested period. The photocurrent reached a plateau after 50 min and then stabilized, with a maximal change of 1.66% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>f</i></figref>). Consistent with the photocurrent data, the imaging unit monitored an increase in the intercellular space due to cell shrinkage induced by thrombin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>e</i></figref>). In this case, the cell spreading area and optical current data are negatively correlated with each other. To corroborate this result, blebbistatin is used to induce the cell morphology changes by inhibiting the myosin II activity. Myosin II is a critical determinant of contractile characteristics of cell motility and cell adhesion in several tissue types. After treatment with the drugs (50 &#x3bc;M), the cells gradually shrank in the next 1 h, showing increased cell gaps and dendritic cell morphologies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). As expected, an increase in photocurrent is observed during this period due to the decrease of the cell coverage area on the chip surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">Cells can respond to chemical stimuli in a variety of ways, including the activation of signaling pathways, morphological changes, and the initiation of cell death. The currently available systems on the market for label-free and real-time monitoring of cells in vitro are mostly based on cell morphology/cell spreading, which means that the cell activities can only be measured when there are cell morphological changes or cell spreading variations. Herein, the newly developed GaN chip is able not only to measure changes in cell morphology/cell spreading, but also to sense and record RI dynamics induced by intracellular dynamics in real-time. It is even capable of determining the dominant factor contributing to the RI changes with the help of the imaging analysis. These unique features make the GaN chipscope an excellent candidate for monitoring cell response against various drugs and chemicals in vitro in a variety of ways.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">GaN Chipscope in the Demonstration of Drug Screening</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0056">To demonstrate the potential application of this sensing platform in drug research, an experiment is conducted to determine the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug &#x3b2;-lapachone on human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549). The A549 cells are seeded in the chamber of the platform and cultured for 24 h for fully spreading. Afterward, 10 &#x3bc;M, 30 &#x3bc;M or 50 &#x3bc;M of &#x3b2;-lapachone is added into the chambers, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the chipscope recorded the responses of A549 cells stimulated by &#x3b2;-lapachone. Clearly, the &#x3b2;-lapachone induced dose-depend cytotoxicity in A549 cells, as characterized by a significant increase in the photocurrent data with increasing drug concentration.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Additionally, the photocurrent curves offered valuable practical information for the study of drug-cell interactions. First, by plotting the slope of the tangent line, the speed of cell response at different periods was analyzed. For instance, in the first 5 h of stimulation, the response exhibited by the cells at a high &#x3b2;-lapachone concentration (50 &#x3bc;M) was 6.05 and 2.85 times higher than that at low (10 &#x3bc;M) and intermediate concentrations (30 &#x3bc;M), respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>e</i></figref>). Secondly, the photocurrent curves revealed the reaction time of the cells under different drug concentrations. For instance, A549 cells exhibited a much faster response against a high dose of &#x3b2;-lapachone (12.5 h and 11.6 h for 50 &#x3bc;M and 30 &#x3bc;M of &#x3b2;-lapachone, respectively) than against a low dose (20.2 h for 10 &#x3bc;M of &#x3b2;-lapachone). Indeed, a higher dose is more toxic and induces faster cell death. Thirdly, by coupling the imaging system, we were able to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the cell-drug interactions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i></figref>, the cells shrank in a dose-dependent manner after &#x3b2;-lapachone treatment. Specifically, cells treated with a lower dose (10 &#x3bc;M) slowly shrank over time, but there is no obvious increase in intercellular spaces during the 24 h. This suggested that the photocurrent dynamics are mainly to be ascribed to the intracellular RI changes induced by the drugs instead of to the changes in the cell spreading area. The A549 cells treated with higher dose of &#x3b2;-lapachone shrank intensely and showed significant intercellular gaps (red dots line labeled) in the intermediate and high dose groups (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>c </i>and <i>d</i></figref>). It is believed that the increase in photocurrent in higher dose-treated cells is contributed by both cell morphology changes as well as by cell intracellular dynamics alternation. Further, the cell confluency is calculated based on the photos taken by the imaging system. As a result, the confluence of cells treated with high, medium, and low doses of &#x3b2;-lapachone decreased by 23.1%, 19.0%, and 0%, respectively after 24 h incubation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Therefore, this GaN chipscope platform is capable of recording cell response in regard to both cell adhesions and intra-/intercellular dynamics after drug treatment, demonstrating its practicality as a toxicity biosensor in rapid drug screening studies.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Demonstration of Cell Differentiation Monitoring</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0059">The cell refractive index is an intrinsic optical parameter that varies with different cell phenotypes. This inspired the exploration of whether the sensing platform could track online the dynamics of cell differentiation and distinguish the different cell phenotypes. In this experiment, human monocytic THP-1 cells are employed as the cell model due to their multi-phenotypic characteristics, including the initial suspended monocyte, adhered macrophage (M0), and two major polarized states (adhered M1 and M2). Here, THP-1 cells differentiated from suspended state (monocyte) to adhered M0 state by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), followed by induction of the resultant M0 cells to polarize to M1 by LPS/FN-gamma. The process is monitored throughout by the GaN chipscope system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">The photocurrent signal slightly decreased after monocytes are seeded into the chip chamber, indicating that these cells precipitated onto the chip surface due to gravity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>c</i></figref>).

PMA (25 ng/mL) is then loaded to trigger monocyte to macrophage differentiation. It is evident from the photocurrent signal that monocytes responded strongly against PMA in 3-9 h after stimulation, and this response became mild in the following 11 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The cell spreading area is calculated according to the photos taken by the imaging system.

In contrast, the cell roundness exhibited a trend opposite to the cell area (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>d</i></figref>). It is noticed that the imaging data perfectly matched the photocurrent dynamics during the first 9 h after PMA stimulation, which indicated that the photocurrent signals are mainly contributed by the adhesion-based cell area changes and intracellular dynamic. In the following 10-20 h, the photocurrent data kept decreasing, but the cell area shows no noticeable change, indicating that the cell-intrinsic property dynamics dominated the signals in this period. To confirm the differentiation of monocyte to macrophage, CD 11b as a macrophage surface marker is evaluated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. After incubation with PMA, the expression of CD11 b of THP-1 cells is significantly increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>e</i></figref>), indicating the successful differentiation of monocyte to M0.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">To polarize M0 to M1, macrophages were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL) and interferon-gamma proteins (IFN&#x3b3;, 20 ng/mL). A steady decrease of the photocurrent signal is observed in the 24 h following stimulation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>f</i></figref>). Similarly, the cell spreading area gradually increases by 87% within this 24 h, and the polarized cells showed a &#x201c;dendritic&#x201d;-like morphology with large filopodia (arrows labeled, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b</i></figref>). By contrast, cell roundness decreases from 0.3 to 0.57 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>g</i></figref>). There is apparent shifting of M1 macrophage surface maker CD 80, which confirmed the successful differentiation of M0 to M1 macrophage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>h</i></figref>). Together, these results indicate that our GaN chipscope can monitor in real-time and quantify cell activities or status changes in both intracellular and intercellular dynamics. Additionally, this device integrated with an imaging system is label-free and incubator-adaptive, making it highly suitable for various tests and analyses in living cells in situ.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Some Conclusions</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0063">Here, introduce is a low-cost, incubator-adaptive chipscope based on the refractive index-sensitive GaN device for label-free and real-time cell sensing. The device benefits from its small size, continuous monitoring, and real-time photocurrent readout and analysis, enabling us to readily capture the dynamics of cell adhesion-based activities in situ, including cell precipitation, initial attachment, spreading, shrinkage, and detachment. In particular, by coupling the imaging unit and RI sensing unit, the platform can determine both intercellular and intracellular dynamics by monitoring the cell adhesion and morphologies changes with high sensitivity and responsiveness. Another specific outcome of this work is the development of a practical, ready-to-use cell analyzer for pharmacological studies to determine the cytotoxicity of anticancer drug and their corresponding cellular response, as well as cell biology research to track the immune cell phenotypes transform. Technically, these results are sufficiently robust to demonstrate the applicability of the optical chip-based sensing technology in biosensing.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">Compared to the prevailing complex optical living cell biosensing technologies, such as SPR and RWG, our GaN chips tremendously lower the technical thresholds in the design, fabrication and the practical use of biosensors (Table in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>). Specifically, the monolithic strategy was utilized to integrate InGaN/GaN photo emitter and photo detector on the same microchip, which eliminate the use of the costly spectrum analyzer and other optical apparatus. Additionally, due to their microscale size and the less requirement on the sensing setup, the chip can be easily integrated with other devices and applied in some special environments such as fast detection in the wearable device, integration with microscope or working in tight space with high humidity (cell incubator).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">The GaN chipscope platform can be used as a tool for label-free monitoring of live cell activities which transcends the boundaries of the conventional &#x201c;photonic chip&#x201d; and &#x201c;microscopy&#x201d; monitoring processes. The new chipscope integrates more functions that highly enrich the data output in both qualitative and quantitative ways. In particular, their easy accessibility and extremely low manufacturing cost (&#x3c;10 cents per chip) may enable them to be welcomed in the practical use and the market.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">Described herein is a versatile, incubator-compatible, monolithic GaN photonic chipscope for label-free monitoring of live cell activities. Regarding the electrical characteristics of the photonic chip, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>a</i></figref>, the I-V curve illustrates that the measured forward voltage of LED is 2.4 V at 10 mA, and the resistance obtained based on the slope of the linear region is 4.95&#x3a9;. Also, the output power of the LED was linearly proportional to the input current. Not surprisingly, as the injecting current in LED increased, the electroluminescence intensity became larger, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>b</i></figref>. However, a fixed low input current of 10 mA was used in all our experiments to avoid possible phototoxicity to living cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>c </i></figref>shows the I-V curve of PD under a reverse bias voltage where photocurrent generated by the photodetector was kept at a high level of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>A (in contrast to that of &#x2dc;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>A without illumination) when the LED injecting current increased from 1 mA to 10 mA. This demonstrates that the measured data possess a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Additionally, the chip response time is determined by injecting an electrical pulse into the LED. The LED-converted optical pulse signal is received by a PD connected to a transimpedance amplifier and an oscilloscope. From the measured result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, our chip can provide fast transition times, with the rise and fall times below 1.5 s, which was mainly contributed to the fast photon-electron conversion property of the chip device incorporating InGaN/GaN MQWs.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Determination of the Vertical Sensing Range of the GaN Chip.</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0068">To determine the vertical sensing ability of the GaN chip, the simulation is conducted by building a sandwich model with sapphire-intermediate-sample layer to characterize the vertical sensing range of the chip. Two possible cases are defined: (1) the vertical separation between the chip and targeted sample layer, and (2) the vertical distance that can be sensed by the chip in the targeted sample layer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The simulation is conducted by a commercial FEM simulation software, known as COMSOL Multiphysics. Particularly, a sandwich model composed of sapphire/cell/culture medium layers is conducted, and the model construction and solving are in the 2D Wave Optics module. Plane-wave with different incident angles and one-unit cell by applied periodic boundary conditions are performed herein. The refractive indexes of the sapphire and culture medium are fixed at 1.78 and 1.34, respectively, while the refractive index of the cells is set to a range of 1.35-1.37.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">Case 1: it is supposed the targeted sensing layer as the monolayer cells. When the intermediate between the chip and sensing layer is air, the total reflectance (internal reflectance and scattering) responds to a limited distance ranging from 0 nm to 300 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i></figref>). When the intermediate medium changes to water, the vertical responsive distance is 0-500 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <i>d</i></figref>). Therefore, the theoretical maximum vertical sensing range will be around 300 nm and 500 nm for air and water, respectively.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">Case 2: the degree of reflectance is governed by the refractive index difference at the interface. During the cell detection process, there exist two interfaces (sapphire/cell and cell/culture medium) above the chip, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>a</i></figref>. When the incident angle exceeds the critical angle (&#x3b8;c=&#x2dc;50&#xb0;) at the sapphire/cell interface, the light undergoes total internal reflection, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>b</i></figref>. Only light rays with an incident angle less than the critical angle partially enter the cell. However, the weak refractive index contrast at the culture medium/cell interface leads to a large critical angle of &#x3e;78&#xb0;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>c</i></figref>. Moreover, the culture medium/cell interface provides very weak reflectance, and the amount of light that can be reflected is highly limited.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">During measurements, it is expected that the lateral spreading of the cell across the chip surface can increase the amount of reflected light at the culture medium/cell interface. However, the photocurrent magnitude is found to decrease monotonically over time, implying that reflected light from this part is negligible. As such, light undergoing total internal reflection at the sapphire/cell interface remains the dominant part.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Fabrication of the Cell Adhesion-Resistance Surface on the GaN Chip</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0073">To establish a cell adhesion resistance surface on the GaN chip, a monolayer polymer coating based on liner polyglycerol (LPG) is employed in this work, which has been proved capable of providing effective antifouling properties in various substrates. The fabrication of the antifouling polymer layer on the device is via two steps: 1) a hydrophobic layer is formed on the sapphire surface of the device by sialyation; 2) amphiphilic block copolymers benzophenone functionalized liner polyglycerol (LPG-BPh) self-assemble on the alkyl-functionalized substrates through the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic domain (BPh) of the polymer and hydrophobic base alkyl layer. Then, the polymers were covalently bonded on the alkylated sapphire by the UV initiated &#x201c;C&#x2014;H&#x201d; photo-crosslinking between BPh groups and neighboring &#x201c;C&#x2014;H&#x201d;. The thickness of the monolayer coatings is about 3.5 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows the surface morphologies of the sapphire face of the device without and with the LPG coating.

Results and Discussion</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Before the cell seeding, the chips with culture medium were stabilized in the cell incubator for 4 hours to monitor any noise from the environments (temperature, humidity, light, etc.) during the detection. The current signals of both control group and experimental group were quite stable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>). After the cells seeding, the optical current of experimental group experienced an obvious decrease of 9.91% (0.3287 &#x3bc;A) in the first 2 h and almost no signal changes from the control chip (&#x2212;0.39%). It is assumed that it might be contributed to the refractive properties changes during the cell deposition on the surface. To prove this, optical images were collected at specific time points and showed that most of cells deposited on the chip surface in the first 2 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>). At the time of 3 h, cell started to spread and highly extended at time of 8 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Interestingly, a slight increase of 2.263% of optical current was observed during this time range. It is believed that it is the cell spreading that led to the increase of the optical current after hour 3. In addition, it indicated that the tiny refractive properties changes induced by cell adhesion from round morphology to flatten morphology could be successfully monitored by our LED chips.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Importantly, the performance of control group (culture medium) is quite stable during the whole experiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>).

The LED and PD mesas were then fabricated on a single wafer by photolithography and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. In order to promote the spreading of current, a 120 nm-thick indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer was deposited on the p-GaN by reactive plasma deposition. The LED and PD were covered by photomasks and a 10 &#x3bc;m-wide GaN between them was then ICP-etched. The p-electrode and n-electrode were subsequently patterned by photolithography and then coated with Cr/AI/Ti/Pt/Au materials by electron-beam evaporation. An insulating SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer with 360 nm thickness was deposited on the wafer by plasma-enhanced CVD technique. A stacked layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>distributed Bragg reflector was deposited as a bottom mirror to reflect the emitted light into the sapphire substrate. The p-pad and n-pad regions were defined by photolithography, and a metallization layer was then deposited by electron-beam evaporation.

After beam splitting, the separated downward beams passing through a birefringent Normarski prism were collected with a 40&#xd7;DIC objective with 0.6 NA, and then irradiated on the specimen. The reflected wavefronts experienced varying optical path differences due to irregular specimen surface topography and were gathered by the objective and focused on the interference plane of the prism. The combined lights continued to propagate through the beam splitter and then encountered the analyzer (second polarizer), which allowed the light beams parallel to the analyzer transmission vector to pass through, further undergoing interference and generating amplitude fluctuations at the focal plane of the lens.
