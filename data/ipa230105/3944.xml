Some types of fiber optic connectors have multiple core heads. When the core heads of the fiber optic connectors are mated in a different order the polarity may be changed, and a variety of connection methods may be obtained. It is usual for front ends of the fiber optic adaptor to be provided with an upwardly protruding polarity key which acts to mark the order of the core heads and display the current polarity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the conventional fiber optic adaptor <b>1</b> is integrally formed, and a position of a key receptacle <b>11</b> of the conventional fiber optic adaptor used for the insertion of a polarity key of the fiber optic connector cannot be changed. Therefore, when the polarity of each fiber optic connector needs to be reversed, the fiber optic connector first needs to be disconnected, and a tool is needed to remove the polarity key, in order to change the position of the polarity key on the fiber optic connector, until finally the fiber optic connector is reconnected to the fiber optic adaptor <b>1</b>. The detachment method for switching polarity described above is quite complex, and furthermore, the polarity key is not only difficult to disassemble, but also easily to lose because of its small size. Furthermore, after the fiber optic connector is inserted into the fiber optic adaptor <b>1</b>, it is difficult to see the polarity of the fiber optic connector. Therefore the conventional fiber optic adaptor is inconvenient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide a fiber optic adaptor that can alleviate at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the disclosure, a fiber optic adaptor includes a main shell body and an outer cover. The main shell body defines an inner passage extending in a front-rear direction. The main shell body further has a first end portion defining a first opening that communicates with the inner passage, and a second end portion defining a second opening that communicates with the inner passage. The first end portion is formed with two engaging grooves that are opposite to each other in a left-right direction perpendicular to the front-rear direction. The outer cover is removably disposed on and covers the first end portion, and has a cover body portion, two locking clips, and an identifier portion. The two locking clips protrude from the cover body portion in the front-rear direction and respectively engage the engaging grooves. The identifier portion is disposed on the cover body portion. The locking clips are operable to be removed respectively from the engaging grooves. The cover body portion defines a port outer opening that communicates with the first opening, and a port key portion that communicates with the port outer opening. The port outer opening and the port key portion are arranged in an up-down direction which is perpendicular to the front-rear direction and the left-right direction. The identifier portion is located at an upper outer side of the port key portion when the outer cover is coupled to the first end portion with the port key portion being over the port outer opening, and the identifier portion is located at a lower outer side of the port key portion when the outer cover is coupled to the first end portion with the port key portion being under the port outer opening.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other features and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent in the following detailed description of the embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a conventional fiber optic adaptor;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a fiber optic adaptor according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view, illustrating arrangements of components of the embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating arrangement of components of the embodiment from another angle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, an embodiment of the fiber optic adaptor according to the present disclosure is shown.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fiber optic adaptor includes a main shell body <b>2</b> surrounding and defining an inner passage <b>21</b> that extends in a front-rear direction (A), and an outer cover <b>3</b>. The main shell body <b>2</b> has a first end portion <b>22</b> that defines a first opening <b>221</b> communicating with the inner passage <b>21</b>, and a second end portion <b>23</b> that is opposite to the first end portion <b>22</b> in the front-rear direction (A) and that surrounds and defines a second opening <b>231</b> communicating with the inner passage <b>21</b>. The first and second openings <b>221</b>, <b>231</b> are located at two ends of the inner passage <b>21</b> in the front-rear direction (A), and are communicated with each other. The first end portion <b>22</b> is formed with two engaging grooves <b>222</b> that are opposite to each other in a left-right direction (B) perpendicular to the front-rear direction (A) and that are in spatial communication with the inner passage <b>21</b>, and a plurality of positioning holes <b>223</b> that are disposed around the first opening <b>221</b>, and that extend inwardly from an outer end surface thereof in the front-rear direction (A).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The outer cover <b>3</b> is removably disposed on and covers the first end portion <b>22</b>, and has a cover body portion <b>31</b> that surrounds and defines a port outer opening <b>311</b> and a port key portion <b>312</b>, two locking clips <b>32</b> that protrude from the cover body portion <b>31</b> in the front-rear direction (A), a plurality of positioning post portions <b>33</b> that extend from the cover body portion <b>31</b> in the front-rear direction (A) (i.e., in the same direction as the locking clips <b>32</b>), and an identifier portion <b>34</b> that is displayed on the cover body portion <b>31</b>. The port outer opening portion <b>311</b> and the port key portion <b>312</b> are arranged in an up-down direction (C) which is perpendicular to the front-rear direction (A) and the left-right direction (B), communicate with each other, and are both in communication with the first opening <b>221</b> so as to communicate with the inner passage <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, the outer cover <b>3</b> has four positioning post portions <b>33</b>, and the first end portion <b>22</b> of the main shell body <b>2</b> has four positioning holes <b>223</b>. The locking clips <b>32</b> extend through the first opening <b>221</b> into the inner passage <b>21</b>, and respectively engage the engaging grooves <b>222</b>. The locking clips <b>32</b> are operable to be removed respectively from the engaging grooves <b>222</b>. Through this, the outer cover <b>3</b> can be fixed to the main shell body <b>2</b> and removed from the main shell body <b>2</b>. The positioning post portions <b>33</b> are respectively inserted into the positioning holes <b>223</b> such that the cover body portion <b>31</b> does not move relative to the first end portion <b>22</b> in the left-right direction (B) and the up-down direction (C), thereby achieving the effect of a secure fixing. In this embodiment, the cross section of each positioning post portion <b>33</b> perpendicular to the front-rear direction (A) is substantially L-shaped, but is not limited thereto. The identifier portion <b>34</b> can be displayed on the cover body portion <b>31</b> through an engraving or an adhesive attachment, etc., and is located externally of the port key portion <b>312</b> so as to mark the position of the port key portion <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A fiber optic connector <b>4</b> having a polarity key <b>41</b> can be inserted into the fiber optic adaptor according to this disclosure. A main body of the fiber optic connector <b>4</b> is inserted into the inner passage <b>21</b> through the port outer opening <b>311</b> and the first opening <b>221</b>, and the polarity key <b>41</b> is inserted into the port key portion <b>312</b>. When polarity is to be reversed, a user only needs to remove the fiber optic connector <b>4</b> and turning the fiber optic connector <b>4</b> upside down, then decouple the outer cover <b>3</b> from the main shell body <b>2</b> by retracting the locking clips <b>32</b> from the engaging grooves <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">And afterwards the user turns the outer cover <b>3</b> upside down and re-couple the outer cover <b>3</b> with the main shell body <b>2</b>. At this time the port key portion <b>312</b> has also been inverted along with the outer cover <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Finally, the fiber optic connector <b>4</b> that has been turned upside down as mentioned previously is inserted into the main shell body <b>2</b> of the fiber optic adaptor. During the insertion, the polarity key <b>41</b> which was turned upside down can be inserted into the port key portion <b>312</b> which was also turned upside down as mention above. Therefore, polarity can be changed quickly and easily, and the polarity can be labelled in the correct position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The identifier portion <b>34</b> may be a relief, imprint or sticker that is labelled &#x201c;KEY&#x201d; (or other text, patterns, signs) that correspond to the outside of the port key portion <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the fiber optic connector <b>4</b> is inserted into the fiber optic adaptor of the present embodiment, the user can confirm a position of the port key portion <b>312</b> through the identifier portion <b>34</b> that is externally visible, thereby determining the polarity. More specifically, the identifier portion <b>34</b> is located at an upper outer side of the port key portion <b>312</b> when the outer cover <b>3</b> is coupled to the first end portion <b>22</b> with the port key portion <b>312</b> being over the port outer opening <b>311</b>, and the identifier portion <b>34</b> is located at a lower outer side of the port key portion <b>312</b> when the outer cover <b>3</b> is coupled to the first end portion <b>22</b> with the port key portion <b>312</b> being under the port outer opening <b>311</b>. Therefore the polarity of the fiber optic adaptor can be easily identified and changing of polarity can be conveniently accomplished.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the second opening <b>231</b> is capable for insertion of another fiber optic connector (not shown) so that the two fiber optic connectors are signally connected.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In summary, through the design of the outer cover <b>3</b> that can be turned upside down relative to the main shell body <b>2</b>, the fiber optic adaptor according to this disclosure can allow a fiber optic connector to quickly change polarity by being turned upside down and reconnecting. Furthermore, the identifier portion <b>34</b> is visible on the exterior of the fiber optic adaptor and allows a user to determine the current polarity. The polarity change is simple, so the object of this invention can be certainly achieved.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiment.
