These wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources with those users (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or other resources). Multiple-access technologies can rely on any of code division, time division, frequency division orthogonal frequency division, single-carrier frequency division, or time division synchronous code division, to name a few. These and other multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although wireless communication systems have made great technological advancements over many years, challenges still exist.

To facilitate configuration of communication on a channel, a user equipment (UE) may provide various feedback parameters, such as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Typically, the UE provides a single value of a feedback parameter representing an instantaneous measurement of the parameter or an average of measurements made over a band. A single value indication of a feedback parameter may not provide sufficient information regarding channel quality because channel quality varies within a range of possible values. For example, the feedback parameter may vary due to changing communication activities of neighboring base stations. Therefore, what is needed are techniques for providing more detailed information regarding a measured feedback parameter.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing detailed information regarding a measured feedback parameter in the form of a probabilistic feedback parameter. For example, an estimate report may be generated to indicate a probability distribution function associated with a feedback parameter such as an SINR. The probability distribution function may indicate values of the feedback parameter and associated value probabilities. Indicating a probability distribution function for a feedback parameter provides various processing options. For example, a base station may receive and input the probability distribution function to a machine learning model to determine a configuration for communication or perform UE selection. The probability distribution function from a UE may also be used to facilitate coordination with neighboring base stations to adjust transmit power and modify a channel quality environment of the UE. The probability distribution function provides more detailed information about the measured feedback parameter compared to conventional methods, allowing for communications to be configured more efficiently and based on a more accurate channel quality assessment. In-turn, the reliability and speed (e.g., data rate) of communications may be improved based on the more detailed information about the measured feedback parameter, leading to more efficient use of the medium,</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Introduction to Wireless Communication Networks</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b>, in which aspects described herein may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, wireless communications system <b>100</b> includes base stations (BSs) <b>102</b>, user equipments (UEs) <b>104</b>, one or more core networks, such as an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>160</b> and 5G Core (5GC) network <b>190</b>, which interoperate to provide wireless communications services.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Base stations <b>102</b> may provide an access point to the EPC <b>160</b> and/or 5GC <b>190</b> for a user equipment <b>104</b>, and may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, delivery of warning messages, among other functions.

As illustrated, the BS <b>402</b> may serve UE <b>408</b> (labeled U<b>1</b>) and UE <b>410</b> (labeled U<b>2</b>). The BS may communicate with UE <b>408</b> (labeled U<b>1</b>) using beam <b>420</b> and communicate with UE <b>410</b> using beam <b>422</b>. Similarly, BS <b>404</b> may serve UE <b>412</b> (labeled U<b>3</b>) and UE <b>414</b> (labeled U<b>4</b>). BS <b>404</b> may communicate with UE <b>412</b> using beam <b>426</b> and communicate with UE <b>414</b> using beam <b>428</b>, as shown. BS <b>402</b> and BS <b>404</b> may be part of different cells and communications by BS <b>402</b> and BS <b>404</b> may cause inter-cell interference. For example, the direction of beam <b>426</b> may face both UE <b>412</b> and UE <b>408</b>, and thus, communication with UE <b>412</b> may cause interference with UE <b>408</b>. As another example, signaling using beam <b>422</b> may reflect off an object <b>416</b> and cause interference with UE <b>408</b>, causing intra-cell interference.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Downlink (DL) performance for the BSs may depend on a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The inter-cell interference described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may reduce SINR, degrading DL performance. In other words, signal power depends on the channel between a UE (e.g., UE <b>408</b>) and the serving BS (e.g., BS <b>402</b>). Signal power can vary over a range due to changing channel conditions and UE movement, to name just a few causes. SINR measurements may be performed to reduce uncertainty regarding signal strength and range of possible signal strengths.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">SINR also takes into account interference. Interference depends on the channel between the UE (e.g., UE <b>408</b>) and neighboring BSs (e.g., BS <b>404</b>). The amount of interference experienced by a UE may vary over a range. The interference may vary for reasons independent from actions (e.g., active communication) of neighboring BSs (e.g., BS <b>404</b>). Interference may also vary depending on the communications of other BSs, as described. Without the UE being aware of active communications by neighboring BSs, instantaneous interference measurements may not be useful since the interference may vary within a range of possible interference values. One technique may be to measure and use an average interference value. However, the measurement of average interference does not help predict DL performance in a slot.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Aspects Related to Providing a Probabilistic Feedback Parameter</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Conventionally, a SINR estimate may be taken as a single value. However, as described herein, SINR generally varies over a range based on various dynamic factors. Accordingly, some aspects described herein are directed to reporting SINR as a range and a probability over the range. For example, the SINR may be indicated as a probability distribution function (also referred to herein as a probabilistic estimate). In some aspects, an SINR estimate may be reported as a probabilistic estimate and the probabilistic estimate may be associated with a confidence value. For instance, a probabilistic estimate of SINR may be derived using a high confidence value or a low confidence value, as described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate example probabilistic SINR estimates. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, a probabilistic SINR estimate <b>502</b> may have a range from <b>10</b>dB to <b>20</b>dB. A UE may have a <b>90</b>% confidence in the probabilistic SINR estimate. Generally, the wider range for a probabilistic estimate, the higher the confidence value may be for the probabilistic estimate. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the probabilistic estimate <b>504</b> may have a range between 15 dB and 17 dB and the confidence value associated with the probabilistic estimate may be 70%. An SINR estimate with a narrow range (e.g., having a high peak probability) is more useful to a BS as the number of possible interference values is less, and the BS may choose to use a DL beam corresponding to that SINR estimate. In other words, a UE may provide a probabilistic estimate with a narrower range with a lower confidence value, or provide a probabilistic estimate with a wider range with a higher confidence value. In some aspects, a BS may configure the UE with a confidence value (e.g., a minimum confidence value) to be used for generating the probabilistic estimate. For instance, the BS may indicate to the UE to provide a probabilistic estimate having at least a 70% confidence value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate an example probabilistic estimate <b>602</b> for signal power and a probabilistic estimate <b>604</b> for interference power. A UE may feedback separate probabilistic estimates for signal power (e.g., signal strength) and interference. In other words, instead of providing a single SINR probabilistic estimate, separate probabilistic estimates <b>602</b>, <b>604</b> may be provided for signal power and interference power separately. A receiver may use the separate probabilistic estimates for signal power and interference power to calculate SINR and configure communications accordingly. Providing separate probabilistic estimates for signal power and interference power provides more information to the BS since the BS can determine the signal power and interference power separately, as opposed to a ratio of signal power and interference power. In some aspects, an interference power estimate may identify the source BS of interference. For example, the probabilistic estimate <b>604</b> may indicate the interference from a first BS and the probabilistic estimate <b>606</b> may indicate the interference from a second BS.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrates example probabilistic estimates associated with different confidence values. In other words, a UE may feedback probabilistic estimates for different confidence values. Probabilistic estimate <b>608</b> having a narrower range may be associated with a lower confidence value of 50% and the probabilistic estimate <b>610</b> having a wider range may be associated with a higher confidence value of 90%, as shown. To derive a high confidence (e.g., 90%) distribution function, a UE may observe the medium for a longer time (e.g., resulting in collection of more samples) as compared to deriving a low confidence (e.g., 50%) distribution function.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, a UE may send one or more probabilistic downlink (DL) SINR reports to the BS corresponding to multiple transmit (Tx)-receive (Rx) beam pairs. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C</figref>, the one or more SINR reports may contain combinations of probabilistic SINR estimates, probabilistic signal power estimates, probabilistic interference estimates, and confidence values, in addition to (or instead of) instantaneous/averaged measurements of SINR.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a table <b>700</b> illustrating estimate information for various beam pairs. An estimate report may include any combination of a probabilistic SINR estimate, probabilistic signal power estimate, probabilistic interference estimate, and a confidence value. In some aspects, the estimate report may also include an indication of an instantaneous or averaged measurement of SINR (e.g., an average SINR measured across a given bandwidth).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, for a BS DL beam index 1 and UE beam index 1, an SINR estimate may be indicated having a mean interval of [10 dB, 12 dB], standard deviation of [5 dB, 6 dB], a confidence value of 0.9 (90%), validity duration of 10 ms, and an indication of the time and frequency resources of measurements. The validity duration indicates how long the indicated SINR estimate will be valid from when the SINR estimate is indicated. The indication of the time and frequency resources of measurements indicates the time and frequency resources in which the measurements were made, and on which the probabilistic estimates were based. For example, calculating SINR mean interval of confidence value of 0.9 can be based on the SINR measurements made in the indicated time and frequency resources. The BS DL beam index may correspond to an index of a synchronization signal block (SSB) transmission from the BS to the UE, and the UE beam index may correspond to an index associated with a sounding reference signal (SRS) transmission from the UE to the BS. For example, the UE may receive an SSB associated with BS DL beam index 1 while transmitting an SRS associated with UE beam index 1. The UE may then measure SINR based on the SSB and indicate the SINR as the estimate for the BS DL beam index 1 and UE beam index 1.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown, for BS DL beam index 1 and UE beam index 2, an SINR estimate may be indicated using separate signal and interference estimates. As shown, a type of the probability distribution function (labeled as &#x201c;PDF&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) associated with the estimate may also be indicated. For instance, the probability distribution function may be a uniform distribution function. Other example types of probability distribution function types may include normal (Gaussian) distribution, mixture Gaussian distribution, log normal distribution, or triangular distribution, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a call flow diagram illustrating example operations <b>800</b> for estimate reporting. As shown, a UE <b>804</b> may perform one or more measurements at block <b>809</b> based on reference signal (RS) transmissions <b>808</b>. The UE may then transmit an estimate report <b>810</b>, as described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C, and <b>7</b></figref>. The estimate report <b>810</b> may be transmitted using radio resource control (RRC) signaling, medium access control (MAC) control element (CE), or uplink control information (e.g., on a physical uplink control channel(PUCCH)). In some cases, the UE <b>804</b> may receive an indication of a confidence value <b>807</b> to be used. The estimate report <b>810</b> may indicate a probability distribution function having the confidence value <b>807</b> (e.g., may indicate a mean interval and standard deviation interval of the probability distribution function, as well as other parameters such as confidence value, validity duration, time and freq. resources of measurements, and probability distribution function type).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Based on the estimate report, the BS <b>802</b> may determine a configuration for communication at block <b>814</b>. For example, the BS <b>802</b> may select, based on the estimate report <b>810</b>, a DL beam to be used for communication with the UE. In some cases, the BS <b>802</b> may select a DL beam having a narrower SINR estimate range than another DL beam having a wider SINR range even if the other DL beam is associated with a higher instantaneous SINR, since the narrower SINR estimate range provides fewer possible values of SINR.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some aspects, the BS <b>802</b> may select a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) based on the estimate report <b>810</b>. For example, the BS may select an MCS that is compatible with a lower end of an SINR estimate to improve block error rate (BLER). For instance, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the BS may select an MCS associated with a lower end <b>510</b> of the SINR estimate <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some aspects, the BS <b>802</b> may perform UE selection based on the estimate report. For example, the BS <b>802</b> may use a probabilistic SINR estimate to select a UE to be configured for communication. In some aspects, UEs with narrower SINR estimate ranges may be given additional priority or preference in UE selection since the channel conditions of the UEs with narrower SINR estimate ranges are more deterministic.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some aspects, the BS <b>802</b> may coordinate with one or more neighboring BSs (e.g. BS <b>803</b>) to adjust (increase or decrease) transmit power in order to shift (e.g., to lower interference levels), or decrease an interference estimate range. The BS <b>803</b> may adjust transmit power at block <b>820</b> accordingly. As an example, the UE <b>804</b> may report an interference estimate and the report may indicate that the BS <b>803</b> is a cause of the interference. The BS <b>802</b> may determine to send a message <b>816</b> to BS <b>803</b> requesting the BS <b>803</b> reduce transmit power in an attempt to reduce interference to UE <b>804</b>. In some aspect, the BS <b>802</b> may coordinate with one or more neighboring BSs (e.g., BS <b>803</b>) to transmit a RS to allow a UE to measure and identify the source of the inter-cell interference. For example, from the probabilistic estimate report from a UE, the BS <b>802</b> may determine that the inter-cell interference is high and request one or more neighboring BSs to transmit an inter-cell interference measurement RS with certain properties. For example, the BS <b>802</b> may request the neighboring BSs to transmit an inter-cell interference RS in a certain time and frequency resource and scrambled with some scrambling sequences. The BS <b>802</b> may then schedule the UE to measure inter-cell interference based on the inter-cell interference RS transmitted by the neighboring BS and identify the source of inter-cell interference based on the UE receiving the inter-cell interference RS scrambled with the scrambling sequence from one or more of the neighboring BSs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some aspects, determining the configuration at block <b>814</b> may involve inputting the estimate report (e.g., probabilistic SINR estimate(s)) into a machine learning model. For example, a machine learning model may be trained to perform the configuration determination as described herein. Based on probabilistic estimates from UEs from different UEs, the machine learning model may perform UE selection and/or resource allocation that facilitates efficient communication between the BS and the UEs. As shown, after determining the configuration at block <b>814</b>, the BS <b>802</b> may transmit a configuration <b>818</b> to the UE <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some aspects, the network provides the UE a prediction or estimation module that the UE can use to generate the estimate report <b>810</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the BS <b>802</b> may provide an estimation model <b>806</b> to the UE <b>804</b> to be used for generating the estimate report <b>810</b>. The estimation model may be a machine learning model, such as a neural network model in some aspects. The UE may input various parameters into the estimation model to generate the estimate report <b>810</b>. For example, the UE may input the serving BS ID (e.g., ID of BS <b>802</b>), UE location, and a connection parameter (e.g., beam indices such as UE beam index or BS beam index, UL transmit power, pathloss estimate) to the network. Various UE internal parameter may also be input to the estimation model, such as the number of UE panels, panel orientation, number of antennas, characteristics of beams (e.g., beam width or side lobe width), or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The UE may also input RS measurements, such as measurements on channel state information (CSI)-RS (e.g., non-zero power (NZP) or zero-power (ZP) CSI-RS), SSB, demodulation reference signal (DMRS), phase tracking RS (PTRS), positioning RS, SRS, CSI-interference measurement (CSI-IM), or cross-link interference (CLI)-SRS, or null tone DMRS. The setup of RS for measurements may depend on UE internal parameters. For example, the network (e.g., BS <b>802</b>) may request that the UE send the UE internal parameters to be used for generating the estimate report <b>810</b>. The UE may then send the UE internal parameters to the network, and the network may configure transmission of suitable RSs to facilitate measurements by the UE to generate the internal parameters. An example UE internal parameter may include the quantity of panels that the UE can activate simultaneously. The BS may set up a number of CSI-RS transmissions in the same time and frequency resources for the UE to receive on all UE panels at the same time. This way, the UE can estimate SINR on all panels simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some aspects, the UE may have an estimation model, and use reference signal measurements for prediction. In other words, instead of the BS providing the estimation model to the UE, the UE may be preconfigured with an estimation model to be used to generate the estimate report <b>810</b>. RS transmission may be set up such that measurements are compatible with the estimation model. For example, the UE may request that the BS set up an RS transmission for compatibility with the configured estimation model. The UE may request a specific RS type, periodicity, transmit power, number of RS transmissions, or any combination thereof</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">While some examples provided herein have been described with respect to SINR (e.g., providing a probabilistic SINR report) to facilitate understanding, the aspects described herein are applicable to any suitable parameter. For example, instead of a probabilistic SINR report (or in addition to the probabilistic SINR report), the UE may send a probabilistic rank indicator (RI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), precoding matrix indicator (PMI), channel quality indicator (CQI) report (e.g., for data communication), reference signal time difference (RSTD) measurement, angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD) reports (e.g., for positioning), or any combination thereof. While some examples have described a probabilistic estimation report transmitted from the UE <b>804</b> to the BS <b>802</b>, the aspects described herein are also applicable to reports from the BS <b>802</b> to the UE <b>804</b>. For example, a probabilistic estimation report <b>812</b> (e.g., probabilistic SRS measurement report) may be sent from the BS <b>802</b> to the UE <b>804</b>.

While subframes 3, 4 are shown with slot formats 34, 28, respectively, any particular subframe may be configured with any of the various available slot formats 0-61. Slot formats 0, 1 are all DL, UL, respectively. Other slot formats 2-61 include a mix of DL, UL, and flexible symbols. UEs are configured with the slot format (dynamically through DL control information (DCI), or semi-statically/statically through radio resource control (RRC) signaling) through a received slot format indicator (SFI).

For slot configuration 0, different numerologies 0 to 5 allow for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 slots, respectively, per subframe. For slot configuration 1, different numerologies 0 to 2 allow for 2, 4, and 8 slots, respectively, per subframe.
