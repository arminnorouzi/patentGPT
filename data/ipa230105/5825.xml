In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the conductive ribbons <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B are electrically coupled (shorted) at the leadframe level and form a first signal channel designated Ch #<b>1</b> and the conductive ribbon <b>16</b><i>c </i>is kept electrically separate from the conductive ribbons <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B and forms a second signal channel designated Ch #<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the conductive ribbons <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C are not coupled with one another and form three distinct signal channels designated Ch #<b>1</b>, Ch #<b>2</b>, and Ch #<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In conventional solutions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C</figref> these three different arrangements are mirrored by three respective, different leadframe layouts as shown at least by the difference in structures at the right side of each figure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">From a package perspective, this translates into different types of leadframe designs that take into account the number of channels involved. Such leadframe customization facilitates providing device characteristics as desired to render the final product functional.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">From the viewpoint of the supply chain of the components, managing several leadframe versions, some of which may be dedicated just to a small number of products, is largely inconvenient.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A possible approach in addressing these issues may involve managing the different power channels at board level (e.g., with a printed circuit board or PCB) by bridging the leads with a wire connection.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For instance, a dual channel package could be shorted at board level to be used as a single channel device via short circuits (jumpers) at board level.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In such an approach (board customization) the underlying problem of having to manage different leadframe layouts is not properly solved. Rather, the problem is moved or displaced to the board design level, and is thus still present.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, board customization is almost invariably carried out by the final customer, which is largely impractical.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, it is noted that, with wire bridging, a new connection is added, involving two welds. This is in contrast with wedge bridging as discussed in the following, which is performed with one weld only.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also, wire connection in some cases involves a dedicated area/pad, while a ribbon wedge can be bonded over an existing weld.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A wedge bonding process utilizes ultrasonic energy and pressure to create a bond. Wedge bonding is thus a low temperature process, where, for example, a wire or conductive ribbon (of aluminum, copper, gold or any other material compatible with ultrasonic bonding) is used to make the interconnection. This process deforms the wire/ribbon into a flat elongated shape of a wedge.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">While wire bonding is already mature in semiconductor industry, bonding a conductive ribbon over different leads and conductive ribbons unexpectedly facilitates customizing power distribution in power packaging.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Particularly, wedge-on-wedge bridging as exemplified herein can be planned for critical package applications or developments, mostly for power application with the capability of meeting various specifications and flexibility in providing single-channel and multi-channel product versions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Examples as discussed herein in connection with figures from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> onwards improve leadframe choice flexibility retaining a single multi-channel leadframe layout (e.g., of the type underlying an arrangement as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, with three independent channels Ch #<b>1</b>, Ch #<b>2</b>, and Ch #<b>3</b>) by coupling (shorting) adjacent conductive ribbons <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C through a ribbon bonding process, bonding two adjacent leads, welding bridge-like a wedge over existing conductive ribbons, for instance. This may occur at the distal ends of these channels (conductive ribbons) that is at the &#x201c;distal&#x201d; pins or leads <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B, and <b>160</b>C.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Examples as discussed herein thus expand on the concept of arranging over a substrate such as a leadframe <b>12</b> one or more semiconductor chips <b>14</b> and a plurality of current-carrying formations such as the conductive ribbons <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C coupled to the semiconductor chip(s), wherein the substrate (leadframe) <b>12</b> is exempt from

Cross-sectional analysis can be performed where the bridge is detected by X-Ray.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Examples as illustrated herein rely on the possibility of bonding ribbons between two or more leads in order to bridge them.
