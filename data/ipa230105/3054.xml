Locking of a padlock is conducted through operating a shackle. However, conventionally, the shackle is exposed outside the lock and destruction may be made to the exposed shackle, or connection between the shackle and the lock body, by an evildoer. Thus, the shackle is commonly considered a fatal weakness of the lock device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recent development brought a lock device that conceals the shackle, such as one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in which a lock device comprises a lock body <b>1</b> and a shackle <b>2</b>, as well as locking hasps <b>3</b> that are used in combination with the lock device. To use, fasteners are applied to first fix the locking hasps <b>3</b> to an object that is to be locked with the lock device. The lock body <b>1</b> is subjected to special treatment of metal to exhibit a high strength, so that the lock body <b>1</b> is strong enough to resist knocking and drilling applied with an external force thereto. When locked, the shackle <b>2</b> is covered by and hidden in the lock body so as not be exposed outside. In this way, the shackle <b>2</b> is protected from being destructed by an externally applied force. To use, the shackle <b>2</b> of the lock device penetrate through two locking hasps to achieve locking thereby completing the locking operation of the lock device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such as known lock device allows the shackle <b>2</b> to be covered by and hidden in the lock body <b>1</b> and also provides the lock body <b>1</b> with a high strength for resisting destruction through application of external forces, so as to achieve a high level of protection and be favored by people. In many regions, people are used to applying such a lock device <b>1</b> to lock a compartment of a large-sized vehicle, and there are also people who prefers for applications to locking of doors or large-sized warehouses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a lock tongue (not shown) arranged at an end of a lock core <b>11</b> of the known lock device is connected to an end of the shackle <b>2</b> to combine the lock core <b>11</b> and shackle <b>2</b> together in a coaxial arrangement, so that the shackle <b>2</b> is drivable to rotate by the lock core <b>11</b>. Further, tumblers <b>12</b> are arranged alongside the lock core <b>11</b>. To provide the lock core <b>11</b> with an increased length for accommodating a larger number of tumblers <b>12</b> to thereby achieve high variability of arrangement of the tumblers <b>12</b> for being not easily broken, the known lock body <b>1</b> of such a design is commonly of a large diameter. Further, a keyhole of the lock core <b>11</b> of such a known lock device is commonly formed in a side of the lock body <b>1</b>. Practically, the keyhole is very close to the locking hasps <b>3</b> and as such, operations of inserting, rotating, and withdrawing a key for locking and unlocking are easily interfered with, leading to inconvenience for practical uses thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention generally relates to a lock device and locking hasps thereof, which are mainly made for overcoming or alleviating the drawbacks of the prior art lock device that is bulky and is hard to operate with a key.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For such a purpose, the present invention provides a lock device and locking hasps thereof. The lock device according to the present invention comprises, at least, a lock body and a shackle, wherein the lock body includes a bottom portion and a top portion, and the lock body is formed or provided, in the interior thereof, with a first accommodation zone, a second accommodation zone, a lock bore, a protective cover lid, a lock core, and a closure plate. The bottom portion is located on a bottom side of the lock body and is formed with a recessed area that is slightly recessed inwardly into the interior of the lock body. The top portion is located on a top side of the lock body and is formed with a hole. The first accommodation zone is made in the form of a cylindrical hole. The first accommodation zone is formed through recessing from an interior portion of the recessed area of the bottom portion further into the interior of the lock body to be in communication with the hole of the top portion. The second accommodation zone is formed through recessing the bottom portion inwardly of the lock body. The second accommodation zone includes a communication section that is in communication with the first accommodation zone. The lock bore perpendicularly extends from a lateral side of the lock body into, and is in communication with, the second accommodation zone, and the lock bore is set in communication with one side of the first accommodation zone. The protective cover lid is in the form of a circular plate that is made of a metallic material that has been subjected to heat treatment to exhibit a high strength and is received in the first accommodation zone. The protective cover lid is formed therein with a penetration opening that penetrates through a main body thereof. The lock core has one end that is provided with a lock tongue and an opposite end that is formed with a keyhole. The lock tongue is extendible out of a lateral side surface of the lock core. The end of the lock core that is provided with the lock tongue is further formed with a cut-off notch. The closure plate is formed to has a contour that corresponds to and matches with the recessed area of the bottom portion. The closure plate includes an inset portion extended from one surface thereof to match with the communication section of the second accommodation zone. The shackle is made in the form of a cylindrical rod made of a metallic material that has been subjected to heat treatment to exhibit a high strength. The shackle comprises a shackle body and a rounded end portion, and an end of the shackle body that is opposite to the rounded end portion is formed as a hook portion. The shackle is sleeved with a spring.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The efficacy that the above-described structure of the present invention may provide is that in the present invention, the shackle can be deeply hidden in the lock body and is not readily damaged. The lock core is disposed into the first accommodation zone through the bottom portion of the lock body, so that the lock core is arranged in an upstanding manner in the lock body, and the keyhole faces the top portion of the lock body to allow an operator to easily and efficiently find the keyhole of the lock core for conducting an unlocking operation. Further, the lock core is protected by the protective cover lid from being damaged. Further, since the lock core is arranged in an upstanding manner in the lock body, the diameter of the lock body can be reduced for fabrication and applications so as to achieve compactness and easiness of operation. Further, since the lock core is arranged in an upstanding manner in the lock body, a slight increase of the height of the lock body allows for an increase of the length of the lock core disposed therein, so as to enable increase and sophistication of the tumblers arranged inside the lock core to thereby further increase the difficulty of breaking the lock core, and this further enhances the locking security of the lock device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are schematic views showing a prior art lock device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded view of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view, partly broken, showing a lock body of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a lock core and a closure plate of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> are assembled views, in sectioned form, showing the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref> are schematic views showing implementation of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating unlocking of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref> are schematic views showing another embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Firstly, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b></figref>, the present invention provides a lock device which comprises, at least, a lock body <b>4</b> and a shackle <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the lock device, the lock body <b>4</b> is formed as a cylindrical body that is made of a metallic material that has been subjected to heat treatment to exhibit a high strength.

The protective cover lid <b>46</b> has a diameter that is smaller than the hole diameter of the first accommodation zone <b>43</b> and larger than the hole <b>421</b> of the top portion <b>42</b>, and the diameter of the protrusion portion <b>462</b> of the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is smaller than the hole <b>421</b> of the top portion <b>42</b>, so that when the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is disposed into the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is constrained by the hole <b>421</b> of the top portion <b>42</b> from falling outward. Further, the protrusion portion <b>462</b> of the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is exactly fit into the hole <b>421</b> of the top portion <b>42</b>, and preferably, the protrusion portion <b>462</b> of the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is made not higher than a height of the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, the lock core <b>47</b> is disposed through the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> into the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, such that the end of the lock core <b>47</b> that is formed with the keyhole <b>472</b> is set in a direction of facing the top portion <b>42</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>. As such, the lock core <b>47</b> is disposed in an upstanding manner, in the interior of the lock body <b>4</b>, and the lock core <b>47</b> abuts the protective cover lid <b>46</b>. Preferably, a cushion ring <b>463</b> is additionally arranged between the protective cover lid <b>46</b> and the lock core <b>47</b>. In an embodiment, the cushion ring <b>463</b> has a cross-section that is preferably circular. By means of the arrangement of the cushion ring <b>463</b>, a contact area between the lock core <b>47</b> and the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is reduced to thereby reduce a frictional force between the lock core <b>47</b> and the protective cover lid <b>46</b>. Further, since the lock bore <b>45</b> is made in communication with one side of the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> disposed in the first accommodation zone <b>43</b> is extendible into the lock bore <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, the spring <b>54</b> is first sleeved over the shackle <b>5</b>, and the spring <b>54</b> is partly received into and retained in position by the circumferential recessed groove <b>513</b> of the shackle <b>5</b>. The end of the shackle <b>5</b> that is formed with the hook portion <b>53</b> is arranged to face the lock bore <b>45</b> for insertion into the lock body <b>4</b>, so as to set the flat cut section <b>511</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> in a direction of facing the lock core <b>47</b> disposed inside the lock body <b>4</b>. Under such a condition, due to the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> being extended into and reaching into the lock bore <b>45</b>, the flat cut section <b>511</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> is set in abutting engagement with the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b>. Afterwards, the closure plate <b>48</b> is mounted by screws <b>485</b> to and closes the recessed area <b>411</b> of the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>. Under such a condition, the inset portion <b>481</b> of the closure plate <b>48</b> is inserted into a portion of the communication section <b>441</b> that provides communication between the second accommodation zone <b>44</b> and the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, so that the arc-surface side <b>482</b> of the inset portion <b>481</b> is in contact engagement with the lock core <b>47</b> that is located in the first accommodation zone <b>44</b> to fix the lock core <b>47</b>. One surface of the inset portion <b>481</b> is set flush with a wall of the second accommodation zone <b>44</b>, and the curved trough <b>483</b> of the inset portion <b>481</b> is set corresponding to the lock bore <b>45</b>, so as to have the hook portion <b>53</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> constrained by the curved trough <b>483</b>, and the top support portion <b>484</b> of the closure plate <b>48</b> engage and hold the cut-off notch <b>473</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> thereby realizing an effect of securely fixing and positioning the lock core <b>47</b>. This completes the assembly of the lock body <b>4</b>. Further, in implementation, the closure plate <b>48</b> has a thickness that corresponds to the recessed area <b>411</b> of the bottom portion <b>41</b>, so that the closure plate <b>48</b>, when disposed in and covering the recessed area <b>411</b> of the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>, exhibits a flat form with respect to the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To use the present invention, reference being had to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, firstly, two locking hasps <b>6</b> are separately mounted to an object <b>7</b> to which the lock device is to be applied. In implementation, the two locking hasps <b>6</b> are made of metallic materials that have been subjected to heat treatment to exhibit high strengths. The locking hasps <b>6</b> are provided, at an end of a back side thereof, with a lug <b>61</b>. The lug <b>61</b> is formed with a hole <b>611</b>. The locking hasps <b>6</b> are provided, on a back side thereof, with a plurality of threaded tubes <b>62</b> that are provide, in an interior thereof, with a thread. Further, the locking hasps <b>6</b> are each fit to a pad <b>63</b>. The pad <b>63</b> includes a plurality of through apertures <b>64</b> into which the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the locking hasp <b>6</b> are respectively inserted. To implement, the object <b>7</b> to which the invention is applied is first formed with holes <b>71</b> at locations corresponding to the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the locking hasps <b>6</b>, and then, the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the hasps <b>3</b> are first inserted through the through apertures <b>64</b> of the pad <b>63</b> to then penetrate from outside of the object <b>7</b> into the holes <b>71</b>. Under this condition, the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the hasps <b>3</b> penetrates into the object <b>7</b> to reach into the interior thereof, and then, the sleeves <b>65</b> are put outside the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the locking hasps <b>6</b>, and washers <b>66</b> are set on the sleeves <b>65</b>, and finally, bolts <b>67</b> are applied to fasten to the threaded tubes <b>62</b> of the locking hasps <b>6</b>, to thereby mount the locking hasps <b>6</b> to the object <b>7</b> to which the invention is to be applied. Under this condition, the object <b>7</b> to which the invention is to be applied shows, from the outside, only the locking hasps <b>6</b>, while the threaded tubes <b>62</b> and the bolts <b>67</b> of the locking hasps <b>6</b> are completely invisible from the outside, for being totally different from the prior art lock device where the hasps allow the bolts for fastening to get exposed, and therefore demonstrating a high quality of a product according to the invention. Further, the pad <b>63</b> functions to block invasion of rainwater and the likes into a space between the locking hasps <b>6</b> and the object <b>7</b> to prevent rusting from occurring at such a location.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the two locking hasps <b>6</b> on the object <b>7</b> are moved and positioned so that the two lugs <b>61</b> of the two locking hasps <b>6</b> correspond to and in alignment with each other in a horizontal direction to make the holes <b>611</b> of the two lug <b>61</b> corresponding to and in communication with each other. Next, the bottom portion <b>41</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> is disposed on and houses the two lug <b>61</b>, so that the second accommodation zone <b>44</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> encloses and conceals the two lugs <b>61</b> in the interior thereof and the top portion <b>42</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> is made facing outward. Next, pressing is applied to the rounded end portion <b>52</b> to press the shackle <b>5</b> in a direction toward the interior of the lock body <b>4</b>. Under such a condition, the shackle <b>5</b> moves along the lock bore <b>45</b> to reach into the second accommodation zone <b>44</b> and penetrating through the holes <b>611</b> of the two lug <b>61</b>, until the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> is moved into the cut-off notch <b>512</b> of the flat cut section <b>511</b> of the shackle <b>5</b>, and meanwhile, the end of the shackle <b>5</b> that is provided with the hook portion <b>53</b> gets into abutting engagement with the trough <b>442</b> of the second accommodation zone <b>44</b>, whereby the shackle <b>5</b> is thus constrained by the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> to complete the operation of locking. Under such a condition, the spring <b>54</b> encompassing the shackle <b>5</b> is compressed to retract into the large-diameter section <b>451</b> of the lock bore <b>45</b>, and the conic portion <b>521</b> of the rounded end portion <b>52</b> matches up with the expanded opening section <b>452</b> of the lock bore <b>45</b> to achieve a mutual abutting engagement therebetween, while the rounded end portion <b>52</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> is set in flush with the outer circumference of the lock body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, under such a condition, the shackle <b>5</b> of the present invention is enclosed and covered by the lock body <b>4</b> and is thus not exposed to the outside. By means of the material of high strength, the lock body <b>4</b> is sufficiently capable of resisting destruction caused by an external force. Further, when an external force is applied to powerfully strike or hit the rounded end portion <b>52</b> of the shackle <b>5</b>, in addition to the material of the shackle <b>5</b> that exhibits a high strength to resist destruction induced by such an external force, the conic portion <b>521</b> of the rounded end portion <b>52</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> is set in abutting engagement with the expanded opening section <b>452</b> of the lock bore <b>45</b> so as to transmit such an external force through the expanded opening section <b>452</b> of the lock bore <b>45</b> to the lock body <b>4</b>, not allowing the external force to transmit through the shackle <b>5</b> to the lock core <b>47</b> to expose the lock core <b>47</b> and the lock tongue <b>471</b> thereof to potential risks of being shocked or even damaged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, when an evildoer uses an electrical drill to drill the lock core <b>47</b>, since the lock core <b>47</b> is provided, on an outer side thereof, with the protective cover lid <b>46</b>, the electric drill will first contact the protective cover lid <b>46</b> to be blocked thereby from contacting the lock core <b>47</b>, so that the lock core <b>47</b> is protected from damage caused by drilling made with an electric drill. Further, the protective cover lid <b>46</b> itself is made of a material that exhibits a high strength, so that in addition to the strength thereof that is hard to be damaged through drilling, the diameter of the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is made slightly smaller than the hole diameter of the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, so that after the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is disposed into the first accommodation zone <b>43</b>, the protective cover lid <b>46</b> is in fact in a condition of being not constrained by the first accommodation zone <b>43</b> in respect of rotating in situ. Thus, in case of being drilled by an electric drill, when the electric drill gets into contact with the protective cover lid <b>46</b> through drilling, the protective cover lid <b>46</b> will be caused to rotate in situ by following the rotation of the electric drill. In this way, the electric drill is prevented from conducting effective cutting and drilling. Further, the protective cover lid <b>46</b> and the lock core <b>47</b> are provided with the cushion ring <b>463</b> arranged therebetween, and the cushion ring <b>463</b> functions to reduce the contact area between the protective cover lid <b>46</b> and the lock core <b>47</b> so as to minimize the frictional force induced between the protective cover lid <b>46</b> and the lock core <b>47</b> thereby helping make the protective cover lid <b>46</b> rotating in situ when be drilled by an electric drill and thus making the electrical drill totally impotent for conducting cutting and drilling.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Following the above, to unlock, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, an operator puts a key (not shown) through the penetration opening <b>461</b> of the protective cover lid <b>46</b> inside the top portion <b>42</b> of the lock body <b>4</b>, and makes a slight rotation for adjusting the key to align with and extend into the keyhole <b>472</b> of the lock core <b>47</b>, and then, the lock tongue <b>471</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> can be operated to rotate such that when the rotation of the lock tongue <b>471</b> reaches a position where it is allowed to get off the cut-off notch <b>512</b> of the shackle <b>5</b>, the shackle <b>5</b> is no longer constrained by the lock tongue <b>471</b> and the spring force from the spring <b>54</b> encompassing the shackle <b>5</b> elastically drives the shackle <b>5</b> to move along the lock bore <b>45</b> to eject out of the lock body <b>4</b>, until the hook portion <b>53</b> of the shackle <b>5</b> is stopped by the curved trough <b>483</b> of the inset portion <b>481</b> of the closure plate <b>48</b>, whereby the shackle <b>5</b> is made completely retracted out of the holes <b>611</b> of the two lug <b>61</b>, and the operation of unlocking is done. Afterwards, the operator may simply remove the lock body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment of the present invention, reference being had to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, raised walls <b>68</b> are circumferentially arranged around the lugs <b>61</b> of the two locking hasps <b>6</b>. The raised walls <b>68</b> of the two locking hasps <b>6</b> define a space that is sufficient to accommodate the lock body <b>4</b> therein, so that the lock body <b>4</b> is surrounded and enclosed by the raised walls <b>68</b> to provide enhanced protection of the lock body <b>4</b> against hitting by external forces. Further, the raised walls <b>68</b> are formed with a plurality of notches <b>681</b> to enable fingers of the operator to extend through the notches <b>681</b> to grip and hold the lock body <b>4</b>. Further, at least one of the notches <b>681</b> is set to correspond, in position, to the shackle <b>5</b>, so that the shackle <b>5</b> may extend through the raised wall <b>68</b> by way of such one of the notches <b>681</b> to conduct operations of locking and unlocking in combination with the lock body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the locking hasps <b>6</b> may be provided, on a front side thereof, with at least one ancillary lug <b>69</b>. The ancillary lug <b>69</b> is formed with a hole <b>691</b>, and preferably, the ancillary lug <b>69</b> is arranged in a direction that is different from the lug <b>61</b> so as to be readily differed from the lug <b>61</b> for easy identification. To implement, when an operator unlocks and removes the lock body <b>4</b> from the lugs <b>61</b>, the operator may then hang the lock body <b>4</b> on the ancillary lug <b>69</b> for temporary positioning, wherein the second accommodation zone <b>44</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> may receive the ancillary lug <b>69</b> to inset therein. In this way, the lock body <b>4</b> is provided with a location for temporary storage and keeping, and this helps eliminate the embarrassing situation where there is no place for storing or keeping the lock body <b>4</b> after unlocking. Further, the shackle <b>5</b> may be operated for locking and attaching to the hole <b>691</b> of the ancillary lug <b>69</b> so that the lock body <b>4</b> is securely attached to the ancillary lug <b>69</b>, making the ancillary lug <b>69</b> temporarily held in a more secured manner.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The efficacy that the above-described structure of the present invention may provide is that in the present invention, the shackle <b>5</b> can be deeply hidden in the lock body <b>4</b> and is not readily damaged, wherein the lock core <b>47</b> is arranged in an upstanding manner in the lock body <b>4</b>, and the keyhole <b>472</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> is arranged to face toward the top portion <b>42</b> of the lock body <b>4</b> to allow an operator to easily and efficiently find the keyhole <b>472</b> of the lock core <b>47</b> for conducting an unlocking operation, and further, the lock core <b>47</b> is protected by the protective cover lid <b>46</b> from being damaged. The present invention exhibits feature of both locking security and easiness of use. Further, since the lock core <b>47</b> is arranged in a vertically erected or upstanding manner in the lock body <b>4</b>, the diameter of the lock body <b>4</b> can be reduced for fabrication and applications so as to achieve compactness and easiness of operation. Further, since the lock core <b>47</b> is arranged in a vertically erected or standing manner in the lock body <b>4</b>, a slight increase of the height of the lock body <b>4</b> allows for an increase of the length of the lock core <b>47</b> disposed therein, so as to enable increase and sophistication of the tumblers arranged inside the lock core <b>47</b> to thereby further increase the difficulty of breaking the lock core <b>47</b>, and this further enhances the locking security of the lock device.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
