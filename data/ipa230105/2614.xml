(as determined via American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D5) of about 18-22 dmm, a softening point (as determined via ASTM D36) greater than about 112&#xb0; F., and a solubility in trichloroethylene (as determined via ASTM D2042) of at least about 98%.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0040">In some embodiments, in addition to the rubber and asphalt components, other additives that enhance, cause, and/or assist in devulcanization, liquefaction, and/or break-down of the rubber are combined, mixed, contacted, and/or blended with the rubber and/or asphalt components prior to and/or during contact of the rubber granules and asphalt in preparing the RMAC. For example, such other additives can aid in incorporation and/or combination of the rubber into the asphalt component, and/or to adjust or alter the physical properties (e.g., softening point, hardness, stability) of the RMAC. For example, any anti-foam agents, polymer latex, and/or sulfonic acids (e.g., DBSA and/or p-TSA) can be used in preparing the RMAC, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,400 (Doyle), U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,665 (Sylvester), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2005/0131113, filed Feb. 7, 2005 (Sylvester), and/or U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 2007/2049762, filed Jul. 10, 2006 (Sylvester). In some preferred embodiments, however, no such other additives are used in preparing the RMAC.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">In another embodiment, a system is provided for preparing the RMAC that comprises an asphalt charging device for charging asphalt into the system; a rubber charging device for charging rubber granules into the system; at least one heater for heating the charged asphalt, the charged rubber granules, or a mixture thereof; at least one high shear mixer for mixing the charged asphalt and charged rubber granules into a rubber-modified asphalt cement composition (i.e., for preparing the RMAC from the heated mixture of charged asphalt and charged rubber granules components); and a controller for controlling the asphalt charging device, the rubber charging device, and/or the at least one high shear mixer, in a manner such that the rubber-modified asphalt cement composition has any desired integration factor. Additionally, as is discussed herein, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and as would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the system may further comprise any additional components (such as lines, valves, input conduits, output conduit, recycle loops, etc.) needed and/or desired to optimize production of the RMAC and/or to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, speed, and/or other desirable properties achievable through use of the system. In those embodiments in which the system comprises two or more (e.g., three or more, four or more, or even five or more) high shear mixers, such mixers can be arranged in any desired manner, such as in series, in parallel, or both. It should be noted that the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided for illustration purposes only, and is in no way intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">The controller used in the present invention can be any controller that is suitable for controlling, coordinating, manipulating, and/or optimizing the operation of one or more components of the system (such as, for example, the asphalt charging device, the rubber charging device, and/or the at least one high shear mixer of the present invention) in a manner such that a rubber-modified asphalt composition having any desired integration factor is produced. In some embodiments, the controller is a semi-automatic controller that allows that any desired degree of user input and/or control during the operation of the system. In some embodiments, the controller is an automatic controller.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0043">The systems and methods described herein are low energy, energy efficient, and low cost systems and methods for the production of rubber-modified asphalt cement compositions, as compared to conventional systems and methods not comprising one or more high shear mixers in combination with the other discussed factors. In particular, for example, use of the present low energy system and/or method to produce a rubber modified asphalt cement composition from 52,000 pounds of rubber granules and having an integration factor of 98, would require at least 5% (such as at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, or even at least 40%) less energy, as compared to the energy required by a conventional system to produce a rubber-modified asphalt cement composition from 52,000 pounds of rubber granules and having an integration factor of 95.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Other End Products</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0044">The RMAC can be used alone, or in combination with any other components, to form any desired emulsions, slurry seals, surface sealers, binder compositions, and/or other desired end products for use in any desired application. In one embodiment, for example, a composition comprising the RMAC can be applied to any paved surface, such as any roadway, driving surface, and/or paved surface (such as to form a seal-coat and/or surface sealer) in any suitable manner (such as by computer rate control asphalt spreader truckers, hand spray wands, and/or by squeegees) to form a cured coating. Additionally, a composition comprised the RMAC can be applied to any industrial surface (such as to enhance corrosion resistance of steel, concrete, or the like, and/or to improve fire resistance of such surfaces), any building surface such as any roof surface (such as to form a seal-coat and/or surface sealer for the surface, such as proximate to any asphalt roof surface such as asphalt roof shingles), and/or the like, in any suitable manner. In other embodiments, the composition comprising the RMAC can be form any suitable industrial coating composition, surface sealer composition, roof sealer composition, and/or roofing asphalt cement, or the like. In all of these embodiments, the composition comprising the RMAC can form a cured coating when applied to the target surface.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">Such end products comprising the RMAC can be prepared in any suitable manner by combining, mixing, contacting, and/or blending any desired amount of the RMAC with any corresponding amount of other component(s) (e.g., emulsification solution) to produce a composition having any desired properties (such as high and/or enhanced resistance to water, fuel, and/or UV and/or no tackiness, low tackiness, and/or substantially no tackiness properties), as taught, for example, in U.S. Provisional Pat.
