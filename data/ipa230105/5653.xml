The glass content of the second part is higher than that of the first part and the third part, and the coil component has good characteristics in a high-frequency band located at around 10 GHz.

For example, an organic binder such as a polyvinyl butyral resin, an organic solvent such as ethanol or toluene, and a dispersant are added to a ferrite material and the resulting mixture is kneaded to form a slurry. After that, ceramic green sheets having a thickness of around 12 &#x3bc;m are manufactured using a method such as a doctor blade technique.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">The ferrite material may be manufactured using the following method, for example. First, iron, nickel, zinc, and copper oxide materials are mixed together and calcined at 800&#xb0; C. for one hour. After that, manufacture of a Ni&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;Cu ferrite material (oxide mixed powder) having an average particle diameter of 2 &#x3bc;m is completed by pulverizing the obtained calcined material with a ball mill and then drying the material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">When manufacturing the ceramic green sheets using a ferrite material, it is preferable that the composition of the ferrite material consist of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in a range from 40 mol % to 49.5 mol %, ZnO in a range from 5 mol % to 35 mol %, CuO in range from 4 mol % to 12 mol %, and the remainder consisting of NiO and trace amounts of additives (including inevitable impurities) in order to realize a high inductance.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">As a ceramic green sheet material, other than a magnetic material such as the ferrite material described above, for example, a non-magnetic material such as a glass ceramic material or a mixed material consisting of a magnetic material and a non-magnetic material may be used.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0089">Next, conductor patterns that will later form the coil conductors and via conductors are formed on and in the ceramic green sheets. For example, first, via holes having a diameter of around 20 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m are formed by subjecting the ceramic green sheets to laser processing. Then, via-conductor conductor patterns are formed by filling the via holes with a conductive paste such as silver paste. In addition, coil-conductor conductor patterns having a thickness of around 11 &#x3bc;m are formed via printing using a method such as screen printing using a conductive paste such as silver paste on main surfaces of the ceramic green sheets. For example, conductor patterns and so on corresponding to the coil conductors illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are formed as the coil-conductor conductor patterns by performing printing.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0090">Next, drying is performed, and as a result coil sheets having a configuration in which the coil-conductor conductor patterns and the via-conductor conductor patterns are formed on and in ceramic green sheets are obtained. The coil-conductor conductor patterns and the via-conductor conductor patterns are connected to each other in the coil sheets.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0091">Furthermore, via sheets that have a configuration in which via-conductor conductor patterns are formed are manufactured separately from the coil sheets. The via-conductor conductor patterns of the via sheets are conductor patterns that will later form the via conductors constituting the connection conductors.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0092">Next, the coil sheets are stacked in a prescribed order so that a coil having a coil axis that is parallel to the mounting surface will be formed inside the multilayer body after division into individual components and firing. At this time, at least one via sheet is interposed between each pair of coil sheets. The number of via sheets interposed between each pair of coil sheets preferably lies in a range from 1 to 7 and more preferably lies in a range from 2 to 4. The thickness of the via sheets may be the same as that of the coil sheets or may be different from that of the coil sheets. In addition, via sheets are stacked above and below the multilayer body formed of the coil sheets.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0093">The multilayer body consisting of the coil sheets and the via sheets is subjected to thermal pressure bonding in order to obtain a pressure-bonded body, and then the pressure-bonded body is cut into pieces of a predetermined chip size to obtain individual chips.

At this time, the coil-conductor conductor patterns and the via-conductor conductor patterns become the coil conductors and the via conductors after firing. The coil is formed by the coil conductors being connected to one another by the via conductors. In addition, the stacking direction of the multilayer body and the coil axis direction of the coil are parallel to the mounting surface.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0095">Next, a conductive paste such as silver paste is spread so as to form a layer of a predetermined thickness and then each multilayer body is dipped at an angle into this layer and baked to form a base electrode layer of an outer electrode on four surfaces (a main surface, an end surface, and both side surfaces) of the multilayer body. Using this method, the base electrode can be formed in one go in contrast to the case where the base electrode is formed separately on the main surface and the end surface of the multilayer body in two steps. A base electrode of an outer electrode can be formed on five surfaces of the multilayer body (four surfaces consisting of adjacent main surfaces and side surfaces in addition to the respective end surface) when a method is used in which a chip is vertically dipped in a layer formed by spreading silver paste to a prescribed thickness.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0096">Next, a nickel film and a tin film having predetermined thicknesses are formed on the base electrode layers by performing plating.
