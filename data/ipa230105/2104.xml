Consumers enjoy seeing new and interesting packaging for products, however each update or change can result in wasted packaging components if too many components are made, particularly when packaging relates to time sensitive information or events. As such, companies need to balance the benefit of discounts as a result of volume production with the risk of wasting overstocked products with obsolete packaging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, professional and collegiate sports games are scheduled almost daily during each respective season. Producing tailored product packages that reflect updated player and team statistics and other information after each game presents a steep resource demand as well as a high risk of producing too many or too few packages for the limited time period during which each batch of packages remains relevant.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As another example, product packaging can feature characters or themes from upcoming or recently released movies. If those products and corresponding packages have not been sold by the time the associated movies are no longer in theaters, the overstock may end up being discarded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, seasonal and holiday-specific product packages are commonly used and are similarly at risk of being discarded at the end of each holiday or season. For example, demand for Thanksgiving themed packages drops off precipitously after the holiday passes, at which point any unsold Thanksgiving packages would be liquidated or discarded.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, there is a need for packaging assemblies that easily customizable while mitigating the risk of waste.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment relates to a method of reducing packaging waste arising from producing customized packages. The method includes producing a plurality of trays and producing a first batch of sleeves corresponding to a first sleeve design, each sleeve of the first batch of sleeves being sized and shaped to be disposed about a respective one of the plurality of trays. The method further includes disposing each sleeve of the first batch of sleeves about a respective one of the plurality trays to assemble a first plurality of packages. The method includes producing a second batch of sleeves corresponding to a second sleeve design that is different from the first sleeve design, each sleeve of the second batch of sleeves being sized and shaped to be disposed about a respective one of the plurality trays. The method includes disposing each sleeve of the second batch of sleeves about a respective one of the plurality of trays to assemble a second plurality of packages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment relates to a package. The package includes a product, and a tray sized and shaped to be disposed within a plurality of sleeves of different sleeve designs and further defining a bowl portion sized and shaped to house the product for display. The package further includes a sleeve having a graphic on at least one outer surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another embodiment relates to a mosaic of packages. The mosaic includes a plurality of trays housing a corresponding plurality of products. The mosaic further includes a first set of sleeves incorporating a first sleeve design, the first set of sleeves disposed about a first portion of the plurality of trays to form a first set of product packages. The first set of product packages is organized to form a mosaic design, and each of the plurality of trays have the same design.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below (provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent) are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein.

It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a product package <b>100</b> according to an example arrangement is shown. The product package <b>100</b> may be used to store and protect various types of consumer-packaged goods, including foodstuffs, pet food, housewares, clothing, among other products. In various arrangements, the product package <b>100</b> includes features that are visible to consumers when the product package <b>100</b> is fully assembled, as well as features that are visible on individual components of the product package <b>100</b> that consumers may access when the product package <b>100</b> is opened. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, multiple product packages <b>100</b> may be displayed together to form visual mosaic designs corresponding to pictures, symbols, or other visual images. Consistent throughout these arrangements of the product package <b>100</b>, certain components of the product package <b>100</b> may be changed or updated and used with other components that remain unchanged, allowing for significant reductions in packaging waste, improved speed to market through the use of pre-manufactured as well as customized packaging components, and significant improvements to packaging flexibility overall.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The product package <b>100</b> is shown in an exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and an assembled configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The product package <b>100</b> may include a sleeve <b>102</b>, a tray <b>104</b>, and a product <b>106</b>. The product <b>106</b> may be any of a variety of good or goods as mentioned above such as snacks (e.g., pretzels, nuts, trail mix, chips, granola, etc.), confections (e.g., chocolates, gummy candies, hard candies, etc.), foodstuffs (e.g., rice, beans, prepared meals, sauces, spice mixes, etc.), medication (e.g., tablets, capsules, creams, etc.), pet food (e.g., wet food, dry food, treats, etc.). Here the product <b>106</b> is shown as a pouch of foodstuffs. In another example (not shown) the good or goods may be in direct contact with the tray without a pouch or enclosure around it.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The product <b>106</b> may be disposed in the tray <b>104</b> which may then be inserted into the sleeve <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As will be discussed below, the sleeve <b>102</b> is highly customizable and a common pool of trays <b>104</b> can be used to fill a wide variety of different sleeves <b>102</b>. In addition, the sleeve <b>102</b> is generally the least expensive packaging component (i.e., compared to the tray <b>104</b> or the product <b>106</b>) of the product package <b>100</b>. As such, the risk of waste as a result of an overstock of highly customized or time-sensitive packaging will be limited to only low cost, overstocked sleeves <b>102</b> (i.e., as opposed to the number of overstock sleeves, trays, and product), in stark contrast to product packages known in art that would otherwise need to be thrown out entirely. In some arrangements, the product package <b>100</b> may further include an overwrap <b>108</b> (e.g., shrink wrap, cellophane, etc.) disposed about the outer surface of the product package <b>100</b> in the assembled configuration.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a sleeve <b>302</b> is shown according to an example arrangement. The sleeve <b>302</b> may be formed out of any suitable materials such as paperboard (e.g., untreated, coated, laminated, etc.), plastics (e.g., petroleum-based, bio-based, etc.), metals (e.g., tin, copper, aluminum, alloys, etc.), or a combination of materials, some or all of which may be biodegradable, recyclable, or compostable. In the arrangement shown, the sleeve <b>302</b> includes a front panel <b>310</b>, a left side panel <b>312</b>, a right-side panel <b>314</b>, and a back panel <b>316</b> that may collectively form a rectangular exterior shape and define an open interior pocket <b>318</b> that is open on top and bottom. In other arrangements, a top panel (not shown) is used such that the sleeve <b>302</b> defines a closed interior pocket (i.e., closed at the top by the top panel). The sleeve <b>302</b> may define various other exterior shapes in other arrangements, such as a square, shapes with rounded corners, irregular shapes, and so on. In some arrangements, the sleeve <b>302</b> may be cut from a sheet of paperboard, folded, and glued to form the rectangular shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In various arrangements, the sleeve <b>302</b> may be collapsible for greater storage efficiency or improved ease of transport before being filled with a tray. For example, with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where the sleeve <b>302</b> is rectangular with an open top and bottom, a panel (e.g., the front panel <b>310</b>) may be translated laterally relative to an opposing panel (e.g., the back panel <b>316</b>) until all four panels are substantially flat and parallel in a collapsed orientation that effectively closes the interior pocket <b>318</b>. Sleeves <b>302</b> in the collapsed orientation can be stacked and stored for later use, where each sleeve <b>302</b> may be returned to an open orientation defining the interior pocket <b>318</b> that can receive a corresponding tray.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sleeve <b>302</b> may include a variety of features that give rise to one or more graphics that may be visually accessible on exterior or interior surfaces of the sleeve <b>302</b>. In various arrangements, the graphics may arise from printed features, embossed or debossed features, textured features, dyed features, transparent materials or cutout portions (e.g., so that the product <b>106</b> or portions of the tray <b>104</b> may be seen through the sleeve <b>302</b>), or three-dimensional features that may be molded, cast, or 3D printed, and so on. The sleeve <b>302</b> may further include one or more cutouts <b>320</b> or other such features that allow a consumer to more easily remove a tray disposed within the pocket <b>318</b> (e.g., by pushing on the tray <b>104</b> at the cutout <b>320</b>, then grasping and withdrawing the tray <b>104</b>). In one example, the printing on the sleeve is done using digital printing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The arrangement of the sleeve <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may include a first graphic <b>304</b>, a second graphic <b>306</b>, and a code <b>308</b> pursuant to an overall sleeve design. In this arrangement, the sleeve design is such that the first graphic <b>304</b> and the code <b>308</b> are disposed on an outer surface of the front panel <b>310</b> of the sleeve <b>302</b>, and the second graphic <b>306</b> is disposed on an outer surface of the right side panel <b>314</b>. In other arrangements, various graphics and one or more codes <b>308</b> may be disposed on any surface of the sleeve <b>302</b> or the tray (e.g., tray <b>104</b>). In some arrangements, one or more codes <b>308</b> or graphics are not visually accessible when the package <b>100</b> is assembled (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In such arrangements, the package must be opened (e.g., the sleeve <b>102</b> must be removed from the tray <b>104</b>, or the product <b>106</b> must be removed from the tray <b>104</b>) or the code <b>308</b> is otherwise initially obscured (e.g., by a sticker, scratch off layer, or so on). In addition, more or fewer graphics may be applied to more or fewer panels of the sleeve <b>302</b> in other arrangements, and further, graphics may also be disposed on one or more interior surfaces (i.e., in the pocket <b>318</b>) of the sleeve <b>302</b>. As discussed above, the first graphic <b>304</b> and the second graphic <b>306</b> may include any of various forms of visual information such as text, shapes, pictures, and so on that may be printed, embossed, dyed, or otherwise disposed on a surface of the sleeve <b>302</b>. In some arrangements, either or both the first graphic <b>304</b> and second graphic <b>306</b> may provide a portion of one or more mosaic designs as discussed in more detail below. Graphics may also be disposed on an overwrap <b>108</b> that may provide, for example, standalone text or images, or may be superimposed with graphics disposed on the underlying sleeve <b>302</b>. In some arrangements, the sleeve <b>302</b> may not include any graphics.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The code <b>308</b> may be a marker that corresponds to another piece of information or a location of information and may be presented in the form of a quick-read (QR) code, a bar code, an alphanumeric code, wireless tags (e.g., NFC, RFID, etc.) and so on. The code <b>308</b> may be read by a computing device (e.g., a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet, a laptop with a scanning apparatus, and so on) or otherwise entered into a computing system to access corresponding information such as websites, videos, images, marketing information, product information, computing device applications (e.g., loyalty program apps, games, tools, augmented reality programs, etc.), and so on that may correspond to the product <b>106</b>, its manufacturer, one or more graphics on the package, and so on. For example, a consumer may obtain an embodiment of the package <b>100</b> with the sleeve <b>302</b> having the code <b>308</b> embodied as a QR code configured to retrieve a website with a game relating to the product <b>106</b>. The consumer may use a smartphone with a QR code reader to scan the code <b>308</b>, which causes the smartphone to open a web browser displaying the website, allowing the consumer to play a game.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a tray <b>402</b> is shown according to an example arrangement. The tray <b>402</b> may be shaped and sized such that it can be disposed within the interior pocket <b>318</b> of the sleeve <b>302</b>. In various arrangements, the tray <b>402</b> may also include a variety of features that give rise to one or more graphics or codes that may be visually accessible on the tray <b>402</b>, similar to the sleeve <b>302</b>. In some such arrangements, tray <b>402</b> graphics may only be visible when the tray <b>402</b> has been removed from a corresponding sleeve <b>302</b>. In some arrangements, the overall exterior shape of the tray <b>402</b> may be similar to the sleeve <b>302</b> (e.g., both rectangular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). In other arrangements, the overall exterior shape of the tray <b>402</b> may be different than the sleeve <b>302</b> (e.g., a rectangular sleeve <b>302</b> with a tray <b>402</b> with rounded corners). The tray <b>402</b> may be sized to allow it to be disposed within the interior pocket <b>318</b> of the sleeve, but in some arrangements, the tray <b>402</b> may be sized such that one or more ends of the tray <b>402</b> protrudes out of one or more ends of the sleeve <b>302</b>. In other arrangements, the tray <b>402</b> may be sized such that the entire tray <b>402</b> may be disposed within the pocket <b>318</b> or is otherwise flush with the edges of the sleeve <b>302</b> when disposed within the pocket <b>318</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tray <b>402</b> may be formed of the same or similar materials as the sleeve <b>302</b>. For example, both the tray <b>402</b> and sleeve <b>302</b> may be formed from the same type and thickness of paperboard. However, in other arrangements, one of the sleeve <b>302</b> and tray <b>402</b> is formed of a more robust composition of materials than the other. In some arrangements, one of the tray <b>402</b> and the sleeve <b>302</b> may be formed of different materials than the other (e.g., a metallic tray <b>402</b> with a paperboard sleeve <b>302</b>). Alternatively, one of the tray <b>402</b> and the sleeve <b>302</b> may be formed with a thicker or denser composition of the same material as the other (e.g., a first thickness and a second thickness of paperboard, respectively). In some arrangements, the sleeve <b>302</b> may be formed of a more robust material than the tray <b>402</b>, in anticipation of consumers retaining the sleeve <b>302</b> and disposing the tray <b>402</b> after consuming or using the product <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the tray <b>402</b> may be formed of the more robust material than the sleeve <b>302</b>, for example to improve the performance of the tray <b>402</b> as a display or serving device for the product <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tray <b>402</b> may include a border portion <b>406</b> and a bowl portion <b>404</b> that may be shaped to house the product <b>106</b> and may operate as a serving dish or a display for the product <b>106</b> after the product package <b>100</b> is opened. The border portion <b>406</b> may be an outer portion about the outer perimeter of the tray <b>402</b> that defines edges of the bowl portion <b>404</b>. The border portion <b>406</b> may be formed of a lightweight material and may further be formed in a hollow orientation for improved structural rigidity as well as reducing weight and amount of material used for construction. In some arrangements, the border portion <b>406</b> may be formed such that it includes a flat portion sized to protect product <b>106</b> disposed within the bowl portion, have one or more graphics displayed, or provide structural rigidity to the tray <b>402</b>. In some arrangements, the border portion <b>406</b> slopes downward into the bowl portion <b>404</b> of the tray <b>402</b> in order to catch loose product <b>106</b> (e.g., when a consumer goes to pick up one or more pieces of product within the bowl portion <b>404</b>) and redirect such loose product <b>106</b> back into the bowl portion <b>404</b>. In such arrangements where the tray <b>402</b> includes a bowl portion <b>404</b>, the tray <b>402</b> may be formed of food safe materials, particularly where the product <b>106</b> includes foodstuffs that may be in direct contact with the tray <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> only has a single bowl portion <b>404</b>, however in various arrangements, the tray <b>402</b> may define multiple bowl portions with different shapes and sizes that may be customized and specific to particular products, and may further incorporate various dispensing mechanisms for the product (e.g., blisters, tear strips, and so on).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As such, the bowl portion <b>404</b> of the tray <b>402</b> conveniently eliminates the need for additional serving trays, bowls, dishes or the like, as consumers can simply remove a corresponding sleeve and use the tray <b>402</b> itself as a portable apparatus for serving or displaying product housed in the bowl portion <b>404</b>. For example, in operation according to one arrangement, a consumer may select and purchases a fully assembled embodiment of the product package <b>100</b> from a retail store. The consumer may remove the overwrap <b>108</b>, pull the tray <b>402</b> out from the interior pocket <b>318</b> of the sleeve <b>302</b> to access the product <b>106</b> (e.g., here, a pouch of foodstuffs). The consumer may remove the pouch and pours the product <b>106</b> within into the bowl portion <b>404</b> of the tray <b>402</b> for convenient access and consumption. At any point throughout, the consumer may scan the code <b>308</b> with a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone) to access media provided by the product manufacturer (e.g., a video).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a first mosaic <b>500</b> and a second mosaic <b>600</b> are respectively shown according to example arrangements of product packages. Each of the mosaics <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be constructed from a set of product packages (e.g., product package <b>100</b>) that are organized to collectively form a visual design. For ease of this explanation, the first mosaic <b>500</b> is constructed to form a &#x201c;P&#x201d; from a first set of packages <b>502</b>, and the second mosaic <b>600</b> is constructed to form an &#x201c;L&#x201d; from a second set of packages <b>602</b>, although mosaics of similar, more, or less detail are also contemplated under this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each set of product packages <b>502</b>, <b>602</b> may be designed to collectively form a respective mosaic <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> as a result of the overall composition of the graphics disposed on the components of each product package. For example, the first mosaic <b>500</b> may be constructed from product packages with graphics disposed on one panel of each respective sleeve (e.g., the right side panel <b>314</b>). In another arrangement, the graphics of the packages forming first mosaic may arise from images on the overwrap superimposed on underlying images on the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As discussed above, the present disclosure provides for product packages that can be quickly adapted and customized by making changes to the sleeves. In some arrangements, a mosaic (e.g., the first mosaic <b>500</b>) may be formed from packages assembled from a single batch of sleeves designed to create that particular mosaic. As such, for example, a retailer may receive a single batch of product packages that are already assembled into an intended mosaic, or may receive a single batch of product packages sufficient to allow the retailer to assemble the corresponding mosaic themselves.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation according to one arrangement relating to an athletics promotion, a first sleeve design is created, a first batch of sleeves is produced pursuant to the first sleeve design, and the first batch of sleeves assembled into product packages (e.g., <b>100</b>) and then organized to form the first mosaic <b>500</b> in support of team P following their latest win. One week later, a second sleeve design is created, a second batch of sleeves is produced pursuant to the second sleeve design, and the second batch of sleeves is assembled into product packages to form the second mosaic <b>600</b> in support of team L following their most recent win. Consistent across the product packages of the first mosaic <b>500</b> and the second mosaic <b>600</b>, the same trays and products may be used without any changes between the two mosaics. As such, trays and product may be produced and stored in bulk, while sleeves are customized and made in limited quantity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, in other arrangements, mosaics may be formed from product packages with sleeves made from several batches. For example, a first batch of product packages include a first batch of sleeves corresponding to one piece of the first mosaic, a second batch of product packages include a second batch of sleeves corresponding to a second piece of the first mosaic, and so on. Each batch may be released over time, and consumers may collect them until they are able to construct the intended mosaic. One or more visual components of each product package (e.g., a graphic on a sleeve, or the code <b>308</b>) can provide mosaic assembly instructions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram showing a method <b>700</b> of producing product packages in accordance with example embodiments. In some embodiments, the volume of trays produced may be independent of the volume of sleeves produced, thereby allowing for greater manufacturing flexibility and efficiency as well as package customization as the same tray design can be used across multiple embodiments of sleeves.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At <b>702</b>, a plurality of trays (e.g., tray <b>104</b>, <b>402</b>) is produced. Trays may be produced to house and protect product (e.g., <b>106</b>) for the overall product package. In various arrangements, the trays may be produced with one or more bowl portions (e.g., bowl portion <b>404</b>) that may be shaped and sized to allow for display or easy access to the product after the product package has been opened. Trays may be cut, folded, and glued, or may be blow molded, 3D printed, casted, and so on.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>704</b>, the plurality of trays is filled. The trays produced at <b>702</b> may be filled with product (e.g., product <b>106</b>), for example foodstuffs, clothing, or other consumer packaged goods. In arrangements where the tray defines a bowl portion (e.g., bowl portion <b>404</b>), the product may be disposed within the bowl portion of the tray. In some arrangements, trays may be filled with product that correspond to a sleeve design (e.g., corresponding colors, corresponding themes or motifs, and so on). In such arrangements, these trays may not be filled until a sleeve design is created (e.g., at <b>708</b> or <b>716</b>, as described below). For example, a first set of trays may be filled with confectionery products having the team colors of one athletic team which is to be disposed in a sleeve having a first sleeve design incorporating those team colors, and a second set of trays may be filled with confectionery products having the team colors of a second athletic team which may be disposed in another sleeve having a second sleeve design incorporating the colors of the second team.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some arrangements, the plurality of trays produced at <b>702</b> may be stored at <b>706</b>. Trays may be filled before or after storage at <b>706</b>. Storing the trays allows the product packaging manufacturer to produce an inventory of trays that may be used across various product packages with different sleeves, thereby cutting down on manufacturing time, reducing costs as a result of safely producing higher volumes of trays, and reducing potential waste as each tray can be used with various different sleeves. The trays may be stored until they are needed to fill a batch of sleeves.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At <b>708</b>, a first sleeve design is created. The first sleeve design may include any of a variety of graphics and visually accessible information (e.g., images, pictures, text, codes, and so on) that may be disposed on one or more surfaces of a sleeve.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At <b>710</b>, a batch of product package sleeves (e.g., sleeve <b>102</b>, <b>302</b>) corresponding to the first sleeve design is produced. The batch of sleeves may be produced by any means known in the art, for example by cutting, folding, and gluing paperboard. Graphics corresponding to the first sleeve design may be added to the sleeves by printing, embossing, debossing, dying, and so on. In one example, the printing on the product package sleeves is done using digital printing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At <b>712</b>, the batch of sleeves produced at <b>710</b> are disposed about at least some of the trays produced at <b>702</b> to assemble a first plurality of product packages. In some arrangements, the sleeves produced at <b>710</b> may be fully assembled such that each tray is inserted into an interior pocket (e.g., interior pocket <b>318</b>) of a corresponding sleeve. In other arrangements, the sleeves produced at <b>710</b> are flat blanks that are disposed about a corresponding tray and coupled at terminal ends (e.g., by gluing terminal ends of a sleeve blank together).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some arrangements, an overwrap (e.g., overwrap <b>108</b>) is applied at <b>714</b>. In some such arrangements, the overwrap may be transparent about the entire product package and offers additional protection to the packaging and product. In other such arrangements, the overwrap may include additional graphical features that overlay the sleeve produced at <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At <b>716</b>, a second sleeve design is created. The second sleeve design may be different from the first sleeve design, and may influenced by an event (e.g., an athletic team winning a game, a new movie, etc.), new information (e.g., updated statistics), and so on. After some visual component of the sleeve is changed, a corresponding batch of sleeves may be produced at <b>710</b>, disposed about a tray at <b>712</b> to create a second plurality of product packages, and optionally overwrapped at <b>714</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In arrangements where product packages are used to construct mosaic designs (e.g., mosaic <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>), mosaic designs are created at <b>718</b>. Each mosaic design may be broken up into individual pieces to be disposed on exterior surfaces of product packages (e.g., right side panel <b>314</b> of the sleeve) across sleeve designs for one or more batches of sleeves. In some arrangements, each of the first sleeve design and the second sleeve design may correspond to an entire respective mosaic designed at <b>718</b>. In other arrangements, each of the first sleeve design and the second sleeve design may only correspond to one or more pieces of a mosaic designed at <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that the orientation of various elements may differ according to other exemplary embodiments, and that such variations are intended to be encompassed by the present disclosure.
