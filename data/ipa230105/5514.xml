Accordingly, constituent semiconductor devices (e.g., logic and/or memory devices) should provide faster data access, expanded data bandwidth, increased data storage capabilities and/or reduced power consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A semiconductor memory device (hereafter generically, a &#x201c;memory device&#x201d;) typically operates in response to one or more command(s), address(es), data and/or control signal(s) including clock signal(s) (hereafter singularly of collectively, Command &#x26; Control/Address/Data or &#x201c;CAD signals:). Various CAD signals may be provided by a memory controller.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Respective command(s) may be used to control the operation of a memory device. That is, the memory device perform one or more data access operations in response to a corresponding command. For example, a read command may invoke execution of a read operation that retrieves &#x201c;read data&#x201d; from the memory device, and a write (or program) command may invoke a write (or program) operation that stores &#x201c;write data&#x201d; in the memory device. In this regard, read data associated with a read command or write data associated with a write command may be exchanged between a memory controller and the memory device in relation to defined timings constraints. Thus, the successful execution of various data access operations by the memory device requires accurate control over the timing of data reception and/or data transmission (hereafter, &#x201c;data communications&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain externally-provided clocks (hereafter, &#x201c;external clocks&#x201d;) such as a system clock and/or a data clock may be provided to the memory device by the memory controller. The system clock may be used to control the timing of commands and addresses, whereas the data clock may be used to control the timing of certain data communications (e.g., write data being provided to the memory device). Additionally, the memory device may provide a read clock to the memory controller in order to control the timing of other data communications (e.g., read data being provided from the memory device to the memory controller). A frequency of a data clock may be greater than a frequency of a system clock. For example, a frequency of a data clock may be an integer multiple of a frequency of a system clock.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An external clock provided to the memory device may be used to generate one or more internal clock(s) used to control the timing(s) of various internal circuits during operation of the memory device. The interrelated timing(s) of these internal circuits is critical to the successful execution of data access operations. Accordingly, any deviation in the functioning of an internal clock may cause a malfunction (or performance departure) in the memory device. One example of a common deviation in clock timing is duty cycle distortion (e.g., a deviation from a defined 50% duty cycle).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further complicating concerns regarding correct data access timing (e.g., proper clock operation), a memory controller and a memory device arranged in a memory system may have been manufactured under very different (e.g., different semiconductor manufacturing processes, temperatures, voltages, etc.). Accordingly, the memory controller and the memory device may exhibit differing operating characteristics, such as operating speed, power consumption, etc. In view of these possibilities, it is typical to &#x201c;train&#x201d; the memory controller in relation to the actual performance of the memory device in order to adjust, as necessary, the duty cycle of a data clock (e.g., a data clock defined to have an ideal 50% duty cycle). However, after performing data clock training, the memory controller may additionally require training in relation to the read clock, wherein the duty cycle of the read clock may be adjusted in relation to the actual performance of the memory device (e.g., a read clock defined to have an ideal 50% duty cycle).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Unfortunately, sophisticated data clock training and read clock training performed between the memory controller and the memory device may involve sequentially and repeatedly performing various operations such as adjusting, changing, and/or correcting a code under the control of a specialized training program, and this approach may involve considerable time and system resource consumption.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide apparatuses, memory devices and methods of operation that markedly reduce the time required to perform data clock and read clock training.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the inventive concept, a memory device may include;

For example, a command may be issued by the memory controller <b>110</b> to the memory device <b>120</b> to perform the operation(s) described hereafter. For brevity, details regarding a particular command and details related to the issuing of the particular command are deemed to fall within the state of the art and are therefore omitted to preserve descriptive clarity.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the memory device <b>120</b> may perform a DCM operation on a WCK clock by using the first DCM circuit <b>352</b>, to provide information necessary for the memory controller <b>110</b> to read a DCM result on the WCK clock (S<b>1210</b>). The DCM operation of operation S<b>1210</b> may start as the memory controller <b>110</b> issues mode register write commands MRW-<b>1</b> and MRW&#x2212;2 to the memory device <b>120</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The memory controller <b>110</b> may wait for the time tDCMM for the first DCM circuit <b>352</b> to complete measuring a WCK duty cycle. The memory controller <b>110</b> may issue the mode register write commands MRW-<b>1</b> and MRW&#x2212;2 to flip an input of the first DCM operation S<b>910</b> to switch OP[1] code of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b</i>. The memory controller <b>110</b> may wait for the time tDCMM for the first DCM circuit <b>352</b> to complete WCK duty cycle measurement with the flipped inputs. The memory controller <b>110</b> may exit from the first DCM operation (S<b>1210</b>) by issuing the mode register write commands MRW-<b>1</b> and MRW&#x2212;2. When escaping the first DCM operation (S<b>1210</b>), a current DCM result may be automatically captured when OP[1] of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b </i>is logic low, and stored in OP[2]/OP[4] of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b</i>, and a current DCM result may be automatically captured when OP[1] of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b </i>is logic high, and stored in OP[3]/OP[5] of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b</i>. The DCM result stored in OP[5:2] of the second mode register <b>122</b><i>b </i>may be provided to the memory controller <b>110</b> by an MMR command issued by the memory controller <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The memory controller <b>110</b> may provide a timing-adjusted WCK clock based on the DCM result of the DCM operation (S<b>1210</b>) on the WCK clock. The memory device <b>120</b> may correct the RDQS duty cycle based on the RDQS offset code RDQS_OFFSET stored in the storage circuit <b>366</b> (S<b>1220</b>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the RDQS duty cycle may be corrected based on the RDQS offset code RDQS_OFFSET based on the WCK clock timing adjusted at time Tf1. Here, it will be understood that the RDQS duty cycle correction operation is performed without the RDQS training operation (S<b>920</b>) described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system <b>1000</b> to which the clock training method according to the embodiments of the inventive may be applied.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the system <b>1000</b> may include a camera <b>1100</b>, a display <b>1200</b>, an audio processor <b>1300</b>, a modem <b>1400</b>, DRAMs <b>1500</b><i>a </i>and <b>1500</b><i>b</i>, and flash memories <b>1600</b><i>a </i>and <b>1600</b><i>b</i>, I/O devices <b>1700</b><i>a </i>and <b>1700</b><i>b</i>, and an AP <b>1800</b>.
