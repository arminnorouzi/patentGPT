id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to the delivery, mixing and/or biomanufacturing of biological fluids within biocontainers or bioreactors. More particularly, a fluid flow diverter for use with biocontainers and bioreactors is disclosed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Biological fluids are processed in solutions in the bioprocessing industry. Processes include, for example, cell culturing and production of desired products, e.g., cells, viruses, capsids, monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, and inactivated viruses for use in plant and animal-based cells of the biological fluids and related therapies. During processing, chemicals, reagents, buffer solutions, adjuvants, processing aids, and the like are added to biological solutions. However, these additions are typically delivered above a fluid level, creating a splashing effect. The splashing can create an undesirable foaming and/or aeration of the biological fluid, leading to the need for the delivery of a defoaming agent.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Past attempts to deliver fluids to a bioreactor have included the use of a port located adjacent the bottom, i.e., below a fluid level, in conjunction with a pump in fluid communication therewith. However, all components in contact with biological fluids need to be sterile. Sterilizing a pump after each use is an expensive undertaking and failure modes are many. Moreover, pumps are too expensive to be used once and discarded. And, if a flow diverter is used at a submerged inlet, &#x201c;dead&#x201d; spots are created in the bioreactor, i.e., areas in which liquids are too insulated from mixing and, therefore, any components that settle undissolved tend to remain undissolved. Furthermore, the inlet port tends to be adjacent an outlet port attached to a conduit, wherein the conduit is disposed between the outlet port and a valve outside the bioreactor. Undissolved components can unfavorably collect in the conduit, leading to a waste of reagents and concentration variability in biological solutions. If two fluids must be delivered to the bottom of a bioreactor, two flow diverters would be needed as well as a baffle(s) disposed near the bottom, creating stagnant areas.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A flow diverter(s), which allows the quick delivery of a retentate, reagents, buffer solutions, chemicals, and the like above a fluid level to a biocontainer or bioreactor without creating a splashing or aerating condition and overcomes the limitations of the technology described above represents an advance in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the present disclosure comprise a flow diverter for use in a biocontainer or bioreactor, comprising a shoulder having a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface, a conduit extending from the first surface of the shoulder, an inlet at a first end of the conduit, wherein the first end comprises a connector, an outlet formed within the second surface of the shoulder in fluid communication with the inlet at an end opposite the first end of the conduit and a hood adjacent to the outlet, wherein a fluid diverter is capable of directing a fluid down a sidewall of the biocontainer or bioreactor, attenuating a splashing or foaming condition.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments of the present disclosure comprise a flow diverter for use in a biocontainer or bioreactor, comprising a shoulder having a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface, a conduit extending from the first surface of the shoulder, an inlet at a first end of the conduit, wherein the first end comprises a connector, an outlet formed within the second surface of the shoulder in fluid communication with the inlet at an end opposite the first end of the conduit and a deflecting film bonded to adjacent to the outlet, wherein a fluid diverter is capable of directing a fluid down a sidewall of the biocontainer or bioreactor, attenuating a splashing or foaming condition.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some embodiments of the present disclosure comprise, optionally, a plurality of flow diverters for use in a single use biocontainers or bioreactors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other provisions will become clear from the description, claims, and figures below.

It is depicted that the outlet <b>118</b> is in fluid communication with the inner diameter <b>110</b> of the conduit <b>106</b>. The flow diverter <b>100</b> may be made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 46, polyether sulfone, polysulfone, and other sterilizable polymers typically used in the bioprocessing industry, i.e., by steaming, or alcohol solutions sterilization processes as are known to those in the art. Gamma radiation sterilization processes may be used for polymers that are gamma-stable, e.g., HDPE. The flow diverter <b>100</b> may be manufactured using, for example, injection molding processes and may be a single integral piece, i.e., molded via a single injection molding process. In some embodiments, the flow diverter can also be manufactured through additive manufacturing (3D Printing) in various materials. In some embodiments, the flow diverter <b>100</b> is machined from a single stock piece, i.e., plastic, ceramic, or metal. The flow diverter <b>100</b> may also be more than one piece, which are joined by adhesives or heat-staking processes. It is to be understood that fluid entering the flow diverter <b>100</b>, at the inlet <b>108</b> exits the flow diverter <b>100</b> at the outlet <b>112</b>. The outlet <b>112</b> is oriented such that the fluid flows and/or is directed parallel to a side wall of a biocontainer or bioreactor, wherein the fluid runs down a sidewall of the biocontainer.

Flexible film baffles disclosed herein are described in US 2016/0040113A1, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. According to some embodiments, described is a container <b>400</b> having a bottom surface <b>318</b>, a top surface <b>316</b>, and sidewalls <b>310</b>, such as a disposable or single use container, having an inner volume <b>330</b>, optionally having one or more inlets <b>302</b> and one or more flow diverters <b>100</b>,<b>200</b>, one or more outlets <b>304</b> and a mixer comprising a drive <b>334</b> and an agitator <b>332</b> associated with the container to cause mixing and dispersing of one or more ingredients contained or added to the container. The drive <b>334</b> may be a shaftless drive, wherein the agitator comprises a magnet (not shown) and blades <b>336</b>. According to some embodiments, the container <b>400</b> includes a flexible baffle <b>324</b> shaped and positioned within the container <b>400</b> to improve mixing. The baffle <b>324</b> is positioned within the container so as to disrupt a vortex formed by the mixer or prevent formation of a vortex, wherein the baffle <b>324</b> projects out of the fluid contained within the inner volume <b>330</b> of the biocontainer <b>400</b>. The formation of a vortex may cause stagnant zones of inadequate mixing and is often associated with a single agitator. A flexible baffle <b>324</b> having a first diagonal member <b>322</b> and a second diagonal member <b>320</b> opposite the first diagonal member can be added to suppress vortex formation. As shown, the second diagonal member <b>320</b> is disposed in front of the first diagonal member <b>322</b>. In practice, the first diagonal member <b>322</b> and the second diagonal member <b>320</b> may be a single piece. In some embodiments, both the first diagonal member <b>322</b> and the second diagonal member <b>320</b> may pass through a center point of the inner volume <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, the first diagonal member <b>322</b> and the second diagonal member <b>320</b> may not pass through a center point. The location of the mixer can dictate where a vortex may form. For example, the vortex may form closer to a sidewall <b>310</b> if the mixer itself is closer to a sidewall <b>310</b>. Accordingly, providing a baffle <b>324</b> having diagonal members <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, which extend from the bottom surface <b>318</b> to the top surface <b>316</b> necessarily allows disruption of any vortex formed irrespective of any fluid level <b>314</b>. As above, the biocontainer <b>400</b> also comprises a plurality of flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> on a sidewall <b>310</b>, which is disposed above a fluid level <b>314</b>, for delivery of a fluid, such as a biological fluid, a biological processing aid, a buffer solution, an adjuvant solution, or other fluids used in bioprocessing, as are known to those in the art, wherein the flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> allow any fluid entering the ports to flow down the sidewall <b>310</b>, attenuating any potential splashing or foaming conditions. As shown, the biocontainer <b>400</b> comprises a plurality of flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. It is to be understood that the biocontainer <b>300</b> may also comprise a plurality of flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. Providing a plurality of flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> allows for a plurality of liquids to be delivered to the inner volume <b>330</b> of the biocontainer <b>400</b>. For example, some perfusion or tangential flow filtration processes include the re-circulation of a retentate fluid following a filtration step, wherein the retentate is drawn from the biocontainer <b>400</b> and is subsequently delivered to the biocontainer <b>400</b> via one of the flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> following a filtration step. Similarly, a buffer solution or adjuvant solution may be delivered to the biocontainer <b>400</b> through one or more of the flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flow diverter <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 46, polyether sulfone, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) or copolymers or blends thereof, and other sterilizable polymers typically used in the bioprocessing industry. The flow diverter <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be manufactured using, for example, injection molding processes, machining processes, milling processes, 3D printing, and the like.

It is to be further noted that, optionally, the flow diverters are made of plastic and all corners, etc., are radiused so that where the flow diverters are joined to a bioreactor or biocontainer before shipping, the risk of the flow diverters puncturing or abrading the bioreactor or biocontainer is minimized. Such designs further prevent the bioreactors/biocontainers from having the sterility compromised during or after shipping. It is to be further understood that any and all embodiments of the flow diverters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and others have many advances over the prior art. Any of the flow diverters described herein can be scaled to differing sizes, e.g., external sizes, internal diameters for conduits, differently sized connectors, differing connector styles, etc., so accommodate various tubing, ports, connectors to stably control the addition of various fluids.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">All ranges for formulations recited herein include ranges therebetween and can be inclusive or exclusive of the endpoints. Optional included ranges are from integer values therebetween (or inclusive of one original endpoint), at the order of magnitude recited or the next smaller order of magnitude, e.g., if the lower range value is 0.2, optional included endpoints can be 0.3, 0.4, . . . 1.1, 1.2, and the like, as well as 1, 2, 3 and the like; if the higher range is 8, optional included endpoints can be 7, 6, and the like, as well as 7.9, 7.8, and the like. One-sided boundaries, such as 3 or more, similarly include consistent boundaries (or ranges) starting at integer values at the recited order of magnitude or one lower. For example, 3 or more includes 4, or 3.1 or more.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; indicates that a feature, structure, material, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure.
