It is an underrecognized and consequently, undertreated problem, contributing significantly to prolonged opioid use and subsequent misuse. Furthermore, CPSP negatively impacts psychological health and quality of life, leading to disability and suicidal ideation. In order to curb this problem, development of targeted and individualized pain management strategies would be beneficial; however, there are critical gaps in the ability to predict individual risk for CPSP.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Preoperative pain, surgical duration and psychological factors like childhood anxiety sensitivity index (CASI) are associated with CPSP risk in adolescents undergoing spine surgery. However, these factors only explain 16% of variability with medium accuracy in predicting CPSP. Thus, objective biomarkers with higher accuracy are needed to guide preventive and management strategies toward. Incorporation of genetic risk in predicting CPSP could effectively improve predictive accuracy; however, to date only small effect sizes of single variants can explain only a low percentage of the phenotypic variance. Combined effects of a large number of susceptibility loci may become large enough to be useful for targeted risk prediction and prevention. As such, development of a method of assessing polygenic risk profiling for CPSP may have translational potential as a predictive and prognostic biomarker as a PRS is used to model weak contributions of several variants, whereby an individual's genetic risk is the sum of all their risk alleles weighted by significance of the corresponding allele in genome wide association studies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the identification of genetic factors and non-genetic factors as indicators for chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) in human subjects, either taken alone or in combination.

In some instances, the non-genetic factors may further comprise one or more psychophysical factors of the subject. Accordingly, provided herein are methods and kits for assessing risk of CPSP in a subject relying on the genetic factors, the non-genetic factors, or a combination thereof.

The genetic factors include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific genes. The non-genetic factors include, for example, childhood anxiety sensitivity index (CASI), pain catastrophizing (PCS-C) score, pediatric pain sensitivity score, surgical duration, and area under curve (AUC) of a pain score at days 1 and 2 post-surgery (Pain_AUC_POD12).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Accordingly, provided herein are methods for assessing CPSP risk in a subject relying on genetic factors, non-genetic factors, or a combination thereof. Such methods support for CPSP risk stratification and development of tailored prevention. For example, the assessment obtained from such methods would facilitate selecting suitable pain management approaches and applying such to the subject.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">I.

The set of oligonucleotides collectively detects the SNPs in the combination. The oligonucleotide for detecting a target SNP may comprise one probe that is differentially hybridizable to one allele of the SNP. Alternatively, the oligonucleotide for detecting a target SNP may comprise a pair of probes, one of which is differentially hybridizable to one allele and the other of which is differentially hybridizable to the other allele.

PPT refers to the minimum force applied to a subject that induces pain. See, e.g., Park et al., Ann Rehabil Med. 2011, 35(3):412-417. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is a psychophysical experimental measure of the endogenous pain inhibitory pathway in humans. Kennedy et al., Pain 2016, 157(11):2410-2419. Temporal summation is a clinical measure of central sensitization in which a high frequency of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron elicits postsynaptic potentials that overlap and summate with each other.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">In some examples, one of more of the following non-genetic factors may be determined in a subject for assessing the subject's risk for CPSP, either taken alone or in combination with any of the genetic factors disclosed herein: childhood anxiety sensitivity index (CASI), pain catastrophizing (PCS-C) score, pediatric pain sensitivity score, surgical duration, and area under curve (AUC) of a pain score at days 1 and 2 post-surgery (Pain_AUC_POD12).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">CASI typically measures anxiety sensitivity, which is an established cognitive risk factor for anxiety disorders. In some examples, CASI may be comprised of lower-order factors pertaining to physical, psychological and social concerns. Factor structure of CASI is well known in the art. See, e.g., Silverman et al., <i>Behav, Res. Ther, </i>1999, 37(9):903-917; and Muris, <i>Behav, Res.

Child versions of PCS-C and parent versions of PCS-C are known in the art. See, for example, Crombez et al., Pain 2003 104(3):639-46 and Goubert et al., Pain 2006 123(3):254-263.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">Measurement of other non-genetic factors disclosed herein is also known in the art.

A PRS for a subject may be calculated using a computational method as known in the art based on the SNP status of those SNPs in a genetic profile of a subject. For example, logistic and/or linear models may be used for PRS calculation. In other examples, a multiple regression model may be used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">In some examples, the PRS may be calculated as a weighted sum of products between number of risk alleles and their corresponding regression coefficients. Risk alleles of exemplary SNPs as disclosed herein and their exemplary regression coefficients are provided in Table 6. In some examples, SNPs provided in Table 9 can be used for PRS calculation. In some examples, bootstrapping may be applied to validate the prediction model. For example, PRS may be weighted by regression coefficients of the SNPs in the SNP combination to produce a weighted PRS.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">In some embodiments, a PRS of a subject can be used to predict risk of CPSP for that subject. The PRS of a candidate subject (e.g., a human subject) may be compared with a reference value. In some examples, the reference value may represent a PRS of a subject of the same species as the candidate subject (e.g., a human subject) and having CPSP, wherein the PRS is calculated by the same method (e.g., same computational model) based on the same SNP combination. In other examples, the reference value may represent a PRS of a subject of the same species as the candidate subject (e.g., a human subject) and having no CPSP, wherein the PRS is calculated by the same method (e.g., same computational model) based on the same SNP combination. Such reference values in association with a particular SNP combination can be predetermined based on PRS scores of subjects representing high CPSP risk or minor CPSP risk. By comparing the PRS of a candidate subject with a corresponding reference value (e.g., PRS calculated by the same method based on the same SNP combination), the risk for CPSP for the candidate subject can be determined. For example, if the PRS of a candidate subject is close to a corresponding reference value representing high CPSP risk, that candidate subject can be predicted as having a high risk for CPSP. Alternatively, if the PRS of a candidate subject is close to a corresponding reference value representing minor CPSP risk, that candidate subject can be predicted as having a low risk for CPSP.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">In some embodiments, the CPSP risk for a subject may be assessed by a PRS of that subject alone. In other embodiments, at least one non-genetic factor, for example, a psychosocial factor, a psychophysical factor, or a combination thereof, can be used as a covariate in combination with a PRS for assessment of CPSP risk. Such non-genetic factors may be used in a multiple regression model to assess risk for CPSP.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">In some examples, a full regression model may be applied in assessing risk for CPSP, taking into consideration weighted PRS in combination with multiple non-genetic factors, for example, CASI, surgical duration, and Pain_AUC_POD12. In other examples a reduced regression model may be used for assessing risk for CPSP, taking into consideration weighted PRS in combination with one non-genetic factor, for example, CASI. See also Table 10.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">Alternatively or in addition, the risk for CPSP can be assessed by one of the genetic factors as disclosed herein in combination with one or more non-genetic factors. In some examples, the non-genetic factors may comprise one or more of psychosocial factors as those disclosed herein.

In some embodiments, the subject is not a human patient who has been diagnosed as having chronic pain. In other embodiments, the subject is free of any opioid in the past six months before the assessment. Alternatively or in addition, the subject is not a human patient having hepatic and/or renal disease or having developmental delays.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">II. Tailored Pain Management Based on CPSP Risk Assessment</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0081">After the risk for CPSP of a subject has been assessed using any of the methods disclosed herein, a tailored pain management approach may be determined based on that subject's risk for CPSP. As such, any of the methods disclosed herein may further comprise applying to the subject a pain management approach based on the subject's risk of developing CPSP.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">A pain management approach may comprise the use of an analgesic, application of a one psychosocial therapy, or a combination thereof. Examples of analgesics include, but are not limited to bupivacaine, ropivacaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine, chloroprocaine, lidocaine, gabapentin, morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and clonidine. In some examples, the analgesic may be systemically administered. In other examples, the analgesic may be locally applied, e.g., to the surgery site. Non-limiting examples of psychosocial therapy include psychotherapy, psychoeducation, self-help, support groups, psychosocial rehabilitation, contingency management, cognitive behavioral therapy, and assertive community treatment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">In some embodiments, a pain management approach based on the subject's risk of developing CPSP may include administering a physician-guided opioid medication management and tapering regimen, an opioid-sparing pharmacotherapy, a non-opioid pharmacotherapy, and/or a combination thereof after surgery to prevent CPSP. In some embodiments, a physician-guided opioid medication tapering regimen concludes about 2 to about 5 months after surgery. In some embodiments, a physician-guided opioid medication tapering regimen concludes about 3 months after surgery.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0084">A suitable pain management approach may be selected based on the subject's risk for CPSP. For example, if a subject is assessed as having low risk for CPSP, one or more psychosocial therapies may be used, either taken alone or in combination with a mild analgesic. On the other hand, if a subject is assessed as having a high risk for CPSP, a strong analgesic may be selected, either taken alone or in combination with one or more psychosocial therapies. Choosing suitable pain management approaches for subjects having different levels of CPSP risk would be within the knowledge of medical practitioners.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">III. Kit for CPSP Risk Assessment</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0085">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a kit for determining a genetic profile and optionally for assessing the risk for CPSP. Such a kit may comprise means for determining any of the SNP combinations disclosed herein, for example, means for determining the 24 SNPs listed in Table 9.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">In some embodiments, the means for determining genetic status of the SNP combination may comprise a set of primer pairs. Each of the primer pairs are designed for amplifying a fragment (e.g., around 150 bp or around 100 bp) encompassing the site of a target SNP. The set of primer pairs, collectively, are designed for amplifying fragments encompassing the sites of all target SNPs in a SNP combination, e.g., those disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">In other embodiments, the means for determining genetic status of the SNP combination may comprise a set of oligosaccharides. Each of the oligonucleotides is designed for detecting a target SNP in the combination and the whole set, collectively, is designed for detecting all SNPs in the combination. Such an oligonucleotide may be differentially hybridizable to one allele of a SNP (e.g., hybridizable to only allele under certain hybridization conditions). Design of such an oligonucleotide for detecting a particular allele of a SNP is within the knowledge of a skilled person in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. et al., MOLECULAR CLONING&#x2014;A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">In some example, the kit disclosed herein may comprise a microarray chip comprising a support member, on which the set of oligonucleotides (probes) can be immobilized. The probes may comprise DNA sequences, RNA sequences, or a hybrid of DNA and RNA sequences. The probes may also comprise modified nucleotide residues. The support member in the microarray chip may be either porous or non-porous. For example, the probes may be attached to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane or filter covalently at either the 3&#x2032; or the 5&#x2032; end of the polynucleotide. Alternatively, the support member may have a glass or plastic surface. In one embodiment, hybridization levels are measured to microarrays of probes consisting of a solid phase on the surface of which are immobilized a population of polynucleotides, such as a population of DNA or DNA mimics, or, alternatively, a population of RNA or RNA mimics. The solid phase may be a nonporous or, optionally, a porous material such as a gel.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0089">In one embodiment, a microarray chip may comprise a support member with an ordered array of binding (e.g., hybridization) sites or &#x201c;probes&#x201d; each representing one of the target SNP described herein. Preferably the microarrays are addressable arrays, and more preferably positionally addressable arrays. For example, each probe of the array is preferably located at a known, predetermined position on the solid support such that the identity (i.e., the sequence) of each probe can be determined from its position in the array (i.e., on the support or surface). In preferred embodiments, each probe is covalently attached to the solid support at a single site.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0090">The microarray chips disclosed herein can be made in a number of ways. In some examples, the microarray chips are reproducible, allowing multiple copies of a given array to be produced and easily compared with each other. In some examples, microarrays are made from materials that are stable under binding (e.g., nucleic acid hybridization) conditions. The microarrays may be small, e.g., between 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>and 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, between 12 cm<sup>2 </sup>and 13 cm<sup>2</sup>, or about 3 cm<sup>2</sup>. However, larger arrays are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0091">Any of the kits disclosed herein may further comprise a container for placing a biological sample, and optionally a tool for collecting a biological sample from a subject. Alternatively or in addition, the kit may further comprise one or more reagents for extracting nucleic acids from the biological sample. In some examples, the kit may comprise reagents for PCR amplification of fragments encompassing target SNP sites. In other examples, the kit may comprise reagents for hybridization.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0092">Any of the kits may further comprise an instruction manual providing guidance for using the kit to determine a genetic profile comprising a combination of the target SNPs as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0093">In some embodiments, the kit may further comprise questionnaires for assessing one or more of the non-genetic factors associated with the CPSP risk, e.g., CASI, PCS-C, etc. Instructions of how to use such questionnaires for assessing the non-genetic factors may also be included.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0094">Further, any of the kits disclosed herein may comprise a processor, e.g., a computational processor, for PSR calculation and/or CPSP risk assessment. Such a processor may be configured with a regression model such as those disclosed herein. By inputting the genetic profile (genetic status of a SNP combination associated with CPSP) and optionally any of the non-genetic factors, the processor may process the information to predict risk of CPSP.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">General Techniques</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0095">The practice of the present disclosure will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.

Spine fusion for scoliosis/kyphosis and endoscopic Nuss procedure for pectus were known to be the most painful corrective surgeries healthy children/adolescents undergo. Further, unlike adults, it was known that children/adolescents have minimal/no pain before surgery and surgery was usually the child's first exposure to severe pain and opioids. A 37-40% incidence of CPSP was observed at 2-3 months and 1 year after spine fusion, which aligned with postsurgical outcomes data from international pediatric spine surgery registries.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2. Assessment of Psychosocial and Perioperative Factors as Predictors of CPSP in a Scoliosis Cohort</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0102">A cohort of 171 children undergoing spinal fusion under standard anesthesia/pain protocols was selected according to the protocol in Example 1. Preoperative data on demographics (sex, age, race, etc.), weight, home medications, and scoliosis curve from X-ray reports, were collected from the cohort. The numerical rating scale (NRS) for self-report of pain intensity in children and adolescents&#x2014;a validated measure of pain in children aged &#x2dc;7 to 17 years&#x2014;was determined in a manner similar to that described in von Baeyer, (2009), <i>European Journal of Pain, </i>13: 1005-1007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Because socioeconomic status can influence pain responses, preoperative data also includes socioeconomic status (SES) data on education level and financial condition of the family. Questionnaires to assess pain catastrophizing (Pain catastrophizing scale/PCS), functional disability (FDI), and anxiety sensitivity (childhood anxiety sensitivity index (CASI)), were administered preoperatively in a manner as described in Crombez et al., (2003) <i>Pain, </i>104(3):639-646, Walker et al, (1991) <i>Journal of Pediatric Psychology </i>16(1):39-58, and Silverman et al., (1991) <i>J Clin Child Psychol </i>20:162-168, respectively, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.

Somatosensory assessments are performed done prior to surgery by the same examiner at each testing site, to minimize observer bias. Participants are comfortably positioned. To familiarize participants with the test, a standardized set of instructions is read, and practice trials demonstrated on the non-testing site of the participants' bodies, preferably without the parent/legal guardians present to eliminate parental influence. Each mechanical procedure is conducted over sets of trials to derive an average mean measure and/or pain (numerical pain rating, NRS). Each device is wiped and cleaned with 70% alcohol after being used on each participant.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0105">All patients received total intravenous anesthesia (propofol and remifentanil) and midazolam in the intraoperative period followed by standardized doses of patient controlled analgesia (morphine or hydromorphone) postoperatively. Pertinent surgical details (duration, number of vertebral levels fused) and anesthetic data (propofol and remifentanil doses) were collected. In the immediate Postoperative, pain scores (every four hours), doses of morphine equivalents administered over on postoperative days (POD) one and two were recorded.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0106">After hospital discharge, at 6-12 months, patients were asked to rate their average pain score (NRS) over the previous week and open-ended questions about the nature and site of pain, use of medications/alternative therapies/physician consults for pain, and functional disability (FDI). Briefly, questions (pain score, anxiety and medication dose/use over 24 hours) are sent at 6 PM every day until no opioid use is reported for 3 consecutive days. These follow up questionnaires are administered through Twilio messaging links via REDCap, electronic diary or phone by a trained research coordinator. Typically, opioid use decreases by about 2-3 weeks. Documentation about opioid use after the texting period was obtained through questionnaires administered at 2-3 months and 4-6 months after surgery. The questionnaires are administered in a standard fashion, without prompting answers, giving subjects time to think. Patients were asked to rate their current pain score (NRS) at rest and with daily activity, maximum pain score over the previous week, nature and site of pain, medications/alternative therapies/physician consults for pain. At least 3 phone call attempts at all provided contact numbers to ensure contact, use of monthly reminders, and incentives to facilitate retention and future follow-up are performed. Rate of prescription refills and electronic medication monitoring are alternative strategies to obtain objective opioid use data when contact with patient post-surgery is lost.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0107">Outcomes evaluated included a a) binary outcome: CPSP which was determined based on a cut-off of pain score&#x3e;3/10 on an 11-point Numerical rating scale (range 0-10) at 6-12 months after surgery. This cut-off was used as NRS pain scores&#x3e;3 (moderate/severe pain) at three months was a known predictor for persistence of pain, associated with functional disability.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0108">Maladaptive coping strategies in children and negative parent responses affect chronic pain conditions in children. Three coping sub-scales from Pain Coping Scale (approach, behavioral distraction, emotion-focused avoidance) and 3 parenting factors (Protection, Minimizing, Encouragement) from Adult Response to Child's Symptoms are considered for association with CPSP. PROMIS domains have shown construct validity and responsiveness to change in children (ages 8-18) with chronic pain; as suc, pain Interference and Depression is also assessed.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0109">Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation for continuous, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables) were calculated for all study variables. Additionally, univariate association between independent variables and outcomes (primary and secondary) were examined using 2-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis, Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficient, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. For each outcome variable, linear (for continuous outcome) or logistic (for binary CPSP outcome) regression models with one primary independent variable of interest at a time were conducted, adjusting for covariates. To compare QST, data are calculated for each individual QST variable or by z transformation as described in Baron et al., (2017) <i>Pain, </i>158(2):261-72, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Z scores of zero represent a value corresponding to the mean of the non-CPSP cohort for that measure; z scores above &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicate a gain of function when the patient was more sensitive to the test stimuli compared with controls, z scores below &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicate loss of function referring to a lower sensitivity of the patient. For each outcome variable, linear regression models with one primary independent variable of interest at a time are conducted, adjusting for covariates. Increase in coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) due the additional primary independent variable of interest were reported. To build a multivariable model for each outcome, factors associated at p&#x3c;0.10 in univariate analysis are subject to testing of multicollinearity (and removed if collinearity exists) and then entered into multivariable regression models. Stepwise selection was used to derive a final model for each outcome where only variables with a p&#x3c;0.05 are retained. R<sup>2 </sup>is reported for the final models. A random effect is included in all regression models to account for the cluster effect of study center. As a secondary analysis, pairwise correlation between continuous and categorical outcomes are examined using either Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficient as appropriate. Cronbach's alpha is used to assess internal consistency of the questionnaires. In general, an alpha of &#x3e;0.7 is acceptable.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0110">Demographics and summary of the variables examined for the prospective cohort are given in Table 4 where the following

Briefly. HCA was used to group patients with similar structure into phenotypes based on 3 factors: 1) pain character (AUC and nature&#x2014;inflammatory or neuropathic based on PainDETECT score (1-12: nociceptive pain, and 19-38: neuropathic pain is likely)); 2) psychophysical characteristics; and 3) opioid use (dose and days of use over weeks after surgery). For cluster characteristics, continuous values of the measures or dichotomize by high tertile and low tertile for discordant phenotypes was used. Before clustering, a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce dimensionality of data. A screen plot was analyzed to detect an &#x201c;elbow&#x201d; that suggested the number of PCs for entering hierarchical clustering. A wide variety of hierarchical clustering techniques were applied to achieve robust and meaningful data segregation, including divisive and agglomerative algorithm, Ward's and other methods for the linkage criterion, Euclidean, Manhattan and correlation-bases distances for similarities. To detect an optimal number of clusters, heatmaps and dendrograms were visually inspected and R software (package NbClust) that identifies optimal number of clusters using multiple indexes was employed. These clusters were evaluated in the context of prior knowledge to identify the most parsimonious clustering. HCA and PCA were performed in R software (package factoextra v1.0.3). Cophenetic correlation, which was the Pearson correlation between actual and predicted distances based on clustering approach as calculated.

Identification of a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Predictive for CPSP Risk</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0123">Genetic factors influence individual differences in pain perception but the effect these factors have on pain perception is small and causal variants are difficult to detect. It is possible that it is not just one genetic factor contributing to the risk of CPSP, but instead the combined effects of a large number of susceptibility loci may become large enough to be useful for targeted risk prediction and prevention. A polygenic risk score (PRS) can be used to model these weak contributions, where an individual's genetic risk is the sum of all their risk alleles weighted by significance of the corresponding allele in genome wide association studies.

Prior to genetic analyses, 121,301 SNPs from the sex chromosome, chromosome zero, mitochondrial, indels and other were excluded from analysis. Quality of SNP calls from the chip were also evaluated. SNPs were assessed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by means of goodness of fit &#x3c7;2 test. SNPs deviating HWE (p&#x3c;0.0001), whose MAF is less than 90%, or whose call rates fall below 95% were excluded. Thresholds for quality control for call rates at individual and SNP levels were 99% and 90%, respectively. Low-frequency variants were also excluded, threshold for minor allele frequencies was 10%. SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (80%) were pruned out in PLINK using the command --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.8. SNPs from autosomal chromosomes only were selected for analysis and were annotated using ANNOVAR software in a manner similar to that described in Wang et al., (2010) <i>Nucleic Acids Research </i>38(16):e164-e164, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. SNPs located in intergenic regions and not associated with a specific gene according to ANNOVAR annotation were also excluded prior to analysis. Prior to genetic analyses, cryptic relatedness was checked using Graphical Representation of Relationship (GRR), in a similar manner as described in Abecasis et al., (2001) <i>Bioinformatics Applications Note </i>2001; 17(8):742-743, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.

In all association tests we used an additive genetic model in which major homozygotes were coded as 0, heterozygotes as 1, and minor homozygotes as 2. Surgical duration, CASI and acute postoperative pain over 48 hours (area under curve of pain scores over time) were used as covariates, based on our previous multiple regression model which did not include genetics.

Pruning was then done based on Linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>=0.5) to remove variants that were highly linked and minimize correlation issues.

SNPs from the control set were selected in the same ratio for MAF as it was observed in the case set. Specifically, we used MAF bands as follows: 10-15%:15-20%:20-30%:30-50%. Empirical p-values of resampling tests were computed as follows: we calculated how many samples out of 10,000 had the number of significant SNPs equal to or greater than the number of significant SNPs from the case set and divided this number by 10,000.

Stat Softw </i>33(1):1-22, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein. A controlling penalty parameter lambda was selected via cross-validation approach. After least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the final set included 9 genes and 24 variants.

Building a Predictive Model and Internal Validation</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0148">The predictive model for CSPS was calculated for the Scoliosis Cohort (described in Examples 1 and 2) based on significant psychophysical predictors (identified in Example 2) and PRS (identified in Example 4) using a bootstrap method. Briefly, bootstrapping was used to build and internally validate the prediction model. At each iteration, a random bootstrap sample the same size as the original sample was drawn with replacement from the original sample. Stepwise selection was used to derive a final model for each outcome where the final model will either include only variables with a p&#x3c;0.05 or be the one minimizing marginal Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and/or Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). Both criteria penalized larger models, although BIC model heavily, therefore balance fit with model size and avoid overfitting. The procedure was repeated for at least 100 times. To assess predictive performance, the models developed in each bootstrap sample were evaluated in both the bootstrap sample (apparent performance) and the original sample (test performance) using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (or the c statistics) and calibration slope for binary outcomes, and mean square error (MSE) and marginal, conditional, and fitted R<sup>2 </sup>for continuous outcomes. Optimism was estimated to equal average (bootstrap performance&#x2212;test performance) as internally validated performance as well as the variance based on cross-validation (VEcv). Specifically, with bootstrapping the model parameters (regression coefficients) and model performance (AUC) were evaluated. At each iteration (n=1000), a random bootstrap sample the same size as the original sample was drawn with replacement from the original sample. Logistic models were generated for each bootstrap sample and bootstrapping results were compared with results from the original model. Bootstrapping was performed in R software with the package boot. Mean OR and AUC for the ROC after bootstrapping and 95% CI are given in Table 10.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">A decision tree was constructed from the top 80 most significant SNPs for CPSP (by chi-square) using C4.5 algorithm (J48 in R package RWeka) and partykit package for visualization.
