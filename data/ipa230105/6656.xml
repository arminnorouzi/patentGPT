More specifically, circuits, devices and related techniques disclosed herein relate to power transistor dV/dt (a relatively fast rate of change of voltage with respect to time) control circuits. In some embodiments, dV/dt control circuits can be utilized to control and optimize a rate of turning off of a power transistor resulting in reduced voltage oscillations in the power conversion circuit. In various embodiments, a turn-off dV/dt control circuit and related technique can reduce excessive ringing that may occur when an external gate driver integrated circuit (IC) is used to drive a gallium nitride (GaN) power switch. This can be beneficial for power converter circuits employing GaN switches because GaN switches may be relatively more sensitive to excessive oscillations and ringing. In some embodiments, improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance can result from the reduced oscillations and ringing in the power conversion circuit. In this way, relatively high operating frequencies can be achieved for power converter circuits that utilize GaN switches.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the disclosure can be employed to control a dV/dt in GaN power switches. A dV/dt event may turn the GaN power transistor back on after the GaN power transistor has been turned off and it is to stay off. This can be due to a coupling of a drain terminal voltage onto the gate terminal through a parasitic miller capacitance that can be present in the GaN power transistor. In some embodiments, a gate voltage of the GaN power transistor can be controlled during turn-off in such a way that can prevent a dV/dt event at the drain terminal of GaN power transistor. In this way, the GaN power transistor can operate in its safe operating area.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of the disclosure can also be employed to control a rate of change of drain current as a function of time (dI/dt) in a GaN power switch. Embodiments of the disclosed circuits and techniques can control a slew rate of the drain current in a GaN power switch. By controlling and reducing the dI/dt, a voltage spike on the various terminals of the GaN power switch can be reduced. In this way, the GaN power switch can operate in its safe operating area (SOA). Various inventive embodiments are described herein, including methods, processes, systems, devices, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Several illustrative embodiments will now be described with respect to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. The ensuing description provides embodiment(s) only and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing one or more embodiments. It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of certain inventive embodiments. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive. The word &#x201c;example&#x201d; or &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or &#x201c;example&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a turn-off control circuit <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, circuit <b>100</b> can include a GaN power transistor <b>126</b>, with a drain terminal <b>122</b>, a gate terminal <b>124</b> and a source terminal <b>112</b>. GaN power transistor <b>126</b> can be used in a low-side configuration, where source terminal <b>112</b> may be connected to a ground node, or in a high-side configuration where source terminal <b>112</b> may be connected to a switch node (Vsw). A voltage at the drain terminal <b>122</b> drain can rise relatively fast when the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is turned off. A relatively fast rate of change of the drain voltage as a function of time (dV/dt) can turn the GaN power transistor back on due to a coupling of the drain voltage onto the gate terminal <b>124</b> through a parasitic miller capacitance of the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. This secondary turn on is typically not desirable because an uncontrolled turn-on of the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> can cause oscillations and ringing within the power conversion circuit and may damage the GaN power transistor. Furthermore, excessive oscillations and ringing may increase electromagnetic interference (EMI) generation of the power conversion circuit. In some embodiments, a turn-off dV/dt control circuit can reduce the high dV/dt rate by sensing a voltage at the drain terminal <b>122</b> and adjusting the gate drive at a gate terminal <b>124</b> based on the sensed drain voltage. Moreover, the turn-off dV/dt control circuit can improve EMI performance, as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, circuit <b>100</b> can also be employed to control a rate of change of drain current as a function of time (dI/dt) in the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. When controlling the dI/dt, circuit <b>100</b> can control the drain current slew rate when the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is turned off. By controlling and lowering the dI/dt, a voltage spike across the GaN power transistor can be reduced during turn-off. In this way, the GaN power transistor can operate in its safe operating area.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Circuit <b>100</b> can include a sensing circuit <b>119</b> that is arranged to sense a voltage at the drain terminal <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, sensing circuit <b>119</b> may include a sensing capacitor <b>102</b>, having a capacitance with a value of C. Circuit <b>100</b> can include a V<sub>dd </sub>terminal <b>106</b>. The sensing circuit <b>119</b> can be connected to the drain terminal <b>122</b>. The sensing circuit <b>119</b> can be connected to a current mirror circuit <b>140</b>. The current mirror circuit <b>140</b> may be connected to a logic circuit <b>116</b>. The current mirror circuit <b>140</b> can include transistors <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. A node <b>148</b> in the current mirror circuit <b>140</b> can be connected to a ground node when the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is used in a low-side configuration, or connected to a switch node (Vsw), or other suitable nodes, when the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is used in a high-side configuration. The logic circuit <b>116</b> can also be connected to a first pull-down transistor <b>114</b> and a second pull-down transistor <b>110</b>. The first pull-down transistor <b>114</b> and the second pull-down transistor <b>110</b> can be connected to the gate terminal <b>124</b> and to the source terminal <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">During a dV/dt event, a current I=C&#xd7;dV/dt can develop through the capacitor <b>102</b>. This current can be fed into the current mirror circuit <b>140</b>. Current I can be mirrored from transistor <b>132</b> into transistor <b>134</b>, and can flow through resistor <b>150</b> from V<sub>dd </sub>terminal <b>106</b>, causing a voltage at node <b>152</b> to go to a low state. The voltage at node <b>152</b> can be fed into a logic circuit <b>116</b> at node <b>130</b>. The logic circuit <b>116</b> can use the signal from node <b>152</b> to drive the gate <b>115</b> of a first pull-down transistor <b>114</b> and gate <b>111</b> of a second pull-down transistor <b>110</b>. The first pull-down transistor <b>114</b> and the second pull-down transistor <b>110</b> can be used to turn off the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. When transistors <b>114</b> and <b>110</b> are turned on, the gate terminal <b>124</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> can go to a low state, thus putting the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> in a non-conductive state. In some embodiments, a size of transistor <b>110</b> can be, for example, 5 to 10 times larger than transistor <b>114</b>, thus transistor <b>110</b> can pull down the gate terminal <b>124</b> at a relatively faster rate than transistor <b>114</b> can. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, the value for the ratio of transistor sizes can be set to any suitable value as appropriate for specific applications.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an initial state, both transistors <b>114</b> and <b>110</b> may be turned on in order to turn off the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> after a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal received by the power converter circuit goes low. When the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is turned off, a voltage at drain terminal <b>122</b> can start to rise.

In some embodiments, where the logic and control circuit <b>840</b> is a stand-alone chip that is connected to the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> through bond wires, it can be beneficial to control a rate of reduction of the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>, because existence of parasitic inductances in the bond wires may cause excessive ringing and oscillations on the voltage at the gate terminal. These excessive rings and oscillations may cause the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> to turn back on when it is to be in an off state. When signal <b>860</b> goes low, it can turn on the transistor <b>852</b> thereby allowing a discharge current to flow from the gate terminal <b>124</b> through the external impedance element <b>820</b> to the ground node <b>814</b>. A value of the impedance element <b>820</b> can determine a value of the discharge current, thus a rate of reduction of the gate voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> can be controlled. Therefore, by providing an external impedance element <b>820</b>, a user can control a rate of reduction of the gate voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>. For example, for an impedance element that includes a resistor, a relatively large value of the resistor may reduce the drain terminal <b>122</b> dV/dt, and a relatively small value of the resistor may increase the drain terminal <b>122</b> dV/dt. Therefore, this technique is user programmable. In some embodiments, a resistive element <b>818</b> can be coupled to the source terminal <b>856</b> such that if a user cannot connect an impedance element <b>820</b> to the pin <b>868</b>, there still can exist a path for the discharge current to flow and turn off the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A presence of parasitic inductances may cause excessive ringing and oscillations of the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> during turn-off of the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. A detection circuit that includes the comparator <b>848</b> and the latch <b>850</b>, and the pull-down transistor <b>802</b> can be arranged to prevent these excessive ringing and oscillations.

When the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> drops to a value below the threshold voltage, comparator <b>848</b> can act and turn on the latch <b>850</b>, thereby turning on the pull-down transistor <b>802</b>. Upon the turn-on of pull-down transistor <b>802</b>, it can pull down the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>, thereby keeping the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> in an off state. The pull-down transistor <b>802</b> may be formed on the same GaN-based die as the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>, thus parasitic inductances can be minimized between the pull-down transistor <b>802</b> and the GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. In this way, ringing and oscillations can be minimized at the terminals of GaN power transistor <b>126</b>. In some embodiments a value of the threshold voltage may be, for example, 0.6 V, while in other embodiments a value of the threshold voltage can be, for example, 0.3 to 0.9 V.

The second current mirror <b>1072</b> can be coupled to the power terminal <b>1006</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Circuit <b>1000</b> can further include a gate driver circuit <b>1050</b> coupled to the gate terminal <b>124</b>. The gate driver circuit can be configured to receive an input signal <b>1010</b> and control a voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> in response to receiving the input signal. In some embodiments, the input signal can be a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal. Collector terminal <b>1040</b> can coupled to the gate terminal <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operation of circuit <b>1000</b> is now described. When the PWM signal is high, the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> is high state, therefore the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> is in a conductive state, and a current may flow from the drain terminal <b>122</b> to the source terminal, or vice-versa. When the PWM signal transitions to low, the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> transitions to a low state and the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> transitions to a low state. The current flowing from the drain terminal <b>122</b> to the source terminal <b>112</b> starts to discharge, however due to the existence of parasitic elements in connecting elements, such as parasitic inductances, a dV/dt event may occur at the drain terminal <b>122</b>, i.e., a voltage spike may be generated at the drain terminal <b>122</b>. This voltage spike may couple onto the gate terminal <b>124</b> through a parasitic capacitance between the drain terminal <b>122</b> and the gate terminal <b>124</b>, and may cause the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> to rise, causing the GaN power transistor <b>126</b> to turn back on. This is not desirable. Embodiments of the present disclosure can prevent a turn-off dV/dt event from turning on a voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">When a dV/dt event occurs at the drain terminal <b>122</b>, the sensing element <b>1020</b> can sense the voltage change and generate a first current that can flow from the collector terminal <b>1026</b>. The first current is mirrored by the first current mirror <b>1070</b> and a second current can be generated that flows into the collector terminal <b>1022</b>. In some embodiments, a magnitude of the first current may be substantially equal to the second current. The second current can be fed into the second current mirror <b>1072</b> and a third current can be generated that flows into the collector terminal <b>1040</b>. The third current can discharge a gate charge at the gate terminal <b>124</b>, thereby lowering a voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b>. Thus, the voltage at the gate terminal <b>124</b> can be prevented from rising and causing an undesired turn-on. It will be understood by one of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the size of the transistors used can be determined based on a specific application. Further, the type of transistors used can be determined based on a specific application. Moreover, the above describes a positive dV/dt event. Embodiments of the disclosure also can operate during a negative dV/dt, where the third current may flow into the gate terminal <b>124</b>, thereby preventing a voltage at the gate terminal to go negative.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although transistor dV/dt control circuits are described and illustrated herein with respect to one particular configuration of GaN power transistor, embodiments of the disclosure are suitable for use with other configurations of GaN-based and non-GaN-based power converter circuits, such as power converters using silicon, silicon-carbide or other semiconductor devices. For example, EMI performance of any power converter using semiconductor transistors can be improved by utilizing embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the disclosure have been described with reference to numerous specific details that can vary from implementation to implementation.
