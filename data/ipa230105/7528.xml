description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to have a more detailed understanding of the features and technical content of the embodiments of the present disclosure, the implementation of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which are provided for illustration only and are not intended to limit the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Before detailed description of embodiments of the present disclosure, artificial intelligence is briefly explained.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Artificial intelligence has become a new way for people to solve and deal with problems. Artificial intelligence based on a neural network has a wide range of applications. The basic structure of a simple neural network model is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, including: the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The input layer is used to receive data, the hidden layer is used to process data, and the output layer is used to generate the calculation results of the neural network model.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With the continuous development of the neural network model research, a neural network deep learning algorithm is proposed. The basic structure of the deep neural network model is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The deep neural network model includes multiple hidden layers. The deep neural network model including multiple hidden layers can greatly improve the data processing ability, and is widely used in pattern recognition, signal processing, optimal combination and anomaly detection.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The application of the neural network model includes two processes of training stage and reasoning stage. In the training stage, a large amount of data first should be obtained as a training set (also called a sample set), the training set is taken as the input data of the neural network model to be trained, and based on a specific training algorithm, through a large number of training and parameter iteration, the parameters to be determined of the neural network model to be trained are determined, thus completing the training process of the neural network model and obtaining a trained neural network model. For example, a neural network model for recognizing a puppy can be trained through a large number of images, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. For a neural network, after the neural network model has been trained, the trained neural network model can be used for reasoning or verification operations such as recognition, classification and information recovery. This process is called the reasoning process of the neural network model. For example, the puppy in the image can be recognized by a trained neural network model, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A manner of training the neural network model is &#x201c;federated learning&#x201d;, which is characterized in that during the training process of neural network model, the training sets are distributed on each sub-node device. The training process of the neural network model based on the federated learning is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which includes three steps. Firstly, after each sub-node generates a local neural network model, the local neural network model is uploaded to the main node device. Secondly, the main node device can synthesize the current global neural network model according to all the obtained local neural network models, and transmit the global neural network model to each sub-node device. Finally, the sub-node device continues to use the new global neural network model for the next training iteration. Then, the training of neural network model is completed under the cooperation of main node device and multiple sub-node devices.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the communication system, the terminal device can be regarded as the sub-node device, and the sub-node device transmits specific data to the network device for the network device to achieve the goals of model training, federation learning, system optimization and so on. The specific data may be minimization of drive-test (MDT) measurement data, intermediate data in a federated learning process, sample data in a machine learning process, and data corresponding to a specific Quality of Service (QoS). By automatically collecting and analyzing the measurement reports of the terminal device containing position information, the MDT technology minimizes the workload of manual drive-test and other work. The terminal device transmits the acquired measurement information to the network device, and the network device comprehensively optimizes the network configuration information by using the data from different terminal device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Services transmitted in the network through data, which is transmitted from multiple terminal devices to the network device, generally has the following characteristics: large amount of data, low time sensitivity, and low user sensitivity, etc. However, when the data having the above characteristics is transmitted by the network device, it is not distinguished from the data transmitting common services such as voice, video and multimedia. In this way, it may lead to potential risks in data transmission, for example, when the current network load is relatively heavy and the resources are insufficient, and a large number of terminal devices transmit data for data collection services to the network device, voice services, video services and multimedia services, which require higher real-time performance of communication systems, will be seriously affected.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The technical solution of the embodiment of the disclosure can be applied to various communication systems. For example, global system of mobile communication (GSM) system, code division multiple access (CDMA) system, wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, general packet radio service (GPRS), long term evolution (LTE) system, LTE frequency division duplex (FDD) system, LTE time division duplex (TDD) system, advanced long term evolution (LTE-A) system, new radio (NR) system, evolution system of NR system, LTE-based access to unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) system, NR-based access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) system, universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) communication system, wireless local area network (WLAN), wireless fidelity (WiFi), next generation communication system or other communication systems.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system architecture and the business scenario described in the embodiment of the disclosure are intended to more clearly illustrate the technical solution of the embodiment of the disclosure and do not constitute a limitation to the technical solution provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure.

Communication between a network device and a terminal device, as well as between a terminal device and a terminal device, can be carried out through frequency spectrum below 7 Gigahertz (GHz), or above 7 GHz, and can also be carried out by using frequency spectrum below 7 GHz and above 7 GHz simultaneously. Embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the spectrum resources used between the network device and the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally speaking, conventional communication systems support a limited number of connections and are easy to implement. However, with the development of communication technology, mobile communication systems will not only support conventional communication, but also support, for example, device to device (D2D) communication, machine to machine (M2M) communication, machine type communication (MTC), vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, etc. Embodiments of the present disclosure can also be applied to these communication systems.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Exemplary, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the communication system <b>100</b> to which the present disclosure embodiment is applied.

The first indication information may be transmitted via broadcast, such as via a master information block (MIB), a system information block (SIB). The first indication information may be transmitted via radio resource control (RRC) signaling, such as an RRC reconfiguration message. The first indication information may also be transmitted by downlink control information (DCI), media access control-control element (MAC CE), physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) signaling, etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In response to that the first indication information is used to determine that the terminal device is valid, the terminal device determines to transmit the first data; or in response to that the first indication information is used to determine that the terminal device is invalid, the terminal device determines not to transmit the first data.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the first indication information for determining whether the terminal device is valid may include at least the following two manners.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a first manner, the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid. The first condition includes a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid. The terminal device is valid when a reference value generated by the terminal device between a first value and a second value satisfies a first relationship with the probability threshold. The terminal device is invalid when a reference value generated by the terminal device between a first value and a second value does not satisfy a first relationship with the probability threshold. The first relationship includes any one of the following: the reference value is greater than the probability threshold; the reference value is greater than or equal to the probability threshold; the reference value is less than the probability threshold; and the reference value is less than or equal to the probability threshold. For example, the first indication information includes a probability threshold X, the terminal device generates a reference value between a and b, for example a random number. The terminal device compares the generated reference value with the probability threshold X, and the terminal device is valid when the relationship between the reference value and X satisfies the first condition. The values of a and b may be pre-agreed, or configured by network device.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the specific implementation, the network device may adjust the threshold X according to its own load state. For example, if the load of the network device is larger, and the first condition is that the reference value is greater than the probability threshold, the terminal device is valid, the network device can set the threshold value X to a larger value. In this way, the number of terminal devices reporting data to the network device can be reduced, and more network resources can be applied to ordinary data service transmission. If the load of the network device is smaller, and the first condition is that the reference value is greater than the probability threshold, the terminal device is valid, the network device can set the threshold value X to a smaller value. In this way, the number of terminal devices reporting data to the network device can be increased, and idle network resources are effectively used to complete data collection services.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a second manner, bit information included in the first indication information is used to indicate whether the terminal device is valid. Alternatively, the terminal device is valid when the bit information is a third value; the terminal device is invalid when the bit information is a fourth value. For example, the first indication information includes N bits. When the value of the N bits is 1, it indicates that the terminal device is valid, and when the value of the N bits is 0, it indicates that the terminal device is invalid, N being an integer greater than 0.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first indication information has been described in terms of a transmission mode of the first indication information, a form of the first indication information and the like. In the specific implementation, the first indication information may also be time-sensitive, i.e., when the content indicated by the first indication information becomes valid and when the content becomes invalid after the terminal device has received the first indication information.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the timeliness of the first indication information may include at least the following three manners.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the first manner, the first indication information is valid before the first indication information is updated, or a validity of the terminal device determined according to the first indication information is valid before the first indication information is updated. That is, when the terminal device has received the first indication information, the terminal device may determine whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information. Until the terminal device has received the first indication information again, and then the terminal device re-determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information received again. At this time, the first indication information received by the terminal device again becomes valid and the previous first indication information becomes invalid. For example, when the terminal device has received the first indication information and determines that the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information, the terminal device can transmit the first data. After time T, the terminal device has received the first indication information again, and determines that the terminal device is invalid according to the first indication information, the terminal device cannot transmit the first data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the second manner, the first indication information is valid in response to that the second condition is satisfied; or a validity of the terminal device determined according to the first indication information is valid in response to that the second condition is satisfied. Alternatively, the second condition includes at least one of the following: within a first duration after the terminal device has received the first indication information; after the terminal device has received the first indication information, a number of times that the terminal device transmits the first data is less than or equal to a times threshold; or after the terminal device has received the first indication information, a size of the first data transmitted by the terminal device is less than or equal to a data volume threshold. Alternatively, the second condition includes at least one of the following: within a first duration after the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information; after the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information, a number of times that the terminal device transmits the first data is less than or equal to a times threshold; or after the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information, a size of the first data transmitted by the terminal device is less than or equal to a data volume threshold.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">After the failure of the second condition, the terminal device needs to re-determine whether the terminal device is valid. The following is an explanation for re-determining whether the terminal device is valid according to different situations.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, if the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid, and the first condition may be a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid, the terminal device may continue to use the first condition included in the first indication information to determine whether the terminal device is valid after the second condition fails. For example, if the second condition is satisfied, the first indication information includes a probability threshold X, the terminal device generates a reference value between a and b, for example a random number, the terminal device compares the generated reference value with the probability threshold X, the terminal device is valid when the reference value is greater than X, and the terminal device is invalid when the reference value is less than or equal to X. After the second condition fails, that is, the terminal device no longer satisfies the second condition, the terminal device regenerates a reference value between a and b, the terminal device compares the generated reference value with the probability threshold X, the terminal device is valid when the reference value is greater than X, and the terminal device is invalid when the reference value is less than or equal to X.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other embodiments, if the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid, and the first condition may be a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid, the terminal device sends the data request to the network device again after the second condition fails, the network device sends the first indication information again according to the data request sent by the terminal device, and the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information sent again by the network device. A first condition for the terminal device to be valid included in the first indication information sent again by the network device may be different from the first condition for the terminal device to be valid included in the first indication information sent last time. For example, the first indication information sent by the network device last time includes the probability threshold X, and the first indication information sent again by the network device includes the probability threshold Y. For example, if the second condition is satisfied, the first indication information includes a probability threshold X, the terminal device generates a reference value between a and b, for example a random number, the terminal device compares the generated reference value with the probability threshold X, the terminal device is valid when the reference value is greater than X, and the terminal device is invalid when the reference value is less than or equal to X. After the second condition fails, the terminal device generates a reference value between c and d, the terminal device compares the generated reference value with the probability threshold Y, the terminal device is valid when the reference value is greater than Y, and the terminal device is invalid when the reference value is less than or equal to Y.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other embodiments, if bit information included in the first indication information is used to indicate whether the terminal device is valid, the terminal device sends the data request to the network device again after the second condition fails, the network device sends a first indication information again according to the data request sent by the terminal device to indicate whether the terminal device is valid, and the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information sent again by the network device. The first indication information sent again by the network device may be different from the first indication information sent last time. For example, the first indication information sent last time by the network device indicates that the terminal device is valid, and the first indication information sent again by the network device indicates that the terminal device is invalid.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second condition is pre-agreed, or the second condition is configured by a network device. Where the second condition is configured by a network device, the second condition may be configured by a broadcast message, such as MIB, or SIB. The second condition may also be configured by dedicated signaling, such as RRC signaling, and RRC reconfiguration messages. The second condition can also be configured by DCI, MAC CE, PDCCH signaling and the like.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, if the terminal device has received the first indication information and determines that the terminal device is valid according to bit information included in the first indication information, the terminal device is valid within a first duration after the terminal device determines whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information. After the terminal device determines that the terminal device is valid based on the first indication information, if the first duration elapses, the terminal device needs to re-determine whether the terminal device is valid, for example, re-use the first indication information to determine whether the terminal device is valid, or request a new first indication information to determine whether the terminal device is valid. In the specific implementation, if the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid, the first condition may be a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid. After the terminal device transmits data for more than a first duration, the terminal device can re-use the probability threshold value for determining whether the terminal device is valid in the first duration to determine whether the terminal device is valid. The terminal device may also re-send a data request to the network device, and determine whether the terminal device is valid by using the probability threshold value re-sent by the network device.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For another example, the terminal device has received the first indication information, the terminal device determines that the terminal device is valid according to the bit information included in the first indication information, and the terminal device starts transmitting the first data. If a size of the first data transmitted by the terminal device is greater than or equal to the data volume threshold, the validity of the terminal device fails, and the terminal device needs to re-determine the validity of the terminal device. Or, if the number of times that the terminal device transmits the first data is greater than or equal to a times threshold, the validity of the terminal device fails. In the specific implementation, if the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid, the first condition may be a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid. After the first data transmitted exceeds the data volume threshold or the times threshold, the terminal device may re-use the probability threshold of the last use to determine whether the terminal device is valid. The terminal device may also re-send the data request to the network device, and determine whether the terminal device is valid using the probability threshold re-sent by the network device.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the second manner, if the number of terminal devices is multiple, the validity of the multiple terminal devices is semi-statically updated, giving each terminal device more opportunity to be configured as a valid terminal device.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a third manner, the first indication information is valid only for one transmission of the first data, or a validity of the terminal device determined according to the first indication information is valid only for one transmission of the first data. For example, the terminal device requests the network device to transmit the first data each time, the network device may respond to the request through the DCI, and the DCI carries the first indication information to indicate whether to allow the transmission of the first data. If the network device indicates that the transmission of the first data is allowed, the terminal device transmits the first data. After the terminal device has transmitted the first data, the first indication information fails. When the first data needs to be transmitted again, the terminal device needs to request the network device to transmit the first data again, and determine whether to transmit the first data according to the first indication information sent by the network device. That is, before each transmission of the first data, the terminal device needs to request the network device to obtain the first indication information, and determine whether the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information, that is, to determine whether the terminal device can transmit the first data.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For another example, if the first indication information includes a first condition for the terminal device to be valid, the first condition may be a probability threshold indicating that the terminal device is valid. Before each transmission of the first data, the terminal device needs to determine whether the terminal device is valid. The terminal device may determine whether the terminal device is valid according to the probability threshold of last use before transmitting the first data each time. The terminal device may also re-send a data request to the network device before each transmission of the first data, and determine whether the terminal device is valid by using a probability threshold of re-sending by the network device.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the third manner, the validity of the terminal device is dynamically updated. In the specific scenarios, such as a federated learning scenario, a training set data scenario or an MDT scenario, it can maximize the guarantee that the data comes from more samples and ensure the integrity of data information.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">At operation S202, the terminal device determines whether to transmit first data according to the first indication information.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, in response to that the terminal device determines that the terminal device is valid according to the first indication information, the terminal device determines to transmit the first data; or in response to that the terminal device determines that the terminal device is invalid according to the first indication information, the terminal device determines not to transmit the first data.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device may be a common terminal device, that is, an arbitrary terminal device.
