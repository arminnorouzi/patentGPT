ILD is associated with ageing, smoking, environmental exposures, such as burn pit exposures in combat zones and in response to infections caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus 2 (CoV2). Currently, the most common form of ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), although this may be changing due to the high numbers of patients with severe CoV2 respiratory infections. In the past, conventional medications for IPF included glucocorticosteroids (i.e., prednisone), antioxidants or immunosuppressants. However, combinations of these therapies resulted in increased mortality.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In 2014, oral nintedanib was a breakthrough therapy approved by the FDA. Nintedanib is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases that reduces fibroblast proliferation and activation. Nintedanib has been subjected to clinical testing by randomized controlled trials, where efficacy was shown in slowing the decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) in IPF and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pirfenidone was also licensed in 2014 by the FDA. Pirfenidone is a small molecule with antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that inhibits TGF&#x3b2;-stimulated collagen production. Several prospective studies have found that pirfenidone also slows the loss of FVC in IPF and improves progression-free survival.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although these medications represent a substantial advance, they neither reverse established fibrosis nor are curative. What is needed are novel methods and combinations for treatment of pulmonary diseases related to fibrosis and viral infection including COVID-19.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect, a self-assembled therapeutic dendron-micelle comprises a first amphiphilic dendron-coil, and a second amphiphilic dendron-coil; and an encapsulated BRD4 inhibitor; wherein the first amphiphilic dendron-coil comprises a first non-peptidyl, hydrophobic core-forming component covalently linked to a first polyester dendron which is covalently linked to first a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moiety, wherein the first PEG moiety comprises a first conjugated therapeutic peptide; and wherein the second amphiphilic dendron-coil comprises a second non-peptidyl, hydrophobic core-forming component covalently linked to a second polyester dendron which is covalently linked to a third poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moiety, wherein the second PEG moiety does not comprise a conjugated peptide.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition comprises the self-assembled therapeutic dendron-micelle described above.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also included are methods of treating pulmonary fibrosis, comprising administering by inhalation a therapeutically effective amount of the self-assembled therapeutic dendron-micelle described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b></figref>.

The DM platform allows a mix-and-match approach where multiple functional/therapeutic agents can be easily integrated. Specifically, the DMs deliver a therapeutic peptide (e.g., a peptide which binds a cell-expressed immune checkpoint receptor such as a PD-L1-binding peptide, a fibronectin-binding peptide, a PDGFRb peptide, or a combination thereof) and a BRD4 inhibitor (BRD4i). The DMs provide an inhalable delivery solution for various pulmonary diseases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As established herein, BRD4 is a major factor in the initiation and maintenance of myofibroblast phenotype; BRD4i administered in a therapeutic dosing regimen partially reverses bleomycin-induced pulmonary collagen deposition (to be improved by enhanced delivery using PDCs and their self-assembly into DMs); selectivity of aPD-L1 and aEGFR-conjugates are enhanced in vitro and in vivo; and, PD-L1 and/or FN1 binding peptides have significantly enhanced binding kinetics through multivalent binding effect.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Applying these results, an aerosolized cell-targeted nanoparticle to deliver BRD4i to a pathological myofibroblast populations, identified by selective receptors to reverse pulmonary fibrosis in ILDs is described. These receptors include PD-L1/CD274, Fibronectin, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR&#x3b2;). PD-L1+myofibroblasts are markers of cell types responsible for ECM production and obliteration of alveolar spaces in IPF. Fibronectin is associated with the fibroblastic foci, collections of pathological fibroblasts in IPF. Similarly, PDGF4b is also expressed by profibrotic pericyttes in IPF. We hypothesize that BRD4i encapsulated in multivalent DMs will selectively target and reduce the population of pathogenic myofibroblasts, ameliorating fibrosis and improving outcomes. We further hypothesize that DMs will maximizing delivery of therapeutic drug concentrations to areas of disease, enhance therapeutic effect over that seen using systemic delivery and minimizing undesirable systemic effects.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, described herein is the facile integration of the multiple agents through DMs that can be modularly multifunctionalized via a mix-and-match approach. The proposed DM system will be prepared through self-assembly of PEGylated dendron copolymers (e.g., PEG-polyester dendron poly-e-caprolactone, or PDCs). The PEGylated dendron copolymers are conjugated with therapeutic peptides such as: i) PD-1 mimicking peptides (pPD-1) and/or ii) a fibronectin binding peptide, along with a BRD4i encapsulated in the hydrophobic core.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">First, the pre-organized conical structure imposed by a dendron enables self-assembly with an excellent thermodynamic stability, due to the minimal (pre-paid) entropy cost. Second, the hyperbranched structure of dendrons facilitates the multivalent binding effect that dramatically improves binding kinetics of targeting ligands (e.g., peptides to the level of (or higher than) the binding strength of corresponding antibodies). Third, the high-density poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) outer layer provides maximal stealth effect for longer plasma circulation as well as modular control over PEG configuration effects on cell interactions. Lastly, the biodegradable, biocompatible polymer components (the core-forming poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) and polyester dendron) allow the controlled release of the drug molecules encapsulated in the core of DMs and mitigate the toxicity concerns. These characteristics of DMs will directly affect the functionality of the molecules integrated within the micelles. The thermodynamic stability will improve the structural integrity of DMs during circulation upon injection.

BRD4 belongs to the BD and extraterminal (BET) family consisting of four members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT). Similar to other subfamilies of BD-containing proteins, BET members function in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through binding to the KAc recognition pocket on histone tails and nonhistone proteins. Lysine acetylation (KAc) is one of the most broadly studied post-translational modifications occurring on histone proteins. This highly dynamic process is regulated by opposing actions of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone acetylation also provides binding sites for proteins, especially BD-containing proteins, to promote chromatin reorganization and transcription.

As a result, BRD4 protein accumulation can overcome the effect of competitive BRD4 inhibitors. In addition, using the traditional BRD4 inhibitor approach, high systemic exposure is needed to ensure sufficient in vivo inhibition of BRD4, leading to off-target side effects. To address this potential problem, the drug may include a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), which is a heterobifunctional small molecule including two covalently linked protein-binding molecules having the formula: BRD4 inhibitor-linker-ubiquitin ligase cereblon ligand, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The &#x201c;right side&#x201d; of the drug interacts with an E3 ubiquitin ligase and the &#x201c;left side&#x201d; binds to a target protein meant for degradation. PROTACs achieve degradation through &#x201c;hijacking&#x201d; the cell's Ubiquitin&#x2014;Proteosome system (UPS). Not wishing to be bound by theory, recruitment of the E3 ligase to the target protein results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0061">Lu et al. (&#x201c;Hijacking the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Celebron to Efficiently Target BRD4,&#x201d; Chemistry &#x26; Biology, 22, p. 755-763) reported a BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera using the PROTAC approach by recruiting BRD4 to the E3 ligase cereblon. The structures of the reported degraders incorporated known BRD4 inhibitors such as JQ-1 and an E3 ligase cereblon moiety (i.e., pomalidomide) linked by a polyether linker. The resulting PROTAC molecule (ARV-825) resulted in more significant and longer lasting c-MYC suppression and apoptotic induction than the BRD4 inhibitor alone. Similarly, JQ-1 has been used as the BRD4 inhibitor moiety in another BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera with a different linker (dBET1) as described in US 20160243247A1. JQ1 is the first ligand identified for BRD4 protein and CRBN ligands have relatively good drug like properties. Generally, one needs to screen different types of linkers for the development of PROTACs. Although the effectiveness of BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimeras has been demonstrated in various cell-free assays in vitro , a limitation of the PROTAC approach is that the molecular weight is higher than that of discrete ligands/inhibitors, thus limiting passive diffusion so that the degrader can reach the biological target inside of the cell. Typically, the molecular weight of a compound should range from 200 to 600 grams per mole so that the inhibitor can undergo passive diffusion through the membrane. The strategy encapsulating PROTAC conjugates into cell targeting DMs enable carrier-mediated cellular entry to circumnavigate this limitation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0062">Advantageously, a BRD4 ligand and/or a BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera encapsulated in multivalent DMs may selectively target and reduce the population of pathogenic myofibroblasts, ameliorating fibrosis and improving outcomes. As discussed above, the drug (i.e., a BRD4 ligand or a BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera) is encapsulated within an amphiphilic dendron-coil. Each of the three amphiphilic dendron-coils have a non-peptidyl, hydrophobic core-forming component. The ability of BRD4 ligands and/or BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimeras to reside in the hydrophobic cores of the amphiphilic dendron-coils was a surprising and unexpected result because the structural components that are generally accepted as improving the drug-likeness of a ligand are likely to adversely affect the ability of the ligand to reside in the hydrophobic cores of the amphiphilic dendron-coils. In particular, ligands are generally designed for potency at the biological target and structurally optimized for drug-likeness so that the ligand is orally bioavailable. A druglike ligand desirably has both aqueous and lipid solubility so that it is soluble in the blood and can penetrate the lipid-based cell membrane to reach the inside of the cell. The incorporation of functional groups into the structure that are capable of hydrogen-bonding improve aqueous solubility, however, such groups are polar, rather than hydrophobic, and may adversely affect the ability of a ligand to reside in the hydrophobic cores of the amphiphilic dendron-coils.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0063">The drug may include a BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera having the formula BRD4 ligand-linker-ubiquitin ligase cereblon ligand.

The DMs described herein are an aerosolized cell-targeted nanoparticle to reverse the loss of pulmonary function in the various forms of ILD. In the specific case of IPF, IPF is a chronically progressive, lethal disease that affects over 120,000 US citizens. This diagnosis results in the death of over 48,000 Americans from progressive respiratory failure, typically within 3-5 years after diagnosis. Although infectious causes have not been typically associated with ILD, compelling evidence is now emerging that COVID-19 acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) is associated with ILD. COVID-19 infection results in ARDS in patients who are aged, smoke, hypertensive or who are obese. In COVID-19 ARDS, circulating components of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, including hyaluronans, type III procollagen (COL) and laminin are associated with increased with disease severity. In survivors, radiographic evidence of pulmonary scarring and functional defects in lung function (diffusion capacity) are commonly seen. in fatal cases, increases in transforming growth factor (TGF)-ECM networks, including upregulated TGFBR2, COL isoforms and fibronectin (FN1)(12) are seen, and pulmonary fibrosis is found on autopsy Although the long-term outcomes of lung scarring/fibrosis in survivors of COVID-19 ARDS is not known due to the short -term follow-up, post-infectious pulmonary fibrosis has been reported in survivors from severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS, (28)].

The BD is a high-affinity binding pocket for BRD4 binding to acetylated Lys residues on histones and transcription factors critical for histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Small molecule BRD4 inhibitors that interact with the BRD4 BD inhibit BRD4 function by displacing BRD4 from genome binding sites, disrupting coactivator binding, and inhibiting its atypical HAT activity. A major limitation of pharmacological approaches to modifying BRD4 is that available inhibitors have poor selectivity for BRD isoforms. A third generation BRD4 inhibitor (BRD4i) with high selectivity for the BRD4 BD1 domain has been identified. This compound, ZL0591, binds with approximately 100 nM affinity to BRD4 BD1, but has 10X lower affinity for the BRD4 BD2 domain, and similarly has low affinity for BRD3.

Also of relevance, we know that persistent coronavirus replication in STAT1- produces airway inflammation and remodeling characteristic of severe COVID-19. Here, we will evaluate the effect of human coronavirus (HCoV) strain NL63 (Amsterdam 1, BRC) infection. HCoV-NL63 stably circulates in the human population and is a cause of severe pulmonary infections and neurologic disease typical of SARS CoV2 infections. Like SARS CoV 2, the etiological agent of COVID, HCoV-NL63 binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme ACE)-2 receptor and replicates in human airway epithelium. Importantly, HCoV-NL63 can be studied in BSL2 containment in permissive K18-hACE2-expressing transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratory).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0144">In preliminary experiments, we will establish conditions for producing active HCoV-NL63 replication using K18-hACE2 in C<sub>57</sub>BL/6 background, using intranasal inoculation of infectious virus.

Based on our preliminary demonstration of the effect of systemic ZL0591, we expect that airway delivery and sustained local release will have enhanced therapeutic effect. Similarly, based on our extensive experience with rodent models of paramyxovirus infection, we anticipate that the HCoV-NL63 infection model will enhance myofibroblast formation and expression of remodeling factors. A test of our hypothesis will be that these early features of remodeling will be reduced.
