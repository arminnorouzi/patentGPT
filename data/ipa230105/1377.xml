This need has been realized since ancient times where civilizations would emerge and settle near sources of clean water. With the growth of industrial, materials, and agrochemical production, the contamination of aquatic sources is becoming more prevalent worldwide. Many contaminants have been reported in water, including pesticides, heavy metal ions, biological species, pharmaceutical residues, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In particular, PFAS (formerly known as perfluorochemicals) have emerged as an increasingly common contaminant in drinking water that are very difficult to remove and persist in the environment due to their unique structures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PFAS are synthetic compounds with multiple C&#x2014;F bonds that are used in industrial processes for the preparation of fire-resistant foams, protective coatings, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) products. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two eight-carbon PFAS that are widely found in water supplies. Both PFOS and PFOA are employed for a wide range of applications, including aqueous film-forming foams for firefighting, nonstick cookware, and water-resistant coatings for carpets, leather, and furniture. Due to the long human body accumulation times for PFOS (5.4 years) and PFOA (3.8 years), both chemicals have been linked to obesity, cancer, hormone disruption, and high cholesterol levels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PFOS and PFOA may be introduced into the environment from the waste streams of industrial, military, or urban regions. The current state-of-the-art techniques for PFAS removal are adsorption on granular and powdered activated carbon, ion exchange resins, membrane filtration, and reverse osmosis. Of these approaches, adsorption on highly porous-activated carbon is the most commonly used method today; however, this approach is both nonselective for PFAS with known limitations in removing shorter chain PFAS and expensive to implement, which limits its application for large-scale filtration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there remains a need in the art for a technology that provides sequestering of PFAS, such as PFOS and PFOA to name a few, present in a liquid (e.g., water) source.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more embodiments of the invention address one or more of the aforementioned problems.

The &#x3b3;-AlOOH substrate was chosen due to its high specific surface area as well as its surface characteristics upon contact with water. That is, in aqueous solutions, the aluminol group on &#x3b3;-AlOOH leads to the formation of (Al(OH))<sup>2+</sup>. As a result, &#x3b3;-AlOOH carries a high level of positive charge and is commonly used to sequester negatively charged microbes from water.

One set of functionalization conditions (95% EtOH, cat.

As perfluorinated compounds are often soluble in fluorinated solvents, we tested trifluoroethanol, trifluorotoluene (TFT), and NOVEC&#xae; 7700 for filter conjugation and found that using TFT as the solvent yielded filters with the highest removal of PFOA and PFOS. Functionalization using NOVEC&#xae; 7700 yielded filters with the second best removal.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">A silane concentration screen of the F17-functionalized filters was tested under dynamic filtration conditions at silane concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1%, and the results are shown in Table 1 below.
