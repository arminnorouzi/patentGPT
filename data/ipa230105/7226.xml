The eyewear device <b>100</b> is also referred to simply as eyewear throughout this specification. As shown, the touchpad <b>181</b> may have a boundary that is subtle and not easily seen; alternatively, the boundary may be plainly visible or include a raised or otherwise tactile edge that provides feedback to the user about the location and boundary of the touchpad <b>181</b>. In other implementations, the eyewear device <b>100</b> may include a touchpad on the left side.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The surface of the touchpad <b>181</b> is configured to detect finger touches, taps, and gestures (e.g., moving touches) for use with a GUI displayed by the eyewear device, on an image display, to allow the user to navigate through and select menu options in an intuitive manner, which enhances and simplifies the user experience.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Detection of finger inputs on the touchpad <b>181</b> can enable several functions. For example, touching anywhere on the touchpad <b>181</b> may cause the GUI to display or highlight an item on the image display, which may be projected onto at least one of the optical assemblies <b>180</b>A, <b>180</b>B. Double tapping on the touchpad <b>181</b> may select an item or icon. Sliding or swiping a finger in a particular direction (e.g., from front to back, back to front, up to down, or down to) may cause the items or icons to slide or scroll in a particular direction; for example, to move to a next item, icon, video, image, page, or slide. Sliding the finger in another direction may slide or scroll in the opposite direction; for example, to move to a previous item, icon, video, image, page, or slide. The touchpad <b>181</b> can be virtually anywhere on the eyewear device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one example, an identified finger gesture of a single tap on the touchpad <b>181</b>, initiates selection or pressing of a graphical user interface element in the image presented on the image display of the optical assembly <b>180</b>A, <b>180</b>B. An adjustment to the image presented on the image display of the optical assembly <b>180</b>A, <b>180</b>B based on the identified finger gesture can be a primary action which selects or submits the graphical user interface element on the image display of the optical assembly <b>180</b>A, <b>180</b>B for further display or execution.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown, the eyewear device <b>100</b> includes a right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B. As further described herein, two cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B capture image information for a scene from two separate viewpoints. The two captured images may be used to project a three-dimensional display onto an image display for viewing with 3D glasses.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The eyewear device <b>100</b> includes a right optical assembly <b>180</b>B with an image display to present images, such as depth images. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> includes the right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B. The eyewear device <b>100</b> can include multiple visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B that form a passive type of three-dimensional camera, such as stereo camera, of which the right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B is located on a right corner <b>110</b>B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-D</figref>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> also includes a left visible-light camera <b>114</b>A.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Left and right visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B are sensitive to the visible-light range wavelength. Each of the visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B have a different frontward facing field of view which are overlapping to enable generation of three-dimensional depth images, for example, right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B depicts a right field of view <b>111</b>B. Generally, a &#x201c;field of view&#x201d; is the part of the scene that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space. The fields of view <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have an overlapping field of view <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Objects or object features outside the field of view <b>111</b>A, <b>111</b>B when the visible-light camera captures the image are not recorded in a raw image (e.g., photograph or picture). The field of view describes an angle range or extent, which the sensor system of the visible-light camera <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B picks up electromagnetic radiation of a given scene in a captured image of the given scene. Field of view can be expressed as the angular size of the view cone; i.e., an angle of view. The angle of view can be measured horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an example, visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B have a field of view (FoV) with an angle of view between 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, for example 24&#xb0;, and have a resolution of 480&#xd7;480 pixels. In another example, a larger FoV is obtained using a wide angle camera having a FoV of 100&#xb0;. The &#x201c;angle of coverage&#x201d; describes the angle range that a lens of visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B or infrared camera <b>410</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) can effectively image. Typically, the camera lens produces an image circle that is large enough to cover the film or sensor of the camera completely, possibly including some vignetting (e.g., a darkening of the image toward the edges when compared to the center). If the angle of coverage of the camera lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Examples of such visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B include a high-resolution complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and a digital VGA camera (video graphics array) capable of resolutions of 640p (e.g., 640&#xd7;480 pixels for a total of 0.3 megapixels), 720p, or 1080p. Other examples of visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B that can capture high-definition (HD) still images and store them at a resolution of 1642 by 1642 pixels (or greater); or record high-definition video at a high frame rate (e.g., thirty to sixty frames per second or more) and store the recording at a resolution of 1216 by 1216 pixels (or greater).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The eyewear device <b>100</b> may capture image sensor data from the visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B along with geolocation data, digitized by an image processor, for storage in a memory. The visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B capture respective left and right raw images in the two-dimensional space domain that comprise a matrix of pixels on a two-dimensional coordinate system that includes an X-axis for horizontal position and a Y-axis for vertical position. Each pixel includes a color attribute value (e.g., a red pixel light value, a green pixel light value, or a blue pixel light value); and a position attribute (e.g., an X-axis coordinate and a Y-axis coordinate).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to capture stereo images for later display as a three-dimensional projection, the image processor <b>412</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) may be coupled to the visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B to receive and store the visual image information. The image processor <b>412</b>, or another processor, controls operation of the visible-light cameras <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B to act as a stereo camera simulating human binocular vision and may add a timestamp to each image. The timestamp on each pair of images allows display of the images together as part of a three-dimensional projection. Three-dimensional projections produce an immersive, life-like experience that is desirable in a variety of contexts, including virtual reality (VR) and video gaming.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a perspective, cross-sectional view of a right corner <b>110</b>B of the eyewear device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicting the right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B of the camera system, and a circuit board. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a side view (left) of an example hardware configuration of an eyewear device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, which shows a left visible-light camera <b>114</b>A of the camera system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a perspective, cross-sectional view of a left corner <b>110</b>A of the eyewear device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicting the left visible-light camera <b>114</b>A of the three-dimensional camera, and a circuit board.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Construction and placement of the left visible-light camera <b>114</b>A is substantially similar to the right visible-light camera <b>114</b>B, except the connections and coupling are on the left lateral side <b>170</b>A.

In this regard, the second surface of the prism of the optical layers <b>176</b>A-N can be convex to direct the light toward the center of the eye. The prism can optionally be sized and shaped to magnify the image projected by the display matrix <b>177</b>, and the light travels through the prism so that the image viewed from the second surface is larger in one or more dimensions than the image emitted from the display matrix <b>177</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, the optical layers <b>176</b>A-N may include an LCD layer that is transparent (keeping the lens open) unless and until a voltage is applied which makes the layer opaque (closing or blocking the lens).

The processor <b>432</b> may continuously receive input images from the visible light camera(s) <b>114</b> and store those images in memory <b>434</b> for processing. Additionally, the eyewear device <b>100</b> may capture information from other sensors (e.g., location information from a GPS unit <b>473</b>, orientation information from an IMU <b>472</b>, or distance information from a laser distance sensor).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">At block <b>704</b>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> compares objects in the captured images to objects stored in a library of images to identify a match.

Other sensor data, such as GPS data, may be used to narrow down the number of known objects for use in the comparison (e.g., only images associated with a room identified through GPS coordinates).

Distances between the points of the captured images greater than the points of the identified objects indicates the eyewear device <b>100</b> is closer to the identified object than the imager that captured the image including the identified object. On the other hand, distances between the points of the captured images less than the points of the identified objects indicates the eyewear device <b>100</b> is further from the identified object than the imager that captured the image including the identified object. By processing the relative distances, the processor <b>432</b> is able to determine the position within respect to the objects(s).

In one example, where the identified object (block <b>704</b>) has a predefined coordinate system (x, y, z), the processor <b>432</b> of the eyewear device <b>100</b> constructs the map using that predefined coordinate system and determines its position within that coordinate system based on the determined positions (block <b>706</b>) with respect to the identified objects. In another example, the eyewear device constructs a map using images of permanent or semi-permanent objects <b>604</b> within an environment (e.g., a tree or a park bench within a park). In accordance with this example, the eyewear device <b>100</b> may define the coordinate system (x&#x2032;, y&#x2032;, z&#x2032;) used for the environment.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">At block <b>710</b>, the eyewear device <b>100</b> determines a head pose (roll, pitch, and yaw) of the eyewear device <b>100</b> within the environment.

In an AR system, markers are registered at locations in the environment to assist devices with the task of tracking and updating the location of users, devices, and objects (virtual and physical) in a mapped environment. Markers are sometimes registered to a high-contrast physical object, such as the relatively dark object <b>604</b><i>a </i>mounted on a lighter-colored wall, to assist cameras and other sensors with the task of detecting the marker. The markers may be preassigned or may be assigned by the eyewear device <b>100</b> upon entering the environment.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Markers can be encoded with or otherwise linked to information. A marker might include position information, a physical code (such as a bar code or a QR code; either visible to the user or hidden), or a combination thereof. A set of data associated with the marker is stored in the memory <b>434</b> of the eyewear device <b>100</b>. The set of data includes information about the marker <b>610</b><i>a</i>, the marker's position (location and orientation), one or more virtual objects, or a combination thereof. The marker position may include three-dimensional coordinates for one or more marker landmarks <b>616</b><i>a</i>, such as the corner of the generally rectangular marker <b>610</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The marker location may be expressed relative to real-world geographic coordinates, a system of marker coordinates, a position of the eyewear device <b>100</b>, or other coordinate system. The one or more virtual objects associated with the marker <b>610</b><i>a </i>may include any of a variety of material, including still images, video, audio, tactile feedback, executable applications, interactive user interfaces and experiences, and combinations or sequences of such material. Any type of content capable of being stored in a memory and retrieved when the marker <b>610</b><i>a </i>is encountered or associated with an assigned marker may be classified as a virtual object in this context. The key <b>608</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, for example, is a virtual object displayed as a still image, either 2D or 3D, at a marker location.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one example, the marker <b>610</b><i>a </i>may be registered in memory as being located near and associated with a physical object <b>604</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the framed work of art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

In one example, the sensor system <b>804</b> is a conventional monocular visible light camera that captures a 2D image for viewing a portion of the room positioned behind the barrier (e.g., similar to a television image). In another example, the sensor system <b>804</b> is a stereoscopic camera system such as the camera system used in the eyewear <b>100</b> that captures a 3D image for viewing a portion of the room positioned behind the barrier (e.g., to provide a more realistic &#x201c;portal&#x201d; view into the room).
