More particularly, embodiments of the disclosure relate to semiconductor devices that include silicon substrates and methods of manufacturing semiconductor devices that include silicon substrates using multiple chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current semiconductor manufacturing methods use silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, or silicon substrates with an etch stop layer that protects an epitaxial layer (e.g., an active device area). The availability and cost constraints of SOI substrates and etch stop layers, such as silicon germanium etch stop layers, can limit the production volume needed to support the demand for semiconductor devices that use these features. For example, including an etch stop layer in a semiconductor device can increase both the cost and the complexity of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to method of manufacturing a semiconductor device that includes a two-step chemical mechanical polish (CMP) process to selectively remove device wafer material (e.g., silicon material) disposed over an active device area of the semiconductor device during backside processing of the semiconductor device. The fabrication methods can be used with a variety of semiconductor devices. In a non-limiting nonexclusive example, the semiconductor device is an integrated radio frequency (RF) power switch. The CMP process is tuned so as to preserve the active device area after the backside processing. The present disclosure removes device wafer material overlying the active device area without any special stop thin film layers. The manufacturing method according to the present disclosure eliminates the need for SOI or silicon substrates with etch stop layers while providing the same or better device and product characteristics. In addition to reducing the manufacturing costs, the process techniques according to the present disclosure remove the availability constraints of SOI and silicon substrates that include etch stop layers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device includes performing one or more grinding processes on a backside surface of a device wafer to thin the device wafer from a first thickness to a second thickness. A first CMP process is performed on the backside surface of the device wafer to thin the device wafer from the second thickness to a third thickness. A second CMP process is performed on the backside surface of the device wafer to selectively remove device wafer material that is disposed over an active device area of the semiconductor device, where a removal rate of the device wafer material is a function of depth.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, performing the one or more grinding processes includes performing a first grinding process and a second grinding process. The first grinding process is a rough or coarse grinding process, and the second grinding process is a fine grinding process. One or more first grinding parameters can be determined and/or adjusted before and/or during the first grinding process. Similarly, one or more second grinding parameters may be determined and/or adjusted before and/or during the second grinding process. Example first grinding parameters and second grinding parameters include, but are not limited to, a revolutions per minute (rpm) of a spindle of a grinding tool, a wheel type used in the grinding tool, an rpm of a stage of the grinding tool, and a tilt of the stage of the grinding tool (e.g., a table inclination).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, one or more CMP parameters are determined and/or adjusted at select times before and/or during the performance of the first CMP process. Example CMP parameters include, but are not limited to, a thickness profile of the device wafer, a slurry flow rate, an rpm of a polish head of a polishing tool, an rpm of a platen of the polishing tool, and one or more zonal pressures of the polish head in the polishing tool. The thickness profile may be determined and/or adjusted before and/or during the performance of the CMP process. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the zonal pressures of the polish head can be adjusted based on (e.g., to correct) the thickness profile.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, any of the foregoing aspects individually or together, and/or various separate aspects and features as described herein, may be combined for additional advantage. Any of the various features and elements as disclosed herein may be combined with one or more other disclosed features and elements unless indicated to the contrary herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Those skilled in the art will appreciate the scope of the present disclosure and realize additional aspects thereof after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in association with the accompanying drawing figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The accompanying drawing figures incorporated in and forming a part of this specification illustrate several aspects of the disclosure, and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example first semiconductor device;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example method of manufacturing a second semiconductor device in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example method of attaching the carrier wafer to the device wafer in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example second semiconductor device that includes a device wafer and a carrier wafer in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example method of performing a first grinding process and a second grinding process in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the second semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> after the device wafer is thinned in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the second semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> after the device wafer is further thinned in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the second semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> after a portion of the remaining device wafer is selectively removed in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the second semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> after a mold compound is formed in the trench of the second semiconductor device in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates the second semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> after the carrier wafer is removed in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The embodiments set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments and illustrate the best mode of practicing the embodiments.

Another dry etch process is then performed to remove the etch stop layer <b>104</b> and stop on the epitaxial layer <b>106</b>. The etch stop layer <b>104</b>, the plasma dry etch and/or the selective wet etch can increase the cost and/or the complexity of manufacturing the first semiconductor device <b>100</b>. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide manufacturing techniques that enable the etch stop layer <b>104</b> and the plasma dry etch and/or the selective wet etch to be omitted from the manufacturing process.
