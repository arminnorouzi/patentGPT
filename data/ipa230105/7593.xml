Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect of the disclosure, a method, a computer-readable medium, and an apparatus are provided. The apparatus may be a user equipment (UE). The apparatus may calculate an allocation of a transmission power for a first uplink transmission on a first uplink channel and at least one second uplink transmission on at least one second uplink channel. The transmission power may be allocated in each symbol of a plurality of symbols in a slot. The apparatus may detect a transmission power change in the allocation of the transmission power in the slot for at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission. The transmission power change may be associated with an overlapping between the first uplink transmission and the at least one second uplink transmission over at least a portion of one symbol in the slot. The apparatus may determine whether to adjust the allocation of the transmission power for the at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission to eliminate the transmission power change in the slot for the at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission. The apparatus may transmit, to a base station, the at least one of the first uplink transmission on the first uplink channel or the at least one second uplink transmission on the at least one second uplink channel based on an adjusted or an unadjusted allocation of the transmission power based on the determination.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect of the disclosure, a method, a computer-readable medium, and an apparatus are provided.

The channel priority may be associated with a transmission power of each of the plurality of uplink channels. The plurality of uplink channels may include a first uplink channel and at least one second uplink channel. The apparatus may receive, from the UE, at least one of a first uplink transmission on the first uplink channel or at least one second uplink transmission on the at least one second uplink channel. The at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission may be received based on the at least one of the channel priority or the indication of the requested transmission power and based on an adjustment or a non-adjustment of an allocation of a transmission power for the at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination th ereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a &#x201c;processing system&#x201d; that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, in one or more example embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While aspects and implementations are described in this application by illustration to some examples, those skilled in the art will understand that additional implementations and use cases may come about in many different arrangements and scenarios. Innovations described herein may be implemented across many differing platform types, devices, systems, shapes, sizes, and packaging arrangements. For example, implementations and/or uses may come about via integrated chip implementations and other non-module-component based devices (e.g., end-user devices, vehicles, communication devices, computing devices, industrial equipment, retail/purchasing devices, medical devices, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled devices, etc.). While some examples may or may not be specifically directed to use cases or applications, a wide assortment of applicability of described innovations may occur. Implementations may range a spectrum from chip-level or modular components to non-modular, non-chip-level implementations and further to aggregate, distributed, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) devices or systems incorporating one or more aspects of the described innovations. In some practical settings, devices incorporating described aspects and features may also include additional components and features for implementation and practice of claimed and described aspect. For example, transmission and reception of wireless signals necessarily includes a number of components for analog and digital purposes (e.g., hardware components including antenna, RF-chains, power amplifiers, modulators, buffer, processor(s), interleaver, adders/summers, etc.). It is intended that innovations described herein may be practiced in a wide variety of devices, chip-level components, systems, distributed arrangements, aggregated or disaggregated components, end-user devices, etc. of varying sizes, shapes, and constitution.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b>.

Each of the base stations <b>102</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. There may be overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>. For example, the small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; may have a coverage area <b>110</b>&#x2032; that overlaps the coverage area <b>110</b> of one or more macro base stations <b>102</b>. A network that includes both small cell and macrocells may be known as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include Home Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG). The communication links <b>120</b> between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (UL) (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>.

The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to DL and UL (e.g., more or fewer carriers may be allocated for DL than for UL). The component carriers may include a primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers. A primary component carrier may be referred to as a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be referred to as a secondary cell (SCell).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Certain UEs <b>104</b> may communicate with each other using device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>158</b>. The D2D communication link <b>158</b> may use the DL/UL WWAN spectrum. The D2D communication link <b>158</b> may use one or more sidelink channels, such as a physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH), a physical sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH), a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), and a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH). D2D communication may be through a variety of wireless D2D communications systems, such as for example, WiMedia, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard, LTE, or NR.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wireless communications system may further include a Wi-Fi access point (AP) <b>150</b> in communication with Wi-Fi stations (STAs) <b>152</b> via communication links <b>154</b>, e.g., in a 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum or the like.

When operating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032; may employ NR and use the same unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g., 5 GHz, or the like) as used by the Wi-Fi AP <b>150</b>. The small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032;, employing NR in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided, based on frequency/wavelength, into various classes, bands, channels, etc. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz).

The TX processor <b>316</b> handles mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)). The coded and modulated symbols may then be split into parallel streams. Each stream may then be mapped to an OFDM subcarrier, multiplexed with a reference signal (e.g., pilot) in the time and/or frequency domain, and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams. Channel estimates from a channel estimator <b>374</b> may be used to determine the coding and modulation scheme, as well as for spatial processing. The channel estimate may be derived from a reference signal and/or channel condition feedback transmitted by the UE <b>350</b>. Each spatial stream may then be provided to a different antenna <b>320</b> via a separate transmitter <b>318</b> TX.

The RX processor <b>356</b> may perform spatial processing on the information to recover any spatial streams destined for the UE <b>350</b>. If multiple spatial streams are destined for the UE <b>350</b>, they may be combined by the RX processor <b>356</b> into a single OFDM symbol stream. The RX processor <b>356</b> then converts the OFDM symbol stream from the time-domain to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The frequency domain signal comprises a separate OFDM symbol stream for each subcarrier of the OFDM signal. The symbols on each subcarrier, and the reference signal, are recovered and demodulated by determining the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the base station <b>310</b>. These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel estimator <b>358</b>. The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data and control signals that were originally transmitted by the base station <b>310</b> on the physical channel.

Changing the transmission power within a slot during an active channel transmission may cause multiple issues. For example, channel estimation may not work for modulation schemes with higher orders than QPSK (e.g., M-QAM) due to the constellation scaling. Further, the channel discontinuity due to a power amplifier gain change may cause the constellation to rotate.

The transmission power allocated for the channel transmission on CC 0 may be 23 decibel-milliwatts (dBm) when there is no overlapping transmission on other CCs. The channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 may be associated with the same priority (or not, right?). For symbols 7 to 13 in the illustrated slot, channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 may overlap. However, if the channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 are each transmitted with the 23 dBm transmission power for symbols 7 to 13, the total transmission power (i.e., 26 dBm) may exceed the transmission power limit of the UE (e.g., 23 dBm) based on the UE power class. To keep the total transmission power within the limit, the transmission power for the channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 for symbols 7 to 13 may be scaled down.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram <b>500</b> illustrating uplink transmission power allocation across multiple CCs. Because channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 are associated with the same priority, the total allowable transmission power (e.g., 23 dBm) may be equally allocated to each of the channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 for symbols 7 to 13. Accordingly, each of the channel transmissions on CC 0 and CC 1 may be transmitted with 20 dBm transmission power for symbols 7 to 13. Due to the power allocation for symbols 7 to 13, a transmission power change may occur on the channel transmission on CC 0 at the boundary between symbol 6 and symbol 7. The transmission power change may cause phase discontinuity, and may cause the channel on CC 0 to be non-decodable for symbols 7 to 13.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram <b>600</b> illustrating uplink transmission power allocation across multiple CCs according to aspects of the disclosure. The initial transmission power allocation for the channel transmissions on the multiple CCs including an allocation of the transmission power for each of the symbols may be performed using known methods. For example, the transmission power allocation across the multiple CCs may be based on at least one of the priorities associated with the channel transmissions on the CCs or indications received from the network of requested transmission power levels associated with the channel transmissions on the CCs. In one aspect, before the first symbol of the slot (i.e., symbol 0) is transmitted, the UE may search through the initial transmission power allocation for the slot for each of the CCs to find any in-slot transmission power change on any CC. For example, for CC 0, the UE may find the transmission power change from 23 dBm to 20 dBm at the boundary between symbol 6 and symbol 7, as described above. In one configuration, the UE may adjust the transmission power allocation to reduce the transmission power for some of the symbols for the CCs that are associated with a transmission power change, so that the in-slot transmission power change may be eliminated and the channel transmission on the CC may be transmitted with a same and constant transmission power throughout the duration of the channel transmission (e.g., the entire slot). In one aspect, a minimum transmission power allocated to the channel transmission on the CC for some of the symbols may be used instead for the channel transmission on the CC for the duration of the channel transmission (e.g., the entire slot). In the illustrated example, the transmission power for the channel transmission on CC 0 for symbols 0 to 6 may be reduced to 20 dBm from 23 dBm. Accordingly, the transmission power for the channel transmission on CC 0 may be transmitted with the same 20 dBm transmission power throughout the duration of the channel transmission (e.g., the entire slot). Because the transmission power change is eliminated, the channel may be decodable throughout the slot. In another example (not shown), the channel transmission on CC 0 may overlap in time with an additional channel transmission on an additional CC (e.g., CC 2), and may be associated with two transmission power changes in the slot. Based on the initial transmission power allocation, the channel transmission on CC 0 may be transmitted with a 23 dBm transmission power for some symbols, with a 20 dBm transmission power for some other symbols, and with a 17 dBm transmission power for yet some other symbols. According to the aspects described herein, the transmission power allocation may be adjusted so that the constant 17 dBm transmission power (i.e., the minimum transmission power allocated to the channel transmission on CC 0) may be used instead for the channel transmission on CC 0 throughout the duration of the channel transmission (e.g., the entire slot). As the transmission power changes are eliminated, and the transmission power is not excessively reduced for any symbol, the channel transmission may be decodable for the entire slot.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Although aspects are described in relation to CC 0, they may be applied similarly to other CCs (e.g., CC 1, CC 2, etc.). Further, the number of simultaneous channel transmissions and the number of the in-slot transmission power changes on a CC do not limit the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">An adjusted transmission power allocation that is non optimal may not be used for the channel transmissions. In one configuration, if the power reduction for the channel transmission on one CC based on an adjusted transmission power allocation exceeds a first threshold (e.g., 5 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB, 18 dB, 20 dB, etc.), the initial transmission power allocation may not be adjusted, and the unadjusted initial transmission power allocation may be used for the channel transmissions. For example, if, based on the initial transmission power allocation, the channel transmission on one CC is to be transmitted with a 23 dBm transmission power for some symbols, with a 20 dBm transmission power for some other symbols, and with a 3 dBm transmission power for yet some other symbols, using a minimum transmission power allocated to the channel transmission on the CC (i.e., 3 dBm) for the channel transmission for the entire slot may involve a first transmission power reduction of 20 dB and a second transmission power reduction of 17 dB. With such large transmission power reductions, even if the transmission power changes are eliminated, decoding failures may occur nonetheless. Accordingly, if a first threshold that is less than 20 dB is utilized, the initial transmission power allocation may not be adjusted, and the unadjusted initial transmission power allocation may be used for the channel transmission on the CC. In another example (not shown), based on the initial transmission power allocation, the channel transmission on one CC may be transmitted with a 20 dBm transmission power for some symbols and with a &#x2212;&#x221e; dBm transmission power for some other symbols. Using a minimum transmission power allocated to the channel transmission on the CC (i.e., &#x2212;&#x221e; dBm) for the channel transmission for the entire slot may result in a non-transmission of the whole channel. As the power reduction exceeds the first threshold, the initial transmission power allocation may not be adjusted, and the unadjusted initial transmission power allocation may be used for the channel transmission on the CC. Accordingly, the channel may still be decodable in symbols where the channel transmission is transmitted with the initially allocated 20 dBm transmission power.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In one configuration, if the proportion of symbols in the slot whose decoding may be affected by the transmission power changes is less than a second threshold (e.g., 10%, 15%, etc.), the initial transmission power allocation may not be adjusted, and the unadjusted initial transmission power allocation may be used for the channel transmissions. Intuitively, for example, the full channel power may not be reduced just because the decoding of a single symbol may be affected by a transmission power change. Compared to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, if the transmission power change occurs at the boundary between symbol 12 and symbol 13, the decoding of symbol 13 may be affected, while the decoding of symbols 0 to 12 may not be affected by the transmission power change. If the proportion of symbols in the channel transmission whose decoding may be affected by the transmission power changes (e.g., 1/14) is less than the second threshold (e.g., 10%, 15%, etc.), the initial transmission power allocation may not be adjusted, and the unadjusted initial transmission power allocation may be used for the channel transmissions. In some aspects, a channel error correcting code (e.g., a low-density parity-check &#x201c;LDPC&#x201d; code) may help to correct the errors resulting from the power discontinuity. In some aspects, the data associated with the decoding errors may be retransmitted (e.g., based on the HARQ process).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a communication flow <b>700</b> of a method of wireless communication.

As described supra, the apparatus <b>1202</b> may include the TX Processor <b>316</b>, the RX Processor <b>370</b>, and the controller/processor <b>375</b>.

The transmission power may be allocated in each symbol of a plurality of symbols in a slot. The UE may detect a transmission power change in the allocation of the transmission power in the slot for at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission. The transmission power change may be associated with an overlapping between the first uplink transmission and the at least one second uplink transmission over at least a portion of one symbol in the slot. The UE may determine whether to adjust the allocation of the transmission power for the at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission to eliminate the transmission power change in the slot for the at least one of the first uplink transmission or the at least one second uplink transmission. The UE may transmit, to a base station, the at least one of the first uplink transmission on the first uplink channel or the at least one second uplink transmission on the at least one second uplink channel based on an adjusted or an unadjusted allocation of the transmission power based on the determination. Therefore, in a multiple CC scenario where channel transmissions on different CCs may overlap in time, an in-slot transmission power change in a channel transmission on a CC may be eliminated, and accordingly the full channel transmission may be decodable.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">It is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of blocks in the processes/flowcharts disclosed is an illustration of example approaches.
