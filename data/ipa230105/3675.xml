Because wearable electronic devices can conform to and follow the deformation of the skin, they are capable of capturing various essential mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, and biological signals, demonstrating an excellent potential for future healthcare monitoring applications. Though continuous recording and analysis of gaseous compounds bear significant importance in healthcare, the study of wearable gas sensors for toxic gas detection, environmental air quality monitoring, and breath analysis has only commenced recently. As one representative example, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most prominent toxic air pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuel. Inhaling at low concentration can cause symptoms such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Long-term exposure can lead to heart failure and dysrhythmia. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for the development of wearable gas sensors to provide accurate and continuous recording of NO<sub>2</sub>. Wearable gas sensors can also enable the direct monitoring of the odours released from the human body to help inform the health conditions. Compared to their industrial counterparts, the development of wearable gas sensors needs to address additional challenging requirements, including lightweight and small form factor, low operating temperature, low energy consumption, and mechanical robustness upon various skin deformations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides embodiments of a graphene-based gas sensing platform for sensing a gas component. The gas sensing platform includes a chemoresistive gas sensor and a supporting substrate. The chemoresistive gas sensor includes a sensing region made of porous graphene having two interconnect regions each extending continuously from the sensing region.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, the gas-sensitive nanomaterial may be dispersed in the sensing region for an increased sensitivity of deconvoluting the gas component from a gas mixture. The chemoresistive gas sensor responds to the gas component by changing the resistance of the gas sensing region as the gas-sensitive nanomaterial binds with the gas component. The response is characterized by a ratio (R<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;R)/R<sub>0</sub>, where R<sub>0 </sub>is a resistance of the sensing region in the presence of only air and R is the resistance of the sensing region in the presence of the gas to be detected. The magnitude of the response measures the concentration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the interconnect regions are comprised of porous graphene and the interconnect regions are integrated with the sensing region. The interconnect regions may further comprise a layer of metal surface coating on the porous graphene for modulating the interconnect resistance of the interconnect region. Alternatively, the interconnect region may be made from any other conductive material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gas-sensitive nanomaterial may be selected from, but not limited to, rGO, MoS<sub>2</sub>, rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>, ZnO/CuO core/shell nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes, one dimensional nanostructured metal-oxides, graphene/metal oxide hybrid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The substrate may be rigid, flexible or stretchable depending on the applications of the sensing platform. A stretchable substrate may be used for a sensor applied on human skin.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the interconnect regions may be configured to have an interconnect resistance smaller than a sensing resistance of the sensing region, such that the sensing region generates localized heating upon an externally applied voltage due to the difference between the sensing resistance of the sensing region and the interconnect resistance of the interconnect regions. The larger the difference is, the better. The ratio of the sensing resistance to the interconnect resistance can be tuned by changing the geometrical parameters (width, length and thickness) of the sensing region and the interconnect region. The interconnect regions may also be coated with a metal layer to obviate the need for a significantly reduced linewidth and increased length in the sensing region. As the metal coating significantly reduces the resistance in the interconnect regions to result in localized heating in the sensing region, the power consumption may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is desired for the porous graphene to have a 3D foam structure. In some embodiments, the porous graphene is laser-induced graphene.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sensing region may be a straight line or a non-linear shape. The interconnect regions may be straight or wavy or serpentine or any other nonlinear shape. For a biomedical application with a stretchable substrate, a non-linear shape such as serpentine is preferred.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A gas sensing platform array can be formed comprising an array of the gas sensing platforms according to any embodiment of the present invention, where the sensing region of each gas sensing platform is decorated with a different nanomaterial such that each gas sensing platform in the array is tailored to a different gas component.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also provides embodiments of a method of making a gas sensing platform for sensing a gas component with an ultralow concentration. The method may include the steps of forming porous graphene patterns on a film of carbon source material using a laser system. The pattern may include a sensing region disposed between two interconnect regions each extending continuously from ends of the sensing region. The pattern may then be cut off using the laser system and transferred onto a rigid, flexible or stretchable substrate. A metal layer may be coated onto the interconnect regions and gas-sensitive nanomaterials may be deposited in the sensing region for binding to the gas component.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The carbon source may be polyimide films, modified polyimide and phenolic resin, lignocellulose materials, polyetherimide (PEI), sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone), polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and naturally occurring wood.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">While cutting off the pattern, a small area of the original film around the sensing region may be cut off as well to reduce strain interference.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Using a sensing platform in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, at a proper self-heating condition, the nanomaterial/LIG gas sensor exhibits fast response/recovery and ultrasensitive detection of gas such as NO<sub>2</sub>, with a limit of detection of approximately 1.5 parts per billion (ppb) at low power consumption and in an ambient temperature.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is an advantage of embodiments of the gas sensing platform in the present invention to be capable of detecting various gas components in ultralow concentrations. However, the present gas sensing platform can also be used to sense gases at much higher concentrations.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of an exemplary fabrication process of preparing a stretchable LIG gas sensing platform in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is optical images of the LIG gas sensing platform and its demonstration to follow various deformations applied to it;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are optical images of the gas sensor bent over a cylinder and attached to the back surface of the hand respectively;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref> are plots characterizing the LIG gas sensing platform;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> are XPS survey scans;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> are plots characterizing the LIG electrode with self-heating capabilities;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> are illustrations showing dependence of the resistance of the LIG electrode on its length and width respectively;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref> are plots showing effects of the width and operating temperature from self-heating on the gas sensing performance;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a plot showing dependence of the temperature in the LIG electrode from self-heating on the input power;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>F</figref> are plots showing the dynamic response, limit of detection, selectivity, and mechanical robustness of the gas sensor;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref> are plots showing the gas sensing performance of pristine LIG lines to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm at 20&#xb0;

The graphene-based gas sensing platform may include a sensing region comprised of a porous graphene platform. The porous graphene is coated with highly sensitive materials such as MoS<sub>2</sub>, rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The effective use of nanomaterials, because of their significantly increased surface to volume ratios and the formation of the p-n junction between p-type porous graphene and n-type gas-sensitive nanomaterials, leads to enhanced sensitivity, selectivity, and signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of a target gas component at an ultralow concentration.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, introducing n-type MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanomaterials on the porous graphene could form p-n junctions to enhance the sensing performance. In the rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers, while the p-type rGO sheets provide the overall conductivity, the n-type MoS<sub>2 </sub>on the rGO sheets has multiple active sites with selective affinity to NO<sub>2 </sub>gas molecules for sensing. The carrier concentration on the LIG changes upon NO<sub>2 </sub>adsorption making the porous graphene-based platform an outstanding candidate for sensing NO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The graphene can be highly porous laser-induced graphene (LIG). The laser used may be continuous-wave lasers such as CO<sub>2 </sub>lasers, optically pumped solid state lasers, ultraviolet lasers, or pulsed lasers such as femtosecond lasers. Graphene may also be induced with focused irradiation, or other types of energy comparable to the lasers used. Any known or yet to be developed approach may be used to form the porous graphene.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The laser scribing parameters change the sheet resistance of the laser-induced graphene. The additional change in the linewidth and length of the LIG sensing region further provides ways to tune the resistance of the LIG sensing region. Given the same laser scribing parameters, the resistance of the LIG sensing region is found to be proportional to its length.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example, the time for a peak temperature of the LIG platform to reach equilibrium for an applied voltage in the range from 0.5 V to 12 V may be less than 20 s. The temperature of the gas sensing region can be controlled to be below 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an example, the sensor has only a graphene sensing region and a graphene interconnect region extending continuously from both ends of the sensing region. The sensor may be placed on a supporting substrate. The substrate may be rigid, flexible or stretchable. There are no additional electrodes in the interconnect region and other sensing materials in the sensing region. In this example, the porous graphene itself supported by a substrate makes up a complete sensing platform due to its relatively high electrical conductivity and its large surface to volume ratio. The porous graphene sensing region may be a straight or nonlinear elongated region. The interconnect region may be a straight or nonlinear elongated region.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some gas sensors in prior art use electrodes, such as interdigitated electrodes, that are separated by a small gap. As such, they form an open circuit until gas-sensing nanomaterials are deposited on the sensor to span this gap. The gas-sensing nanomaterials form the electrical path between the electrodes. In examples of the porous graphene gas sensing platform of the present invention, the graphene in the sensing region is continuous between the electrodes and therefore forms an electrical connection prior to the addition of gas-sensing nanomaterials.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, the gas sensing platform has only a graphene sensing region and interconnect regions extending continuously from both ends of the sensing region. The interconnect regions may be made from conductive materials other than graphene. The sensor may be placed on a supporting substrate.

The self-heating effect of the LIG gas sensing platform could be exploited to reduce the device complexity for characterizing various gas-sensitive nanomaterials.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The self-heating effect of the LIG gas sensing platform hinges on its geometric parameters and location-dependent conductivity (i.e., Silver coated LIG in the serpentine interconnect region). A strong self-heating effect requires the resistance of the LIG sensing region to be significantly larger than that of the serpentine region. Similar to the conventional design of heaters, a smaller linewidth and a longer length in the LIG sensing region increased its relative resistance to the serpentine interconnect region. However, the Ag ink coating in the serpentine interconnect region drastically reduced its resistance, obviating the need for a significantly reduced linewidth and increased length in the LIG heating region. While the laser processing parameters change the sheet resistance of the LIG, the additional change in the linewidth and length of the LIG sensing region further provides ways to tune the resistance of the LIG sensing region.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> are illustrations showing dependence of the resistance of the LIG electrode on its length and width respectively.

Though the I-V curves were relatively linear despite the temperature rise from self-heating, there was still a small change in the resistance of the LIG gas sensing platform.

In the rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers, while the p-type rGO sheets provide the overall conductivity, the n-type MoS<sub>2 </sub>on the rGO sheets has multiple active sites with selective affinity to NO<sub>2 </sub>gas molecules for sensing. The adsorption of NO<sub>2 </sub>on the surface of rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers continuously withdrew electrons from rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>, which extended both of the electron depletion and hole accumulation regions at the interface of the p-n junction.

The gas sensor response was defined as the ratio of its electrical resistance R in the presence of target gas to that R<sub>0 </sub>in the air. The gas sensing response of pristine porous LIG sensing regions to NO<sub>2 </sub>was observed to depend on the laser scribing parameters. When a power of 16% and a speed of 10% were used in the CO<sub>2 </sub>laser scribing process, the resulting LIG sensing regions showed poor sensitivity (&#x2dc;0.3&#x2030;) and apparent baseline shift when exposed to 1 ppm NO<sub>2 </sub>at 20&#xb0; C., shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. Reducing both the power and speed in the laser scribing process (power of 3% and speed of 0.8%) yielded pristine porous LIG sensing regions with significantly improved performance (i.e., response of 12&#x2030; and SNR of 434), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. Meanwhile, the excellent selectivity of the sensor to NO<sub>2 </sub>over a wide range of other inferencing gas species (e.g., acetone, ethanol, ammonia, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO) was also confirmed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>. In addition to the change in laser scribing parameters, dispersing highly sensitive materials such as MoS<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> or rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> in the LIG sensing regions also improved the gas sensing performance to NO<sub>2</sub>. For instance, the response of the porous LIG line (power of 16%, speed of 10%) coated with rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>(or MoS<sub>2</sub>) exhibited significant increase to 7&#x2030; (or 5&#x2030;), corresponding to ca. 20-fold increase when compared to the pristine porous LIG sensing regions without nanomaterial coating. Upon NO<sub>2 </sub>exposure of 6 min, a high SNR of 482 (or 285) was also observed in the LIG sensing region coated with rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>(or MoS<sub>2</sub>). Considering the vast difference between sensors with and without the highly sensitive nanomaterials, the response of the gas sensor should be mainly contributed by the nanomaterials, which demonstrates that the LIG gas sensing platform enables the characterization of sensitive nanomaterials.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers with the small petal structure was selected to investigate the width effect on the gas sensor performance, because it demonstrated a more substantial response of 4.0&#x2030; than that with the big petal structure of 1.8&#x2030; to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm at 60&#xb0; C. from self-heating (10 V applied on the LIG with a linewidth of 120 &#x3bc;m and length of 2.5 mm), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. The more significant response in the LIG with the small petal structure than that with the big petal structure was also observed at other temperature values, i.e., 6.6&#x2030; vs. 2.8&#x2030; at 20&#xb0; C., 5.1&#x2030; vs. 2.0&#x2030; at 40&#xb0; C., and 2.0&#x2030; vs. 0.4&#x2030; at 80&#xb0; C., shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The LIG with the small petal structure is associated with the reduced feature size and more uniform distribution of the nanomaterials. The increased specific surface area and the possibly formed p-n junction lead to a more substantial response and faster response/recovery processes. The angle of the plateau is introduced and defined as the tangent angle of the response/recovery curves at the end of adsorption/desorption to quantitatively capture these processes. The smaller the angle of the plateau, the faster the response/recovery processes. With such a new definition, the response process in the LIG with the small petal structure (angle of the plateau of 2&#xb0;) was indeed faster than that with the big petal structure (slope of the plateau of 3&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Different voltage inputs were first applied to the LIG sensing region with various linewidths to ensure their temperatures remained the same such as at 60&#xb0; C. In particular, a voltage of 20 V, 15 V, 12 V, and 11 V was applied on the LIG with a linewidth of 120 &#x3bc;m, 160 &#x3bc;m, 200 &#x3bc;m, and 240 &#x3bc;m, all with the same length of 6 mm. Next, dispersing rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers with small petal structure on the LIG sensing region with various linewidths prepared chemiresistive gas sensors. The electrical resistance of the resulting gas sensors decreased upon exposure to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm and recovered in the air due to the desorption of NO<sub>2</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. The magnitude of the response to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm at 60&#xb0; C. increased from 3&#x2030; to 8&#x2030; as the linewidth of LIG sensing region increased from 120 &#x3bc;m to 240 &#x3bc;m. Consisting of the electrical resistance R<sub>sensing </sub>in the sensing region, R<sub>serpentine </sub>in the serpentine region, and the contact resistance R<sub>contact </sub>between nanomaterials (e.g., rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>) and LIG, the total resistance R<sub>total </sub>of the resulting gas sensor would be the sum of the three. Forming a parallel connection between the LIG and the nanomaterial such as rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>would indicate a more significant response in the LIG with a smaller linewidth, which cannot explain the trend in the experiment. The increased response with the increasing linewidth could be likely attributed to the non-uniform temperature distribution in the LIG sensing region, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Non-uniform temperature distribution resulted in a lower temperature at the edge than that at the central region of the LIG sensing region. Because the rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>sensing material showed a more substantial response at a lower temperature, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C-<b>7</b>D</figref>, the lower temperature at the edge region of the LIG sensing region with a larger linewidth gave rise to the more significant response. Additionally, the incomplete recovery to NO<sub>2 </sub>observed in the LIG with a larger linewidth could be explained by the limited recovery at a lower temperature in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C-<b>7</b>D</figref> at the edge region from the non-uniform temperature distribution as well.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">After uncovering the width effect, the temperature effect is investigated on the gas sensor performance. By leveraging the self-heating effect in the LIG sensing region, the gas sensing behaviors of the rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>-LIG sensor to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm were compared at various operating temperatures from 20&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C-<b>7</b>D</figref>. The operating temperature was selected to be below 100&#xb0; C. because of the stability consideration of the ionosorption of gas species in the charge transfer involving MoS<sub>2</sub>. While a complete recovery was observed in the LIG gas sensing platform with rGO/MoS<sub>2 </sub>nanoflowers of the small petal structure, the recovery time of 2830 s to 1 pm NO<sub>2 </sub>at 20&#xb0; C. was significantly larger than that at 80&#xb0; C. (580 s), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Also, it is crucial to sensitively detect low concentrations of NO<sub>2 </sub>(&#x2dc;53 ppb) in the envisioned applications, as this level of exposure can cause chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and respiratory irritation. The repeatability test indicates that the response of the gas sensor to the same target gas concentration is independent of whether the gas sensor is fully recovered. Thus, the gas sensor does not necessarily need to fully recover when used for the long-term monitoring of low-level exposures. Considering a recovery time of 720 s is sufficient to capture the gas sensor characteristics, this value is used in the subsequent tests for rapid testing unless otherwise specified. As the operating temperature was increased from 20&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., the response of the sensor with the big petal structure gradually decreased from 2.8&#x2030; to 0.4&#x2030; upon exposure to NO<sub>2 </sub>for 6 min, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>. While the temperature-dependent response is related to the equilibrium of the NO<sub>2 </sub>adsorption, further experiments are still needed to directly uncover the underlying mechanism. However, the elevated operating temperature led to improvements in the response/recovery processes of the gas sensor. The decreased slope of the plateau from 11&#xb0; to 0.7&#xb0; indicated the significantly improved response process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. Defining the recovery ratio as the ratio of responses at the end to the start of desorption in given time duration, the recovery rate also increased from 20% to 200% for desorption of 12 min as the operating temperature was increased from 20&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. The improved desorption was enabled by thermal activation at elevated operating temperatures.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A balance has to be struck as the significant response and fast response/recovery cannot be achieved simultaneously by tuning the operating temperature alone. This observation also holds for the LIG with the small petal structure. While the response of the sensor decreased from 6.6&#x2030; to 2.0&#x2030; as the operating temperature was increased from 20&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., the angle of plateau decreased from 8&#xb0; to 0.6&#xb0;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, and the recovery rate increased from 58% to 113%, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>. Considering the balance between the significant response and fast response/recovery processes, the operating temperature of 60&#xb0; C. was selected in the subsequent studies unless specified otherwise. The room or low temperature sensing capability was particularly attractive for wearable gas sensing applications due to low energy consumption and the elimination of the adverse thermal effect on the skin surface. Though the operating temperature of 60&#xb0; C. seems to be slightly higher than the desired temperature in the epidermal applications, incorporating a heat sink or combining the thermal isolation layer in the gas sensor could readily reduce the temperature at the sensor/skin interface to avoid the adverse thermal effect on the skin surface.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>F</figref> show the dynamic response, limit of detection, selectivity, and mechanical robustness of the exemplary gas sensor.

selectivity of the rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>-LIG sensor to NO<sub>2 </sub>was confirmed in comparison to the responses to a wide range of other interfering gas species that include acetone, ethanol, methanol, ammonia, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>. While the sensor response to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm was 5.1&#x2030;, its response was only &#x2212;0.34&#x2030; to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) of 1 ppm, 2.0/&#x2212;0.19/&#x2212;0.11&#x2030; to NO/SO<sub>2</sub>/CO of 1 ppm, and &#x2212;0.3/&#x2212;0.19/&#x2212;0.5&#x2030; to acetone/ethanol/methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH/CH<sub>3</sub>OH) of 100 ppm. Though the concentration of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was much higher than that of NO<sub>2</sub>, the sensor response was still much smaller because of their weak interaction with the gas sensing nanomaterials. The sensor responses to NH<sub>3</sub>/SO<sub>2</sub>/CO of 1 ppm were small yet considerable, but they were in the opposite direction because of their reducing characteristics. In addition to the common interfering gas species such as NH<sub>3</sub>, NO, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and VOCs in the target application environment, humidity often poses significant concern on the gas sensors, especially for those operating at room or low temperatures. Exposing the gas sensor at a high level of relative humidity (RH) demonstrated the humidity effect. After being exposed to an RH of 88% for 6 min, the humidity response was considerable at 20&#xb0; C. (i.e., 1.96&#x2030;). However, the response was significantly reduced at elevated temperatures (i.e., 0.83/0.45/0.29&#x2030; at 40/60/80&#xb0; C.), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, indicating a small interfering effect of RH on NO<sub>2 </sub>response at elevated temperatures. Coating metal-organic framework (MOF) such as a layer of hydrophobic and catalytic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-CoZn (ZIF-CoZn, isostructural with ZIF-8(Zn) or ZIF-67(Co)) thin film on the gas sensor could also drastically improve the sensor performance under humidity interference. Additionally, the concept from the electronic nose could be applied to deconvolute the gas response in the presence of humidity based on the measurements from two sensors with one subject to both gas and humidity and the other one subject to humidity alone.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">When used in epidermal applications, the LIG gas sensing platform also expects to be mechanically robust with minimum resistance change upon mechanical perturbations such as natural skin motions. As stretchable structures have been extensively studied and explored to ensure stretchable properties in the epidermal devices, they will be exploited to yield a stretchable LIG gas sensing platform. Leveraging the simple laser scribing process, the stretchable serpentine interconnect region can be created during the sensor fabrication in a single step. Because of the serpentine interconnect region, the rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>-LIG gas sensor on an elastomeric substrate such as Ecoflex exhibited a robust mechanical property, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>, to withstand a uniaxial tensile strain E of 20% that is comparable to the level of the maximum deformation on the skin surface. The mechano-chemiresistive properties of the rGO/MoS<sub>2</sub>-LIG gas sensor with the small petal structure to NO<sub>2 </sub>of 1 ppm were investigated. The static tensile strain was applied from a custom-built stretcher with a step motor controlled by Arduino Uno, and the gas sensor was evaluated at both room temperature and 40&#xb0; C. from self-heating. In addition to maintaining its mechanical integrity, the sensor subject to a uniaxial tensile strain of 20% demonstrated an increased response and faster recovery when compared to the un-stretched (i.e., E=0%) at both room temperature and 40&#xb0; C. As the tensile strain was increased from 0% to 20%, the sensor response increased from 5.5&#x2030; to 6.2&#x2030; (or from 2.8&#x2030; to 4.0&#x2030;) at 20&#xb0; C. (or 40&#xb0; C.). The increased response and faster recovery upon mechanical deformation could be attributed to the deformation-induced structure change in the highly porous LIG and the strain engineering of the semiconducting nanomaterials. As a simple and straightforward strategy, strain isolation with a stiff material in the sensing region was explored to demonstrate ways to reduce the strain interfering. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>D</figref> show stretchability of LIG gas sensor with different designs. A tensile strain of 20% was applied from a custom-built stretcher on the LIG gas sensing platform with three different strain isolation designs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>. As the existing PI beneath the LIG has Young's modulus much larger than that of the elastomeric substrate, it naturally served as the stiff material for strain isolation. Because of the enhanced stiffness in the device region and the placement of the LIG sensor away from the strain concentration edge, the strain in the LIG sensor is significantly reduced when compared to the applied strain. Progressively increasing the size of the PI pattern (i.e., single line, small circle, and large circle) enhanced the strain isolation effect by moving the LIG gas sensor away from the strain concentration edge. As a result, the resistance change in the LIG gas sensing platform reduced from 11.3&#x2030; for the single line design to 0.47&#x2030; for the large circle design, when a strain of 20% was applied perpendicular to the sensing region. The resistance fluctuation was also greatly suppressed for the large circle design compared with the other two designs, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>D</figref>. While the LIG gas sensing platform could be attached to the skin surface with its sensing line perpendicular to the major deformation direction, the strain along the parallel direction of the sensing line may not be ignored. In the LIG gas sensing array, the spacing between two sensors could actually follow most of the strain applied to the array with different strain isolation designs. When a strain of 20% parallel to the LIG sensing line was applied, the resistance change in the LIG gas sensing platform reduced from 77.8&#x2030; for the single line design to 4.4&#x2030; for the large circle design. Replacing the spacing with a much compliant material would certainly improve the strain isolation effect to result in a much smaller resistance change. Other than the demonstrated strain isolation strategy, many other stretchable strategies (e.g., pre-strain, self-similar interconnect patterns, and kirigami patterning of the substrate can also be applied to further minimize the strain and reduce the resistance change in the LIG sensing region. While the strain-induced resistance change cannot be ignored for the detection of the ultralow concentration of NO<sub>2</sub>, the concept from the electronic nose to deconvolute the gas response in the presence of strain can also be applied here, similar to the proposed strategy to mitigate the humidity effect.
