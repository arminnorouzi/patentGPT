For example, when the rate of yaw of the vehicle becomes large, errors may occur in the results of detecting the position and velocity of a stationary obstacle, and as a result, the axis deviation may not be detected accurately.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One aspect of the present disclosure has the object of providing a technique for improving the accuracy of detecting an axis deviation in an in-vehicle measurement device that uses radar waves.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An axis deviation detection device according to one aspect of the present disclosure is configured to detect the deviation of the central axis of an in-vehicle measurement device. The measurement device radiates radar waves while varying the radiation direction over a predetermined angle on both sides of a central axis, and performs measurements on a stationary object by detecting reflected waves of the radiated radar waves. The axis deviation detection device includes a correction unit, a generating unit, a judgement unit, and a detection unit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The correction unit is configured to correct data that are obtained by the measurements performed by the measurement device, with the correction being executed by a method corresponding to the case in which the travel locus of the vehicle having the measuring apparatus mounted thereon is a predetermined specific travel locus, and is configured to generate first data which express a value relating to the position and/or the velocity of the stationary object. The generating unit is configured to generates second data, which indicate the position and/or velocity of the stationary object, based on the behavior of the vehicle as measured by a sensor unit, which is different from devices that radiate the radar waves and detect the reflected waves. The judgement unit is configured to judge whether the travel locus of the vehicle is the specific travel locus. The detection unit is configured to detect a deviation of the central axis by comparing the first data and second data, where the first data are based on measurements performed by the measurement device in the case in which the judgement unit judges that the travel locus of the vehicle is the specific travel locus, and the second data are based on measurements performed by the sensor unit in the case in which the judgement unit judges that the travel locus of the vehicle is the specific travel locus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above configuration, in detecting a deviation of the central axis, first data and second data are used, where the first data are based on measurements made by means of radar waves in the case in which the vehicle is traveling along a specific travel locus, and the second data are based on measurements made by means of the sensor unit in the in the case in which the judgement unit judges that the travel locus of the vehicle is the specific travel locus. When the first data are generated, correction is applied by a method corresponding to the specific travel locus, for thereby suppressing an error caused by the travel of the vehicle along the specific travel locus. Hence, the deviation of the central axis is detected by using first data whose accuracy has been improved by the correction. It is thus made possible to improve the accuracy of detecting an axis deviation in an in-vehicle measurement device that utilizes radar waves.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is also possible to configure an axis deviation detection program for operating a computer as an axis deviation detection device. In that case, the same effects as described above can be obtained, by operating the computer in accordance with such an axis deviation detection program.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in the following with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">1.

The measurement device <b>1</b> can measure a single object, or measure each of a plurality of objects in parallel. The object may be a moving body or a stationary object, and the measurement device <b>1</b> measures the relative position and relative velocity of the object with respect to the local vehicle. The measurement device <b>1</b> includes a control unit <b>10</b>, a radar device <b>20</b>, and a sensor unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The control unit <b>10</b> is a unit that performs overall control of the measurement device <b>1</b>, and includes a CPU <b>11</b>, a microcomputer having a semiconductor memory (referred to in the following as the memory <b>12</b>) such as a RAM, ROM, flash memory, etc., and a communication unit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The CPU <b>11</b> executes a program stored in the memory <b>12</b>. Each function of the measurement device <b>1</b> is realized by the CPU <b>11</b> in executing an axis deviation detection program that is stored in a non-transitional substantive storage medium. In the present embodiment, the memory <b>12</b> corresponds to the non-transitional substantive storage medium in which the axis deviation detection program is stored. Furthermore, a method corresponding to the axis deviation detection program is executed by executing the axis deviation detection program. The measurement device <b>1</b> may include one or more microcomputers. Furthermore, the method for realizing the functions of the measurement device <b>1</b> is not limited to software, and a part or all of the functions may be realized by using electronic circuits. In that case, the electronic circuits may be configured as digital circuits, analog circuits, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The communication unit <b>13</b> is connected to a communication line such as an in-vehicle LAN (not shown) and communicates with other in-vehicle devices. The in-vehicle LAN may be, for example, a LAN that is compliant with CAN (registered trademark). The measurement device <b>1</b> may provide the measurement results that are obtained for an object to an in-vehicle device, via the in-vehicle LAN, for use in driving support or automatic driving, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The radar device <b>20</b> is mounted on the front end of the local vehicle <b>50</b>, and radiates radar waves within a radiation region <b>60</b> which spreads in a fan shape ahead of the local vehicle <b>50</b>, while receiving reflected waves of the radiated radar waves, for thereby executing measurement relating to the position and/or velocity of an object (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). That is, the radar device <b>20</b> radiates the radar waves while shifting the radiation direction along the vehicle width direction of the local vehicle <b>50</b> over a central angle <b>61</b> of the radiation region <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A straight line passing through the center of the radiation region <b>60</b> is referred to as the central axis <b>62</b>.

The disclosure is of course, not limited to this, and the central axis <b>62</b> may be located on the right side or the left side of the center of the radiation area <b>60</b>. The central axis is defined as the y-axis, and an axis orthogonal to the central axis is defined as the x-axis. The x-axis and y-axis form an xy coordinate plane, having as origin the origin of the radar waves.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000">The radar device <b>20</b> is mounted on the local vehicle <b>50</b> such that the central axis <b>62</b> (in other words, the y-axis) coincides with the front-rear direction of the local vehicle <b>50</b>. However, there may be a deviation between the central axis <b>62</b> of the radar device <b>20</b> and the front-rear direction of the local vehicle <b>50</b>. Hereinafter, the angle of the central axis <b>62</b> with respect to the front-rear direction of the local vehicle <b>50</b> will be referred to as the axis deviation amount or &#x3b8;<sub>gap</sub>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The radar device <b>20</b> may be, for example, what is known as a millimeter wave radar, that uses electromagnetic waves in the millimeter-wave band as radar waves, a laser radar that uses a laser beam as radar waves, or a sonar device that uses sound waves as radar waves.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The sensor unit <b>30</b> is a part that is different from the radar device <b>20</b>, and includes at least one sensor for detecting behavior of the local vehicle <b>50</b>.

Hereinafter the yaw rate, and the vehicle velocity measured by the vehicle velocity sensor <b>31</b>, are also referred to as odometry information. It should be noted that it would be equally possible for the sensor unit <b>30</b> to detect behavior of the local vehicle <b>50</b> other than the yaw rate or the vehicle velocity.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">2. Outline of Processing</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The control unit <b>10</b> of the measurement device <b>1</b> executes measurements relating to the position and/or velocity of an object by tracking the object with an &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker, using a constant velocity linear motion model, based on data generated by the radar device <b>20</b> in a period Tm s. It would of course be equally possible for the control unit <b>10</b> to perform measurement using, for example, an &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker the employs a different motion model, or to perform measurement using a tracking filter (for example, a Kalman filter) other than a &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">The measurement device <b>1</b> functions as an axis deviation detection device <b>1</b> for detecting the above-mentioned axis deviation. The axis deviation is detected by using measurement data (referred to in the following as the first measurement data) concerning the position and/or the velocity of an object obtained by the measurements executed by the measurement device <b>1</b>. Data expressing the behavior of the local vehicle <b>50</b>, obtained by the measurements executed by the sensor unit <b>30</b>, are referred to in the following as the second measurement data. The control unit <b>10</b> detects axis deviation detection based on the first measurement data and second measurement data, which are obtained by measurements performed when the travel locus of the local vehicle <b>50</b> is a predetermined specific travel locus (also referred to in the following as a specific travel period).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">The control unit <b>10</b> corrects the first measurement data by using a method corresponding to the case in which the travel locus of the local vehicle <b>50</b> is the specific travel locus, and thereby generates first data based on the corrected first measurement data, expressing values relating to the position and/or velocity of a stationary object. Furthermore, based on the second measurement data, the control unit <b>10</b> generates second data, expressing values relating to the position and/or velocity of the stationary object. The control unit then <b>10</b> detects the axis deviation by comparing the first data and the second data.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In the present embodiment the specific travel locus is, as an example, a curve which has a radius of curvature within a predetermined range, and which curves in a single direction. The first and second data express, as an example, the angle (hereinafter, also referred to as the vector angle), relative to the y-axis, of the motion direction of a stationary object with respect to the local vehicle <b>50</b>. &#x3b8;<b>1</b> and &#x3b8;<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> correspond to vector angles. However, it would be equally possible for the first and second data to express values other than vector angles.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">3. Axis Deviation Detection Process</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0034">An axis deviation detection process for detecting an axis deviation in the measurement device <b>1</b> will next be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In this process, within each of respective periodically occurring intervals referred to as pre-learning periods, amounts of axis deviation of a stationary object are successively obtained, and the total of the amounts of deviation obtained in a pre-learning period is calculated as a pre-learning value designated as &#x201c;sum&#x201d;. If it is found that the travel locus of the local vehicle during the pre-learning period was a specific travel locus, the pre-learning value sum is added to a learning value &#x201c;SUM&#x201d;. That is, the value SUM corresponds to a total of amounts of axis deviation of stationary objects in a specific travel period. This process is periodically executed at intervals of Tm s by the control unit <b>10</b> of the measurement device <b>1</b>, which functions as an axis deviation detection device <b>1</b>, while the local vehicle <b>50</b> is traveling.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In S<b>100</b>, the control unit <b>10</b> controls the radar device <b>20</b> to measure the position and/or velocity of each of one or more objects that are ahead of the local vehicle <b>50</b>, to obtain first measurement data for each object. Specifically, the control unit <b>10</b> performs object tracking by an &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker based on values of the vehicle velocity and yaw rate of the local vehicle <b>50</b>, newly obtained by the sensor unit <b>30</b>, and on data obtained from the radar device <b>20</b>. First measurement data are thereby generated, which express, with respect to the local vehicle <b>50</b>, the position (s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>) in the xy coordinate plane and the relative velocity vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) of each of one or more objects that are ahead of the local vehicle <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">It should be noted that it would be equally possible, for example, to measure only the velocity vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) of a stationary object as the first measurement data. In such a case, the control unit <b>10</b> could calculate the position (s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>) of the stationary object based on measurements of the velocity vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) of the stationary object over a certain period of time, then use the calculated position in processing for detecting the axis deviation. Alternatively, it would be possible to measure only the position of the stationary object (s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>) as the first measurement data. In such a case, the control unit <b>10</b> could calculate the velocity vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) of the stationary object based on measurements of the position (s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>) of the stationary object over a certain period of time, then use the calculated velocity vector in processing for detecting the axis deviation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In S<b>105</b>, the control unit <b>10</b> measures the vehicle velocity and yaw rate of the local vehicle <b>50</b> by the sensor unit <b>30</b>.

Effects</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0073">The following effects are obtained with the above embodiment.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0074">(1) A deviation of the central axis <b>62</b> is detected by using first data and second data. These are respectively based on first measurement data and second measurement data, which are obtained in the case in which the local vehicle <b>50</b> is traveling along a specific travel locus. The first measurement data are obtained using radar waves, and the second measurement data are obtained using the sensor unit <b>30</b>. In generating the first data, the first measurement data are corrected by a method corresponding to the specific travel locus, for thereby suppressing an error that is generated due to the travel of the local vehicle <b>50</b> along the specific travel locus. Thus, the deviation of the central axis <b>62</b> is detected by using first data whose accuracy has been improved by the correction. It is thus possible to improve the accuracy of detecting an axis deviation in the measurement device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0075">(2) Furthermore, the first data and second data express respective vector angles.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0076">The axis deviation amount &#x3b8;<sub>gap </sub>is calculated from the difference between the vector angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> expressed by the first data and the vector angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> expressed by the second data. The amount of axis deviation can thus be suitably detected.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0077">(3) The specific travel locus is a curve having a radius of curvature R that is within a predetermined range, and steady-state error correction values ve<sub>x </sub>and ve<sub>y </sub>are calculated based on the centripetal acceleration a that is produced in the stationary object <b>70</b> when the local vehicle <b>50</b> travels along the curve. The vector angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> is calculated from the first data after the velocity vector (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) of the stationary object <b>70</b>, which constitutes the first measurement data, has been corrected by the correction values. Therefore, for example, even when the local vehicle <b>50</b> travels at the entrance or exit of a curve and the rate of yaw becomes large, it is possible to improve the accuracy of detecting the amount of deviation.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0078">(4) Furthermore, the first measurement data are generated through tracking by an &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker, and the correction values ve<sub>x </sub>and ve<sub>y </sub>for the steady-state error are calculated based on the constants &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; in the &#x3b1;&#x3b2; tracker. The accuracy of the vector angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b>, constituting the first data, can thus be improved.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0079">(5) Furthermore, the second measurement data express the yaw rate and vehicle velocity of the local vehicle <b>50</b>.

In that case, as in the above embodiment, the axis deviation detection device <b>1</b> can correct the first measurement data by a method corresponding to the specific linearly extending travel locus, to generate the first data, and the axis deviation can then be detected by comparing the first data and the second data.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0088">(4) A plurality of functions possessed by a single component in the above embodiment may be realized by a plurality of components, or a single function possessed by a single component may be realized by a plurality of components.
