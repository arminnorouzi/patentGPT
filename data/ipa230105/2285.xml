Multilayer electronic components, such as multilayer circuit boards, multilayer coils, and multilayer ceramic capacitors, have been widely used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0003">Multilayer ceramic capacitors are typically produced through the following steps.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0004">First, a plasticizer, a dispersant, and the like are added to a solution of a binder resin such as a polyvinyl butyral resin or a poly(meth)acrylate resin in an organic solvent. Ceramic raw material powder is then added and uniformly mixed in a mixer such as a bead mill or a ball mill and deaerated, whereby a ceramic slurry composition having a specific viscosity is obtained. This slurry composition is cast on a surface of a support such as a release-treated polyethylene terephthalate film or a SUS plate using a doctor blade, a reverse roll coater, or the like. The slurry composition is subjected to heating or the like to remove the organic solvent and other volatile components, and then separated from the support to give a ceramic green sheet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0005">Next, the obtained ceramic green sheet is screen-printed with a conductive paste that is to serve as an internal electrode. Sheets obtained in this manner are stacked such that the ceramic green sheets and the conductive paste layers alternate with each other, and thermally pressure-bonded to produce a laminate. The obtained laminate is subjected to a treatment called debinding, that is, a treatment to remove components such as the binder resin component in the laminate by heat decomposition. The laminate is then fired to produce a ceramic sintered body, and external electrodes are sintered to the end surfaces of the ceramic sintered body. Through these steps, a multilayer ceramic capacitor is obtained.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0006">Polyvinyl acetal resins used for producing ceramic green sheets are typically used as solutions in organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, alcohol, and mixtures of these. However, conventional polyvinyl acetal resins may leave trace amounts of undissolved matter when dissolved in organic solvents. Such undissolved matter present in solutions used in multilayer ceramic capacitors tends to cause voids in the debinding step and the firing step or lowers the dispersibility of ceramic powder and the like, thus lowering the electrical characteristics of the resulting products.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">Thus, using a polyvinyl acetal resin in a ceramic green sheet application requires removal of undissolved matter by a filtration step after mixing the polyvinyl acetal resin with organic/inorganic compounds and the like and dissolving them in an organic solvent.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">In response to this, Patent Literature 1 proposes a polyvinyl acetal resin, wherein the rate of decrease in filtration flow rate is lower than 10% when a 5% by weight solution of the polyvinyl acetal resin in a 1:1 solvent mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and/or toluene and ethanol is filtrated using a 5-&#x3bc;m-aperture filter at a filtration temperature of 25&#xb0; C. and a filtration pressure of 10 mmHg. Patent Literature 1 also teaches that using such a polyvinyl acetal resin can improve productivity because such a resin leaves less undissolved matter when dissolved in an organic solvent and thus can shorten the filtration time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1: JP 2005-325342 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0010">Meanwhile, with the recent increase in functionality and reduction in size of electronic devices, multilayer ceramic capacitors having smaller size and larger capacity have been demanded.

However, even the polyvinyl acetal resin disclosed in Patent Literature 1 may leave finer undissolved matter that cannot be sufficiently removed, and may require filtration or the like to remove the undissolved matter, lowering productivity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">The present invention aims to provide a polyvinyl acetal resin which leaves less fine undissolved matter when dissolved in an organic solvent and thus can improve productivity particularly when used as a binder for a ceramic green sheet, and which can also provide a ceramic green sheet having excellent toughness and enables production of a highly reliable multilayer ceramic capacitor.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0012">The present invention relates to a polyvinyl acetal resin having: a wavenumber A (cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) of a peak within a range of 3,100 to 3,700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in an IR absorption spectrum measured using an infrared spectrophotometer; and a hydroxy group content (mol %), the wavenumber A of the peak and the hydroxy group content satisfying relations of the following formulas (1) and (2):</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[(3,470&#x2212;<i>A</i>)/Hydroxy group content]&#x2264;5.5&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(3,470&#x2212;<i>A</i>)&#x2264;185&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">wherein A is a wavenumber which is lower than 3,470 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and at which a transmittance a (%) satisfying [100&#x2212;(100&#x2212;X)/2] is exhibited, where X (%) is a minimum transmittance of the peak within the wavenumber range of 3,100 to 3,700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.
