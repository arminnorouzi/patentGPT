These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these compounds may not be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited, each is individually and collectively contemplated. Thus, is this example, each of the combinations A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed from disclosure of A, B, and C; D, E, and F; and the example combination A-D.

Definitions</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is understood that the disclosed method and compositions are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, and reagents described as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a vasodilator&#x201d; includes a plurality of such vasodilators, reference to &#x201c;the target site&#x201d; is a reference to one or more target sites and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, an &#x201c;alternating electric field&#x201d; or &#x201c;alternating electric fields&#x201d; refers to a very-low-intensity, directional, intermediate-frequency alternating electrical fields delivered to a subject, a sample obtained from a subject or to a specific location within a subject or patient (e.g. a target site). In some aspects, the alternating electrical field can be in a single direction or multiple directional. In some aspects, alternating electric fields can be delivered through two pairs of transducer arrays that generate perpendicular fields within the treated heart. For example, for the Optune&#x2122; system (an alternating electric fields delivery system) one pair of electrodes is located to the left and right (LR) of the heart, and the other pair of electrodes is located anterior and posterior (AP) to the heart. Cycling the field between these two directions (i.e., LR and AP) ensures that a maximal range of cell orientations is targeted. In some aspects, an alternating electric field can be referred to as Tumor Treating Field (TTF).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In-vivo and in-vitro studies show that the efficacy of alternating electric fields therapy increases as the intensity of the electrical field increases. Therefore, optimizing array placement on the area of a patient's target site to increase the intensity in the desired target site can be performed (e.g. with the Optune system). Array placement optimization may be performed by &#x201c;rule of thumb&#x201d; (e.g., placing the arrays on the target site as close to the desired region of the target site (e.g. cancer cells) as possible), measurements describing the geometry of the patient's target site dimensions. Measurements used as input may be derived from imaging data. Imaging data is intended to include any type of visual data, such as for example, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image data, x-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT) data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, positron emission tomography (PET) data, data that can be captured by an optical instrument (e.g., a photographic camera, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, an infrared camera, etc.), and the like. In certain implementations, image data may include 3D data obtained from or generated by a 3D scanner (e.g., point cloud data). Optimization can rely on an understanding of how the electrical field distributes within the head as a function of the positions of the array and, in some aspects, take account for variations in the electrical property distributions within the heads of different patients.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to the target of administration, e.g. an animal. Thus, the subject of the disclosed methods can be a vertebrate, such as a mammal. For example, the subject can be a human. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Subject can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;individual&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient.&#x201d; For example, the subject of administration can mean the recipient of the alternating electrical field.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; is a specific site or location within or present on a subject or patient.

In some aspects, a cell or population of cells include, but are not limited to, lung cells, brain cells, pancreatic cells, abdominal cells, ovarian cells, liver cells, colon cells, or kidney cells. In some aspects, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; can be a tumor target site.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By &#x201c;treat&#x201d; is meant to administer or apply a therapeutic, such as alternating electric fields, to a subject, such as a human or other mammal (for example, an animal model) in order to prevent or delay a worsening of the effects of a disease, disorder, or condition, or to partially or fully reverse the effects of the disease, disorder, or condition. In some aspects, the disease, disorder, or condition can be a cancer or circulatory condition. In some aspects, the subject is in need of treatment to increase circulation. In some aspects, the subject in need of treatment for cancer or for an increased susceptibility for developing cancer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">By &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; is meant to minimize the chance that a subject who has an increased susceptibility for developing a disease, disorder, or condition will develop the disease, disorder, or condition.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;administering&#x201d; and &#x201c;administration&#x201d; refer to any method of providing a therapeutic, such as a vasodilator to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to: oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition. In an aspect, the skilled person can determine an efficacious dose, an efficacious schedule, or an efficacious route of administration so as to treat a subject. In some aspects, administering comprises exposing or contacting. Thus, in some aspects, exposing a cancer cell to alternating electrical fields means administering alternating electrical fields to the cancer cell.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a therapeutic (e.g. vasodilator) is that amount of therapeutic which is sufficient to provide a beneficial effect to the subject to which the therapeutic is administered. The phrase &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an amount that is sufficient or effective to prevent or treat (delay or prevent the onset of, prevent the progression of, inhibit, decrease or reverse) a disease or condition, including alleviating symptoms of such diseases. An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a vasodilator is that amount sufficient to effectively increase the blood flow in a blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x201c;Optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event, circumstance, or material may or may not occur or be present, and that the description includes instances where the event, circumstance, or material occurs or is present and instances where it does not occur or is not present.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ranges may be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value.

Methods of Increasing Blood Circulation</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Increasing blood circulation, or blood flow, at a target site can be beneficial. For example, blood is known to dissipate heat via normal blood flow. Thus, if a treatment that can generate heat is administered to a target site, in can be beneficial to increase blood circulation at the target site to help move some of the heat out of the target site in order to allow for more treatment. In some aspects, blood circulation and blood flow can be used interchangeably. In some aspects, as used throughout, blood circulation and circulation can be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Disclosed are methods of increasing blood circulation at a target site of a subject comprising exposing a target site of the subject to an alternating electric field for a period of time, the alternating electric field having a frequency and field strength, and contacting the target site of the subject to a vasodilator, wherein the vasodilator increases blood circulation at the target site of the subject. In some aspects, disclosed are methods of increasing blood circulation at a target site of a subject comprising exposing a target site of the subject to an alternating electric field for a period of time, the alternating electric field having a frequency and field strength, and administering a vasodilator to the subject, wherein the vasodilator increases blood circulation at the target site of the subject. Such administration can be systemic or local (e.g. transdermal).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some aspects, the target site comprises a cancer cell. In some aspects, the cancer cell is a glioblastoma cell or lung metastatic carcinoma cell. In some aspects, the cancer cell can be any cancer cell.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some aspects, the target site is exposed to the alternating electric field and vasodilator simultaneously. In some aspects, the target site is exposed to the alternating electric field and vasodilator consecutively. For example, in some aspect, the target site is exposed to the alternating electric field prior to or after the target site is exposed to the vasodilator. In some aspects, consecutive exposure of the target site to both the alternating electric field and vasodilator can mean the exposure to each occurs within 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 minutes; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 hours; or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 days of each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some aspects, the vasodilator can be any agent (e.g. compound, peptide, nucleic acid) that opens, or dilates, blood vessels. The dilation of blood vessels can allow blood to flow more easily through the blood vessels. Thus, in some aspects, the vasodilator can be administered in a therapeutically effective amount to increase the flow of blood through blood vessels. In some aspects, the vasodilator can be administered systemically or locally (e.g. transdermal). In some aspects, the vasodilator is nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, minoxidil, or hydralazine. Examples of additional vasodilators that can be use include, but are not limited to, amrinone, arginine, bamethan sulphate, bencyclane fumarate, benfurodil hemisuccinate, benzyl nicotinate, buflomedil hydrochloride, buphenine hydrochloride, butalamine hydrochloride, cetiedil citrate, ciclonicate, cinepazide maleate, cyclandelate, di isopropylammonium dichloroacetate, ethyl nicotinate, hepronicate, hexyl nicotinate, ifenprodil tartrate, inositol nicotinate, isoxsuprine hydrochloride, kallidinogenase, methyl nicotinate, naftidrofuryl oxalate, nicametate citrate, niceritrol, nicoboxil, nicofuranose, nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinyl alcohol tartrate, nitric oxide, nonivamide, oxpentifylline, papaverine, papaveroline, pentifylline, peroxynitrite, pinacidil, pipratecol, propentofyltine, raubasine, suloctidil, teasuprine, thymoxamine hydrochloride, tocopherol nicotinate, tolazoline, xanthinol nicotinate, diazoxide, hydralazine, minoxidil, and sodium nitroprusside. Centrally acting agents include clonidine, quanaberz, and methyl dopa. Alpha adrenoceptor blocking agents include indoramin, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, and prazosin. Adrenergic neuron blocking agents include bedmidine, debrisoquine, and guanethidine. ACE inhibitors include benazepril, captopril, cilazapril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, and ramipril. Ganglion blocking agents include pentolinium and trimetaphan. Calcium channel blockers include amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, and verapamil. Prostaglandins including: prostacyclin, thrombuxane A2, leukotrienes, PGA, PGA1, PGA2, PGE1, PGE2, PGD, PGG, and PGH can also be used. Angiotensin II analogs can also be used and include saralasin. Other suitable vasodilators that can be used include nitroglycerin, labetalol, thrazide, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, <i>digitalis</i>, hydralazine, diazoxide, and sodium nitroprusside, derivatives of these and combinations of the foregoing. In some aspects, the disclosed vasodilators can be a single vasodilator or the combination of two or more vasodilators.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some aspects, the vasodilator can be administered using any of the routes of administration described throughout. In some aspects, the vasodilator can be administered intravenously or transdermally. In some aspect, contacting the target site of the subject to a vasodilator comprises transdermal administration of the vasodilator to the subject at the target site. In some aspects, contacting a target site of a subject to a vasodilator can occur by administering the vasodilator at a location other than the target site so long as the route of administration allows for vasodilation at the target site. For example, in some aspects, the vasodilator can be present in a gel, or similar form, used when applying the alternating electric field to a target site.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some aspects, the vasodilator can be a negative pressure environment that vasodilates the vasculature. For example, using a negative pressure device to create vasodilation can be used in the extremities of a subject.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects, the increase in blood circulation is 1% greater than circulation prior to exposure to the vasodilator. In some aspect, an increase in blood circulation is 1%, 5% or 10% greater than circulation prior to exposure to the vasodilator. The increase in circulation can be measured relative to circulation prior to treatment with a vasodilator or relative to circulation after treatment with a control formulation lacking a vasodilator. In some aspect, an increase in blood circulation can be measured using laser Doppler velocimetry, which typically outputs a voltage that is proportional to the velocity of cells moving through the blood.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some aspects, the target site is the subject's head, chest, or extremity.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some aspects, the temperature at the target site after exposing the target site to an alternating electric field is not increased compared to the temperature at the target site prior to exposure to the alternating electric field. In some aspects, no increase in temperature can include a temperature that remains within less than one degree difference from the temperature prior to the alternating electric field. Thus, in some aspects, the temperature at a target site after exposing the target site to an alternating electric field is maintained. In some aspects, the temperature at the target site after exposing the target site to an alternating electric field is decreased compared to the temperature at the target site prior to exposure to the alternating electric field. In some aspects, a decrease in temperature can include a one degree drop in temperature or more.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some aspects, the period of time, frequency or field strength of the alternating electrical field can be increased from a first exposure period of time, frequency or field strength of the alternating electrical field. For example, the vasodilators can maintain or decrease the temperature at the target site well enough to allow for an extended period of time for exposure to the alternating electrical field and/or to allow for increased frequency and/or field strength of the alternating electrical field over the exposure time period. The heat that could be caused by prolonged exposure to the alternating electrical field or exposure to the alternating electrical field at a frequency or field strength higher than normal can be dissipated by the vasodilator. Thus, in some aspects, treatment with alternating electrical fields can be altered when combined with a vasodilator.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">C.
