Front end portions of the load absorbing portions are respectively joined to rear end portions of side frames that are provided on both side portions of a rear floor in the vehicle width direction and that are extending in a front-rear direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a constitution, when a load (rear collision load) is applied from behind the vehicle to the rear portion of the vehicle, the bumper beam is firstly bent and deformed to receive the rear collision load. After that, the rear collision load that cannot be completely received by the bumper beam is transmitted to the load absorbing portions, and the load absorbing portions receive the rear collision load.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the above-described conventional technique, a transmission path of the rear collision load is limited to the vehicle width direction and the front-rear direction, and it is planar (two-dimensional). For this reason, it is difficult to efficiently absorb the rear collision load in the vehicle rear portion structure. Additionally, the rear collision load has to be absorbed at a planar position. Hence, there is a possibility that the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure increases in order to enhance the mechanical strength of the side frames and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, a vehicle rear portion structure, which is capable of efficiently absorbing the rear collision load, and the weight of which can be reduced, is provided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(1) A vehicle rear portion structure (for example, a vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> in an embodiment) according to one aspect of the present invention includes: a frame (for example, a rear side frame <b>18</b> in an embodiment) extending in a front-rear direction of a vehicle (for example, a vehicle <b>100</b> in an embodiment); a bumper beam (for example, a bumper beam <b>6</b> or <b>206</b> in an embodiment) disposed on a rear side of the frame; and a rear panel (for example, a rear panel <b>5</b> in an embodiment) provided between the frame and the bumper beam, in which the rear panel includes an upper structure (for example, a peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> in an embodiment) which is provided at an upper part of the bumper beam and which has a closed cross-sectional structure, and an upper portion (for example, an upper projection <b>26</b> or <b>226</b> in an embodiment) of the bumper beam is in contact with a lower surface (for example, a panel <b>16</b> in an embodiment) of the upper structure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the constitution as the above aspect (1), the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam is transmitted not only to the frame (in a planar manner) but also to the upper structure located above the bumper beam. That is, the load transmission path of the rear collision load becomes three-dimensional, and the rear collision load can be efficiently absorbed by the vehicle rear portion structure. The mechanical strength of the frame can be relaxed, because the rear collision load is not received only in a planar manner, and the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure can be reduced accordingly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The upper portion of the bumper beam is in contact with the lower surface of the upper structure, and thus the generation of a moment in the bumper beam can be prevented, when the rear collision load is applied to the bumper beam. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the parts to which the rear collision load is applied through the bumper beam can be relaxed, and furthermore, the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the rear collision load is received by the bumper beam without the generation of a moment, and the rear collision load is received by the upper structure with which the bumper beam is brought into contact. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the vehicle rear portion structure against the rear collision load can be sufficiently ensured.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) In the constitution in the above aspect (1), the bumper beam may be fastened and fixed with a bolt (for example, a bolt <b>30</b> in an embodiment) to be screwed into the rear panel from an inside of the bumper beam via the bumper beam.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the constitution as the above aspect (2), the bumper beam can be fastened and fixed to the rear panel without the provision, at the bumper beam, of a flange or the like for fixing the bumper beam to the rear panel. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the bumper beam from being insufficiently brought into contact with the rear panel due to the flange or the like that becomes a hindrance. Therefore, the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam can be efficiently transmitted to the rear panel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(3) In the constitution in the above aspect (1), the bumper beam may be fastened and fixed with a bolt (for example, a bolt <b>30</b> in an embodiment) to be screwed into the upper structure from an inside of the bumper beam through the bumper beam.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the constitution as the above aspect (3), the bumper beam can be fastened and fixed to the upper structure without the provision, at the bumper beam, of a flange or the like for fixing the bumper beam to the upper structure. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the bumper beam from being insufficiently brought into contact with the rear panel due to the flange or the like that becomes a hindrance. Therefore, the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam can be efficiently transmitted to the rear panel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(4) In the constitution in the above aspect (2) or (3), a hole (for example, a through hole <b>31</b> in an embodiment) may be defined in the bumper beam, and the bolt and a tool for fastening the bolt are insertable into the hole in a front-rear direction of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the constitution as the above aspect (4), without the provision, at the bumper beam, of a flange or the like, the bumper beam can be fastened and fixed to the frame and the upper structure with the bolt with certainty.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(5) In the constitution in the above aspect (1), a position of a rear end (for example, a rear vertical wall <b>25</b><i>b </i>or <b>224</b><i>b </i>in an embodiment) and a lower end (for example, a lower end portion <b>224</b><i>e </i>in an embodiment) of the bumper beam may be located lower than a position of a front end (for example, a front vertical wall <b>24</b><i>a </i>or <b>224</b><i>a </i>in an embodiment) and a lower end (for example, a lower end portion <b>224</b><i>d </i>in an embodiment) of the bumper beam.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the constitution as the above aspect (5), for example, even in a case where the height of the vehicle or the height of the floor panel provided on a front side of the bumper beam varies depending on the vehicle type, it becomes possible to receive the rear collision load with the bumper beam with certainty.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(6) In the constitution in the above aspect (1), a position of a front end (for example, a front vertical wall <b>24</b><i>a </i>or <b>224</b><i>a </i>in an embodiment) and a lower end (for example, a lower end portion <b>24</b><i>d </i>or <b>224</b><i>d </i>in an embodiment) of the bumper beam may be located upper than a position of a spare tire (for example, a spare tire <b>101</b> in an embodiment) disposed on a front side of the bumper beam.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With the constitution as the above aspect (6), when the spare tire is assembled into the vehicle, it is possible to prevent degradation in the assembling workability of the spare tire due to the bumper beam that becomes a hindrance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(7) The constitution in the above aspect (1) may further include a peripheral edge frame (for example, an upper peripheral edge frame <b>8</b>, a lower peripheral edge frame <b>9</b>, or a side peripheral edge frame <b>10</b> in an embodiment) that forms a rear opening (for example, a rear opening <b>4</b> in an embodiment) communicating a baggage compartment (for example, a trunk room <b>3</b> in an embodiment) provided at a rear portion of the vehicle and an outside of the vehicle, in which an upper portion of the rear panel may be coupled with the peripheral edge frame.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the constitution as the above aspect (7), the load applied to the bumper beam can be transmitted to the peripheral edge frame that forms the rear opening through the rear panel. Accordingly, the load transmission path of the rear collision load becomes further three-dimensional, and the rear collision load can be efficiently absorbed by the vehicle rear portion structure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(8) In the constitution in the above aspect (1), the bumper beam may include at least one closed cross-sectional structure (for example, a first closed cross-sectional structure <b>24</b>, a second closed cross-sectional structure <b>25</b>, or a closed cross-sectional structure <b>224</b> in an embodiment) including projections (for example, an upper projection <b>26</b> or <b>226</b> and a lower projection <b>27</b> in an embodiment) on up and down sides when viewed from a vehicle width direction of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With the constitution as the above aspect (8), the bumper beam can be easily bent and deformed while having the projections as starting points for crush. The projections are disposed on up and down sides, so that the bumper beam can be easily crushed by the rear collision load applied from the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(9) In the constitution in the above aspect (8), the bumper beam may include a plurality of the closed cross-sectional structures, and the plurality of the closed cross-sectional structures are disposed to be aligned in a front-rear direction of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, for example, in a case where the bumper beam is constituted by one closed cross-sectional structure, the width of the closed cross-sectional structure in the front-rear direction increases, accordingly. Therefore, when the rear collision load is applied and the bumper beam is crushed, a deformed amount of the bumper beam in the front-rear direction also increases. Furthermore, in order to absorb such a deformed amount, a deformed amount in the up-down direction of the projection also increases. In such a case, there is a high possibility that the deformed bumper beam comes into contact with members near the bumper beam and those nearby members are also damaged.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the other hand, as the above aspect (9), by constituting the bumper beam with a plurality of closed cross-sectional structures aligned in the front-rear direction, the deformed amount in the up-down direction when the bumper beam is crushed can be made as small as possible. Therefore, even when the bumper beam is crushed, damage to the members near the bumper beam can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">(10) The constitution in the above aspect (8) or (9) may further include a reinforcement plate (for example, a first reinforcement plate <b>28</b> or a second reinforcement plate <b>29</b> in an embodiment) provided inside the closed cross-sectional structure and extending in a direction intersecting a front-rear direction and an up-down direction, when viewed from the vehicle width direction of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the constitution as the above aspect (10), the mechanical strength of the bumper beam can be increased. Therefore, characteristics of absorbing the rear collision load by the bumper beam can be improved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an aspect of the present invention, the rear collision load can be efficiently absorbed by the vehicle rear portion structure. As a result, the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure can be reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an upper side of a vehicle rear portion structure in a first embodiment of the present invention, when viewed obliquely from a rear left side.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line II-II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a III portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a bumper beam in the first embodiment of the present invention, when viewed obliquely from a lower left side.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a front-rear direction and an up-down direction of a bumper beam in a second embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described, based on the drawings.

The rear collision load F<b>1</b> is also applied to the rear side frames <b>18</b> through the rear bumper, not illustrated. The rear bumper is long in the vehicle width direction. Hence, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> applied to the rear bumper is preferentially applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b> while being applied to the rear side frames <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The bumper beam <b>6</b> is constituted to be crushable by the rear collision load F<b>1</b>. Therefore, firstly, the bumper beam <b>6</b> receives the rear collision load F<b>1</b>, while the bumper beam <b>6</b> is being crushed. In other words, while the bumper beam <b>6</b> is being crushed, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is absorbed by the bumper beam <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Here, the bumper beam <b>6</b> includes two closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> aligned in the front-rear direction. The projections <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are formed at both end portions in the up-down direction of each of the closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. The upper projection <b>26</b> tapers upward, when viewed from the vehicle width direction. The lower projection <b>27</b> tapers downward, when viewed from the vehicle width direction. Therefore, when a load in the front-rear direction (the rear collision load F<b>1</b>) is applied to each of the closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, each of the projections <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> is easily bent while having the ridge portions <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>a </i>as starting points. More specifically, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to each of the projections <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, crushing of the bumper beam <b>6</b> is developed, while each of the ridge portions <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>a </i>is being displaced to escape outward in the up-down direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">On the other hand, the reinforcement plates <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are formed inside the bumper beam <b>6</b>. The mechanical strength of the bumper beam <b>6</b> is also ensured to some extent. Therefore, the bumper beam <b>6</b> is not easily crushed by a light load. The bumper beam <b>6</b> is crushed, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> somewhat larger than the light load is applied. Accordingly, the load absorbed by the bumper beam <b>6</b> is not limited to a light load, and a load somewhat larger than the light load is also easily absorbed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, the rear panel <b>5</b> is provided between the bumper beam <b>6</b> and the rear side frames <b>18</b>. The rear panel <b>5</b> includes the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> provided as an upper part and having a closed cross-sectional structure. The upper projection <b>26</b> of the bumper beam <b>6</b> overlaps (is in contact with) the panel <b>16</b> (the lower surface) of the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>.

Accordingly, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b> is transmitted to the pair of rear side frames <b>18</b> similarly to the rear collision load F<b>1</b> applied to the rear bumper. Then, these rear side frames <b>18</b> also receive the rear collision load F<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, while the bumper beam <b>6</b> is receiving the rear collision load F<b>1</b>, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is transmitted to the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. The peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> is a part (the lower peripheral edge frame <b>9</b>) of the peripheral edge frames <b>8</b> to <b>10</b> constituting the rear opening <b>4</b>. Then, an upper portion of the rear panel <b>5</b> is integrally molded with the panel <b>16</b> of the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. Therefore, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> that has been transmitted to the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> is transmitted to the peripheral edge frames <b>8</b> to <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is transmitted to the rear pillar <b>11</b> through the side peripheral edge frame <b>10</b> among the peripheral edge frames <b>8</b> to <b>10</b> (see a load F<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> has a closed cross-sectional structure, and thus, the mechanical strength can be increased, as compared with the bumper beam <b>6</b>. As a result, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b>, the forward displacement of the bumper beam <b>6</b> is restricted by the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. Therefore, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b>, the bumper beam <b>6</b> is actively crushed at first to absorb the rear collision load F<b>1</b>. After that, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is transmitted to the rear side frames <b>18</b> and the peripheral edge frames <b>8</b> to <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> transmitted to the rear panel <b>5</b> through the bumper beam <b>6</b> is also transmitted to the rear floor panel <b>17</b> disposed on a front side of the rear panel <b>5</b>. The rear floor panel <b>17</b> is constituted by a double panel structure <b>20</b> including the upper panel <b>21</b> and the lower panel <b>22</b> disposed to face each other in the up-down direction. Therefore, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> applied to the rear floor panel <b>17</b> is dispersed to the upper panel <b>21</b> and the lower panel <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A plurality of projecting strip portions <b>21</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>extending in the vehicle width direction are provided on the respective panels <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. These projecting strip portions <b>21</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>extend in the vehicle width direction. Accordingly, the mechanical strength against the load applied from the front-rear direction is weaker than the mechanical strength against the load applied from the vehicle width direction. Therefore, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to each of the panels <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, each of the panels <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is crushed to absorb the rear collision load F<b>1</b>. Then, transmission of the rear collision load F<b>1</b> to the front side of each of the panels <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is prevented as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this manner, the above-described vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> includes the pair of rear side frames <b>18</b>, the bumper beam <b>6</b> disposed on the rear side of the rear side frames <b>18</b>, and the rear panel <b>5</b> provided between the rear side frames <b>18</b> and the bumper beam <b>6</b>. The rear panel <b>5</b> includes the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> provided above the bumper beam <b>6</b>. The upper portion (the upper projection <b>26</b>) of the bumper beam <b>6</b> is in contact with the lower surface (the panel <b>16</b>) of the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. Therefore, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> that has been applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b> is transmitted to the rear side frames <b>18</b> (in a planar manner), and is also transmitted to the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> located above the bumper beam <b>6</b>. That is, the load transmission path of the rear collision load F<b>1</b> becomes three-dimensional, and the rear collision load F<b>1</b> can be efficiently absorbed by the vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b>. The mechanical strength of the rear side frames <b>18</b> can also be reduced, because the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is not received only in a planar manner, and the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> can be reduced accordingly.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The upper portion of the bumper beam <b>6</b> is in direct contact with the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the generation of a moment from in the bumper beam <b>6</b>, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b>. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the parts to which the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied through the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be relaxed, and furthermore, the weight of the vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is received by the bumper beam <b>6</b> without the generation of a moment, and the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is received by the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> with which the bumper beam <b>6</b> is brought into contact. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> against the rear collision load F<b>1</b> can be sufficiently ensured.

Not only the bolt <b>30</b> but also a tool, not illustrated, for fastening the bolt <b>30</b> are insertable into the through hole <b>31</b>. Therefore, the bumper beam <b>6</b> does not have to be provided with a flange or the like for fastening and fixing the bumper beam <b>6</b> to the rear panel <b>5</b> and the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b>. Then, the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be fastened and fixed to the rear panel <b>5</b> and the peripheral edge frame structure <b>15</b> with the bolts <b>30</b>.

Therefore, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> is applied to the bumper beam <b>6</b>, the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be easily crushed while having the ridge portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the upper projection <b>26</b> and the ridge portion <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the lower projection <b>27</b> as starting points of the crush.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, the bumper beam <b>6</b> is formed of the two closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, so that the deformed amount in the up-down direction when the bumper beam <b>6</b> is crushed can be made as small as possible. That is, for example, in a case where the bumper beam <b>6</b> is constituted by one closed cross-sectional structure, the width of the closed cross-sectional structure in the front-rear direction increases accordingly. Therefore, when the rear collision load is applied and the bumper beam <b>6</b> is crushed, the deformed amount of the bumper beam <b>6</b> in the front-rear direction also increases. Furthermore, in order to absorb such a deformed amount, the deformed amount in the up-down direction of each of the projections <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> also increases. In such a case, there is a high possibility that the deformed bumper beam <b>6</b> comes into contact with members near the bumper beam <b>6</b> and the peripheral member is also damaged.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the other hand, the bumper beam <b>6</b> is formed of the two closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, so that the deformed amount of deformation in the up-down direction when the bumper beam <b>6</b> is crushed can be made as small as possible.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore, even when the bumper beam <b>6</b> is crushed, damage to the members near the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The reinforcement plates <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> extending in a direction intersecting the front-rear direction and the up-down direction, when viewed from the vehicle width direction, are respectively provided inside the closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be increased. Accordingly, the bumper beam <b>6</b> is not easily crushed by a light load. The bumper beam <b>6</b> is made to crush, when the rear collision load F<b>1</b> somewhat larger than the light load is applied. Therefore, the absorption characteristics of the rear collision load F<b>1</b> by the bumper beam <b>6</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that in the above-described first embodiment, the description has been given for the case where the bumper beam <b>6</b> includes the two closed cross-sectional structures <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> aligned in the front-rear direction.
