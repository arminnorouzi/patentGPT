The present invention also relates to an associated articulated train.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the railway field, different configurations of articulated trains have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One known configuration is the articulated Jacobs bogie train. In this configuration, the Jacobs bogies are placed between two bodies so that the corresponding cars distribute their weight over half of each bogie. The pivot axis of each Jacobs bogie coincides with the inter-body joint axis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in order to accommodate four secondary suspensions, Jacobs bogies have a larger wheelbase (distance between the axles of this bogie) compared to conventional bogies, which reduces their ability to negotiate tight curves. In addition, Jacobs bogies are generally more difficult to motorise due to fit and space constraints in the gangway areas under which Jacobs bogies are placed. Finally, Jacobs bogies have the disadvantage of being more expensive than conventional bogies because of the doubled equipment, including four suspensions, two anti-roll devices (one for each body), possibly four vertical dampers and lifting systems to accommodate both bodies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another known configuration uses only conventional bogies with two secondary suspensions. In this configuration, a conventional bogie is arranged under the gangway area so that only one end of the body, the so-called carrying end, rests on the bogie. The adjacent body, i.e. the carried end, rests on the first body via an inter-body joint with a vertical axis. The bogie axis (pivot axis) and the inter-body joint axis are the same. To achieve this, the carrying end has its suspension supports cantilevered from the main structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such a configuration greatly complicates the end of the body, which leads to significant costs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is therefore a need for an articulated vehicle configuration capable of negotiating tight curves that is easier to implement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To this end, one object of the present description is a chain of semi-trailer vehicles,

The axle is, for example, located between 1 metre and 1.5 metres from the bogie axis (i.e. the articulation is between 0 and 1 to 1.5 metres from the bogie axis).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">Advantageously, the distance D is less than or equal to 450 mm in order to limit the overhang.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">Preferably, each trailer bogie <b>22</b> of a body <b>20</b> carrying an inter-body joint <b>50</b> is at least partly opposite said inter-body joint <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">Thus, each semi-trailer vehicle <b>14</b> comprises only three support points, namely:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0059">a first support point formed by the articulation of the preceding vehicle to which the semi-trailer vehicle <b>14</b> is articulated, and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0060">a second and a third support point, each formed by the secondary suspensions <b>39</b> of the trailer bogie <b>22</b> carrying the vehicle body <b>20</b> or the back-up suspensions <b>40</b> when the secondary suspensions <b>39</b> are defective.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0048" num="0061">The main vehicle <b>16</b> comprises a body <b>70</b>, two body <b>70</b> support bogies, so-called main bogies <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and at least one inter-body joint, called the inter-body joint <b>76</b>, carried by the body <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0062">Each main bogie <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> may or may not be motorised.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0063">Each main bogie <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> has a central pivot <b>80</b> defining a vertical pivot axis, the so-called bogie axis Z<sub>B</sub>.

Only the specific features of the first bogie <b>72</b> of the second embodiment are described in the following.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0078">The first bogie <b>72</b> comprises two first secondary suspensions <b>100</b> and a single central back-up suspension <b>102</b> (the only back-up suspension of the first bogie <b>72</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0079">The first secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are air suspensions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0080">Preferably, the secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are arranged laterally on either side of the central back-up suspension <b>102</b>. Preferably, the central back-up suspension <b>102</b> is arranged on the chassis <b>83</b> on the central longitudinal axis X<sub>B</sub>, which allows a better distribution of the vehicle weight on the first bogie <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0081">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the central back-up suspension <b>102</b> comprises two back-up elements <b>106</b> arranged on the central longitudinal axis X<sub>B </sub>on either side of the central pivot <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0082">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, each back-up element <b>106</b> comprises an elastic member <b>107</b>, an attachment plate <b>108</b> and a support element <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0083">The elastic member <b>107</b> has a spring function. The elastic member <b>107</b> is adapted to be attached, via the attachment plate <b>108</b>, either to the body <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or to the bogie.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0084">The support element <b>109</b> is attached on the opposite side to the elastic member <b>107</b>, i.e. is attached to the first bogie <b>72</b> when the elastic member <b>107</b> is attached to the body <b>20</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or is attached to the body <b>20</b> when the elastic member <b>107</b> is attached to the first bogie <b>72</b>. When the support element <b>109</b> is attached to the bogie, it is for example attached directly to the chassis <b>83</b> or to any element itself attached to the chassis <b>83</b>. For example, when the first bogie <b>72</b> is a motor bogie, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b></figref> and <b>6</b>, the support element <b>109</b> is attached to the motor <b>110</b>, which in turn is attached to the chassis <b>83</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0085">The support element <b>109</b> is preferably made of a material chosen to reduce the coefficient of friction and to have good anti-wear properties. The material of the support member <b>109</b> is, for example, a Teflon&#xae; coated metal or a nylon type polymer, such as Ertalon&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0086">An operating clearance <b>111</b> is present between the elastic member <b>107</b> and the support element <b>109</b>, which allows the corresponding secondary air suspension <b>100</b> to be the only one in operation when this secondary air suspension <b>100</b> is inflated (normal mode). In the event of damage (degraded mode), the secondary air suspension <b>100</b> is no longer active and the operating clearance <b>111</b> between the elastic member <b>107</b> and the support element <b>109</b> is filled so that the back-up element <b>106</b> replaces said secondary air suspension <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0087">Although the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> describes a central back-up suspension <b>102</b> with two back-up elements <b>106</b>, in one embodiment only one back-up element <b>106</b> is present. Such a back-up element <b>106</b> is, for example, arranged upstream or downstream of the central pivot <b>80</b> on the central longitudinal axis X<sub>B</sub>. However, an arrangement with two back-up elements <b>106</b> has the advantage of being more stable than an arrangement with only one back-up element <b>106</b>, and of distributing the forces over a doubled support surface.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0088">In another embodiment, the central back-up suspension <b>102</b> comprises a number of back-up elements <b>106</b> strictly greater than two. In this case, the back-up elements <b>106</b> are arranged around the central pivot <b>80</b> so that they form a single point of support.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0089">In another embodiment, the central back-up suspension <b>102</b> comprises an annular suspension. The annulus is attached to the centre pin <b>80</b>, i.e. the centre pin <b>80</b> passes through the hole in the annulus. Preferably, the annulus is made at least partly of elastomeric material. However, the previous configuration with members <b>106</b> is easier to access in the case of maintenance operations, as the members <b>106</b> are arranged on either side of the central pivot <b>80</b>, and are not inserted on the central pivot <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0090">Advantageously, the first bogie <b>72</b> has no anti-roll system.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0091">Thus, in this configuration, the first bogie <b>72</b> only defines a support point (the central back-up suspension <b>102</b>) when at least the secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are dysfunctional. Thus, the first bogie <b>72</b> and the second bogie <b>74</b> define three support points for the body <b>70</b> of the main vehicle <b>16</b> when at least the secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are dysfunctional.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0092">Advantageously, the secondary suspensions <b>100</b> of the first bogie <b>72</b> are pneumatically connected to each other, for example, by a pneumatic hose or tube. The secondary suspensions <b>100</b> therefore have approximately the same air pressure under normal operating conditions. In such a case, the first bogie <b>72</b> and the second bogie <b>74</b> also define only three support points for the body <b>70</b> of the main vehicle <b>16</b> when the secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are functional.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0093">The secondary suspensions <b>100</b> are for example supplied via a control component. The control component is suitable for regulating the air pressure in the secondary suspensions <b>100</b>, in particular as a function of the load on the body <b>70</b> supported by the first bogie <b>72</b>. Such a control component allows inflation (injection of air from an air compressor) or deflation (venting to the outside&#x2014;ambient air).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0094">Preferably, the control component is arranged on or in the chassis <b>83</b> on the central longitudinal axis X<sub>B</sub>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0095">The control component is, for example, a levelling valve. The levelling valve is, for example, mechanically operated.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0096">In another example, the control component is a solenoid valve. The solenoid valve is, for example, controlled by a position sensor measuring the distance between the first bogie <b>72</b> and the body <b>70</b>. Thus, in addition to the advantages conferred by the first embodiment, the second embodiment allows the body <b>70</b> of the main vehicle <b>16</b> to be supported by three support points at least in back-up operation, and advantageously also in normal operation. Such a three-point support configuration is called isostatic. A three-point support is particularly suitable for driving on lanes with geometric defects, especially long or short lane lefts, thus improving vehicle safety. In particular, with such a configuration, the effects of body twisting and wheel unloading are reduced.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0097">In addition, when the first bogie <b>72</b> has no anti-roll system, the body <b>70</b> is held in roll only by the second bogie <b>74</b>, which limits the twisting of the body <b>70</b> and facilitates passage on tracks with geometric defects.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0098">The skilled person will appreciate that the above-described embodiments and variants can be combined to form new embodiments, provided that they are technically compatible.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
