to a method for the butt-welding of at least two metal sheets.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">WO 2008/138973 A1 discloses a method for producing tailored blanks from metal sheets to be butt-joined by welding, wherein at least two combined laser cutting and welding heads, which are borne by at least two independent arms each assigned to independent units of the feed apparatus, are displaced simultaneously along the edges, which are to be produced for the butt joint, of the metal sheets held by a workpiece carrier and trim the edges, and after the metal sheets have been brought together to form the butt joint and the metal sheets have been held by the workpiece carrier, the two combined laser cutting and welding heads are displaced simultaneously along the produced edges, forming the butt joint, of the metal sheets held by the workpiece carrier and produce the weld seam in various, successive portions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to develop a method for the butt-welding of at least two metal sheets, the method ensuring a high quality of the welded connections generated and making it possible to produce tailored blanks with little technical outlay and thus in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method according to the present invention for the butt-welding of at least two metal sheets, namely a first metal sheet and a second metal sheet, from which, in particular, a tailored blank is produced, provides<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">that, in a first method step, the first metal sheet is fixed in a first clamping device and the second metal sheet is fixed in a second clamping device,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">that, in a second method step, a first edge to be welded is produced on the first metal sheet by means of laser cutting,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">that, in a third method step, a second edge to be welded is produced on the second metal sheet by means of laser cutting,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">that the second and the third method step are, in particular, carried out in succession or at the same time,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0010">that, in a fourth method step, the first metal sheet and the second metal sheet are positioned relative to one another for carrying out a joining process for joining,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0011">that, in a fifth method step, the two metal sheets are joined along an abutting region, formed by the two edges, by means of laser welding,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0012">that, in the fourth method step, the first metal sheet and the second metal sheet are positioned relative to one another, in each case while maintaining a preload brought about by the fixing produced in the first method step, either by moving the first clamping device or by moving the second clamping device or by moving the first clamping device and the second clamping device in such a way that the edge to be welded of the first metal sheet and the edge to be welded of the second metal sheet lie opposite one another so as to form a joint.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0013">By maintaining the preload, which both metal sheets have during the laser cutting due to a fixing by means of a fixing apparatus, for the laser welding, the edges to be welded of the two metal sheets retain their geometry in an exact manner, with the result that the edges to be welded fit together in an optimal manner. Correspondingly, the method according to the present invention avoids a situation in which deformation of the metal sheets and thus of the edges occurs after the laser cutting due to a change in the stress state of the metal sheets during the positioning of the metal sheets for the laser welding.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0014">Provision is also made for the second, the third and the fourth method step to be carried out in such a way that, prior to the fifth method step, a groove is formed between the first edge to be welded and the second edge to be welded. This makes it possible to produce a weld seam, generated by the laser welding, in a surface-flush manner, such that undesired protrusion of the weld seam is avoided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0015">Provision is furthermore made for the groove to be in the form of a V groove or in the form of a Y groove or in the form of an HV groove or in the form of an HY groove. In this way, the selection of the shape of the groove can be adapted to the respective combinations of material and thickness of the metal sheets.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0016">It is also provided that, during the second method step, the first edge to be welded is prepared by means of laser cutting in such a way that, after the laser cutting, an angle &#x3e;90&#xb0; is enclosed between the first edge and a top side of the first metal sheet, the top side adjoining the first edge, and that, during the third method step, the second edge to be welded is prepared by means of laser cutting in such a way that, after the laser cutting, an angle &#x3e; or =90&#xb0; is enclosed between the second edge and a top side of the second metal sheet, the top side adjoining the second edge. This ensures that a groove with a V-shaped cross section is formed between the metal sheets after the cut edges have been pushed together, the groove serving as a receiving space for the melt volume and thus preventing formation of a protruding weld seam.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">It is furthermore provided that, after the fourth method step, the first metal sheet and the second metal sheet are oriented in such a way that a first cut surface generated at the first edge lies in a first plane and a second cut surface generated at the second edge lies in a second plane, wherein the first plane and the second plane intersect when a top side of the first metal sheet and a top side of the second metal sheet lie in a third plane or in a third plane and a fourth plane, which are oriented parallel to one another. In this way, a parallel orientation of the planes in which the edges lie is prevented and a receiving space for the melt volume is provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0018">Provision is also made for the second and the third method step to be carried out by means of laser beam cutting or by means of remote laser beam cutting (RLC) and for the fifth method step to be carried out by means of laser beam welding or by means of remote laser beam welding (RLW). In this way, a single remote laser is sufficient for cutting the first metal sheet and the second metal sheet and for welding the two metal sheets to one another. In this way, smaller movement travels are sufficient, since the remote laser can reposition the focal point as required.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">Provision is furthermore made for the second and the third and the fifth method step to be carried out using the same laser or using the same remote laser. In this way, the technical outlay for an apparatus for producing tailored blanks is lower than other apparatuses, since only one laser is required.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">Provision is also made for a spacing between the remote laser and the edge or edges to be welded of the metal sheets when the second, third and fifth method steps are being carried out to in each case be at least 200 mm and preferably at least 300 mm. In this way, metal sheets with spatially curved portions can also be cut and welded in a more effective manner, since the aforementioned spacing makes it possible to avoid collisions more easily.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0021">Provision is also made for the first metal sheet, in the region of its first edge to be welded, and/or the second metal sheet, in the region of its second edge to be welded, to be treated by laser ablation by means of the remote laser prior to the fifth method step and, in particular, prior to the second and third method step, respectively. This makes it possible to clean the metal sheets without any additional technical outlay, and thus the result of the welding process can be improved since no undesired substances pass into the melt bath.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">Furthermore, provision is also made for the metal sheets to be configured in terms of their number and shape in such a way that a tailored blank closed in a ring-shaped manner is produced by the method, wherein the tailored blank closed in a ring-shaped manner is produced, in particular, from at least six metal sheets. In order to produce tailored blanks with more than two weld seams, the method according to the present invention is either implemented multiple times or the individual method steps are effected in parallel with one another, the apparatus for producing tailored blanks is then correspondingly equipped with a multiplicity of remote lasers and a multiplicity of clamping devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">It is also provided that, in the fourth method step, the second metal sheet is positioned in relation to the first metal sheet either in such a way that, to produce a first variant of the tailored blank, a top side of the first metal sheet and a top side of the second metal sheet are brought into a first common plane and the groove is in this case formed in the direction of the top side of the second metal sheet, or in such a way that, to produce a second variant of the tailored blank, a bottom side of the first metal sheet and a bottom side of the second metal sheet are brought into a second common plane and the groove is in this case formed in the direction of the top side of the second metal sheet. In this way, it is possible, solely by way of a different positioning of the weld seam or a different orientation of the metal sheets, to produce &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; tailored blanks without a further apparatus for producing tailored blanks being required for this.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">Provision is furthermore made for a free volume of the groove to be predetermined in such a way that the free volume is filled by a weld seam, which is generated in the fifth method step, as far as an interface,<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0025">wherein the interface in the case of metal sheets whose top sides lie in a common plane is defined by this common plane, and wherein the groove is filled in such a way that a fill volume of the weld seam corresponds to the free volume of the groove, or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0026">wherein the interface in the case of metal sheets whose top sides lie at different levels is in the form of an interface which extends from the top side of the first metal sheet to the top side of the second metal sheet in a concavely curved manner, and wherein the groove is filled in such a way that a fill volume of the weld seam lies above the free volume of the groove.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0027">In this way, tailored blanks which meet the requirements in an optimal manner and which, in particular, also do not require any postprocessing in the region of their weld seam can be produced without additional manufacturing steps.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028">Provision is also made for a fill volume of the weld seam in the fifth method step to be increased by continuous feeding of a filler wire during the laser welding until the free volume of the groove is reached by the fill volume. In this way, it is possible for tailored blanks with greater free volumes of the groove to also be produced in such a way that the free volume is filled completely up to an upper limit and thus optimal cohesion of the metal sheets is ensured.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0029">Provision is furthermore made for a plurality of metal sheets to be connected to form a ring, wherein, for this purpose, these metal sheets are connected by a number of weld seams which corresponds to a number of the metal sheets. This makes it possible to produce ring-shaped tailored blanks in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">Provision is also made for the first edge to be welded and the second edge to be welded to each have a linear profile, such that a linearly running weld seam is formed by the welding. This makes it possible to produce areal tailored blanks in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">Provision is furthermore made for the first edge to be welded and the second edge to be welded to each have a two-dimensional, curved profile, such that a weld seam which runs in a two-dimensional, curved manner is formed by the welding.

The apparatus on which this method is carried out then comprises a corresponding number of clamping devices and, where appropriate, a number of laser devices which corresponds to the number of metal sheets. As an alternative, a laser device may also be provided which performs the laser cutting and laser welding of all the metal sheets and which is displaced correspondingly for this purpose, provision also being able to be made that, as an alternative or in addition, the clamping devices are displaced in order to bring the laser device and the metal sheets into position relative to one another. In such a method, to produce a component or tailored blank, a plurality of weld seams are then generated on the component or tailored blank by the same laser device. Such a method reduces the construction outlay for an apparatus for producing such components or tailored blanks considerably.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>8</b>C</figref>, method sequences for the efficient production of two embodiment variants of a further tailored blank are described.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0080">To this end, it is provided in the method described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>I</figref> that, in the fourth method step, a second metal sheet B<b>7</b> or B<b>8</b>, which has a smaller thickness than a first metal sheet A<b>7</b> or A<b>8</b>, respectively, is positioned in relation to the first metal sheet A<b>7</b> or A<b>8</b> either in such a way<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0081">that, to produce a first variant of a tailored blank T<b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, a top side <b>15</b>.<b>7</b> of the first metal sheet A<b>7</b> and a top side <b>16</b>.<b>7</b> of the second metal sheet B<b>7</b> are brought into a first common plane <b>17</b> after the laser cutting and a groove N<b>7</b> is in this case formed in the direction of the top side <b>16</b>.<b>7</b> of the second metal sheet B<b>7</b>, or in such a way</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0082">that, to produce a second variant of a tailored blank T<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, a bottom side <b>19</b>.<b>8</b> of a first metal sheet A<b>8</b> and a bottom side 20.8 of a second metal sheet B<b>8</b> are brought into a second common plane <b>18</b> and a groove N<b>8</b> is in this case formed in the direction of a top side <b>15</b>.<b>8</b> or <b>16</b>.<b>8</b> of the first or the second metal sheet B<b>8</b>, respectively.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0071" num="0083">In order to position the metal sheets A<b>7</b>, B<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b>, B<b>8</b>, respectively, relative to one another, at least one of the clamping devices (not illustrated) in which the metal sheets are clamped during all of the laser processing steps is additionally displaced in the above-mentioned third spatial direction z or z&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0084">In this case, laser cutting of the first metal sheet A<b>7</b> and of the second metal sheet B<b>7</b> so as to form edges <b>9</b>.<b>7</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>7</b> is effected in such a way that a Y seam is formed as weld seam <b>12</b>.<b>7</b> between the metal sheets A<b>7</b>, A<b>8</b> after the laser welding.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0085">In this case, laser cutting of the first metal sheet A<b>8</b> and of the second metal sheet B<b>8</b> so as to form edges <b>9</b>.<b>8</b> and <b>10</b>.<b>8</b> is effected in such a way that a V seam is formed in each case as weld seam <b>12</b>.<b>8</b> between the metal sheets A<b>8</b>, B<b>8</b> after the laser welding.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0086">In principle, it is provided for all embodiment variants of tailored blanks that&#x2014;as, for example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C and <b>8</b>C</figref>&#x2014;a free volume FV<b>7</b> or FV<b>8</b> of the groove N<b>7</b> or N<b>8</b>, respectively, is predetermined in such a way that the free volume is filled by the weld seam <b>12</b>.<b>7</b> or <b>12</b>.<b>8</b>, respectively, which is generated in the fifth method step, as far as an interface, wherein the interface is defined by the top side <b>16</b>.<b>7</b> or <b>16</b>.<b>8</b> of the thinner metal sheet B<b>7</b> or B<b>8</b>, respectively, of the metal sheets to be welded A<b>7</b>, B<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b>, B<b>8</b>, respectively, and wherein the groove N<b>7</b> or N<b>8</b> is filled in such a way that a fill volume FV<b>12</b>.<b>7</b> or FV<b>12</b>.<b>8</b> of the weld seam <b>12</b>.<b>7</b> or <b>12</b>.<b>8</b>, respectively, corresponds to the free volume FV<b>7</b> or FV<b>8</b> of the groove N<b>7</b> or N<b>8</b>, respectively.
