System <b>102</b> can comprise a memory <b>104</b>, a processor <b>106</b>, a trajectory determination component <b>108</b>, a collision avoidance component <b>110</b>, and/or a bus <b>112</b>. In various embodiments, one or more of the memory <b>104</b>, processor <b>106</b>, trajectory determination component <b>108</b>, collision avoidance component <b>110</b>, and/or bus <b>112</b>, can be communicatively or operably coupled to one another to perform one or more functions of the system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an embodiment, the trajectory determination component <b>108</b> can determine a trajectory of an adjacent-lane traveling vehicle traveling in a lane adjacent to a vehicle (e.g., a vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>). It is noted that the trajectory determination component <b>108</b> can determine the trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle when visibility of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle is impaired (e.g., to a driver of a vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>) by a succeeding vehicle traveling between the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle and the vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>. The trajectory determination component <b>108</b> can determine the trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle using a sensor or a combination of sensors (e.g., as later discussed herein). It is noted that the trajectory determination component <b>108</b> can determine the trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle by determining a current/instant trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle and/or front/rear wheel directions of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle, among other suitable information. The trajectory determination component <b>108</b> can further consider other relevant information when determining the trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle, such as distance to another vehicle, speed, acceleration, previous observed overtaking maneuvers, turn signal status (e.g., driver side blinking turn signal can indicate an intent to make a turn in that direction or change lanes in that direction), visual cues such as hand-signals, or other suitable information.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the collision avoidance component <b>110</b> can, in response to a trajectory of an adjacent-lane traveling vehicle being determined, by the trajectory determination component <b>108</b>, to prevent a safe lane change by the vehicle to the lane, initiate a collision avoidance action for the vehicle (e.g., the vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>). It is noted that a safe lane change can comprise a lane change with a minimal risk of a collision (e.g., as determined by the collision avoidance component <b>110</b> using the trajectory of the adjacent-lane traveling vehicle determined by the trajectory determination component <b>108</b> and/or a trajectory of the vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>, in addition to other suitable information). Such a risk can be compared to a defined collision risk threshold. A collision risk below such a threshold (e.g., as determined by the collision avoidance component <b>110</b>) can comprise an acceptable risk, and a collision risk above such a threshold can comprise unacceptable risk (e.g., adjacent-lane traveling vehicle preventing a safe lane change).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an embodiment, a collision avoidance action herein can comprise one or more of a variety of actions, depending on context conditions and/or vehicle capabilities or settings. For instance, such a collision avoidance action can comprise an audible or visual warning displayed in/on the vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the collision avoidance action can comprise haptic feedback (e.g., on a steering wheel of the vehicle comprising the system <b>102</b>.
