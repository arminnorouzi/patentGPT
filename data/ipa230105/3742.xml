FA significantly affect the day-to-day life of pediatric patients as they involve all common food staples and are responsible for potentially life-threatening reactions upon accidental exposures. Yet, the understanding of mechanisms involved in FA pathogenesis&#x2014;beyond the role of IgE&#x2014;remains limited. This knowledge gap is immediately reflected in the challenges routinely faced by clinicians in identifying individuals at risk for FA, in providing accurate diagnosis and prognosis, and, finally, in precisely establishing when clinical tolerance is acquired over time. FA diagnosis currently relies on skin prick testing and/or specific IgE measurement. These IgE-based methodologies may not reflect clinical disease in the absence of a clear history of reactions and are limited in their ability to predict the acquisition of future tolerance. The current recommendation for FA subjects is strict allergen avoidance, which impacts quality of life and, importantly, does not promote the acquisition of tolerance over time. Further, this approach does not aid in the prevention and/or treatment of a severe reaction to a food allergy, for example, anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">More accurate biomarkers of FA are strongly needed to identify individuals at risk of developing FA, to assist in the accurate diagnosis and monitoring of subjects with FA, and to predict those individuals who are likely to have outgrown their FA. Such biomarkers will also be helpful in predicting and/or identifying a subject at risk of having a severe reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to an allergy, e.g., a food allergy. The need is also strong for more specific therapeutic interventions that alter the course of the disease and help imparting long-term tolerance.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention is based, in part, on the finding that subjects having a food allergy, but not asthmatics or non-allergic controls, have increased concentrations of Resistin-like beta (RELM&#x3b2;) in their sera. RELM&#x3b2; is also increased in the sera and gut tissues of FA-prone Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice as compared to non FA-prone wild-type mice. Furthermore, RELM&#x3b2;-deficient Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice (Retnlb<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice) are protected from anaphylaxis when sensitized and orally challenged with food allergens. RELM&#x3b2;-deficiency also increased the frequencies of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells, an immune cell population critical for establishing oral immune tolerance to foods.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, one aspect described herein provides a method for identifying a subject at risk of having anaphylaxis, the method comprising: (a) obtaining a biological sample from a subject; (b) measuring the level of Resistin-like beta (RELM&#x3b2;) in the biological sample of (a); (c) comparing the level of (b) with a reference level, wherein a subject is identified as being at risk for anaphylaxis if the level of (b) is greater than a reference level; and, optionally, (d) administering to the subject identified as being at risk for anaphylaxis an anti-anaphylaxis therapeutic.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the anti-anaphylaxis therapeutic is an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2;. In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the anti-anaphylaxis therapeutic is a microbiota therapeutic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the method further comprises, prior to obtaining the biological sample, diagnosing a subject as having, or likely to develop, an allergy.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the method further comprises, prior to obtaining the biological sample, receiving the results of an assay that diagnoses a subject as having, or likely to develop, an allergy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the subject is selected from the group consisting of: a newborn, an infant, a toddler, a child, and an adult.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the allergy is a food allergy. Exemplary allergies, e.g., that may also result in anaphylaxis, include a drug allergy, an insect allergy, a latex allergy, a mold allergy, a pet allergy, and a pollen allergy. Exemplary food allergies include soy, wheat, eggs, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, mushrooms, stone fruits, and other fruits. In one embodiment of any aspect, the subject is allergic to one or more food allergens.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the agent is selected from the group consisting of: a small molecule, a compound, an antibody, a peptide, and an expression vector encoding an inhibitory nucleic acid or polypeptide. In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the antibody or antibody reagent is a humanized antibody or antibody reagent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the vector is non-integrative or integrative. Exemplary non-integrative vectors include, but are not limited to, an episomal vector, an EBNA1 vector, a minicircle vector, a non-integrative adenovirus, a non-integrative RNA, and a Sendai virus. In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the vector is a lentivirus vector.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the agent increases the population of ROR&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. For example, the population of ROR&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells is increased by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or more as compared to the population of ROR&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of any aspect provided herein, the agent reduces the level of RELM&#x3b2; by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more as compared to the level of RELM&#x3b2; prior to administration.

The term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of a food allergy (e.g., itching, gastric distress, or inflamed or constricted airway). Treatment is generally &#x201c;effective&#x201d; if one or more symptoms or clinical markers are reduced. Alternatively, treatment is &#x201c;effective&#x201d; if the progression of a disease is reduced or halted. That is, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; includes not just the improvement of symptoms or markers, but also a cessation of, or at least slowing of, progress or worsening of symptoms compared to what would be expected in the absence of treatment. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of one or more symptom(s), diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), and/or decreased mortality, whether detectable or undetectable.

In one aspect, it is understood that prevention can also mean that the disease is not established to the extent that occurs in untreated controls. For example, there can be a 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% reduction in the establishment of disease frequency relative to untreated controls.

That is, an immune response is generated in response to particular food antigens and can lead to hives, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, anaphylaxis and even death.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tolerance&#x201d; refers to the level of allergic response to a particular quantity of allergen.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; refers to a substance or substances alone or in combination that when introduced into the lymphatic system induces production of antibodies that bind to a fraction of the molecule or molecules.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, the term &#x201c;allergic reaction&#x201d; refers to any untoward response to an allergen.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;administering,&#x201d; refers to the placement of a therapeutic (e.g., an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2;) or pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial delivery of the agent to the subject. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising agents as disclosed herein can be administered by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment in the subject.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, &#x201c;transplanting&#x201d; refers to the placement of fecal matter, e.g. from a healthy subject, as described herein into a subject, by a method or route which results in at least partial localization of the introduced fecal matter at a desired site, such as the intestines or a region thereof, such that a desired effect(s) is produced (e.g., tolerance to a food allergen). The fecal matter can be administered by any appropriate route which results in delivery to a desired location in the subject where at least a portion of the delivered fecal matter remain viable. The period of viability of the fecal matter after administration to a subject can be as short as a few hours, e.g., twenty-four hours, to a few days, to as long as several years, i.e., long-term engraftment. In some embodiments, the fecal matter transplant is administered in the form of a suppository, pill, capsule, or the like. In some embodiments, the fecal matter transplant is administered orally, rectally, or enterically. In some embodiments, the fecal matter transplant is administered in the form of a liquid or solution. In some embodiments, the fecal matter transplant is administered using a colonoscopy, enema, or a plastic tube inserted through the nose into the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., stomach or intestines).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, a &#x201c;subject&#x201d; means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include, for example, chimpanzees, cynomolgus monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus. Rodents include, for example, mice, rats, woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters. Domestic and game animals include, for example, cows, horses, pigs, deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g., domestic cat, canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g., trout, catfish and salmon.

The terms, &#x201c;individual,&#x201d; &#x201c;patient&#x201d; and &#x201c;subject&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but is not limited to these examples. Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of disease e.g., an allergy or anaphylaxis. A subject can be male or female. A subject can be a newborn (e.g., birth to 2 months), an infant (e.g., 2 months to 1 year), a toddler (e.g., 1 year to 4 year), a child (e.g., less than 18 years of age), or an adult (e.g., greater than 18 years of age).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed with or identified as suffering from or having a disease or disorder in need of treatment (e.g., an allergy or anaphylaxis) or one or more complications related to such a disease or disorder, and optionally, have already undergone treatment for the disease or disorder or the one or more complications related to the disease or disorder. Alternatively, a subject can also be one who has not been previously diagnosed as having such disease or disorder (e.g., an allergy or anaphylaxis) or related complications. For example, a subject can be one who exhibits one or more risk factors for the disease or disorder or one or more complications related to the disease or disorder or a subject who does not exhibit risk factors. A &#x201c;subject in need&#x201d; of treatment for a particular condition can be a subject having that condition, diagnosed as having that condition, or at risk of developing that condition.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;agent&#x201d; as used herein means any compound or substance such as, but not limited to, a small molecule, nucleic acid, polypeptide, peptide, drug, ion, etc. An &#x201c;agent&#x201d; can be any chemical, entity or moiety, including without limitation synthetic and naturally-occurring proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous entities. In some embodiments, an agent is nucleic acid, nucleic acid analogues, proteins, antibodies, peptides, aptamers, oligomer of nucleic acids, amino acids, or carbohydrates including without limitation proteins, oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, glycoproteins, siRNAs, lipoproteins, aptamers, and modifications and combinations thereof etc. In certain embodiments, agents are small molecule having a chemical moiety.

The beneficial microbial cell to be administered can be live, dead, e.g., in a preserved state, such as dried. The microbial cell need not be viable to be beneficial. The bacterial cell can be administered as an intact, whole cell, or in pieces. Exemplary microbiota therapeutics include, but are not limited to a fecal matter transplant, a probiotic, a characterized microbial consortium, a single microbial strain or species, an engineered microbial strain or species, and a by-product of the microbial cell, such as a metabolite, e.g., indoxyl 3 sulfate (I3S), e.g., as described in PCT/US2019/060431, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, &#x201c;fecal matter transplant&#x201d; refers to a transfer of stool from a healthy donor, e.g., a donor not having or at risk of having a food allergy, to a gastrointestinal tract of a subject. Previous terms for the procedure include fecal bacteriotherapy, fecal transfusion, fecal transplant, stool transplant, fecal enema, and human probiotic infusion (HPI). Because the procedure involves the complete restoration of the entire fecal microbiota, not just a single agent or combination of agents, these terms have now been replaced by the new term fecal microbiota transplantation. Methods for performing a fecal matter transplant are known in the art, for example, performed by colonoscopy and less commonly by nasoduodenal tube. During colonoscopy, the colonoscope is advanced through the entire colon. As the colonoscope is withdrawn, the fecal matter obtained from the healthy donor is delivered through the colonoscopy into the subject's colon. Fecal matter samples can be prepared and administered in various forms, for example, a freeze dried sample, a fresh sample, a blended sample, or a diluted sample. Methods for preparation and administration of a fecal matter sample are further described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,192,361, 9,308,226, and 9,968,638; and International Patent Application No. WO2014152484 which are incorporated herein, in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As used herein, the term &#x201c;small molecule&#x201d; refers to a chemical agent which can include, but is not limited to, a peptide, a peptidomimetic, an amino acid, an amino acid analog, a polynucleotide, a polynucleotide analog, an aptamer, a nucleotide, a nucleotide analog, an organic or inorganic compound (e.g., including heterorganic and organometallic compounds) having a molecular weight less than about 10,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 5,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 1,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 500 grams per mole, and salts, esters, and other pharmaceutically acceptable forms of such compounds.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;protein&#x201d; and &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acids. A peptide is a relatively short polypeptide, typically between about 2 and 60 amino acids in length. Polypeptides used herein typically contain amino acids such as the 20 L-amino acids that are most commonly found in proteins. However, other amino acids and/or amino acid analogs known in the art can be used. One or more of the amino acids in a polypeptide may be modified, for example, by the addition of a chemical entity such as a carbohydrate group, a phosphate group, a fatty acid group, a linker for conjugation, functionalization, etc. A polypeptide that has a non-polypeptide moiety covalently or noncovalently associated therewith is still considered a &#x201c;polypeptide.&#x201d; Exemplary modifications include glycosylation and palmitoylation. Polypeptides can be purified from natural sources, produced using recombinant DNA technology or synthesized through chemical means such as conventional solid phase peptide synthesis, etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the various embodiments described herein, it is further contemplated that variants (naturally occurring or otherwise), alleles, homologs, conservatively modified variants, and/or conservative substitution variants of any of the particular polypeptides described are encompassed. As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a &#x201c;conservatively modified variant&#x201d; where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid and retains the desired activity of the polypeptide. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles consistent with the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A given amino acid can be replaced by a residue having similar physiochemical characteristics, e.g., substituting one aliphatic residue for another (such as Ile, Val, Leu, or Ala for one another), or substitution of one polar residue for another (such as between Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; or Gln and Asn). Other such conservative substitutions, e.g., substitutions of entire regions having similar hydrophobicity characteristics, are well known. Polypeptides comprising conservative amino acid substitutions can be tested in any one of the assays described herein to confirm that a desired activity, e.g. activity and specificity of a native or reference polypeptide is retained.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Amino acids can be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)): (1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M); (2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q); (3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E); (4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H). Alternatively, naturally occurring residues can be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile; (2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln; (3) acidic: Asp, Glu; (4) basic: His, Lys, Arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; (6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe. Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Particular conservative substitutions include, for example; Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gln or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gln into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gln; Ile into Leu or into Val; Leu into Ile or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gln or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into Ile; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into Ile or into Leu.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the polypeptide described herein (or a nucleic acid encoding such a polypeptide) can be a functional fragment of one of the amino acid sequences described herein. As used herein, a &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; is a fragment or segment of a peptide which retains at least 50% of the wild-type reference polypeptide's activity according to the assays described below herein. A functional fragment can comprise conservative substitutions of the sequences disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the polypeptide described herein can be a variant of a sequence described herein. In some embodiments, the variant is a conservatively modified variant. Conservative substitution variants can be obtained by mutations of native nucleotide sequences, for example. A &#x201c;variant,&#x201d; as referred to herein, is a polypeptide substantially homologous to a native or reference polypeptide, but which has an amino acid sequence different from that of the native or reference polypeptide because of one or a plurality of deletions, insertions or substitutions. Variant polypeptide-encoding DNA sequences encompass sequences that comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to a native or reference DNA sequence, but that encode a variant protein or fragment thereof that retains activity. A wide variety of PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis approaches are known in the art and can be applied by the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A variant amino acid or DNA sequence can be at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more, identical to a native or reference sequence. The degree of homology (percent identity) between a native and a mutant sequence can be determined, for example, by comparing the two sequences using freely available computer programs commonly employed for this purpose on the world wide web (e.g. BLASTp or BLASTn with default settings).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alterations of the native amino acid sequence can be accomplished by any of a number of techniques known to one of skill in the art. Mutations can be introduced, for example, at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides containing a mutant sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of the native sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an analog having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion. Alternatively, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis procedures can be employed to provide an altered nucleotide sequence having particular codons altered according to the substitution, deletion, or insertion required. Techniques for making such alterations are very well established and include, for example, those disclosed by Walder et al. (Gene 42:133, 1986); Bauer et al. (Gene 37:73, 1985); Craik (BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19); Smith et al. (Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Plenum Press, 1981); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the polypeptide also can be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) can be added to the polypeptide to improve its stability or facilitate oligomerization.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, the term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; refers to any molecule, preferably a polymeric molecule, incorporating units of ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid or an analog thereof. The nucleic acid can be either single-stranded or double-stranded. A single-stranded nucleic acid can be one nucleic acid strand of a denatured double-stranded DNA. Alternatively, it can be a single-stranded nucleic acid not derived from any double-stranded DNA. In one aspect, the nucleic acid can be DNA. In another aspect, the nucleic acid can be RNA. Suitable DNA can include, e.g., genomic DNA or cDNA. Suitable RNA can include, e.g., mRNA.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate, secreting proteins, including where applicable, but not limited to, for example, transcription, transcript processing, translation and protein folding, modification and processing. Expression can refer to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from a nucleic acid fragment or fragments of the invention and/or to the translation of mRNA into a polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the expression of a biomarker(s), target(s), or gene/polypeptide described herein is/are tissue-specific. In some embodiments, the expression of a biomarker(s), target(s), or gene/polypeptide described herein is/are global. In some embodiments, the expression of a biomarker(s), target(s), or gene/polypeptide described herein is systemic.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Expression products&#x201d; include RNA transcribed from a gene, and polypeptides obtained by translation of mRNA transcribed from a gene. The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; means the nucleic acid sequence which is transcribed (DNA) to RNA in vitro or in vivo when operably linked to appropriate regulatory sequences. The gene may or may not include regions preceding and following the coding region, e.g. 5&#x2032; untranslated (5&#x2032;UTR) or &#x201c;leader&#x201d; sequences and 3&#x2032; UTR or &#x201c;trailer&#x201d; sequences, as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Marker&#x201d; in the context of the present invention refers to an expression product, e.g., nucleic acid or polypeptide which is differentially present in a sample taken from subjects having a food allergy, as compared to a comparable sample taken from control subjects (e.g., a healthy subject). The term &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;marker.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the methods described herein relate to measuring, detecting, or determining the level of at least one marker. As used herein, the term &#x201c;detecting&#x201d; or &#x201c;measuring&#x201d; refers to observing a signal from, e.g. a probe, label, or target molecule to indicate the presence of an analyte in a sample. Any method known in the art for detecting a particular label moiety can be used for detection. Exemplary detection methods include, but are not limited to, spectroscopic, fluorescent, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical methods. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, measuring can be a quantitative observation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a polypeptide, nucleic acid, or cell as described herein can be engineered. As used herein, &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; refers to the aspect of having been manipulated by the hand of man. For example, a polypeptide is considered to be &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; when at least one aspect of the polypeptide, e.g., its sequence, has been manipulated by the hand of man to differ from the aspect as it exists in nature. As is common practice and is understood by those in the art, progeny of an engineered cell are typically still referred to as &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; even though the actual manipulation was performed on a prior entity.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; refers to a substance present in a cell other than its native source. The term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; when used herein can refer to a nucleic acid (e.g. a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide) or a polypeptide that has been introduced by a process involving the hand of man into a biological system such as a cell or organism in which it is not normally found and one wishes to introduce the nucleic acid or polypeptide into such a cell or organism. Alternatively, &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; can refer to a nucleic acid or a polypeptide that has been introduced by a process involving the hand of man into a biological system such as a cell or organism in which it is found in relatively low amounts and one wishes to increase the amount of the nucleic acid or polypeptide in the cell or organism, e.g., to create ectopic expression or levels. In contrast, the term &#x201c;endogenous&#x201d; refers to a substance that is native to the biological system or cell. As used herein, &#x201c;ectopic&#x201d; refers to a substance that is found in an unusual location and/or amount. An ectopic substance can be one that is normally found in a given cell, but at a much lower amount and/or at a different time.

FA subjects, but not asthmatics or non-allergic controls, have increased concentrations of RELM&#x3b2; in their sera. RELM&#x3b2; is also increased in the sera and gut tissues of FA-prone Il4raF709 mice as compared to non FA-prone wild-type mice. Furthermore, RELM&#x3b2;-deficient Il4raF709 mice (Retnlb<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>Il4raF709 mice) are protected from anaphylaxis when sensitized and orally challenged with food allergens. RELM&#x3b2;-deficiency also increased the frequencies of ROR-&#x3b3;t+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, an immune cell population critical for establishing oral immune tolerance to foods. Data presented herein establish the feasibility of targeting the RELM&#x3b2; pathway in the prevention of anaphylaxis in a subject having an allergy, and the boosting of oral immune tolerance to an allergen.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to an allergen that a subject is allergic to, such as a food allergy or bee sting.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Anaphylaxis causes immune system to release a flood of chemicals, which induces shock. The release of chemicals is triggered by an interaction between an allergic antibody (IgE) and the allergen. Common symptoms of anaphylaxis include, but are not limited to, a rapid drop in blood pressure (hypotension), constricted airway, a swollen tongue, wheezing and difficulty breathing, rapid and weak pulse, a skin reaction (such as hives and itching and flushed or pale skin), nausea and vomiting, dizziness or fainting, and death. Allergens that commonly trigger anaphylaxis include certain foods, some medications, insect venom and latex. Symptoms are commonly apparent within seconds to minutes of exposure to the allergen, and less commonly, within hours of exposure to the allergen. Up to 20 percent of subjects have a second wave of symptoms hours or days after their initial symptoms have subsided; this is called biphasic anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">One skilled in the art can diagnose a subject as having anaphylaxis by determining if the subject has elevated levels of the enzyme, tryptase, in a blood sample taken from the subject. Tryptase is elevated in the blood for at least 3 hours following anaphylaxis. Current treatments for anaphylaxis include, but are not limited to, Epinephrine (adrenaline, EpiPen&#xae;), supplemental oxygen, intravenous (IV) antihistamines and cortisone, and a beta-agonist (such as albuterol). There are currently no know methods for accurately predicting the severity of anaphylaxis, i.e., would the anaphylaxis episode result in mild symptoms or death. Previous reactions to an allergen is not a reliable predictor as to whether a subject with develop anaphylaxis, or the severity of an anaphylaxis episode.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Treating or Preventing Anaphylaxis</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Provided herein is a method for identifying a subject at risk of having anaphylaxis comprising: (a) obtaining a biological sample from a subject; (b) measuring the level of Resistin-like beta (RELM&#x3b2;) in the biological sample of (a); (c) comparing the level of (b) with a reference level, wherein a subject is identified as being at risk for anaphylaxis if the level of (b) is greater than a reference level; and, optionally, (d) administering to the subject identified as being at risk for anaphylaxis an anti-anaphylaxis therapeutic.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, the level of RELM&#x3b2; is increased by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or more, or at least 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 5&#xd7;, 6&#xd7;, 7&#xd7;, 8&#xd7;, 9&#xd7;, or more as compared to the reference level as compared to the reference level. As used herein, the &#x201c;reference level&#x201d; refers to the level of RELM&#x3b2; in a healthy subject, e.g., not having an allergy and/or at risk of having anaphylaxis. One skilled in the art can assess the mRNA or protein level of RELM&#x3b2;, e.g., in a biological sample, using PCR-based assays or Westernblotting, respectively.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment, the anti-anaphylaxis agent is an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; levels, for example, by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or more as compared to a reference level. As used herein, &#x201c;reference level&#x201d; refers to the RELM&#x3b2; levels prior to administration of the agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; levels, or the RELM&#x3b2; level in a subject having an allergy and/or anaphylaxis, or at risk of having allergy and/or anaphylaxis. One skilled in the art can assess the mRNA or protein level of RELM&#x3b2;, e.g., in a biological sample, using PCR-based assays or Westernblotting, respectively.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, the anti-anaphylaxis agent is a microbial therapeutic, for example, a fecal matter transplant, wherein the fecal matter is obtained from a healthy subject. In one embodiment, the agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; is co-administered with a microbial therapeutic.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, the method further comprises, prior to obtaining the biological sample, diagnosing a subject as having, or likely to develop, an allergy, i.e., a reaction to an allergen. In one embodiment, the method further comprises, prior to obtaining the biological sample, receiving the results of an assay that diagnoses a subject as having, or likely to develop, an allergy, i.e., a reaction to an allergen. Methods and assays for diagnosing a food allergy include, but are not limited to a complete family history of allergic disease, a blood test, for example, ImmunoCAP test), and/or a skin prick food allergy test that indicates if a subject has food-specific IgE antibodies. These assays are commonly known in the art and can be executed by a skilled clinician.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Examples of naturally occurring allergens include pollen allergens (tree, weed, herb and grass pollen allergens), mite allergens (from e.g. house dust mites and storage mites), insect allergens (inhalant, saliva- and venom origin allergens), animal allergens from e.g. saliva, hair and dander from e.g. dog, cat, horse, rat, mouse, etc., fungi allergens and food allergens.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Important pollen allergens from trees, grasses and herbs are such originating from the taxonomic orders of Fagales, Oleales, Pinales and platanaceae including i.a. birch (<i>Betula</i>), alder (<i>Alnus</i>), hazel (<i>Corylus</i>), hornbeam (<i>Carpinus</i>), olive (<i>Olea</i>), cedar (<i>Cryptomeria </i>and <i>Juniperus</i>), Plane tree (<i>Platanus</i>), the order of Poales including i.a. grasses of the genera <i>Lolium, Phleum, Poa, Cynodon, Dactylis, Holcus, Phalaris, Secale</i>, and Sorghum and the orders of Asterales and Urticales including i.a. herbs of the genera <i>Ambrosia, Artemisia</i>, and <i>Parietaria</i>. Other important inhalation allergens are those from house dust mites of the genus <i>Dermatophagoides </i>and Euroglyphus, storage mite e.g Lepidoglyphys, Glycyphagus and Tyrophagus, those from cockroaches, midges and fleas e.g. Blatella, <i>Periplaneta</i>, Chironomus and Ctenocepphalides, and those from mammals such as cat, dog and horse, venom allergens including such originating from stinging or biting insects such as those from the taxonomic order of Hymenoptera including bees (superfamily Apidae), wasps (superfamily Vespidea), and ants (superfamily Formicoidae). Important inhalation allergens from fungi are i.a. such originating from the genera <i>Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus </i>and <i>Penicillium. </i></p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Examples of food allergens are allergens from wheat, crustacean food including shrimp, prawn, crab and lobster, fish, hen's eggs, peanut, soy, cows' milk, nuts such as almond, brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut and walnut, celery, mustard and sesame seed.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Examples of recombinant allergens include but are not limited to proteins/peptides from plant pollens, grass pollens, tree pollens, weed pollens, insect venom, dust and storage mite proteins, animal dander, saliva, fungal spores and food allergens (i.e., peanut, milk, gluten and egg) prepared using recombinant techniques. Recombinant allergens can be obtained e.g. on a large scale by using microbial expression systems that may be grown on fermenters, produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or chemical precursors or other chemicals when synthesized chemically.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, the allergy is a food allergy. As used herein, an &#x201c;food allergy&#x201d; refers to a failure of oral tolerance to food antigens associated with Th2 immunity and allergen-specific IgE responses. That is, an immune response is generated in response to particular food antigens. Food intolerance often presents with symptoms similar to a food allergy, but does not involve an immune response. The most common food allergies include, but are not limited to, allergies to cow's milk, soy, wheat, eggs, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, mushrooms, stone fruits, and other fruits. Food allergy affects an estimated 6 to 8 percent of children under age 3 and up to 3 percent of adults.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Common symptoms of food allergies include, but are not limited to, tingling or itching in the mouth; hives, itching or eczema; swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the body; wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing; abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting; dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. During severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis can occur, resulting in constriction and tightening of the airways; a swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe; shock with a severe drop in blood pressure; rapid pulse; and dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or even death.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment, the food allergy is pollen-food allergy syndrome. Pollen-food allergy syndrome, also known as oral allergy syndrome, affects many people who have hay fever. In this condition, certain fresh fruits and vegetables or nuts and spices can trigger an allergic reaction that causes the mouth to tingle or itch. In serious cases, the reaction results in swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis. Proteins in certain fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices cause the reaction because they're similar to allergy-causing proteins found in certain pollens. This is an example of cross-reactivity.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">A food allergy can be exercised-induced food allergy. Eating certain foods may cause some people to feel itchy and lightheaded soon after starting to exercise. Serious cases may even involve hives or anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment, an anti-anaphylaxis agent is administered as a prophylactic treatment to a subject at risk of developing an allergy, e.g., a food allergy, that is capable of resulting in anaphylaxis. Risk factors for developing a food allergy include, but are not limited to a family history of asthma, eczema, hives, food allergy or other allergies; having other allergies, for example, to hay, pet dander, or seasonal allergies; a young age (e.g., newborn, infant, toddler, or child); and having asthma</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Additional allergies capable of inducing anaphylaxis include, but are not limited to drug allergy, an insect allergy, a latex allergy, a mold allergy, a pet allergy, and a pollen allergy.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Additionally, provided herein is a method for treating or preventing the onset of anaphylaxis in a subject comprising administering an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; to a subject.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further provided herein is a method for inducing tolerance to an allergen in a subject, comprising administering an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; to a subject. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tolerance&#x201d; refers to the process of suppressing a portion of the immune system that recognizes an antigen as being foreign. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the term &#x201c;tolerance&#x201d; as used herein has the same meaning as &#x201c;immune tolerance&#x201d;. As used herein, the expression &#x201c;increasing tolerance&#x201d; or &#x201c;inducing tolerance&#x201d; means an increase in tolerance to an antigen relative to the tolerance to the antigen prior to application of the method of the invention. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;tolerance&#x201d; refers to the level of allergic response to a particular quantity of allergen. In some embodiments the tolerance can be oral tolerance and/or mucosal tolerance.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Provided herein is a method for reducing or eliminating a subject's immune reaction to an allergen, the method comprising administering an agent that inhibits RELM&#x3b2; to a subject. In one embodiment, the subject's immune reaction to an allergen is reduced by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or more as compared to an appropriate control. As used herein, an &#x201c;appropriate control&#x201d; refers to the subject's immune reaction to an allergen prior to administration, or the immune reaction to an allergen in a subject who has been diagnosed as having an allergen. Methods for measuring an immune reaction to a food allergen can be performed by a skilled clinician, and include, but are not limited to, identifying IgE antibodies produced by a subject following exposure to a food allergen. To identifying if an immune response is reduced or eliminated, one skilled in the art can, e.g., measure the level of IgE antibodies produced by a subject prior to and following administration of the agent or fecal matter transplant, compare the levels, and identify a subject as having a reduced or eliminated immune response if the level of IgE after administration is lower than the level prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, methods described herein further comprise, prior to administration, diagnosing a subject as having, or as being likely to develop, an allergy. In one embodiment, methods described herein further comprise, prior to administration, receiving the results of an assay that diagnoses a subject as having, or as being likely to develop, an allergy. Exemplary assays useful for diagnosing a subject as having or being at risk for having a food allergy are further described herein above.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In one embodiment, methods described herein further comprise, prior to administration, diagnosing a subject as having increased level of RELM&#x3b2; as compared to the reference level. In one embodiment, methods described herein further comprise, prior to administration, receiving the results of an assay that diagnoses a subject as having increased level of RELM&#x3b2; as compared to the reference level.

While RELM&#x3b2; and Resistin were initially described as hormones that can regulate responsiveness to insulin [29], RELM&#x3b2; has been subsequently found to be also involved in allergic inflammation and host defenses in the gut [30, 31]. RELM&#x3b2; is expressed in intestinal epithelia cells and predominantly in colonic goblet cells [32]. RELM&#x3b2; is induced by Th2 cytokines, as IL-4 and IL-13 can drive the differentiation of gut epithelial cells into RELM&#x3b2;-producing goblet cells resulting in protection by worm infection [31]. RELM&#x3b2; is upregulated during intestinal inflammation and plays a role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota [33, 34]. RELM&#x3b2;-KO mice show a higher proportion of organisms belonging to lactic acid bacterial species (such as L. gasseri and <i>L. reuteri</i>) and lower levels of Clostridia species (<i>Clostridium coccoides</i>) [35]. A recent study in a mucin-deficient mouse model of intestinal inflammation showed that RELM&#x3b2; drives colitis by depleting commensal microbes and promoting dysbiosis [36]. Recent evidence further suggests that RELM&#x3b2; promotes spatial segregation of the microbiota and colonic epithelium thus contributing to host-bacterial mutualism [37]. Finally, the inventors have observed that RELM&#x3b2;-KO mice have marked decrease in intestinal mast cell load, indicating that RELM&#x3b2; may be also involved in the regulation of mast cell responses in the gut.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Methods and compositions described herein require that the levels and/or activity of RELM&#x3b2; are inhibited.

The interaction between microRNA and mRNAs is mediated by what is known as the &#x201c;seed sequence&#x201d;, a 6-8-nucleotide region of the microRNA that directs sequence-specific binding to the mRNA through imperfect Watson-Crick base pairing. More than 900 microRNAs are known to be expressed in mammals. Many of these can be grouped into families on the basis of their seed sequence, thereby identifying a &#x201c;cluster&#x201d; of similar microRNAs.

This entails a decrease in the mRNA level in a cell for the target by at least about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, about 100% of the mRNA level found in the cell without the presence of the agent. In one preferred embodiment, the mRNA levels are decreased by at least about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, about 100%. One skilled in the art will be able to readily assess whether the siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA effectively downregulates RELM&#x3b2;, for example by transfecting the siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA into cells and detecting the levels of the mRNA or gene product found within the cell via PCR-based assays or western-blotting, respectively.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">The agent may be contained in and thus further include a vector. Many such vectors useful for transferring exogenous genes into target mammalian cells are available. The vectors may be episomal, e.g. plasmids, virus-derived vectors such cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, etc., or may be integrated into the target cell genome, through homologous recombination or random integration, e.g. retrovirus-derived vectors such as MMLV, HIV-1, ALV, etc. In some embodiments, combinations of retroviruses and an appropriate packaging cell line may also find use, where the capsid proteins will be functional for infecting the target cells, e.g., Treg cells, for example, that express ROR&#x3b3;t. Usually, the cells and virus will be incubated for at least about 24 hours in the culture medium. The cells are then allowed to grow in the culture medium for short intervals in some applications, e.g. 24-73 hours, or for at least two weeks, and may be allowed to grow for five weeks or more, before analysis. Commonly used retroviral vectors are &#x201c;defective&#x201d;, i.e. unable to produce viral proteins required for productive infection. Replication of the vector requires growth in the packaging cell line.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid construct designed for delivery to a host cell or for transfer between different host cells. As used herein, a vector can be viral or non-viral. The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; encompasses any genetic element that is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements and that can transfer gene sequences to cells. A vector can include, but is not limited to, a cloning vector, an expression vector, a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, artificial chromosome, virus, virion, etc.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150">As used herein, the term &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; refers to a vector that directs expression of an RNA or polypeptide from nucleic acid sequences contained therein linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences on the vector. The sequences expressed will often, but not necessarily, be heterologous to the cell. An expression vector may comprise additional elements, for example, the expression vector may have two replication systems, thus allowing it to be maintained in two organisms, for example in human cells for expression and in a prokaryotic host for cloning and amplification. The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate, secreting proteins, including where applicable, but not limited to, for example, transcription, transcript processing, translation and protein folding, modification and processing. &#x201c;Expression products&#x201d; include RNA transcribed from a gene, and polypeptides obtained by translation of mRNA transcribed from a gene. The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; means the nucleic acid sequence which is transcribed (DNA) to RNA in vitro or in vivo when operably linked to appropriate regulatory sequences. The gene may or may not include regions preceding and following the coding region, e.g. 5&#x2032; untranslated (5&#x2032;UTR) or &#x201c;leader&#x201d; sequences and 3&#x2032; UTR or &#x201c;trailer&#x201d; sequences, as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">Integrating vectors have their delivered RNA/DNA permanently incorporated into the host cell chromosomes. Non-integrating vectors remain episomal which means the nucleic acid contained therein is never integrated into the host cell chromosomes. Examples of integrating vectors include retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, hybrid adenoviral vectors, and herpes simplex viral vector.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">One example of a non-integrative vector is a non-integrative viral vector. Non-integrative viral vectors eliminate the risks posed by integrative retroviruses, as they do not incorporate their genome into the host DNA. One example is the Epstein Barr oriP/Nuclear Antigen-1 (&#x201c;EBNA1&#x201d;) vector, which is capable of limited self-replication and known to function in mammalian cells. As containing two elements from Epstein-Barr virus, oriP and EBNA1, binding of the EBNA1 protein to the virus replicon region oriP maintains a relatively long-term episomal presence of plasmids in mammalian cells. This particular feature of the oriP/EBNA1 vector makes it ideal for generation of integration-free iPSCs. Another non-integrative viral vector is adenoviral vector and the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">Another non-integrative viral vector is RNA Sendai viral vector, which can produce protein without entering the nucleus of an infected cell. The F-deficient Sendai virus vector remains in the cytoplasm of infected cells for a few passages, but is diluted out quickly and completely lost after several passages (e.g., 10 passages).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154">Another example of a non-integrative vector is a minicircle vector. Minicircle vectors are circularized vectors in which the plasmid backbone has been released leaving only the eukaryotic promoter and cDNA(s) that are to be expressed.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0155">As used herein, the term &#x201c;viral vector&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid vector construct that includes at least one element of viral origin and has the capacity to be packaged into a viral vector particle. The viral vector can contain a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide as described herein in place of non-essential viral genes. The vector and/or particle may be utilized for the purpose of transferring nucleic acids into cells either in vitro or in vivo. Numerous forms of viral vectors are known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Identifying a Subject at Risk</heading><p id="p-0159" num="0156">Certain aspects provided herein relate, in part, to the surprising finding that a subject having increased levels of RELM&#x3b2; are at greater risk of having anaphylaxis.

As used herein, &#x201c;alleviating at least one symptom of an allergy or anaphylaxis&#x201d; is ameliorating any condition or symptom associated with, e.g., an allergy or anaphylaxis (e.g., skin rash, digestive distress, constricted airway, inability to fully inflate/deflate lungs, or edema). As compared with an equivalent untreated control, such reduction is by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more as measured by any standard technique. A variety of means for administering the agents described herein to subjects are known to those of skill in the art.

In one embodiment, the agent is administered systemically or locally (e.g., to the lungs). In one embodiment, the agent is administered intravenously. In one embodiment, the agent is administered continuously, in intervals, or sporadically. The route of administration of the agent will be optimized for the type of agent being delivered (e.g., an antibody, a small molecule, an RNAi, a fecal transplant), and can be determined by a skilled practitioner. In some embodiments, the agent is administered orally, rectally, enterically, using a colonoscopy, using an enema, or using a plastic tube inserted through the nose into the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., stomach or intestines).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; as used herein refers to the amount of an agent can be administered to a subject having, diagnosed as having, or at risk of having an allergy or anaphylaxis needed to alleviate at least one or more symptom of, e.g., an allergy or anaphylaxis. The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; therefore refers to an amount of an agent that is sufficient to provide, e.g., a particular anti-anaphylaxis effect when administered to a typical subject. An effective amount as used herein, in various contexts, would also include an amount of an agent sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of, alter the course of a symptom of, or reverse a symptom of an allergy or anaphylaxis.

Examples include, without limitation: sterile water; water for injection USP; saline solution; glucose solution; aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to, sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose Injection, dextrose and sodium chloride injection, and lactated Ringer's injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Controlled and Delayed Release Dosage Forms</heading><p id="p-0189" num="0186">Conventional dosage forms generally provide rapid or immediate drug release from the formulation. Depending on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the drug, use of conventional dosage forms can lead to wide fluctuations in the concentrations of the drug in a patient's blood and other tissues. These fluctuations can impact a number of parameters, such as dose frequency, onset of action, duration of efficacy, maintenance of therapeutic blood levels, toxicity, side effects, and the like. Advantageously, controlled-release formulations can be used to control a drug's onset of action, duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular, controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of a drug is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and safety concerns, which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum therapeutic levels) as well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug. In some embodiments, the agent as described herein can be administered in a sustained release formulation.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, an agent is administered to a subject by controlled- or delayed-release means. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; 3) increased patient compliance; 4) usage of less total drug; 5) reduction in local or systemic side effects; 6) minimization of drug accumulation; 7) reduction in blood level fluctuations; 8) improvement in efficacy of treatment; 9) reduction of potentiation or loss of drug activity; and 10) improvement in speed of control of diseases or conditions. (Kim, Cherng-ju, Controlled Release Dosage Form Design, 2 (Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, Pa.: 2000)). Controlled-release formulations can be used to control a compound of formula (I)'s onset of action, duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular, controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of an agent is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and safety concerns, which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum therapeutic levels) as well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, ionic strength, osmotic pressure, temperature, enzymes, water, and other physiological conditions or compounds.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">A variety of known controlled- or extended-release dosage forms, formulations, and devices can be adapted for use with any agent described herein.

Allergic disorders are complex diseases that result from the interaction of multiple genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences [5]. Though allergic disorders are defined by their shared IgE mediated mechanisms, their markedly diverse clinical manifestations suggest that additional and unique factors are involved in shaping their heterogeneous phenotypical expression. The rapid increase in FA prevalence over the last few decades suggests a key contribution provided by environmental influences related to a modern lifestyle on genetically predisposed atopic individuals [13]. Several lifestyle factors have been identified that increase the risk of developing FA, including timing of exposure to food allergens [14], dietary habits [15] and microbial exposures [16-19]. The importance of timing of exposure to food allergens has been suggested by the failure of guidelines that delayed introduction of allergenic foods in children in halting the rise in FA [20] and confirmed by a seminal clinical trial of early peanut introduction which showed a marked decrease in the rate of peanut allergy in at-risk children fed peanut from infancy [21]. Among dietary factors, Vitamin D levels have been associated with increased risk of FA [22]. Finally, the observation that children raised and living on traditional farms have lower prevalence of allergies and asthma has suggested that colonization with certain microorganisms at mucosal surfaces can influence the developing immune system towards either tolerance or allergic inflammation (so called &#x201c;hygiene hypothesis&#x201d;) [16]. Indeed, multiple observational studies suggest that exposure to pet dogs [23], farm animals [24, 25], childcare attendance [18], older siblings in the family [18] and vaginal delivery [26] may protect against the development of atopic conditions, including FA. The concept that the microbiome plays a critical role in the development of atopic disease and FA is currently a focus of very active investigation. Overall these observations indicate an extensive network of environmental factors acting on predisposed individuals from early on in life. Understanding such contributions is key to achieve advances in the field of FA.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0248">Cutaneous food exposure. The dual-allergen exposure theory postulates that exposure to food allergens through the skin can lead to allergic sensitization, while consumption of these foods at an early age leads to oral tolerance [27]. The presence of atopic dermatitis&#x2014;with onset in the first months of life and requiring the use of topical steroids&#x2014;is a strong risk factor for the development of FA [28]. Being able to identify those infants with atopic dermatitis that go on to develop FA possibly through cutaneous food exposure would allow to apply preventative strategies that can significantly decrease the development of FA in at risk individuals.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0249">T regulatory cells play a crucial role in tolerogenic responses in the gut. T regulatory (Treg) cells play a central role in oral tolerance [38-42]. Impaired production and function of allergen-specific T regulatory (Treg) cells has been shown in FA [42]. The inventors have previously demonstrated that pathogenic Th2 reprogramming of Treg cells contributes to FA both in mice and humans [43]. The composition of the gut microbiome promotes the generation of mucosal ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells [44], which play a key role in suppressing FA and are decreased in FA in concomitance with the emergence of Th2 reprogrammed Treg cells [45].</p><p id="p-0204" num="0250">Metabolomic profiling can provide key insights into complex disorders. High-throughput &#x2212;omics technologies have emerged as powerful techniques to investigate complex diseases [46]. Situated downstream of the other &#x2212;omics technologies, metabolomics can provide a snapshot of the physiological state of a system with the closest association to the phenotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) [47]. The ability of metabolomic profiling to detect alterations that are driven both by endogenous and exogenous influences&#x2014;including the microbiome [48, 49]&#x2014;makes it particularly useful for unveiling pathways dysregulated as a result of both genetic and environmental factors and for biomarker discovery. Numerous studies over the last decade have identified metabolic signatures associated with asthma phenotype and severity [50]. The application of untargeted metabolomics to FA is so far limited. One study in a mouse model of peanut allergy showed alterations in uric acid metabolism, suggesting a possible role for alarmins&#x2014;such as uric acid&#x2014;in FA pathogenesis [51]. More recently, stool metabolomics suggested the possible involvement of sphingolipids in FA pathogenesis, mediated at least in part by modulation of iNKT cells [52]. The application of metabolomics to the study of FA holds the promise of contributing to the understanding of the integrated pathophysiological contributions in FA and of identifying biomarkers and metabolic pathways that can become the focus of targeted therapies.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0251">The application of untargeted metabolomic profiling in a mouse model of FA has led to the identification of RELM&#x3b2; as a potentially pathogenic cytokine not previously associated with FA, whose expression is dysregulated in mice and humans. Deletion of RELM&#x3b2; in mice resulted in protection from FA reactions, with abolished mast cell responses and alterations in gut Treg cells profile. RELM&#x3b2;-deficient mice display unique metabolomic signatures as compared to WT and FA prone mice. This application expands on these innovative approaches and observations to correlate RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation in FA children with global, mast-cell and microbiome-associated metabolomic profiles as well as Treg cells mediated tolerogenic responses, with the goal to mechanistically relate pathognomonic changes in these profiles to alterations in RELM&#x3b2;. The hypothesis that serum levels of RELM&#x3b2; are uniquely elevated in subjects with FA as compared to those with other atopic conditions and correlate with pathognomonic metabolomic alterations, is an innovative hypothesis. Untargeted metabolomic profiling is a powerful tool for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms of disease. It has so far had limited application to FA, a condition in which it offers the potential of providing unbiased insight into factors shaping disease susceptibility and progression as well as leading to novel biomarkers of disease diagnosis and outcome that directly address currently unmet needs in FA. Relating changes in RELM&#x3b2; with altered metabolomic profiles and imbalances in the Treg compartment can provide key mechanistic insights in the contribution of RELM&#x3b2; to FA pathogenesis. Finally, and critically, the development of therapy for anaphylaxis based on the suppression of RELM&#x3b2; over-expression in FA will provide a novel approach to anaphylaxis prevention in susceptible subjects by means of a long acting biologic therapy. Importantly, no such therapy currently exists.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0252">Currently diagnostic modalities for FA have limited accuracy, and no disease-modifying treatment is available for FA patients, reflecting incomplete understanding of the complex pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of FA and of the multiple environmental influences exerted on genetically predisposed atopic individuals. Experiments presented herein investigate the role of RELM&#x3b2; as a FA biomarker and applies global and targeted metabolomic profiling to dissect pathways altered as a result of RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation in FA, including the contribution of the microbiome and alterations in Treg-mediated gut tolerogenic responses. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which RELM&#x3b2; contributes to FA pathogenesis may lead to the identification of candidate targets for future therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0253">The care of patients with FA suffers from the limitations intrinsic to IgE-based testing, and further knowledge is clearly needed. Elucidating robust biomarkers of FA and underlying mechanisms linking the two may lead to new therapeutic options and intervention strategies for these children, or at least in specific FA disease endotypes such as the one characterized by RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Approach</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0254">A unique mouse model of FA developed by the inventor which harbors a mutation in the immunotyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) of the IL-4 receptor &#x3b1; chain (Il4ra<sup>F709</sup>) that potentiates receptor signaling is employed in experiments presented herein. Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice exhibit robust oral sensitization to chicken egg Ovalbumin (OVA) and peanut, and develop severe IgE-dependent anaphylaxis upon oral allergen challenge [43, 54-56]. Untargeted serum metabolomic profiling of FA-prone Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice and FA-resistant WT mice identified a marked dysregulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolites (such as anhydroglucitol [57, 58]) in Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>FA mice (data not shown). These results indicated that dysregulated lipid and sugar metabolisms in the context of Th2 inflammation are reflective of fundamental pathogenic mechanism(s) in FA and led to the evaluation of the role of members of the RELM family. The RELM family, composed of RELM&#x3b1;, RELM&#x3b2;, and RELM-&#x3b3;, is a group of proteins that share sequence homology to Resistin, an adipocyte-secreted factor that can regulate responsiveness to insulin [29]. Unlike Resistin, RELM&#x3b1; and -&#x3b2; are induced by Th2 cytokines [59]. RELM&#x3b2; expression is particularly prominent in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, most notably goblet cells, where it has been implicated in parasite expulsion [31]. Previous studies by the inventors have shown increased Retnlb transcripts, encoding RELM&#x3b2;, in Il4raF709 mice in the context of allergic inflammation [53]. Therefore, qPCR analysis in small intestinal tissue of Il4raF709 and WT mice was performed following either sham (PBS) or OVA sensitization, then oral challenge with OVA for all mice. Expression of Retnlb transcripts was observed to be increased in Il4raF709 relative to WT mice after sham sensitization, but was dramatically upregulated in the Il4raF709 mice following OVA sensitization and challenge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In contrast Retnla transcripts, encoding RELM&#x3b1;, were modestly increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). RELM&#x3b2; protein concentrations were also measured in the sera of WT and Il4raF709 mice that were either sham (PBS) or OVA sensitized. The RELM&#x3b2; serum concentrations were increased in the sham sensitized Il4raF709 mice and were further increased upon sensitization with OVA, whereas they were below the detection limit in WT controls. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>). The Serum concentrations of RELM&#x3b1; were also analyzed in the same mouse groups. RELM&#x3b1;, has also been invoked in allergic airway inflammation and has also been associated with decreased glucose tolerance in experimental large intestinal inflammation [60]. However, and unlike RELM&#x3b2;, the serum concentrations of RELM&#x3b1; were minimally changed between WT and Il4raF709 09 mice either before or after sensitization <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, D). These results are consistent with divergent regulation of RELM&#x3b2; versus RELM&#x3b1; in the context of FA</p><p id="p-0209" num="0255">To determine whether human FA is associated with increased serum RELM&#x3b2; levels, RELM&#x3b2; concentrations in the sera of children with no known allergies (n=41), asthma (n=23), atopic dermatitis (AD) (17), asthma with FA (FAA) (55) and FA (n=66) were analyzed via ELISA The diagnosis of asthma was made based the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3) criteria [61]. Subjects with isolated asthma did not suffer from eczema. Results revealed that RELM&#x3b2; was highly increased in the overwhelming majority of subjects with FA and FAA as compared to asthmatics, subjects with atopic dermatitis and non-allergic controls (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0256">The sharp upregulation of RELM&#x3b2; in FA-prone Il4raF709 mice and in human subjects with FA as compared to asthmatics and healthy control subjects is suggestive of a mechanistic function for RELM&#x3b2; in disease pathogenesis. This hypothesis was validated by the observation that Il4raF709 Retnlb&#x2212;/&#x2212;&#x2014;double mutant mice failed to develop FA in response to sensitization to OVA/SEB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). While the OVA/SEB-sensitized Il4raF709 and Il4raF709 Retnlb&#x2212;/&#x2212;&#x2014;double mutant mice showed a similar increase in their total serum IgE concentrations as compared to similarly sensitized WT mice, the Il4raF709 Retnlb&#x2212;/&#x2212;&#x2014;double mutant mice were profoundly defective in their capacity to mount an allergen specific (OVA-specific) IgE response. not affect the increased total serum IgE concentrations in response A key effect of RELM&#x3b2; deficiency appeared to be the suppression of mast cell release, as measured by the increased serum concentrations of the mast cell protease 1 (MMCP1) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). The total number of mast cells, normally increased in OVA/SEB-sensitized Il4raF709 mice, was also suppressed in the similarly sensitized Il4raF709 Retnlb&#x2212;/&#x2212; double mutant mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>E</figref>) or the Treg cell Th2 cell-like reprogramming (data not shown), otherwise cardinal steps in directing the FA response in Il4raF709 mice [45].</p><p id="p-0211" num="0257">Investigating the relationship between RELM&#x3b2; expression and the development and resolution of food allergy in children. Experiments are designed to (1) determine if expression of RELM&#x3b2; is increased in young children at risk for FA and decreased following resolution of FA. It is specifically contemplated herein that increased RELM&#x3b2; expression reflects pathogenic mechanisms that promote FA and is down-regulated upon acquisition of oral tolerance. (2) To compare RELM&#x3b2; levels in young children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are at risk for FA and children with mild AD, those with established FA or healthy controls. It is specifically contemplated herein that RELM&#x3b2; elevation predicts those AD subjects at risk for the development of FA. (3) To compare RELM&#x3b2; levels in children with active and resolved FA. It is specifically contemplated herein that RELM&#x3b2; levels decline upon the induction of oral tolerance in FA subjects.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0258">Rationale. RELM&#x3b2; is upregulated in FA-prone Il4rd&#x2032; 709 mice and in human subjects with FA as compared to asthmatics and healthy control subjects. Mice deficient in RELM&#x3b2; are protected from food allergen-induced anaphylactic reactions, indicating a mechanistic function for RELM&#x3b2; in disease pathogenesis. In mice, elevation of RELM&#x3b2; is observed at baseline, prior to sensitization, suggesting that it may serve as a marker of FA predisposition, prior to overt clinical manifestations elicited by food exposure. In a small group of children with AD and no FA, elevation of RELM&#x3b2; was observed in a subset of subjects. Young children with AD are at increased risk of FA, with these two conditions often presenting as the first steps in the development of the atopic march, a typical progression of allergic disease that starts early in life with AD and FA and progresses to allergic rhinitis and asthma [62]. The inventors propose to investigate whether elevation of RELM&#x3b2; is present in a subset of children with moderate to severe AD at higher risk of developing FA Such observation will be key in designing future prospective studies aimed at assessing the role of RELM&#x3b2; as a candidate biomarker to predict FA</p><p id="p-0213" num="0259">Experimental Design: Children ages 4 to 12 months with either mild or moderate/severe AD but no FA, infants with both eczema and FA, as well as healthy controls will be included. Infants with eczema but no FA will be monitored over 3 years for the development of FA by clinic follow-up visits to determine whether FA develops more frequently in children with elevated RELM&#x3b2;. FA will be diagnosed based on the combination of both positive testing (specific IgE and/or skin testing) and a history of immediate symptoms occurring within 2 hours of ingestion of the culprit food. FA to foods that are avoided without a clear history of reaction, will be diagnosed by either a failed oral food challenge or serum specific IgE exceeding the established diagnostic cutoffs associated with 95% positive predictive values [7, 63, 64]. Children with positive testing and no history of reaction that do not fit the above criteria will be classified as non-FA, with secondary analyses performed looking separately at this group of sensitized children. Serum RELM&#x3b2; levels will be measured by ELISA (Antigenix) at baseline as well as at follow-up visits to assess their relationship with eczema and FA over time. RELM&#x3b2; levels will also be correlated with markers of FA and AD severity such total and specific IgE and SCORAD severity score. The presence of other atopic conditions (atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis) will be recorded and will be included either in adjusted or subgroups RELM&#x3b2; analyses in order to adjust for the effect of other sources of Th2 inflammation and to test for possible interactions, for example between FA and asthma. Results will be validated in samples from a second cohort of patients with similar characteristics provided by Dr. Nadeau. Given the limited sample size of children with moderate/severe eczema and no FA, this study will serve as a pilot effort to determine the potential effect size and number of patients necessary for a larger prospective study analyzing the relationship between eczema, RELM&#x3b2; and the development of FA.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0260">Inclusion criteria. AD: clinical diagnosis with presence of eczematous, itchy and relapsing lesions with typical morphology and age-related distribution (facial, neck and extensor involvement in infants and children; flexural lesions at any age; sparing of the groin and axillary regions). AD severity will be assessed using the SCORAD severity scoring index (mild&#x3c;25; moderate 25-50; severe&#x3e;50). FA: documented FA phenotype, indicated by both of the following criteria: 1) A history of allergic reactions to one or more specific foods (e.g. milk, soy, egg, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat or peanuts), including urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, anaphylaxis, diarrhea and/or vomiting, clearly triggered within 2 hours by food exposure and improving markedly after food avoidance. 2) Positive food specific skin test and/or serum specific IgE. Control subjects: Healthy subjects with no personal history of FA, asthma, eczema or allergic rhinitis. A sample size of 120 subjects (45 with severe moderate/severe AD, 25 with mild AD, 25 with FA and AD, and 25 controls) will provide 80% power to detect the hypothesized difference of 40% versus 10% RELM&#x3b2; expression (alpha-0.05) in the moderate/severe AD group compared to mild eczema group and controls. N-45 with moderate/severe AD would provide 80% power to detect a significant difference of 30% developing FA vs. 5% developing FA in children with mild AD (probability at baseline=0.5), respectively. This assumes a 10% dropout rate from baseline to follow-tip.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0261">It is specifically contemplated herein that a subset of children with moderate to severe AD will have elevated RELM&#x3b2; levels. In this group of children RELM&#x3b2; may serve as a marker of FA predisposition, reflecting the early establishment of pathogenic mechanisms in FA development, such as Th2 skewing, mast cell load, dysbiosis and/or others. Given the research limitations intrinsic to a career development award, follow-up will extend for 3 years, which may not be powered to fully inform on whether the infants with elevated RELM&#x3b2; do go on to develop FA. Notwithstanding this limitation, this approach will allow us to test the hypothesis that children with more severe eczema may manifest increased blood RELM&#x3b2; concentrations and a trend to develop FA. Results favoring this hypothesis will justify future studies employing prospective cohort(s) to further evaluate the use of RELM&#x3b2; as a marker to predict FA in at-risk infants.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0262">Rationale: Natural tolerance is acquired over time by a large proportion of children who develop FA early on in life, especially to allergens such as hen's egg and cow milk. It is not known whether such acquisition of tolerance involves extinction of pathogenic responses or development of alternative, protective immunological mechanisms. The inventors will test the hypothesis that the acquisition of oral tolerance is associated with the down-regulation of RELM&#x3b2; expression by measuring the serum levels of RELM&#x3b2; in children with active FA and children who have acquired tolerance to all previous allergenic foods.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0263">Experimental Design: Serum samples of children with active FA (i.e. recent FA reaction) will be compared to those of children with history of FA who have acquired tolerance to all previously allergenic food(s). Analyses will be validated in a second cohort of patients with similar characteristics provided by Dr. Nadeau. FA diagnosis criteria are described herein above. Acquisition of food tolerance will be ascertained by the lack of response to an open food challenge performed as part of the clinical management. RELM&#x3b2; levels will be compared between the two groups by ELISA. A sample size of 54 subjects (27 FA, 27 resolved FA) will provide 80% power to detect the hypothesized difference of SO % versus 20% RELM&#x3b2; expression (alpha-0.05). Approximately 1,000 clinic oral food challenges are performed at BCH each year, assuring feasibility of this aim during the award timeline.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0264">We anticipate that RELM&#x3b2; levels are decreased in children who have outgrown their previous FA. It is possible that RELM&#x3b2; may be decreased in all children with FA, in which case it may serve as a marker of acquisition of oral tolerance over time. Alternatively, it is possible that RELM&#x3b2; levels may be decreased only in a subset of patients with resolved FA, while remaining persistently elevated in others. This latter observation may suggest that persistent RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation is a marker of Th2 dysregulation that persists following resolution of FA in children who go on to develop other atopic manifestations. In this scenario RELM&#x3b2; may serve as a marker of the atopic march. Finally, it is also possible that RELM&#x3b2; may remain elevated in all children who have outgrown their FA, though this scenario appears unlikely. If RELM&#x3b2; is indeed decreased in all or some of previously food allergic children, then prospective studies will be key in evaluating the temporal changes of RELM&#x3b2; and its role in assessing the acquisition of oral tolerance.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0265">Investigate metabolomic and immune regulatory mechanisms mediating RELM&#x25a1; action in FA. Experiments are designed to (1) investigate whether increased RELM&#x3b2; expression is associated with unique metabolomic signatures and changes in Treg cell tolerogenic responses in the gut. It is specifically contemplated herein that changes in RELM&#x3b2; expression reflect pathogenic mechanisms in FA that result in altered metabolomic and Treg profiles and that may involve the gut microbiome. (2) To correlate global, mast-cell- and microbiome-related metabolomic profiles with RELM&#x3b2; levels in food allergic children. It is specifically contemplated herein that unique metabolomic alterations correlate with changes in RELM&#x3b2; expression in children with FA. (3) To correlate the frequencies of circulating ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> and GATA3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells with serum RELM&#x3b2; levels and microbiome-derived metabolites in FA. It is specifically contemplated herein that RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation modulates ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> expression and alters balance of GATA3<sup>+</sup>:ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells by altering the production of microbiome-derived metabolites.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0266">Rationale: RELM&#x3b2; levels are elevated in a murine model of FA and in a large proportion of FA children, likely reflecting pathogenic mechanisms involved in FA. RELM&#x3b2; deficient mice show a marked decrease in the mast cell load in the gut and in the release of mast cell mediators upon food challenge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref>). Their metabolomic profile is distinct from that of WT and Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice and is characterized by a decrease in histamine metabolites and alterations in lipids that are involved in mast cell function indicating that RELM&#x3b2; may be a marker of mast cell load and identify individuals at risk for anaphylaxis. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0221" num="0267">RELM&#x3b2; has also been shown to modulate the murine microbiome through its bactericidal properties [36, 37]. RELM&#x3b2;-deficient mice manifest an altered microbial composition [35] and their metabolomic profile shows alterations in microbiome sensitive metabolites such as fatty acids and secondary bile acids. The inventors have recently demonstrated in a pilot study that FA children display a unique metabolomic signature characterized by a prominent dysregulation in fatty acids, sphingolipid and plasmalogens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and that severe FA phenotypes (i.e. history of multiple FA or anaphylaxis) are associated with changes in eicosanoids, fatty and in microbiome sensitive metabolites, including short chain fatty acids and aromatic amino acids (histidine and tryptophan) [65].</p><p id="p-0222" num="0268">It is specifically contemplated herein that conserved metabolomic changes observed in mice and humans&#x2014;including mast-cell and microbiome-associated signatures&#x2014;correlate with the degree of RELM&#x3b2; elevation in humans reflecting both systemic, mast cell and Treg-specific mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and severity of FA.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0269">Experimental Design: Untargeted (looking at general metabolism, including lipid and mast-cell related metabolites) and targeted (focusing on microbiome-related metabolites and short chain fatty acids) metabolomic profiling will be performed in an exploratory cohort of children with FA (n=50), asthma (n=35) and non-atopic controls (n=35), ages 1 to 11 years. RELM&#x3b2; levels will be measured by ELISA. Metabolomic studies will be carried out at Metabolon, Inc. (Morrisville, N.C.) using a liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry based approach. Plasma samples for metabolomics are processed and stored at &#x2212;80 F within two hours of collection, according to recommended metabolomics practices. Exclusion criteria for metabolomic analyses include use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications and use of antibiotics in the previous 6 weeks. Other medications and diet are recorded and included in the analyses. Bioinformatic tools (Metaboanalyst [66] and others) will be applied to identify individual metabolites (in the global and targeted panels) that segregate with FA and correlate with RELM&#x3b2; levels among FA children. Metabolite enrichment analyses will be applied to gain insight into main altered pathways. Both unadjusted analyses and analyses adjusted for personal characteristics and atopic attributes will be performed. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, increased RELM&#x3b2; expression is present in the majority, though not all FA patients, defining a subgroup which manifests high serum levels of this cytokine, possibly consistent with intense Th2 cell skewing and high mast-cell load as seen in the Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice. Accordingly, The inventor will perform a sub-analysis comparing the metabolomic profiles of FA children in the highest versus those in the lowest tertile of RELM&#x3b2; expression, with the goal to dissect the FA endotype characterized by marked RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation. History of anaphylaxis and other markers of disease severity will be compared between groups of differential RELM&#x3b2; expression. Metabolite levels will also be correlated with personal characteristics (age, gender) disease attributes (type and number of FA, IgE levels etc) as well as presence of atopic comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, asthma, AD) in an attempt to gain insights into metabolomic pathways uniquely dysregulated in specific FA phenotypes. These investigations will be performed on samples already collected under the current IRB protocol #P00021163, which currently includes 60 FA, 40 asthma and 30 control plasma samples (ages&#x3c;11 years). A second cohort of 50 FA patients and 30 controls will be recruited, who evaluates on average 10 FA and 5 asthma patients per week, and in the Asthma/Allergy Clinical Research Center at the Boston Children's Hospital and used for validation studies. Inclusion criteria for FA and controls are described in Aim 1a. Asthma diagnosis is based on EPR-3 criteria [61]. Metabolites associated with FA (q&#x2264;0.1) in the exploratory cohort will be the focus of targeted analyses in the validation cohort.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0270">It is specifically contemplated herein that unique metabolomic alterations identified in FA children are reflective of pathogenic mechanisms related to RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation. In particular, it is specifically contemplated herein that given the role of RELM&#x3b2; in intestinal mast cell expansion and anaphylaxis in mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref>), the inventors will identify a subgroup of children with marked RELM&#x3b2; elevation and increased lipid and mast-cell related metabolites (such as eicosanoid, PAF and histidine metabolites) who may be at risk of severe reactions due to augmented mast cell load and/or activation. Similarly, the inventors expect to observe alterations in microbial metabolites reflecting the impact of RELM&#x3b2; on the gut microbiome composition. It is possible however that differences in mast-cell metabolites may be compounded by the presence of other atopic co-morbidities that are associated with heightened mast-cell responses in organ systems other than the gut. To address this possibility, the inventors will perform secondary analysis segregating patients by the presence of other atopic traits such as AD and allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, by correlating metabolites with personal and disease characteristics and comorbidities the inventors will be able to identify distinct metabolomic profiles in specific FA phenotypes that may suggest candidate pathogenic pathways and disease biomarkers both dependent and independent of RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation</p><p id="p-0225" num="0271">Rationale: Treg cells play a crucial role in the maintenance of tolerance to food allergens. In previous studies, the inventors have shown that Treg reprogramming cells towards a Th2 phenotype, characterized by increased expression of IL-4 and GATA3, is associated with FA both in mice and humans [43]. Th2 reprogramming of Treg cells is unaltered in RELM&#x3b2;&#x2014;deficient mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>) suggesting that alternative mechanisms mediate RELM&#x3b2; contribution to anaphylactic FA responses. It is appreciated that the microbiota regulates type 2 immunity through the induction of a specific subset of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells [44]. Critically, the inventors have established that protection against FA is dependent on the induction by the microbiota of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells [67]. Furthermore, while the microbiota of children with FA do not protect against FA when transferred into FA-prone germ free-mice, those of non-FA children do, in association with induction by the FA microbiota of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the recipient mice [45]. In agreement with these findings, the inventors have observed a decreased proportion of circulating ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in FA children [67]. The inventors have observed that Il4ra<sup>F709</sup>Retnlb<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> double mutant mice have increased proportions of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells as compared to FA-prone Il4ra<sup>F709 </sup>mice, suggesting that RELM&#x3b2; may contribute to FA pathogenesis by modulating microbiome-dependent gut ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cell responses. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0272">A role for dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of FA has been suggested by mouse and human studies [45, 68]. In mouse models of FA, treatment with selected pro-tolerogenic bacterial species (Clostridiales, Bacteroidales) reverses peanut sensitization [45, 55]. In humans, several risk factors for FA (mode of birth, pet exposure, antibiotic treatment, presence of older siblings etc.) directly affect and modify the microbiome early in life. Furthermore, decreased microbiota diversity and unique microbial signatures in the infant gut&#x2014;such as elevated ratio of Enterobacteriaceae/Bacteroidaceae&#x2014;have been associated with the development of subsequent food sensitization [69]. These findings suggest that the pattern of early gut colonization can contribute to the development of atopic diseases, including FA [70]. RELM&#x3b2; has been implicated in shaping the gut microbiome by depleting protective <i>Lactobacillus </i>species and by regulating the spatial segregation between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelium [36]. Notably, mice deficient in RELM&#x3b2; have an altered microbiome as compared to WT mice [35]. The inventors postulate that RELM&#x3b2; promotes dysbiosis and consequently changes in microbiome-derived metabolites that contribute to the FA response by modulating the frequency of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0273">Experimental Design: FA children will be categorized based on serum RELM&#x3b2; levels measured by ELISA (highest vs lowest tertile). Frequency of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> and GATA3<sup>+</sup> expression will be measured by flowcytometry in CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs isolated from PBMCs of children with FA (n=30), children with asthma (n=25), children with eczema (n=25) and non-atopic controls (n=20). The proportion of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> and GATA3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells will be correlated with RELM&#x3b2; levels in FA children. Proportions will also be compared in dichotomous comparisons of children with high vs. low RELM&#x3b2; levels. Treg cell subpopulations will be measured also in children with asthma and non-atopic controls to determine the specificity of Treg imbalances to FA, as well in children with AD (with or without elevated RELM&#x25a1;) to determine whether they may be indicative of predisposition to FA development. The n=30 FA subjects will provide 80% power to detect a correlation of 0.63 between RELM&#x3b2; expression and Treg profiles. Levels of microbiome-associated metabolites that are associated with increased RELM&#x3b2; as described herein above will then be correlated with the frequency of ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in FA children. This approach will allow to identify metabolites mediating the effect of RELM&#x3b2;-induced dysbiosis on the Treg compartment.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0274">It is specifically contemplated herein that the proportions of peripheral blood ROR-&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in FA children inversely correlate with RELM&#x3b2; levels and that microbiome-related metabolites can be identified that correlate with both RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation and Treg imbalances. This would support the hypothesis that the contribution of RELM&#x3b2; dysregulation in FA is at least in part mediated by changes in the gut microbial composition and that altered levels of microbial-derived metabolites in turn modulate Treg populations. The inventors anticipate identifying candidate metabolomic mediators of the effects of RELM&#x3b2; in the gut that can act as biomarkers and target for therapeutic manipulation. In future studies will plan to address the direct effect of RELM&#x3b2; on the human gut microbiome composition and the role of specific microbial species in the stool.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0275">Generate and test in preclinical mouse models neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human RELM&#x3b2;.

The MAC supports the humanization of mAbs using its own internal expertise and resources.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0281">In vivo testing of blockade of human RELM&#x3b2; protein in humanized mouse model of FA. To further test the activity of the neutralizing antibody, a humanized mouse model of FA will be used. For this, the SCID mouse (OD.Cg-Prkd<sup>csid </sup>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wj1 </sup>Tg(CMV-IL3,CSF2,KITLG)1Eav/M<sup>loySzJ</sup>) will be used [71]. These mice don't possess any active adaptive immune system. However, when engrafted with Cord blood-derived flow-sorted human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, they exhibit robust engraftment with functional human T and B lymphocytes and, importantly, human mast cells in their tissues, including the intestinal mucosa [71]. Following oral gavage feeding with peanut, they mount specific antibody responses, including peanut-specific IgE. Furthermore, when enterally challenged with PN, they exhibit mast cell mediated systemic anaphylaxis, as indicated by hypothermia and increases in plasma tryptase levels. Anti-IgE (omalizumab) treatment ablates this anaphylactic response.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0233" num="0282">The inventors propose to transfer CD34 cells from human donors to these mice to reconstitute their adaptive immune system with human immune system. The mice will be then sensitized with peanut flour then orally challenged with peanut, as described [71]. Subgroups of mice will receive either anti-RELM&#x3b2; or isotype control mAbs at 100 &#x3bc;g intraperitoneal injection once weekly for the duration of the sensitization period, and the mice will be examined for their anaphylactic response as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref> and the inventors' recent publications [43, 55, 67, 72, 73]. Other parameters examined will include total and peanut-specific IgE, MCPT1 release, tissue mastocytosis in the gut and especially the induction of ROR&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (and reciprocally, the suppression of Th2 cell-like reprogramed Treg cells and the recently described pathogenic Tfh13 [74, 75]) in the lamina propria of treated mice as a measure of restored immune tolerance.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0283">In addition to the above prevention mode of therapy, the mice will undergo a curative mode as well. Mice will be orally sensitized with peanut to render them FA, then continued to be sensitized for an additional 4 weeks while receiving anti-RELM&#x3b2; or isotype control mAbs at 100 &#x3bc;g intraperitoneal injection once weekly. The mice will then be challenged enterally with peanut flour and examined for their anaphylactic response.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0284">It is specifically contemplated herein that the generated anti-human RELM&#x3b2; mAbs would prove effective in both the prevention and curative modes of peanut FA therapy. Once the basic experiments are set, optimization as to the frequency and dosage of therapy in both prevention and curative mode. Of particular interest is the effect of anti-human RELM&#x3b2; mAb therapy on the previously described dysbiosis in FA, as resetting the dysbiosis in favor of tolerance inducing (ROR&#x3b3;t<sup>+</sup> Treg cell inducing) bacteria, including Clostridiales and Bacteroidales species, will foster long-term oral tolerance [67]. These studies can be carried out in the inventors' laboratory using techniques readily available and described in the inventors' recent Nature Medicine publication [67].</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0236" num="0000"><ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0285">1.
