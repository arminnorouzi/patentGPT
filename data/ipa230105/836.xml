Mirabegron is chemically known as (R)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-4&#x2032;-{2-[(2-hydroxy-2 phenylethyl)amino]ethyl} acetanilide. It is represented with the following chemical structure:</p><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="18.20mm" wi="75.10mm" file="US20230000837A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Presently, mirabegron is approved in the form of solid oral dosage forms in the US market as extended-release tablets in strengths of 25 mg and 50 mg. Mirabegron compound is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,346,532.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 10,842,780 discloses sustained-release, hydrogel-forming oral formulations of mirabegron. U.S. Pat. No. 8,835,474, RE44,872 disclose methods of using mirabegron for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). U.S. Pat. No. 8,772,315 discloses combinations of mirabegron and solifenacin and methods of using such combinations for the treatment of OAB.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The use of &#x3b2;3-adrenergic receptor agonists including mirabegron in the treatment of obesity, metabolic disease, and reducing fat accumulation is known in the literature. Effect of mirabegron to stimulate the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis was recently disclosed in 2015 (Cypess et al., &#x201c;Activation of human brown adipose tissue by a beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist,&#x201d; <i>Cell metabolism </i>21:33-38 (2015)). U.S. Patent Publication No. 2018/0326080 discloses the utilization of novel polymer-based systems that allow controlled generation of brown/beige adipose tissues for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. This publication also discloses making a microsphere polymer-based drug delivery system via combining a drug with a polymer matrix system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">However, till date, no &#x3b2;3-adrenergic receptor agonist is approved in the USA market for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic disorders and/or fat removal or reduction. Moreover, the determination of critical parameters of various clinical candidates or molecules associated with drug development essentially requires successful optimization of technical parameters like the selection of suitable dose, suitable dosage form, suitable route of administration, suitable dosing regimen, effect in animals, and humans.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">In the pharmaceutical industry, there is a constant need to work on identifying and developing novel pharmaceutical compositions that certainly affect the drug's dissolution profile, bioavailability, bioequivalence, stability, etc. These factors all play important roles in achieving the desired therapeutic effect, and successful dosage form development with desired technical attributes. Therefore, in the case of mirabegron too, there is an unmet need to develop parenteral pharmaceutical compositions with desirable technical attributes such as solubility, drug release, stability, bioavailability, and patient compliance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Thus, there is an unmet need to provide an effective drug delivery system of an &#x3b2;3-adrenergic receptor agonist, such as mirabegron for the treatment of obesity, reduction of localized fat, and/or related metabolic disorders and methods for making such delivery systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present invention relates to novel parenteral compositions of &#x3b2;3-adrenergic receptor agonists and processes for preparing such compositions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The present invention relates to novel injection compositions of mirabegron and processes for preparing such compositions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., lyophilized and/or aqueous compositions) comprising mirabegron and methods of use thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present invention also relates to injection compositions comprising mirabegron and at least one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients selected from the group consisting of solvents, co-solvents, solubilizing agents, surfactant or wetting agents, permeation enhancers, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, pH adjusting agents, buffering agents, carriers, diluents, suspending agents, complexing agents, preservatives, antioxidants, surface modifiers and combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The present invention also relates to the use of the therapeutically effective amount of injection compositions of mirabegron in the manufacture of a medicament for treating obesity, and its related metabolic disorders, reduction/removal of localized fat, hypertension, patients at risk of having diabetes (pre-diabetes), diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hyperglycemia, gallbladder diseases, excess fat on the chin (submental fullness or double chin disorder), binge eating, hypothyroidism, excess fat on the breast, adiposis dolorosa, benign symmetric lipomatosis, lipedema, familial lipodystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, HIV lipodystrophy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, hypertrophy of dorsocervical fat/dorsocervical fat hypertrophy (&#x201c;buffalo hump&#x201d;), lipoma, lipomatosis, moon facies, Down syndrome, pseudo-Cushing syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Cushing syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Madelung disease and even some types of cancer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The details of one or more embodiments of the present invention are outlined in the description below.

Moreover, the bioavailability of mirabegron is affected by the presence of food in the GI (Gastro-Intestinal) tract. Therefore, to prevent this food effect, the commercially available pharmaceutical formulations of mirabegron are in the form of extended-release tablet formulation based on an orally controlled absorption system (OCAS&#xae;) technology. These properties of mirabegron may pose multiple challenges for formulation scientists in the dosage forms development. Moreover, the use of oral dosage form in the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic disorders may not be a suitable approach due to the number of factors such as frequent dosage administration, long treatment period, patient compliance, and low bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">The bioavailability of the &#x3b2;3-adrenergic receptor agonists such as mirabegron can be improved via the injectable/parenteral route of administration and may provide a higher level of bioavailability than the oral route. The increase in bioavailability of an injectable formulation can provide therapeutic plasma concentration levels with a dose that can be administered. However, the development of injection dosage forms such as aqueous-based injection is not feasible due to the very poor solubility of the drug in water. Further, formulation development of injectable dosage form is highly challenging. The stability of the drug in the final injection product is a primary concern to the formulation scientist. The drug substances are less stable in aqueous media than solid dosage forms, and it is very important to properly stabilize and preserve liquid aqueous formulations such as injectable solutions. Acid-base reactions, acid or base catalysis, oxidation, and reduction can occur in these products. These reactions can arise from drug substance-ingredient interactions, ingredient-ingredient interactions, or container-product interactions. For pH-sensitive compounds, any of these interactions may alter the pH and may cause precipitation. In addition to stabilization of pharmaceutical preparations against chemical and physical degradation, multiple dosage unit preparations must usually be protected against microbial contamination. In contrast to solid preparations, aqueous solutions often provide excellent growth media for microorganisms such as molds, yeast, and bacteria. Contamination by these microorganisms may occur during the manufacturing or when a dose is taken from multiple dosage unit formulations.

The solubility of API was studied in various solvent systems. For formulating immediate release injectable formulations, the solubility of the drug plays an important role as the final parenteral formulation has to be essentially a clear solution. The present inventors found that the API is practically insoluble in water. The present inventor surprisingly found that the API is found soluble when the pH is adjusted to the acidic side such as pH close to 3.0. The API solubility was found to increase from about 0.1 mg/mL to up to 100 mg/mL. While other techniques such as the use of co-solvent (such as propylene glycol) with or without heating failed to achieve desired drug solubility required for the successful development of immediate-release injectable formulations. Further, the inventors of the present invention were able to achieve maximum API solubility based on series of saturation solubility studies performed. The present inventors surprisingly found that maximum solubility of API was found in Acetate buffer having pH 4.5. The assessment of the successful development and stability of the solutions has been made on basis of the appearance of the solutions, the pH-value, osmolality, impurities content, and stability. The prepared formulations were found acceptable on these parameters.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup

The animals were divided into three groups (Group 1 for Mirabegron single dose, Group 2 for Vehicle (placebo), and Group 3 for Mirabegron multiple-dose injection). Twelve animals were used for the single injection group, 6 animals were used for the vehicle group, and 18 animals were used for the multiple injection group.

Further, pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on group 3. The adipose tissue and plasma were collected after the injection on day 7 at different time points: 0.5 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours post-injection. Further, biomarker analysis was performed on the samples collected for groups 2 and 3. The adipose tissue was collected on day 7 at a 0.5-hour time point.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0140">Results: Mirabegron formulation after injection demonstrated high exposure in tissue compared to plasma, as was desired by giving localized injection. A significant increase in UCP-1 mRNA expression was found in iWAT suggesting the thermogenic potential of mirabegron in iWAT after localized injection. Exposure of mirabegron was found to be high at 1 mg dose in both plasma and tissue (iWAT). In the biomarker group, mirabegron 1 mg/animal has shown a statistically significant increase in expression of UCP-1 mRNA in iWAT. This indicates upregulation of thermogenesis in iWAT upon treatment with mirabegron.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Results</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Day 1</entry><entry>Day 7</entry></row><row><entry>Parameters</entry><entry>(single injection)</entry><entry>(multiple injections)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Plasma)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>C<sub>max </sub>[ng/mL]</entry><entry>8912</entry><entry>10262</entry></row><row><entry>AUC<sub>0-8 hr. </sub>ng * hr/mL]</entry><entry>27793</entry><entry>21748</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Adipose tissue)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>C<sub>max </sub>[ng/g]</entry><entry>402602</entry><entry>287880</entry></row><row><entry>AUC<sub>0-8 hr. </sub>[ng * hr/g]</entry><entry>558648</entry><entry>398018</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 18</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0141">Compositions prepared according to Examples 15-16 of the present invention were studied in mice wherein the injection formulation was injected into adipose tissue in the mice.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0142">Objectives: The objective of this study was to conduct and observe a dose proportionality study to evaluate the exposure and the response at a lower dose and to generate data for toxicity (local and systemic) following multiple injections.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0143">Dose: A dose level of 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg/20 &#x3bc;l/animal was selected for the experiment.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0144">Materials and Methods: Mice: Non-fasted male C57BL/6 mice were used in the study.
