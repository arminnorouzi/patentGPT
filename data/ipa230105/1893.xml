119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0087258, filed on Jul. 2, 2021 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to an electric parking brake (EPB) system for controlling operation or release of the EPB and a method for controlling the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a Motor-On-Caliper (MOC) type of an EPB system increases a torque generated from an electric motor of the EPB through a reducer to generate a clamping force required for parking by a mechanical structure device inside a caliper.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such EPB systems press a pair of brake pads against a brake disk rotating together with a wheel of a vehicle by advancing a piston by an electric motor of the EPB during parking operation, thereby generating a clamping force. Furthermore, when parking is released, the EPB systems release the pressure of the brake pad from the brake disc by reversing the piston by the electric motor, thereby releasing the generated clamping force.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When replacing brake pads, burnishing is performed on the brake pads for uniform contact between the brake pads and the brake disc. Burnishing causes eliminating a high-pitched squealing sound between the brake pads and the brake disc and improving the clamping force, when parking is performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At an early stage of vehicle release or an early stage of brake pad replacement, the brake pads may not be sufficiently burnish, resulting in a low friction coefficient of the brake pads. Accordingly, a clamping force lower than a target clamping force may be generated during parking operation until the brake pads is sufficiently burnishing, so that a slip(backward moving) of vehicle may occur during the parking operation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the disclosure is to provide an EPB system capable of preventing a vehicle from slipping by compensating for a clamping force of the EPB according to a burnishing state of a brake pad, and a method of controlling the same.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electric parking brake (EPB) system includes an EPB configured to provide a clamping force to a vehicle for parking;
