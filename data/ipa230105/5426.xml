As the number of times the bias voltage is applied to the driving transistor DT increases, the charge of the driving transistor DT increases and then the driving transistor DT is saturated. That is, when the pixel is driven at 60 Hz and at 1 Hz, the characteristics of the driving transistor DT are changed, resulting in a difference in luminance</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The difference in the characteristics of the driving transistor DT between the driving at 60 Hz and the driving at 1 Hz results from a difference in the amount of bias stress within one set.

Thus, a difference in the amount of bias stress occurs. As a result, the characteristics of the driving transistor DT are changed and a difference in luminance occurs. In other words, when the display device is driven by changing the refresh rate from a high refresh rate (e.g., 60 Hz) to a low refresh rate (e.g., 1 Hz), a difference in the amount of bias stress of the driving transistor DT occurs, and this causes the change of the characteristics of the driving transistor DT, so that the magnitude of the driving current Id is reduced. As a result, when the display device is driven by changing the refresh rate from a high refresh rate to a low refresh rate, the luminance of the electroluminescent device ELD decreases due to a decrease in the driving current Id.
