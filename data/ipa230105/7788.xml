In some embodiments, this high heat and/or pressurization to transfer the two-dimensional material may cause breakage, tearing, melting, or other such deformities on the target substrate and/or two-dimensional material if the target substrate is made of a material that does not support the temperatures and pressures needed to grow or form the two-dimensional material. At the same time, the demand for conductive, rigid or flexible, and/or translucent properties for non-standard electronic devices is growing, and the target substrates used in such non-standard electronic devices may not have the properties needed to support conventional methods for forming the two-dimensional materials (e.g., the properties like that of the initial substrates). Further, known processes to form such two-dimensional-target substrates similar to that described herein may not comprise a uniform thickness as the two-dimensional material may be applied to the target substrate by adding flakes individually. Instead, the invention described herein overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by reciting a process and product to create a two-dimensional-target substrate comprising rigid or flexible, transparent, and/or uniform in thickness properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A two-dimensional material, when applied to certain target substrates, may provide such properties as insulation, high conductibility, and high frequency, for the target substrates.

Further, in some embodiments, the two-dimensional material may first be grown on an initial substrate comprising a high melting point threshold, such that the two-dimensional material may be grown on the initial substrate and then placed on a target substrate comprising different properties from the initial substrate. Such removal process may allow the two-dimensional material to be extracted from the initial substrate without damage, tearing, or breakage.

Thus, use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to embodiments of the present invention, an initial substrate may be used to grow a two-dimensional material comprising insulative and conductive properties, which may collectively be referred to as a two-dimensional-substrate structure. The two-dimensional-substrate structure may be applied to a target substrate comprising rigid or flexible properties via an adhesion promoter to form a lamination stack, heat and pressure may then be applied under a vacuum or controlled gas atmosphere (such as the CVD System incorporated by reference herein) to the lamination stack, and then the initial substrate may be removed from the lamination stack to form a two-dimensional-target structure. By using an initial substrate to grow the two-dimensional material rather than growing the two-dimensional material directly on the target substrate, according to embodiments of the methods and structures described herein, the two-dimensional material can be applied to target substrates having properties that are not able to support the growth process. For example, the target structure may have a lower rigidity properties and lower melting points than the initial substrate, such as may be the case when the target structure is a flexible electronic device. As such, embodiments of the present invention may allow a two-dimensional-target structure to be applied to rigid or flexible electronic devices including composite membranes; composite membranes for audio speakers and receivers; composite membrane actuators; touch screens; foldable screens; foldable touch screens; flexible, stretchable, or foldable electronic devices; flexible LEDs; flexible photovoltaics; silicon-integration of 2D devices where 2D devices are connected with circuits implemented in silicon; light sources on silicon or other wafers; photodetectors integrated with wafers; transparent electrodes on rigid or flexible glass; rigid or flexible transparent electromagnetic shielding, and other such devices known in the art, wherein the target substrate (including the two-dimensional material) may have higher conductivity over conventional two-dimensional-target structures.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A lamination stack, generally, may be understood to be the stack, or layers, of materials used in electronic devices (e.g., a lamination stack may be used to form a PCB). For example, such materials may include a conductive substrate (e.g., metal) used to grow a two-dimensional material such as graphene, hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN), or other such rigid or flexible and conductive materials. According to embodiments of the present invention, the lamination stack may further include the target substrate and an adhesion promoter that is used to affix the target substrate to the two-dimensional-substrate structure. The lamination stack may be heated and pressurized to secure a bond between the two-dimensional material and the target structure via the adhesion promoter. The process of heating and pressurizing may also be referred to as a lamination process. In some aspects of the present invention, heat may be applied to the base of the lamination stack (e.g., from below the lamination stack), applied to the top of the lamination stack (e.g., from a heat-source placed above the lamination stack), or applied to surround the lamination stack (e.g., similar to an oven chamber heating the lamination stack from multiple sides).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the target substrate may also comprise such rigid or flexible and conductive properties as the two-dimensional material or higher rigid or flexible and conductive properties from the two-dimensional material. In recent technology, there is an increasing demand for rigid or flexible, conductive, and/or translucent materials to be used in such devices as described herein. Accordingly, there is an increased demand for efficient processes to create the materials used in these devices</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B</figref>, example methods for facilitating the creation of a lamination stack is provided in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
