A content management platform can provide the content provider with an opportunity to identify an audience for receiving one or more promotional content items in a campaign. For example, the content management platform can present an audience management interface that provides the content provider with an opportunity to select a content campaign and provide input relating to one or more of: demographic criteria relating to a desired audience (e.g., a target age range of an audience of presented content items, a gender of an audience that a content provider desires to reach, a country in which an audience that a content provider desires to reach, and/or any other suitable demographic criteria), affinity criteria relating to a desired audience (e.g., interests and/or habits associated with an audience that a content provider desires to reach), in-market and life event information (e.g., information that an audience is actively researching or planning), remarketing information (e.g., interaction information relating to how a desired audience has interacted with the content provider), etc. In another example, the audience management interface can also provide the content provider with an opportunity to select a content campaign and create a custom audience in which the content provider can input user interests in the form of relevant keywords or phrases (e.g., users with a corresponding interest or purchase intention, users that have searched for one or more of these keywords or phrases on one or more platforms), uniform resource locators (URLs) that a desired audience member might visit (e.g., users that browse websites similar to the inputted URL), and application that a desired audience member has used (e.g., users that have downloaded and/or executed mobile applications on mobile devices that are similar to the inputted application).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can determine whether to present a recommendation interface that prompts the content provider to create a custom audience for a campaign of one or more promotional content items. For example, the recommendation interface can be a notification that indicates that a campaign of one or more promotional content items associated with a user account should create and apply a custom audience as the custom audience can enhance a performance metric of the campaign. In a more particular example, the recommendation interface can prompt the content provider having the user account to create a custom audience using one or more suggested keywords as the application of the custom audience to the campaign is predicted to increase the number of conversions while decreasing the cost per acquisition.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, in response to determining that a user account associated with the content provider has been authenticated, the mechanisms can determine whether a campaign associated with a user account is eligible for receiving the recommendation interface.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether a custom audience, such as a custom intent audience, has already been created for the campaign. In continuing this example, in response to determining that a custom audience has already been created for the campaign, the mechanisms can inhibit the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider having the user account.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether the user account is associated with particular types of campaigns. For example, the mechanisms can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform. In another example, the mechanisms can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform in which the promotional content item includes a call-to-action button, a call-to-action headline, or any other suitable element that prompts a response to the promotional content item. In yet another example, the mechanisms can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform and determine whether the video campaign has received a particular amount of traffic. In continuing this example, the mechanisms can determine that the video campaign is eligible for the recommendation interface in response to determining that the video campaign has not received any traffic over a particular time period (e.g., seven days).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether a campaign associated with the user account has particular advertising channel type and a particular bidding strategy. For example, the mechanisms can determine that the user account is associated with a video campaign that is owned and operated by the content provider and that the video campaign is associated with a bidding strategy that sets bids to help the content provider obtain a maximum number of conversions at or below a set cost per action.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether a campaign is associated with a policy certificate. For example, promotional content items associated with an election may be allowed to be presented in a particular geographic region if the content provider has been verified. In continuing this example, the mechanisms can inhibit the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider in response to determining that promotional content items are associated with a policy certificate.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether a campaign has one or more promotional content items that are deemed to be unsafe. For example, the mechanisms can filter video campaigns that are determined to include objectionable content, such as violence, pornography, objectionable language, animal abuse, and/or any other type of objectionable content, from being eligible for presenting the recommendation interface. In continuing this example, the mechanisms can inhibit the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider in response to determining that the video campaign includes objectionable content or any other suitable content that is deemed as being unsafe.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can determine whether the content provider is associated with websites that are deemed to be sensitive sites. For example, the mechanisms can filter video campaigns associated with a user account from being eligible for presenting the recommendation interface in which the user account of the content provider is determined to be associated with websites that are deemed to be sensitive sites, such as gambling-related websites, religion-related websites, health-related websites, etc. In continuing this example, the mechanisms can inhibit the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider in response to determining that the video campaign of a content provider is associated with websites that are deemed to be sensitive sites.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that any suitable criterion and any suitable combination of criterion can be used to determine whether the recommendation interface that prompts the content provider to create a custom audience for a campaign of one or more promotional content items should be presented.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In response to determining that a campaign of a content provider is eligible for presenting the recommendation interface and in response to determining that the application of a custom audience to a campaign is predicted to have a performance metric that is greater than a particular threshold (e.g., a predicted increase in the number of conversions with a predicted decrease in the cost per acquisition), the mechanisms can present a recommendation interface that prompts the content provider having the user account to create a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the recommendation interface can include a selectable interface for creating a custom audience. In some embodiments, the recommendation interface can include the predicted change in the performance metric upon application of a custom audience. For example, in addition to prompting the user to create a custom audience for application to a campaign, the recommendation interface can indicate a predicted change in one or more performance metrics upon application of the custom audience (e.g., a 74% higher conversion rate at a 12% lower cost acquisition, a 3.2% chance of increasing the conversion rate while decreasing the cost per acquisition, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the recommendation interface can include one or more suggested keywords that, upon selection, can insert the suggested keyword as an input to create the custom audience. For example, in response to selecting a suggested keyword, the keyword can be used to creating an audience that fits the need of the campaign. In a more particular example, based on campaign goals and bidding strategy of a campaign, the mechanisms can interpret the selected keywords to choose an audience that is focused on reach, consideration, and/or performance. In continuing this example, rather than reaching a sports fan affinity audience, a running shoe entity may want to reach marathon runners instead. The shoe company entity can define this audience of marathon runners by entering and/or selecting keywords (e.g., a user-inputted keyword, a suggested keyword in the recommendation interface, etc.), a URL of websites with content about running, training schedules, marathons, marathon nutrition, etc., and/or applications that a marathon runner would be interested in or would have downloaded onto a mobile device (e.g., a running application, a fitness tracking application, etc.).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the mechanisms can be applied to multiple user accounts that are associated with a content provider. For example, the mechanisms can determine that the content provider is associated with multiple user accounts (e.g., one account per product type or service type) and can generate the recommendation interface to prompt the content provider to create a custom audience for each of the multiple accounts. This can include creating one custom audience that can be applied to one or more of the multiple accounts. This can also include creating different custom audiences for each of the multiple accounts in response to determining that each campaign for each user account is eligible for receiving the recommendation interface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">These and other features for providing audience recommendations are described further in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an illustrative example <b>100</b> of a process for determining whether to present an audience recommendation interface and for generating the audience recommendation interface for prompting the content creator to create a custom audience is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, blocks of process <b>100</b> can be executed by any suitable device, such as a server that hosts media content items and streams media content items to user devices. In some such embodiments, the server can execute blocks of process <b>100</b> to identify one or more campaigns of a user account corresponding to the content provider that is predicted to have an increase in one or more performance metrics in response to the application of a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Process <b>100</b> can begin at <b>102</b> by receiving an indication that a user account associated with a content provider has been authenticated. For example, process <b>100</b> can receive an authentication request that includes user credentials for an audience management interface of a content management platform (e.g., usernames, passwords, and/or any other suitable user credentials). It should be noted that the user account can be the user account associated with a content management platform, the user account associated with an advertisement management platform, the user account that was used to proceed through the payment process in the advertisement management system, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the content provider can be associated with multiple user accounts. In response to authenticating a user account associated with the content provider, process <b>100</b> can determine whether additional user accounts are associated with the content provider and can include campaigns associated with the additional user accounts in determining eligibility for receiving the recommendation interface for creating custom audiences. Alternatively, in some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine that additional user accounts are associated with the content provider and can provide the content provider with an opportunity to select one or more of the user accounts to determine whether associated campaigns are eligible for receiving the recommendation interface for creating custom audiences.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In response to receiving an indication that a user account associated with a content provider has been authenticated, process <b>100</b> can determine whether a campaign associated with the user account meets one or more criterion to receive a recommendation interface for creating a custom audience for one or more promotional content items at <b>120</b>. Such a custom audience can then be applied to the campaign to assist the content provider reach audiences searching for a product or a service associated with the content provider.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described herein, the recommendation interface can be a notification that indicates that a campaign of one or more promotional content items associated with a user account should create and apply a custom audience to the campaign as the custom audience can enhance a performance metric of the campaign. For example, the recommendation interface can prompt the content provider having the user account to create a custom audience using one or more suggested keywords as the application of the custom audience to the campaign is predicted to increase the number of conversions while decreasing the cost per acquisition.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that the custom audience can reach audiences searching for a product or a service associated with the content provider on multiple platforms. For example, one or more promotional content items can be provided to audiences that are searching for terms associated with a product or a service of the content provider (e.g., an advertiser) on a search engine site, a media sharing site, a streaming media platform, an application store, etc. It should be noted that these platforms may be owned and operated by the same entity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should also be noted that any suitable criterion and any suitable combination of criterion can be used to determine whether the recommendation interface that prompts the content provider to create a custom audience for a campaign of one or more promotional content items should be presented.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine whether a custom audience, such as a custom intent audience, has already been created for the campaign. For example, in response to determining that a custom audience has already been created for the campaign, process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider having the user account. In continuing this example, process <b>100</b> can ensure that a single custom audience has been created and assigned to each campaign of the content provider.

For example, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform (e.g., an &#x201c;advertising_channel_type&#x201d; tag having a value of &#x201c;owned_and_operated&#x201d; and/or an &#x201c;advertising_channel_sub_type&#x201d; tag having a value of &#x201c;video_action&#x201d;). In another example, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform in which the promotional content item includes a call-to-action button, a call-to-action headline, or any other suitable element that prompts a response to the promotional content item. In yet another example, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the user account is associated with a video campaign that allows the content provider to reach an audience on a video sharing platform and determine whether the video campaign has received a particular amount of traffic. In continuing this example, process <b>100</b> can determine that the video campaign is eligible for the recommendation interface in response to determining that the video campaign has not received any traffic over a particular time period (e.g., no traffic over the past seven days).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to determining that the campaign is not associated with a particular campaign type (e.g., the campaign is not a video campaign, the campaign has received more than a threshold amount of traffic over a particular time period), process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider having the user account. Otherwise, in response to determining that the campaign is associated with a particular campaign type (e.g., the campaign is a video campaign, the campaign has received no traffic over a particular time period), process <b>100</b> can proceed to another criterion for determining whether the campaign is eligible for receiving a recommendation interface for the creation of a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the campaign associated with the user account has a particular advertising channel type and/or a particular bidding strategy. For example, process <b>100</b> can determine that the user account is associated with a video campaign that is owned and operated by the content provider and that the video campaign is associated with a bidding strategy that sets bids to help the content provider obtain a maximum number of conversions at or below a set cost per action (e.g., a bidding strategy tag having a value of &#x201c;max_conversions&#x201d; or &#x201c;target_CPA&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In response to determining that the campaign is not associated with a particular advertising channel type and/or a particular bidding strategy, process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider having the user account. Otherwise, in response to determining that the campaign is associated with a particular advertising channel type and/or a particular bidding strategy, process <b>100</b> can proceed to another criterion for determining whether the campaign is eligible for receiving a recommendation interface for the creation of a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the campaign is associated with a policy certificate. For example, promotional content items associated with an election or other suitable political content may be allowed to be presented in a particular geographic region if the content provider has been verified. In continuing this example, process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider in response to determining that the campaign is associated with a policy certificate. Otherwise, in response to determining that the campaign is not associated with a policy certificate, process <b>100</b> can proceed to another criterion for determining whether the campaign is eligible for receiving a recommendation interface for the creation of a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine whether a campaign has one or more promotional content items that are deemed to be unsafe. For example, process <b>100</b> can determine that one or more promotional content items within a campaign include offensive or inappropriate content, such as content that relates to violence and self-harm, harassment, racism, hatred and intolerance, and capitalizing on sensitive events or threatened species, etc. In a more particular example, process <b>100</b> can perform an image analysis of the content in the one or more promotional content items within the campaign to determine whether an image in the campaign includes offensive content, inappropriate content, or other content that is deemed as being unsafe. In another more particular example, process <b>100</b> can perform a text analysis of the content in the one or more promotional content items within the campaign to determine whether text in the campaign includes offensive content, inappropriate content, or other content that is deemed as being unsafe.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, process <b>100</b> can filter video campaigns that are determined to include objectionable content, such as violence, pornography, objectionable language, animal abuse, and/or any other type of objectionable content, from being eligible for presenting the recommendation interface. In continuing this example, process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider in response to determining that the video campaign includes objectionable content or any other suitable content that is deemed as being unsafe.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine whether the content provider is associated with websites that are deemed to be sensitive sites. For example, process <b>100</b> can determine that the user account is associated with a website owned by the content provider (e.g., the advertiser) that is considered to be a sensitive website (e.g., a gambling-related website, a religion-related website, a health-related website, etc.). In another example, process <b>100</b> can determine that a promotional content item leads to a website or a landing page that is considered to be a sensitive website.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In response to determining that the content provider is associated with websites that are deemed to be sensitive sites, process <b>100</b> can inhibit or otherwise filter the recommendation interface from being presented to the content provider having the user account.

For example, in response to determining that the user account of the content provider has a campaign that is not associated with at least one custom audience, that is not associated with an election certificate, that is not associated with an unsafe creative, that is not associated with a website that is deemed to be sensitive, and that has not received any traffic within a particular time period, process <b>100</b> can determine that the campaign is eligible for receiving the recommendation interface to create a custom audience.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine one or more performance metrics in response to applying a custom audience to the campaign at <b>130</b>. For example, prior to presenting a recommendation interface to a content provider, process <b>100</b> can determine whether one or more performance metrics are enhanced by more than a threshold value in response to applying a custom audience to the campaign. In another example, process <b>100</b> can predict one or more performance metrics for the campaign in response to applying a custom audience to the campaign in order to provide the content provider with a reason to create a custom audience. In a more particular example, process <b>100</b> can determine a predicted change in one or more performance metrics upon application of the custom audience, such as a 74% higher conversion rate at a 12% lower cost acquisition or a 3.2% chance of increasing the conversion rate while decreasing the cost per acquisition.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that, although the embodiments described herein include conversions and cost per acquisition as performance metrics, this is merely illustrative and any suitable performance metric can be used to determine whether to present a recommendation interface to a content provider. For example, the performance metrics can include a cost per impression (CPI) or cost per thousand impressions (CPM), where an impression may be counted, for example, whenever a content item is selected to be served for presentation with a resource. In some instances, the performance metric can include a click-through rate (CTR), defined as the number of clicks on the content item divided by the number of impressions. In some instances, the performance metrics can include a cost per engagement (CPE), where an engagement may be counted when a user interacts with the content item in a specified way. An engagement can be sharing a link to the content item on a social networking site, submitting an email address, taking a survey, and watching a video to completion. Still other performance metrics, such as cost per action (CPA) (where an action may be clicking on the content item or a link therein, a purchase of a product, a referral of the content item, etc.), conversion rate (CVR), cost per click-through (CPC) (counted when a content item is clicked), cost per sale (CPS), cost per lead (CPL), effective CPM (eCPM), and/or other performance metrics can be used. It should be noted that the various performance metrics can be measured before, during, or after content selection, content presentation, user click, or user engagement.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can determine that a campaign associated with the user account is eligible for receiving the recommendation interface in response to determining that one or more performance metrics of the campaign upon application of the custom audience are predicted to increase by more than a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally or alternatively, process <b>100</b> can determine the one or more performance metrics of the campaign upon application of the custom audience and can include the one or more predicted performance metrics in the recommendation interface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can, at <b>140</b>, generate a recommendation interface that prompts the content provider to create a custom audience for application to the eligible campaign in response to determining that the campaign associated with the user account meets the one or more criterion and/or in response to determining that the performance metrics of the campaign are predicted to increase by more than a threshold value upon applying the custom audience to the campaign.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the recommendation interface can be generated in the form of a notification or any other suitable alert to the content provider. For example, in response to logging into a content management platform, a recommendation interface that prompts the user to create a custom audience can be presented in the form of a pop-up notification.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a more particular example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an illustrative example of a recommendation interface in the form of a notification that can be presented to the content provider. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, notification <b>210</b> can be presented within the interface of the content management platform and can indicate that creating and applying a custom audience to a campaign associated with the user account can increase conversions at a lower acquisition cost by reaching users that search for a product or a service of the content provider on multiple properties or platforms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, a recommendation interface can be generated that indicates that application of a custom audience can increase the performance of campaigns of multiple user accounts that are associated with the content provider. For example, as described above, process <b>100</b> can determine that the content provider is associated with multiple user accounts in response to authenticating to a single user account. In continuing this example, process <b>100</b> can then determine that campaigns in each of these multiple user accounts are eligible for creating custom audiences. In response, process <b>100</b> can generate a notification indicating that campaigns in each of these multiple user accounts are eligible for creating custom audiences. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an illustrative example of a recommendation interface in the form of a notification that can be presented to the content provider. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, notification <b>220</b> can be presented within the interface of the content management platform and can indicate that creating and applying a custom audience to campaigns in multiple accounts (e.g., X accounts) can increase conversions at a lower acquisition cost by reaching users that search for a product or a service of the content provider on multiple properties or platforms.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the recommendation interface can be generated in the form of a card interface to the content provider.

Additionally or alternatively, card interface <b>310</b> can be presented in a mobile application corresponding to the content management platform and can indicate that creating and applying a custom audience to a campaign associated with the user account can increase conversions at a lower acquisition cost by reaching users that search for a product or a service of the content provider on multiple properties or platforms.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It should be noted that card interface <b>310</b> can include any suitable reasons for prompting the content provider to create a custom audience. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, card interface <b>310</b> can indicate that the recommendation interface was generated because the content provider has one or more campaigns that may benefit from creating a custom intent audience. In another example, card interface <b>310</b> can indicate that the recommendation interface was generated because the content provider has campaigns with a conversion goal or campaigns that use high-performing keywords to drive lower funnel actions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, card interface <b>310</b> can include any suitable number of recommendations for creating a custom audience. For example, in some embodiments, card interface <b>310</b> can allow the content provider to input keywords, URLs, and/or applications relating to the audience that the one or more promotional content items in the campaign are intending to be reached. In another example, in some embodiments, card interface <b>310</b> can include one or more suggested keywords that, upon selection, can insert the suggested keyword as an input to create the custom audience. For example, in response to selecting a suggested keyword, the keyword can be used to creating an audience that fits the need of the campaign. In a more particular example, based on campaign goals and bidding strategy of a campaign, process <b>100</b> can interpret the selected keywords to choose an audience that is focused on reach, consideration, and/or performance. In continuing this example, rather than reaching a sports fan affinity audience, a running shoe entity may want to reach marathon runners instead. The shoe company entity can define this audience of marathon runners by entering and/or selecting keywords (e.g., a user-inputted keyword, a suggested keyword in the recommendation interface, etc.), a URL of websites with content about running, training schedules, marathons, marathon nutrition, etc., and/or applications that a marathon runner would be interested in or would have downloaded onto a mobile device (e.g., a running application, a fitness tracking application, etc.).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that, in some embodiments, multiple recommendations can be provided for creating a custom audience to be applied to the campaign. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, four recommendations can be presented within card interface <b>310</b> for selection by the content provider. In a more particular example, each recommendation can include a proposed custom audience, a proposed set of keywords, URLs, and/or applications that describe the audience that the campaign intends to reach.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, card interface <b>310</b> can include one or more performance metrics <b>330</b>. For example, card interface <b>310</b> can include the predicted change in the performance metrics upon application of a custom audience to the campaign. For example, in addition to prompting the user to create a custom audience for application to a campaign, card interface can indicate a predicted change in one or more performance metrics upon application of the custom audience (e.g., a 74% higher conversion rate at a 12% lower cost acquisition, a 3.2% chance of increasing the conversion rate while decreasing the cost per acquisition, etc.).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be noted that, in some embodiments, process <b>100</b> can provide the content provider with the opportunity to indicate which performance metrics are important to the content provider.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, recommendation interface <b>410</b> can prompt the content provider to begin the process of creating a custom audience. In a more particular example, recommendation interface <b>410</b> indicates that the content provider can create a custom audience that uses search keywords selected by the content provider, that the content provider can amplify a search audience for the campaign with action-oriented video formats, that the content provider can extend reach and capture attention during an active purchase decision, etc.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, in response to selecting the recommendation interface, process <b>100</b> can prompt the user to create the custom audience by inputting and/or selecting keywords, URLs, and/or applications that describe the intended audience.

For example, in some embodiments, in response to receiving keywords, URLs, and/or applications that have been inputted or selected by the content provider, process <b>100</b> can generate the suggested keywords based on the initial input. In a more particular example, in response to selecting a recommendation interface to create a custom audience, the recommendation interface can pre-populate with the suggested keywords. In response, the content provider can accept one or more of the suggested keywords by selecting one or more of the suggested keywords for inclusion in the custom audience.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, as described above, the recommendation interface can be generated that indicates that the application of a custom audience can improve the campaigns of multiple user accounts that are associated with the content provider.
