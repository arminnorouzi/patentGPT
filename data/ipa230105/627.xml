Cartilage lesions, particularly in weight-bearing joints, often fail to heal on their own and can be associated with pain, loss of joint function, and long-term complications such as osteoarthritis. In the United States, 1.2 million patients per year are diagnosed with a knee cartilage lesion, while only 550,000 patients per year receive knee cartilage repair surgery. Still, there is a significant satisfaction gap of patients diagnosed with cartilage injury, who decline current surgical standard-of-care due to poor outcomes and long rehabilitation&#x2014;more than 30% of micro-fracture surgeries fail. Furthermore, osteochondral injuries are considered by some to be not just naturally but also therapeutically irreversible with current treatment parameters. Inferior repair commonly occurs, with stable regeneration of hyaline cartilage being a rare outcome. Accordingly, unmet needs in cartilage lesion repair include improved joint function and pain-reduction, higher effectiveness of intervention, faster return to weight-bearing and normal activities, shorter rehabilitation time, long-term implant effectiveness, applicability to a wide range of patients and variety of lesions, repair by a single surgery, and rapid surgeon adoption of an effective technique.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some tissue regeneration techniques for cartilage defects range from simple micro-fracture techniques (drilling a multitude of holes through the cartilage defect into subchondral bone) to multistep cartilage transplantation procedures. Regenerative approaches have several shortcomings. For example, they require a long recovery period before allowing the patient to return to full weight-bearing and activity levels, results are highly variable based on individual patient factors such as age and body-mass-index, and they are generally unsuitable for middle-aged or older patients due to poor ability to regenerate hyaline cartilage, often resulting in production of fibro-cartilage having inferior properties. Furthermore, regenerative approaches have not demonstrated any viable method for successful interfacing or anchoring of regenerated cartilage with bone. Many attempts have been made at chondral regeneration and repair or osteo regeneration and repair but have not addressed the osteochondral complex which is relevant to positive clinical outcomes. Additionally, even for those patients with initial benefits, long term results are often elusive. Availability of tissue supply, high costs and the need for multiple surgical procedures are all additional challenges for regenerative approaches. The shortcomings of tissue regeneration techniques have prompted investigations into the use of synthetic implants.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While synthetic materials such as metals and most polymers are generally more durable than the cartilage, they fail to mimic the properties of the native tissue closely enough, and tend to adversely influence the health of the surrounding tissue and damage the opposing cartilage surface under articulation, thereby limiting the lifetime of such implants and hastening failure of the opposing cartilage surface. Other materials fail because they have tear strength that is too low and weak mechanical properties, as compared with cartilage, and often are unable to be properly fixed to the patient's bone in a way that can provide a stable long-term solution. Accordingly, there is a need for new osteochondral implants with improved properties and techniques of repairing focal cartilage defects.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods of repairing articular cartilage defects and osteochondral mimetic implants and systems suitable for use in the methods are disclosed herein. Provided herein are biomimetic osteochondral implants that are multilayered constructs that, through the thickness thereof, mimic the properties (e.g., stiffness) of articular cartilage and, in some implementations, the underlying subchondral bone. The underlying multilayer structure is achieved by multiple zones that are attached together by mechanical connection, chemical bonding, biological adhesion, and/or other attachment mechanisms. Mimicking properties of the cartilage or other tissue to be replaced, as closely as possible, provides benefits such as improved stress transfer from the articulating surface to subchondral bone and, in the case of one-sided repair of a joint, the preservation of the cartilage counterface. The disclosure relates, in part, to the observation that tissues respond to applied loads and the resultant stresses by remodeling. If an osteochondral implant is formed from materials having mechanical properties that differ greatly from the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue, the shape and/or amount of tissue surrounding an implantation site may change, thereby compromising the long-term success of the implant. Accordingly, it is an advantage of this disclosure to provide an osteochondral implant that provides properties similar to the surrounding native cartilage and bone, such that the implant better responds to physiological loads without compromising the health of the native cartilage and bone. In illustrative examples, the implant includes three zones, with an articulating zone, a base zone, and a middle zone, the middle zone having a first surface that attaches to the underside of the articulating zone, a second surface that attaches to the base zone, and a thickness and stiffness between the first and second surfaces that enables the middle zone to absorb part of the articulation load. In some implementations, the middle zone mimics the middle zone of natural cartilage in stiffness, but is hydrophobic and stronger than fibro-cartilage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first aspect, provided herein is a biomimetic osteochondral implant. The implant has a bearing zone, a base zone configured to be attached to bone (e.g., subchondral bone, cancellous bone, sclerotic bone) upon implantation of the implant, and a hydrophobic middle zone positioned between the bearing zone and the base zone. The bearing zone comprises a compliant surface configured for articulation within a diarthrodial or other joint, an under surface, a first thickness extending between the compliant surface and the under surface, and a first compressive modulus with a first stiffness. The middle zone has a shaped first surface, a second surface, and a second thickness extending therebetween, the shaped first surface comprising a perimeter and an external face spaced within the perimeter and attached to the under surface of the bearing zone, wherein the under surface of the bearing zone conforms in shape to the face, and the middle zone further has a second compressive modulus with a second stiffness, the second stiffness being greater than the first stiffness. The base zone has an outer base surface attached to the second surface of the middle zone, an inner base surface configured to attach to bone, and a third thickness extending between the inner base surface and outer base surface, and having a third compressive modulus with a third stiffness, the third stiffness being greater than the second stiffness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some implementations, the bearing zone comprises a biphasic polymer. The biphasic polymer may have a water composition of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or more. In some implementations, the biphasic polymer has a water composition gradient between the compliant surface and the under surface. For example, the water composition gradient has a water composition of less than 10%, less than 5%, or less than 1% at the under surface. For example, the water composition gradient has a water composition of more than 30%, more than 40%, more than 50%, about 40%, about 45%, or about 50% at the compliant surface. For example, the water gradient provides a composition of about 5% water at the under surface and 40% to 50% water at the compliant surface. In some implementations, the compliant surface is lubricious. In some implementations, the under surface is non-lubricious. In some implementations, the bearing zone comprises urethane. In some implementations, the bearing zone includes a water-swellable interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) or semi-IPN, the base zone includes a porous metal, and the middle zone includes a copolymer comprising a urethane dimethacrylate monomer and a monomer selected from methyl methacrylate, acrylamide, and diamethylacrylamide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations, a contact interface formed between the face and the under surface and extending across at least 50% of the face. For example, the contact interface extends across at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, or at least 95% of the face.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, the implant has at least one post structure in the bearing zone, middle zone or base zone. The at least one post structure may have a plurality of posts in the middle zone. For example, the at least one post structure is positioned at the shaped first surface or at the second surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, the implant comprises a central axis extending through the bearing zone, middle zone and base zone, each having an axis and being aligned coaxially along the central axis. In some implementations, the second thickness is variable with a first height extending between the second surface and the first surface at a first position along the first surface, and a second height extending between the second surface and the first surface at a second position along the first surface. For example, the first height has a maximum at a position along the perimeter and the second height has a maximum at a position within the face. The second height may be aligned co-axially with the axis of the base zone. In some implementations, the middle zone is plano-convex or plano-concave. In some implementations, the implant has a tapered region extending along the face from the maximum second height toward the perimeter. In some implementations, the first height maximum is higher than the second height maximum. For example, the tapered region forms a concave curve. In some implementations, the first height maximum is lower than the second height maximum. For example, the tapered region forms a convex curve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the perimeter includes a curved edge extending circumferentially about the central axis. In some implementations, a ridge region extends radially across the face. In some implementations, a plurality of ridges protrude into the under surface. In some implementations, the face includes multiple regions with differing respective radii of curvature.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the second thickness at a position along the perimeter has a boundary height of 0.01 mm to 10 mm, 0.2 mm to 5 mm, or about 1 mm. The second thickness of the middle zone may taper toward the perimeter such that the boundary height is less than 0.1 mm. In some implementations, the bearing zone and middle zone extend axially from the outer base surface to the compliant surface over an axial length of 2 mm to 10 mm or 4 mm to 4.5 mm. In some implementations, the perimeter encompasses an area having a width of 5 mm to 15 mm (where the area is circular, the width is the diameter of the circle). In some implementations, the first thickness is 1 mm to 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations, the second stiffness is 50 MPa to 500 MPa. In some implementations, the first stiffness is 40 MPa to 150 MPa, and the third stiffness is 1.5 GPa to 11 GPa. In some implementations, the bearing zone has a stiffness gradient extending from the under surface to the compliant surface of greater than or equal to 1 kPa/mm. In some implementations, the middle zone is configured to deform between 1% to 20% under physiologic load (e.g., about 3 MPa stress), with repeatable recovery of greater than or equal to 70% of the deformation when the physiological load is removed. In some implementations, the bearing zone has the ability to deform between 1% to 40% under physiological load with repeatable recovery of &#x3e;70% of the deformation when said load is removed. In some implementations, when the bearing layer and middle layer are attached, the implant has the ability to deform between 5% to 20% under physiological loads, with repeatable recovery of greater than or equal to 80% or greater than or equal to 95%.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some implementations, the base zone comprises at least one of a porous metal, a polymer, a ceramic, bone, or synthetic bone. For example, the porous metal comprises one or more of titanium, tantalum, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, a nickel-titanium alloy, or a zirconium alloy; and wherein the polymer comprises one or more of a porous polymer, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyethylene, polysulfone, a poly ester, a polyether imide polypropylene, or any other suitable engineering polymer or porous polymer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations, the inner base surface is configured to be attached to a distal femur. In some implementations, the inner base surface is configured to be attached to a proximal tibia region. The implant may be adapted to repair or replace cartilage or cartilage and bone in a diarthrodial or other joint in the body, such as a knee joint (e.g., a condyle, a patellofemoral joint, a total knee joint, a meniscus, a patella, or a tibial plateau), ankle joint (e.g., talar or tibial surfaces), an elbow joint (e.g., proximal ulna, distal humerus, or radial head), a shoulder joint (e.g., a labrum, a glenoid, a humeral head or any portion thereof), a hand joint (e.g., a metacarpal joint, a finger joint, a thumb joint, or a base of thumb joint), a hip joint (e.g., the acetabular surface, a femoral head or a portion of either surface), a foot joint (e.g., a metatarsal joint or a toe joint), a jaw joint (e.g., a temporomandibular joint), a wrist joint, and a vertebral joint (e.g., an intervertebral facet joint). In some implementations, the bearing and middle zones are deployed on the outer base surface, and the base zone is metal or polymer and configured with a pre-formed attachment mechanism (e.g., a screw, post, digitation, or other component) on one end (e.g., the distal or proximal femur) that can attach mechanically to the bone, for example by screwing, posting, interdigitation or otherwise. In other applications, the implant is deployed by integration into an existing joint replacement component, for example a metal or polymer femoral head in a hip repair. In such cases, the existing metal or polymer implant (e.g., the femoral head), already attached to the bone (e.g., the proximal femur) in a previous surgery, serves as the base zone, and an implant having preformed bearing and middle zones (as disclosed herein) is attached directly to that existing metal or polymer base zone.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, provided herein is a method for repairing a cartilage lesion on an articulating surface within an orthopedic joint (e.g., a diarthrodial joint) comprising subchondral or other bone. The lesion is at least partially surrounded by exterior cartilage on the articulating surface, and a portion of the exterior cartilage provides a region with a native tissue line for articulation. The method comprising the steps of (i) preparing a surgical site in the exterior cartilage region by removing at least a portion of the cartilage surrounding the lesion and leaving a hole that extends through the exterior cartilage region and into the bone, wherein the hole in the exterior cartilage has an inside diameter; (ii) providing an biomimetic osteochondral implant comprising a bearing zone and a base construct, the bearing zone having an under surface and a compliant surface with an outer face and a first perimeter having an outside diameter, the compliant surface configured to change shape upon articulation within the joint so the outer face conforms in shape to an opposing surface of the orthopedic joint; (iii) passing the implant into the hole and into bone so that the base construct interfaces directly with the bone; and (iv) anchoring the implant to the bone so that the outer face of the compliant surface is offset in height relative to the native tissue line of the exterior cartilage. It should be understood that the implant may be anchored such that the offset is zero at one or more locations along the compliant surface. The implant may be the implant according to any of the implementations of the first or second aspects.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the bearing zone comprises a biphasic polymer. The biphasic polymer may have a water composition of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30% or more. In some implementations, the biphasic polymer has a water composition gradient between the compliant surface and the under surface. The composition gradient is configured so that the composition of water changes along the thickness of the biphasic polymer, from its compliant external surface at one end to its internal under surface, with a bulk region in between, so as to provide a proper connection to the hydrophobic middle layer and the hydrophilic articulating surface. The gradient includes a water composition at the compliant surface, a water composition at the under surface, and a bulk water composition extending between the compliant surface and the under surface. In some implementations, the water composition is highest at the compliant surface and lowest at the under surface (e.g., near 0), forming an essentially hydrophobic interface with the middle layer of the construct, with the bulk water composition being at a level in between that of the two surfaces. The water composition at the compliant surface can be adjusted as needed in combination with adjustment of the rest of the gradient. In some implementations, the water composition at the compliant surface is at least 25%, and may be higher, while the water composition at the under surface is low (e.g., less than 10%, less than 5%, or less than 1% (or even approach 0 or is 0)). The bulk water composition is distributed at an operating condition that provides an optimal aqueous balance and transition between the hydrophilic compliant surface and the hydrophobic under surface. In implementations, the bulk water composition is in the 25%-41% range (e.g., 27-34%) and may be distributed as a gradient between that range, so as to provide a smooth transition between the compliant surface and the under surface, or may be distributed at a generally constant level at a point within the range (e.g., 27, or 34%). In some implementations, the compliant surface is lubricious. In some implementations, the under surface is non-lubricious. In some implementations, the bearing zone comprises polyurethane. In some implementations, the implant is plano-convex (flat on one side and convex on the other) or plano-concave (flat on one side and concave on the other). In some implementations, the base construct comprises a porous metal. In some implementations, the bearing zone comprises a stiffness gradient between the compliant surface and the under surface. For example, the stiffness gradient comprises a stiffness at the compliant surface that is less than a stiffness at the under surface, where stiffness varies between the compliant surface and the under surface.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some implementations, the bearing zone is a first polymeric layer disposed between the compliant surface and the under surface, and wherein the base construct comprises a porous layer configured to attach directly to the bone and second polymeric layer attached to the first polymeric layer at a middle interface between the under surface and a shaped surface of the second polymeric layer, such that the second layer is disposed between the middle interface and the porous layer. In some implementations, the first polymeric layer has a first stiffness and the second polymeric layer has a second stiffness, and wherein the second stiffness is greater than the first stiffness. The porous layer may have a third stiffness greater than the second stiffness. In some implementations, the second polymeric layer comprises a copolymer of urethane dimethacrylate monomer comprising a hard segment and a soft segment, and methyl methacrylate monomer. For example, the hard segment of the urethane dimethacrylate of the first polymeric adhesive is formed from one or more of 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), 2,6 toluene diisocyanate or 2,4 toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 3,3-bitoluene diisocyanate (TODI), cyclohexyl diisocyanate (CHDI), hexamethyl diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), methylene bis(p-phenyl) isocyanate, methylene diphenylisocyanate (MDI), and methylene bis (p-cyclohexyl) isocyanate (HMDI). For example, the soft segment of the urethane dimethacrylate monomer is formed from one or more of polybutadiene, polyethylene oxide (PEO), hydroxy terminated butadiene, hydroxybutyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), hydroxyl terminated polyisobutylene, poly(1,6-hexyl-1,2-ethyl carbonate), polycaprolactone, polycarbonate, polyethylene adipate, polyhexamethylene carbonate glycol, polypropylene oxide (PPO), polytetramethylene adipate, poly(dimethylsiloxane), and poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO). In some implementations, the first polymeric layer is a water-swellable interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) or semi-IPN that comprises a first polymeric network comprising the thermoplastic polymer and a second polymeric network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some implementations, the surgical site is at the distal femur, the proximal tibia, the patella, the distal tibia, distal fibula, calcaneus, talus, the tibiofibular joint, the proximal humerus, the glenoid, the proximal femur, the pelvis, the distal humerus, the proximal ulna, the proximal radius, the distal radius, the distal ulna, the carpals, the distal metacarpal, the proximal phalanx, the metatarsal, or other joint surfaces having articular cartilage. In some implementations, the lesion is partially or fully surrounded by tissue.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, step (i) comprises using at least one of an awl, a surgical drill, a burr, a reamer, an alignment guide, a pin, an incisor, a cutter, or a wire. Step (i) may comprise inserting a wire or a pin into the lesion via a guide; placing a drill, a burr, or a reamer over the wire or pin; and forming the hole using the drill, burr, or reamer. In some implementations, step (i) is performed with a single instrument, such as a self-guided surgical drill having a reamer function, so that instrument changes during the procedure are minimized. In some implementations, step (i) comprises resurfacing of the bone within the hole. In some implementations, the method further comprises, before step (iii), checking a depth of the hole. For example, checking the depth comprises inserting a trial implant into the hole, the trial implant mimicking the implant. In some implementations, step (iii) comprises using an implant inserting device which releasably holds the implant. In some implementations, step (iv) comprises using a mallet and a tamp to fully seat the implant within the hole. In some implementations, one or more of steps (i)-(iv) are performed through an arthroscope. In some implementations, the method further comprises closing the surgical site.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hole may be shaped such that the implant has a press-fit in the hole when anchored. In some implementations, at least part of the compliant surface is offset from the native tissue line in a direction distal to the bone. In some implementations, at least part of the compliant surface is offset from the native tissue line in a direction proximal to the bone. In some implementations, the bearing zone is aligned laterally along the first perimeter with the exterior cartilage, such that the bearing zone is in contact with the exterior cartilage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing and other objects and advantages will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a vertical cross-section of a three-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant, according to an illustrative implementation; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an exploded view of the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts a vertical cross-section of a three-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant, according to an alternative illustrative implementation;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts a two-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant, according to an illustrative implementation; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the two-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts a three-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant according to an illustrative implementation, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the three-layered biomimetic osteochondral implant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> depict an biomimetic osteochondral implant, according to an illustrative implementation, after insertion into an implantation site having a convex articular surface.

Although the embodiments and features described herein are specifically described for use in connection with cartilage lesion repair, it will be understood that all the components and other features outlined below may be combined with one another in any suitable manner and may be adapted and applied to other types of medical therapy, patient health, and material construction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Certain terms are used herein to describe various aspects of the disclosure. Some definitions are provided for ease of reference, and others are provided by the use of terms in context throughout the application. It should be understood that the scope of terms includes any species known to those skilled in the art, whether specifically recited or not.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, &#x201c;carboxylic acid groups&#x201d; may refer to both non-ionized (protonated) and ionized (carboxylate) forms of these groups. For purposes of this application, &#x201c;sulfonic acid groups&#x201d; may refer to both non-ionized (protonated) and ionized (sulfonate) forms of these groups.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, an &#x201c;interpenetrating polymer network&#x201d; or &#x201c;IPN&#x201d; is a material comprising two or more polymer networks which are at least partially interlaced on a molecular scale, but not covalently bonded to each other, and cannot be separated unless chemical bonds are broken. A &#x201c;semi-interpenetrating polymer network&#x201d; or &#x201c;semi-IPN&#x201d; is a material comprising one or more polymer networks and one or more linear or branched polymers characterized by the penetration on a molecular scale of at least one of the networks by at least some of the linear or branched macromolecules. Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks are distinguished from interpenetrating polymer networks because the constituent linear or branched polymers can, in principle, be separated from the constituent polymer network(s) without breaking chemical bonds; they are polymer blends.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; is a substance with repeating single species units, including homopolymers (a polymer derived from one species of monomer) and copolymers (a polymer derived from more than one species of monomer). A &#x201c;hydrophobic polymer&#x201d; may be a pre-formed polymer network having at least one of the following two properties: (1) a surface water contact angle of at least 45&#xb0; and (2) exhibits water absorption of 2.5% or less after 24 hours at room temperature according to ASTM test standard D570. A &#x201c;hydrophilic polymer&#x201d; may be a polymer network having a surface water contact angle less than 45&#xb0; and exhibits water absorption of more than 2.5% after 24 hours at room temperature according to ASTM test standard D570. An &#x201c;ionic polymer&#x201d; is as a polymer comprised of macromolecules containing ionic monomers (e.g., monomers with carboxylate group, sulfonate groups, or both), ionizable monomers (e.g., monomers with protonated carboxyl groups, protonated sulfonate groups, or both), or both ionic monomers and ionizable monomers, typically, at least 2% by weight ionic or ionizable monomers (or both), irrespective of their nature and location. A &#x201c;thermoplastic polymer&#x201d; is one which melts or flows when heated and can be re-melted repeatedly to form other shapes or products, unlike thermoset polymers which can only be heated and formed once. Thermoplastic polymers may be covalently (chemically) crosslinked. &#x201c;Phase separation&#x201d; is defined as the conversion of a single-phase system into a multi-phase system; for example, the separation of two immiscible blocks of a block co-polymer into two phases, with the possibility of a small interphase in which a small degree of mixing occurs.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;About&#x201d; can be understood to mean plus or minus 20% of a value.

The implants are constructed to have a modular, layered structure in which the physical properties (e.g., stiffness and lubricity) and dimensions of each layer can be adjusted (e.g., by using the appropriate material and controlling the thickness and stiffness thereof) based on the anatomy to be replaced. For example, the material and or thicknesses of the layers can be selected to approximate the physical properties, function and dimensions of cartilage (and, optionally, chondral and subchondral bone), such that the implant is cartilage mimetic. Also provided herein are methods of treatment involving the use of biomimetic osteochondral implants to repair an osteochondral defect in a joint.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The biomimetic osteochondral implants of the present disclosure can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the specific joint in which the implant is to be deployed. The implant may be adapted to repair or replace cartilage or cartilage and bone in a joint in the body, such as a knee joint (e.g., a condyle, a patellofemoral joint, a total knee joint, a meniscus, a patella, or a tibial plateau), ankle joint (e.g., talar or tibial surfaces), an elbow joint (e.g., proximal ulna, distal humerus, or radial head), a shoulder joint (e.g., a labrum, a glenoid, a humeral head or any portion thereof), a hand joint (e.g., a metacarpal joint, a finger joint, a thumb joint, or a base of thumb joint), a hip joint (e.g., the acetabular surface, a femoral head or a portion of either surface), a foot joint (e.g., a metatarsal joint or a toe joint), a jaw joint (e.g., a temporomandibular joint), a wrist joint, and a vertebral joint (e.g., an intervertebral facet joint). In some applications, the implant may be deployed by integration with an existing joint replacement component, for example a metal or polymer femoral head that may have been placed in a previous hip repair. In such cases, the existing metal or polymer implant (e.g., the femoral head which is itself joined to a femoral stem), already attached to the bone (e.g., the proximal femur) in the previous surgery, serves as the base zone, and an implant having bearing and middle zones (as disclosed herein) is attached directly to that existing metal or polymer base zone. In some implementations, the base zone is configured as a metal or polymer with a pre-formed attachment mechanism (e.g., a screw, post, digitation, or other component) on one end (e.g., the distal or proximal femur) and configured to attach mechanically to the bone, for example by screwing, posting, interdigitation or otherwise. Plasma coating or other porous layer may also be applied to one or more surfaces of the base zone and middle zone. The base zone can accordingly be configured as a ball, disc, cylinder, or other shape appropriate to provide suitable anchoring force to the base, e.g., as a triangle, quadrilateral. While examples provided herein describe use of the implant in repair of a diarthrodial joint, it should be understood that the implant may also be used for repair of other tissues and joints, including but not limited to the spine, the meniscus, and other bone or cartilage structures. The implant may articulate against native tissue or against another implant (e.g., an implant according to the present disclosure, a ceramic implant, a metal (e.g., CoCr) implant, or a polymer implant (e.g., PEEK or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) implant). For example, a joint injury may be repaired by implanting two biomimetic osteochondral implants on the opposing surfaces of the joint. The entirety of one or both of the opposing surfaces may be replaced.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the biomimetic osteochondral implant, or a portion thereof (e.g., the lubricious top surface; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), defines a circular profile. In some embodiments, the biomimetic osteochondral implant, or a portion thereof (e.g., the lubricious top surface; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>), for example, defines an elongated oval profile. Other non-limiting examples of shapes that the biomimetic osteochondral implant (or a portion thereof) may take are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>J</figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, the biomimetic osteochondral implant is shaped as a plug (e.g., a cylindrical plug) for partial resurfacing of joint surfaces. In some implementations, the biomimetic osteochondral implant includes a stem portion formed on or attached to the bone-contacting surface (i.e., the bottom surface a base) of the implant adapted for insertion into a hole or opening in a bone. The stem may be press fit into a hole or opening in the bone, leaving the lubricious top surface of the implant to be exposed to act as prosthetic cartilage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the biomimetic osteochondral implant is axisymmetric or symmetric along one or more vertical planes. For example, it can be cylindrical with a dome shape on its outer surface with a single radius of curvature. Alternatively, it can have two or more radii of curvature. For example, the implant has a radius of curvature in one plane and a larger radius of curvature in a perpendicular plan, thus making it more &#x201c;sloped&#x201d; in one direction and less sloped in the perpendicular plane. In a natural joint surface such as the condyle of the knee, there may be two major curvature planes, one that runs along the flexion/extension axis of the knee (referred to herein as &#x201c;the major radius&#x201d;), and the other that is perpendicular to this plane, which has a smaller radius of curvature (&#x201c;the minor radius&#x201d;). There may also be more than two radii of curvature. These radii of curvature may also vary depending on the exact location on the joint surface. For example, an implant may be placed within an osteochondral defect that approximates the curvature(s) of the surrounding joint surface. Over time within the joint, the compliant surface reshapes under physiologic loads, such that the lubricious top surface takes on the radius or radii of curvature of the surrounding joint surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B</figref>). The biomimetic osteochondral implants of the present disclosure can adapt to any joint geometries, including substantially convex joint surfaces, substantially concave joint surfaces, substantially flat joint surfaces, or joint surfaces that have both convex and concave curvatures. Thus, the implant can, e.g., start convex and become more convex, flat, or concave depending on the shape of the surrounding joint surface; start flat and become concave or convex; or start concave and become even more concave (more steeply curved).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, an axisymmetric implant having a single radius of curvature is inserted into an implantation site in which the natural cartilage has a radius of curvature that differs from that of the implant. Post-implantation, a compliant surface of the implant reshapes under physiologic loads, and the radius of curvature of the implant substantially matches the radius of curvature of the natural cartilage, which results in a smooth continuity of curvature for the repaired joint on and around the implant.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, an axisymmetric implant having a single radius of curvature is inserted into an implantation site in which the natural cartilage has two radii of curvature that differ from that of the implant.

The implant <b>100</b> includes a bearing zone <b>102</b>, a middle zone <b>106</b>, and a base zone <b>112</b>. Bearing zone <b>102</b> has a compliant surface <b>104</b>, an under surface <b>105</b> opposite compliant surface <b>104</b>, a first thickness <b>103</b> extending between compliant surface <b>104</b> and under surface <b>105</b>, and a first compressive modulus with a first stiffness.

The shaped first surface comprises a perimeter <b>110</b> and an external face <b>111</b> spaced within perimeter <b>110</b>. External face <b>111</b> and under surface <b>105</b> are attached (e.g., mechanically connected, chemically bonded, biologically affixed, or otherwise attached). As illustrated, the under surface <b>105</b> conforms in shape to face <b>111</b>. Base zone <b>112</b> has an outer base surface <b>114</b> attached to second surface <b>109</b>, an inner base surface <b>115</b> opposite outer base surface <b>114</b> and configured to attach to bone <b>116</b>, a third thickness <b>113</b> extending between outer base surface <b>114</b> and inner base surface <b>115</b>, and a third compressive modulus with a third stiffness greater than the second stiffness. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows an exploded view of the layers of implant <b>100</b>.

It is understood that any convex and concave surfaces, such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> or elsewhere herein, may be asymmetric or symmetric.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Various materials may be used to construct each of the layers of implant <b>100</b>. Suitable materials include polymers, ceramics, metals, synthetic bone, regenerated tissue, and other suitable materials. Suitable materials for bearing zone <b>102</b> in particular may include materials that have lubricious properties. For example, bearing zone <b>102</b> is constructed from a material that provides a lubricious compliant surface <b>104</b> and a non-lubricious under surface <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some implementations, one of the layers, such as bearing zone <b>102</b>, comprises a biphasic polymer including a polymer and water. For example, the biphasic polymer may have a water composition of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, or at least 60%. The biphasic polymer may have a water composition that is distributed consistently throughout the bearing zone <b>102</b>, or the water may be distributed in a gradient extending within the bearing zone, for example from one surface to an opposite surface, or extending only partially within the bearing zone. The water composition gradient is configured so that the composition of water changes along the thickness of the zone, from its compliant external surface at one end to its internal under surface, with a bulk region in between, so as to provide a proper connection to the hydrophobic middle layer and the hydrophilic articulating surface. More particularly, the gradient includes a first water composition at the compliant surface, a second water composition at the under surface, and a bulk water composition extending between those two surfaces. In some implementations, for example those useful for repairing diarthrodial joints, the water is distributed in the bearing zone so the water composition is highest at the compliant surface and lowest at the under surface (e.g., at or near 0), to provide an essentially hydrophobic, non-lubricious interface with the middle layer of the construct, with the bulk water being distributed at a composition in between the respective water compositions of the two surfaces. That arrangement provides a lubricious interface for joint articulation, on one side, and a hydrophobic, non-lubricious connection surface to the middle layer on the other side of the bearing zone. The water composition at the compliant surface can be adjusted as needed in combination with adjustment of the rest of the gradient. For example, the water gradient may extend between compliant surface <b>104</b> and under surface <b>105</b>. The water gradient may range from less than 1% at one part in the biphasic polymer to at least 20%, or at least 30%, or at least 40% at another part in the biphasic polymer, for example the gradient may have a water composition of less than 1% at a hydrophobic side (e.g., at under surface <b>105</b> which, in a distal femoral implant, may be at a position just proximal of the interface with the middle zone), and at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% at an opposite, more hydrophilic side (e.g., at compliant surface <b>104</b>, which in the distal femoral implant is the articulating surface of the bearing zone). In some implementations, the water composition at the compliant surface is at least 25%, and may be higher (e.g., 40-50%, e.g., 40%, 45% or 50%, or even 60% to 80%), providing the lubricious quality; while the water composition at the under surface is low (e.g., less than 10%, less than 5%, or less than 1% (or even approach 0 or is 0)), providing the non-lubricious quality. In the bulk region, the bulk water composition is distributed at an operating condition that provides an optimal aqueous balance and transition between the hydrophilic compliant surface and the hydrophobic under surface. In implementations, the bulk water composition is in the 25%-41% range (e.g., 27-34%) and may be distributed as a gradient between that range, so as to provide a smooth transition between the compliant surface and the under surface, or may be distributed at a generally constant level between the two surfaces, for example at a point within the range (e.g., 27, or 34%).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The biphasic polymer may be a water-swellable interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) or semi-IPN that comprises a first polymeric network comprising the thermoplastic polymer and a second polymeric network comprising a polymer having carboxylic acid groups or derivatives thereof, wherein the IPN or semi-IPN has a concentration of the carboxylic acid groups or derivatives thereof that is at maximum at the compliant surface <b>104</b> and decreases to zero or substantially zero within a bulk of the IPN or semi-IPN. The carboxylic acid groups or derivatives thereof may include underivatized carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic-acid-derivatized carboxylic acid groups, or a mixture thereof. For example, the polymer having carboxylic acid groups or derivatives thereof is formed from one or more monomers selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, linolenic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and derivatives thereof. The carboxylic acid groups may be completely underivatized or may include sulfonic-acid derivatized carboxylic acid groups (a mixture of underivatized and derivatized groups, or the groups are completely derivatized). The sulfonic-acid derivatized carboxylic acid groups maybe taurine-derivatized carboxylic acid groups. In some implementations, the thermoplastic polymer is not water-based but functionally conformable to the joint geometry and sufficiently biocompatible so as to be used instead of biphasic polymer, for example polyurethane, e.g., polyether urethane or other forms of polyurethane, in the bearing zone of a construct.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, a layer, such as middle zone <b>106</b>, comprises urethane or a urethane-based material. In some implementations, the urethane-based material is a copolymer of urethane dimethacrylate monomer comprising a hard segment and a soft segment, and methyl methacrylate monomer. For example, middle zone <b>106</b> may be formed from a copolymer of about 60% (w/w) to about 99% (w/w) (e.g., about 60% (w/w) to about 80% (w/w)) urethane dimethacrylate monomer, and about 1% (w/w) to about 40% (w/w) (20% (w/w) to about 40% (w/w)) methyl methacrylate monomer. In some implementations, the hard segment of the urethane dimethacrylate of the first polymeric adhesive is formed from one or more of 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), 2,6 toluene diisocyanate or 2,4 toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 3,3-bitoluene diisocyanate (TODI), cyclohexyl diisocyanate (CHDI), hexamethyl diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), methylene bis(p-phenyl) isocyanate, methylene diphenylisocyanate (MDI), and methylene bis (p-cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI). In some implementations, the soft segment of the urethane dimethacrylate monomer is formed from one or more of polybutadiene, polyethylene oxide (PEO), hydroxy terminated butadiene, hydroxybutyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), hydroxyl terminated polyisobutylene, poly(1,6-hexyl-1,2-ethyl carbonate), polycaprolactone, polycarbonate, polyethylene adipate, polyhexamethylene carbonate glycol, polypropylene oxide (PPO), polytetramethylene adipate, poly(dimethylsiloxane), and poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO). For example, the hard segment of the urethane dimethacrylate monomer may be formed from MDI and the soft segment of the urethane dimethacrylate may be formed from PTMO. In some implementations, the soft segment of the urethane dimethacrylate of the polymeric adhesive layer may be formed from a mixture of PTMO having different molecular weights, e.g., molecular weights ranging from about 500 Da to about 1250 Da.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some implementations, a layer of implant <b>100</b>, such as base zone <b>112</b>, comprises a metal (e.g., titanium, tantalum, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, nickel-titanium, zirconium, or alloys thereof), a polymer (e.g., PEEK, PE, PS, or PP), a ceramic, bone, or synthetic bone. Base zone <b>112</b> may be attached to bone <b>116</b> via mechanical or physical means (such as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>H</figref>) immediately upon implantation.

In some implementations, implant <b>100</b> comprises a central axis extending through bearing zone <b>102</b>, middle zone <b>106</b>, and base zone <b>112</b>, each of which having an axis and being aligned coaxially along the central axis.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some implementations, second thickness <b>107</b> is variable with a first height extending between second surface <b>109</b> and first surface <b>108</b> at a first position along first surface <b>108</b> and a second height extending between second surface <b>109</b> and first surface <b>108</b> at a second position along first surface <b>108</b>. The first height may have a maximum at a position along perimeter <b>110</b> and the second height has a maximum at a position within external face <b>111</b>. For example, the second height with the maximum at the position within external face <b>111</b> may be aligned coaxially with the axis of bearing zone <b>102</b>, the axis of middle zone <b>106</b>, or the axis of base zone <b>112</b>.

For example, first thickness <b>103</b>, second thickness <b>107</b>, or third thickness <b>113</b> may each have one or more heights of between 0.01 mm and 25 mm, 1 mm and 20 mm, 5 mm and 15 mm, 3 mm and 4.5 mm, 5 and 10 mm, about 1 mm, about 5 mm, about 10 mm, or about 15 mm. As discussed above, second thickness <b>107</b>, or the other thicknesses, may also vary in height. First thickness <b>103</b>, second thickness <b>107</b>, or third thickness <b>113</b> may each have a boundary height of 0.01 mm to 10 mm at a position along perimeter <b>110</b>. The boundary height may be 0.1 mm to 5 mm, 0.2 to 5 mm, 1 to 5 mm, about 1 mm, about 2 mm, about 3 mm, about 4 mm, or about 5 mm. In some implementations, the first height is about 1 mm. In some implementations, first thickness <b>103</b>, second thickness <b>107</b>, or third thickness <b>113</b> tapers toward perimeter <b>110</b> such that the boundary height is less than 0.1 mm, but the implant <b>100</b> has a thickness positioned inside the boundary, away from the perimeter, which is much higher than the boundary height, for example between 2 and 10 times higher than the boundary height. The thickness may alternatively taper inward such that the boundary height is taller than the height of the interior thickness inside the boundary. Bearing zone <b>102</b> and middle zone <b>106</b> may extend axially from outer base surface <b>114</b> to compliant surface <b>104</b> over an axial length of 1 mm to 10 mm, 2 mm to 8 mm, 4 mm to 6 mm, or about 5 mm. Implant <b>100</b> may have a width (or its perimeter <b>110</b> may encompass an area) of 5 mm to 25 mm, 5 mm to 15 mm, or about 10 mm, and may be aligned to perpendicularly intersect the central axis.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As noted above, the stiffness of middle zone <b>106</b> is greater than the stiffness of bearing zone <b>102</b>, and the stiffness of base zone <b>112</b> is greater than the stiffness of the middle zone, thereby providing a stiffness gradient that increases from the bearing zone to the base zone, similar to what may be found in normal cartilage and osteochondral units. The variation in stiffness between zones can be quite high. In some implementations, the bearing zone stiffness is 40 MPa to 150 MPa. In some implementations, the middle zone stiffness is 50 MPa to 500 MPa, while in some implementations, the base zone stiffness is 1.5 GPa to 11 GPa. In some implementations, the middle zone stiffness is at least 1 to 20 times, 1 to 15 times, 1 to 10 times, 1 to 5 times, 5 to 10 times, 10 to 15 times, 15 to 20 times, about 1.25 times, about 2 times, about 5 times, about 10 times, about 15 times, or about 20 times the bearing zone stiffness. In some implementations, the base zone stiffness is at least 3 to 25 times, 5 to 20 times, 5 to 15 times, 5 to 10 times, 10 to 15 times, 15 to 20 times, 20 to 25 times, about 3 times, about 5 times, about 10 times, about 15 times, about 20 times, or about 25 times the second stiffness. Any of the first stiffness, second stiffness, and third stiffness may have a stiffness gradient extending therethrough. For example, bearing zone <b>102</b> may have a stiffness gradient extending from under surface <b>103</b> to the compliant surface <b>104</b> of greater than or equal to 1 kPa/mm. Stiffness gradients may be less than or equal to 0.1 kPa/mm, 1 kPa/mm, 5 kPa/mm, or 10 kPa/mm, or greater. High relative differences in stiffness between the zones can cause poor distribution of physiological loads when applied by the opposing joint surface to the implant <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), leading to increased risk of damage to implant <b>100</b> or surrounding native tissue. Creation of a more gradual stiffness gradient across the layers and one that matches the surrounding tissue allows for loads to be better distributed throughout implant <b>100</b> and in conjunction with the native tissue, so as to produce a smooth transition between the implant and the surrounding tissue, and distribute force laterally within the implant so as to stabilize the axial structure of the implant. In certain implementations, the bearing zone <b>102</b> has an average stiffness of about 100 MPa, the middle zone <b>106</b> has an average stiffness of about 250 MPa, and the base zone <b>112</b> has an average stiffness of about 5 GPa.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Implant <b>100</b> is suitable for cartilage repair at various sites in the body, such as the articular cartilage within diarthrodial joints (e.g., knee, hip, ankle, toe, thumb, wrist, elbow, shoulder). Suitable sites include the distal femur, proximal tibia, patella, distal tibia, distal fibula, calcaneus, talus, tibiofibular joint, proximal humerus, glenoid, proximal femur, pelvis, distal humerus, proximal ulna, proximal radius, distal radius, distal ulna, carpals, distal metacarpal, proximal phalanx, and other cartilage known to those skilled in the art. Other articulating joint surfaces that can be repaired with the techniques disclosed hereininclude the spinal disc (nucleus pulposus), vertebral facets, and the meniscus in the knee. Implant <b>100</b> is suitable for implantation in humans as well as other organisms having cartilage, particularly articular cartilage.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Implant <b>100</b> may be designed to deform to a certain amount under physiological loads by adjusting the compressive modulus in any or all of the zones. For example, bearing zone <b>102</b> can be configured with the ability to deform between 2% and 25% under physiological load, with repeatable recovery of &#x3e;70% of the deformation when said load is removed. Middle zone <b>106</b> may be configured to deform between 2% to 10% under physiological load, with repeatable recovery of greater than or equal to 70% of the deformation when the physiological load is removed. When the bearing layer and middle layer are attached, implant <b>100</b> may have the ability to deform between 5% to 20% under physiologic load, with repeatable recovery of greater than or equal to 80%. In some implementations, the repeatable recovery is greater than or equal to 95%. For the knee in particular, typical peak physiological loads through the knee joint include 2-4 bodyweights (e.g., 3.1 BW) during walking, 4-6 bodyweights for jogging (e.g., 5.5 BW), 2-5 bodyweights during sit-stand-sit, 4-6 bodyweights during stair climbing, and 7-12 bodyweights during running. See, e.g., Bergmann G, Bender A, Graichen F, et al. Standardized loads acting in knee implants. <i>PLoS One. </i>2014;9(1) (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086035); see also, e.g., ASTM F3141-17a Standard Guide for Total Knee Replacement Loading Profiles. Accordingly, implant <b>100</b>, when implanted in the knee joint, follows the above-mentioned deformations under these peak physiological loads on the knee joint.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">An implant may be axisymmetric or symmetric along one or more vertical planes. For instance, it can be cylindrical with a dome shape on its outer surface with a single radius of curvature. Alternatively, it can have two or more radii of curvature. For instance, in some implementations, the implant can have a radius of curvature in one plane, and a larger radius of curvature in a perpendicular plane, thus making it more &#x201c;sloped&#x201d; in one direction and less sloped in the perpendicular plane. In a natural joint surface such as the condyle of the knee, there can be two major curvature planes, one that runs along the flexion/extension axis of the knee (which we will refer to as &#x201c;the major radius&#x201d;), and the other that is perpendicular to this plane, which has a smaller radius of curvature (&#x201c;the minor radius&#x201d;). These radii of curvature may also vary depending on the exact location on the joint surface. For example, an implant may be placed within an osteochondral defect that approximates the curvature(s) of the surrounding joint surface. Over time within the joint, the compliant surface or bearing zone reshapes under physiologic loads, reshapes such that the lubricious top surface takes on the radius or radii of curvature of the surrounding joint surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A</figref>/<b>4</b>B and <b>5</b>A/<b>5</b>B). The biomimetic osteochondral implants of the present disclosure can adapt to any joint geometries, including substantially convex joint surfaces, substantially concave joint surfaces, substantially flat joint surfaces, or joint surfaces that have both convex and concave curvatures. Thus, the implant can, e.g., start convex and become more convex, flat, or concave depending on the shape of the surrounding joint surface; start flat and become concave or convex; or start concave and become even more concave (more steeply curved). In any way, the implant can be designed such that the surface contours of the implant match the native surface contours upon physiological loading.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An axisymmetric implant having a single radius of curvature may be inserted into an implantation site in which the natural cartilage has a radius of curvature that differs from that of the implant.

Suitable thermoplastic polymers include, but are not limited to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), celluloid, cellulose acetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVAL), Kydex, liquid crystal polymer (LCP), polyacetal (POM), polyacrylate (acrylic), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyamide (PA or Nylon), polyamide-imide (PAI), polyaryletherketone (PAEK), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polyketone (PK), polyester, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), polyethersulfone (PES), polyethylenechlorinates (PEC), polyimide (PI), polymethylpentene (PMP), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyphthalamide (PPA), polystyrene (PS), polysulfone (PSU), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), Spectralon, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and polyurethane (PU). A wide variety of polyurethanes can be used with varying hard segment, soft segment, and chain extender compositions, as will be described herein.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some implementations, the thermoplastic polymer is a thermoplastic polyurethane-based polymer (e.g., polyether urethane, polycarbonate urethane, polyurethane urea, silicone polyether urethane, or silicone polycarbonate urethane) containing a network of hard segments and soft segments that may be swollen with a monomer and optional solvent, along with an initiator and cross-linker, such that the soft segments are swollen while mostly not affecting the hard segment material. This swelling process is not dissolution of the polymer; rather, the hard segments act as physical crosslinks to hold the material together as the soft segments are imbibed with the monomer(s) and optional solvent(s). After polymerization and cross-linking of the monomers, a second polymeric network is formed in the presence of the first network, creating an IPN or semi-IPN in which the second polymeric network (i.e., the polymerized monomer) is primarily sequestered within the soft, amorphous domain of the first polymer. Despite some degree of molecular rearrangement and further phase separation, the hard segments largely remain ordered and crystalline, providing structure and strength to the material. The new properties prepared by such a process depend on the properties of the polymerized monomers that were introduced and, in some implementations, modifications to the polymerized monomers (e.g., carboxylic-acid-containing monomers) that are subsequently introduced. Examples of such new properties include lubriciousness, conductivity, hardness, absorbency, permeability, photoreactivity, and thermal reactivity.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Any number of chemistries and stoichiometries can be used to create the polyurethane polymer. For example, the hard segment may be formed from 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), isophorone isocyanate (IPDI), 3,3-bitoluene diisocyanate (TODI), methylene bis (p-cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI), cyclohexyl diisocyanate (CHDI), 2,6-toluene diisocyanate or 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI), hexamethyl diisocyanate, or methylene bis(p-phenyl isocyanate); and the soft segment may be formed from polyalkylene oxides (e.g., polyethylene oxide (PEO), polypropylene oxide (PPO), and polybutylene oxide (PBO)), polybutadiene, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyethylene adipate, polycaprolactone, polytetramethylene adipate, polyisobutylene, polyhexamethylene carbonate glycol, poly(1,6-hexyl-1,2-ethyl carbonate). Any number of telechelic polymers can be used in the soft segment, if end-groups that are reactive with isocyanates are used. For instance, hydroxyl- or amine-terminated poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), dimethylacrylamide, carboxylate or sulfonated polymers, telechelic hydrocarbon chains (with hydroxyl and/or amine end groups), dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA), or these in combination with each other or with other soft segments mentioned above (e.g., PDMS) can be used.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Chain extenders include, for example, 1,4-butanediol, ethylene diamine, 4,4&#x2032;-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), ethylene glycol, and hexane diol. Any other compatible chain extenders can be used alone or in combination. Crosslinking chain extenders can be used containing isocyanate-reactive end groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amine) and a vinyl-based functional group (e.g., vinyl, methacrylate, acrylate, allyl ether, or acrylamide) may be used in place of some or all of the chain extender. Examples include 1,4-dihydroxybutene and glycerol methacrylate. Alternatively, crosslinking can be achieved through the use of a polyol such as glycerol which contains greater than two hydroxyl groups for reaction with isocyanates.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, the monomer is a carboxylic-acid-containing monomer. Suitable carboxylic-acid -containing monomers used to form the second polymeric network include characteristics such as (1) being capable of swelling without dissolving the thermoplastic polymer (e.g., polyurethane) and (2) being polymerizable. Non-limiting examples include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, linolenic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. After optional swelling in a buffered aqueous solution, the second network of the mixed anion IPN or semi-IPN is ionized, and the mixed anion IPN or semi-IPN is water-swollen and lubricious. Thus, hydrophilicity (i.e., water absorbency) can be introduced into an otherwise hydrophobic material. A hydrophobic polymer material such as polyurethane or ABS can be infiltrated with various mixed anion polymers (e.g., polymers comprising a combination of underivatized carboxylic acid groups and derivatized carboxylic acid groups) such that it absorbs water. In some embodiments, an additional co-monomer is used to form the second polymeric network. The additional co-monomer may be ionic or non-ionic. Exemplary non-ionic monomers include, but are not limited to acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, methylmethacrylate, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Functional groups may be incorporated into an IPN or semi-IPN that including a second polymeric network including carboxylic acid groups by, e.g., replacing the pendant carboxylic acid groups present on a poly(carboxylic acid) (e.g., poly(acrylic acid) or poly (methacrylic acid)) in an IPN with functional groups. In some implementations, the functional groups are sulfonic acid groups, which can be incorporated into an IPN or semi-IPN comprising carboxylic acid groups by reacting the IPN or semi-IPN with a sulfonic-acid-containing compound, e.g., by reacting the carboxylic acid groups of the solid article with an amino sulfonic acid compound such that an amide bond is formed between the carboxylic acid groups of the poly(carboxylic acid) and the amine groups of the amino sulfonic acid compound. In some embodiments, the amino sulfonic acid compound is a compound of the formula (H2N)xR(SO3H)y or a salt thereof, where R is an organic moiety, where x is a positive integer, and wherein y is a positive integer. In certain implementations, x may range from 1 to 10, typically, 1 to 5 (i.e., x may be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) and y may range from 1 to 10, typically, 1 to 5 (i.e., y may be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5). In some implementations, the compound of the formula (H2N)xR(SO3H)y has a hydrodynamic radius that allows the diffusion of the molecule within the IPN. R may be, for example, a hydrocarbon moiety, for example, a including linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon moiety, or a hydrocarbon moiety having a combination of two or more of linear, branched and cyclic hydrocarbon substituents. The hydrocarbon moiety may be, for example, C1-C12 hydrocarbon or a polymeric moiety including polymeric/oligomeric containing heteroatoms. In certain implementations, the hydrocarbon moiety may be selected from an alkane moiety, an alkene moiety, an alkyne moiety, an aromatic moiety, or a hydrocarbon moiety having a combination of two or more of alkane, alkene, alkyne, or aromatic components. In certain implementations, the amino sulfonic acid may be selected from taurine and taurine derivatives, including 1-substituted, 2-substituted, 1,1-disubstituted, 2,2-disubstituted, and 1,2-disubstituted taurines, such as 1-hydrocarbon-substituted, 2-hydrocarbon-substituted, 1,1-hydrocarbon-disubstituted, 2,2-hydrocarbon-disubstituted, and 1,2-hydrocarbon-disubstituted taurines, where the substituted hydrocarbons may be selected, for example, from the hydrocarbon moieties described above. In other implementations, the amino sulfonic acid compound is one that results in the formation of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid or acrylamido ethane sulfonic acid.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Exemplary IPNs and semi-IPNs suitable for use as a layer and preparation procedures thereof are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The sample consisted of the following materials: 1) a first layer of a semi-interpenetrating polymeric network that includes polyurethane and polyacrylic acid that is sulfonated, 2) a second layer of UDMA-MMA copolymer and 3) a third layer of the porous titanium (an example of a three-layer implant). The top layer is a semi-interpenetrating polymeric network that includes polyurethane and polyacrylic acid that is sulfonated, the middle layer is formed from a UDMA-MMA copolymer, and the bottom layer is porous titanium. The three-layered implant was also compared against a CoCr implant with the same geometry as the two polymeric layers attached to the same porous material. A range of implant diameters (12-24 mm) and articular surface curvatures were examined that were appropriately sized to the femoral condyles.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">A knee model was constructed from imaging data derived from a healthy patient. The model included the femur, tibia, and meniscus. The femur and tibial models both included the articular cartilage. The joint was oriented at a 15&#xb0; flexion angle and a load of 3100 N (&#x2dc;3 MPa average pressure) was applied across the joint. This flexion angle and load magnitude are representative of that observed during walking.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The contact pressures were acquired for the native joint. A cylindrical defect was then created in the medial condyle of the femur in the center of pressure observed in the native intact knee.

Finally, the CoCr implant was inserted into the defect and the contact pressure measurement repeated.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In all implant cases, the implant was seated into the defect to ensure that the edge of the implant was below the adjacent cartilage, and the center of the implant was proud (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), even or below the original cartilage surface</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In a series of simulations on peak contact pressures for a variety of conditions and implants, the three-layer implant consistently exhibited lower peak contact pressures than the native knee while the CoCr implant consistently exhibited higher than native peak contact pressures.

The chart shows the range of observed values for the three-layer and CoCr implants. The results, indicated that the three-layered implant successfully reduced the peak contact pressure in the knee without a direct match of the articular surface. In a direct comparison to CoCr, the contact pressures for the three-layered implant were observed in a range between 3.4 and 5.8 MPa which was found to be less than that observed for the CoCr implant (5.0 to 10.5 MPa) in comparable settings (geometry and seating conditions).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: Creep and Relaxation Assessment of 1st Polymer, 2nd Polymer and 3 Layer Implant</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0127">A study was conducted to assess the confined creep and relaxation of sample implants, which are examples of the biomimetic osteochondral implants described herein, under physiological loads.

After obtaining access to the osteochondral lesion through an appropriate approach for the given joint a sizing device is used to aide in the selection of an implant that will cover the lesion and result in a stable cartilage margin. Then, a wire (e.g., k-wire) or a pin (e.g., Steinmann pin) is placed into the center of the lesion with the use of a guide that approximates the size of the implant. The guide ensures that the wire is placed perpendicular to the joint surface. This guide may have a geometry that conforms to the articular surface of the joint being treated. After insertion of the wire or pin, the guide is removed from the surgical site.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">An incising or cutting tool may be used to incise the cartilage to create a clean margin. The incisor is placed over the previously placed guide wire to ensure proper alignment. A drill, burr or reamer is then used to create a cavity in the bone that is designed to receive the implant (i.e., an implantation site). The drill, burr, or reamer is placed over the wire or pin to ensure proper alignment. This cavity may create a press-fit with the implant to provide initial fixation. This cavity may also be designed to receive posts, threads, or other means of securing the implant into the prepared cavity. The cavity may also be created in order to gain access to cancellous bone for adhesive penetration and attachment when the second polymer layer is adhered to the bone in vivo via a bonding agent. The drill may be used with a separate guide, possess markings or have a shoulder to ensure that the cavity is drilled to the appropriate depth. After the cavity has been created, the wire or pin is removed.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The cavity is then verified for accuracy and fit with the use of a trial. The trial mimics the geometry of the implant and allows assessment of the desired seating depth and placement of the implant. After the assessment is complete, the trial is removed from the cavity. If required, the wire or pin can be reinserted and the drill used again to adjust the depth of the cavity if the implant seating was not sufficiently deep. The implant will then be placed into the cavity. The exact insertion technique will depend on the chosen implant geometry (e.g., press fit, post(s), thread, etc.).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some implementations, the implant is seated with the edge of the implant recessed below the surrounding cartilage where the center of the implant may be proud of the original joint line (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). After the implant is loaded, the conformity of the implant will improve in vivo to match the surrounding cartilage due to a combination of elastic deformation and time dependent creep of the bearing zone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart describing a method <b>1200</b> for repairing a cartilage lesion on an articulating surface within a joint (e.g., a diarthrodial joint).
