No. 16/919,384 filed Jul. 2, 2020 and titled Magazine Limit Block, now U.S. Pat. No. 11,391,527, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/869,751 filed Jul. 2, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of hunting rifles and various systems for improved design and functionality.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Firearms for hunting and sport use have historically both come from and inspired military-style rifles. Both share a common thread. Hunting, sport and military rifles share similar characteristics of ruggedness, accuracy and durability. The principle difference between todays hunting and sport rifles versus military rifles is the semi-automatic nature of the hunting and sport rifles versus the fully automatic nature of military rifles. A semi-automatic rifle is a rifle that fires one round for one pull of the trigger, while a fully-automatic rifle fires repeatedly until the trigger is released following the initial pull. Throughout history firearms have taken advantage of newer materials and technology and have incorporated them both into modern designs. Certain aesthetic, feel, and functionality is desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides for a rifle receiver lock alignment and tensioning system that includes a rear alignment lug defining a groove configured to receive an alignment and tension plunger pin, wherein the plunger pin includes a plunger button that positions into the groove when an upper receiver and a lower receiver are connected to form an assembled rifle. The plunger pin is positioned within a threaded body having threads on an outer surface to engage a receiving hole formed in the lower receiver and supported by a tension spring that is compressed upon engagement. The engagement of the plunger pin within the groove is adapted to form a tension fit and alignment of the rifle in an assembled configuration providing a tight fit and feel. This is effective in significantly reducing play and movement between the upper and lower receiver of the rifle. The tensioning system is configured to align upper and lower receivers to each other such that lateral play in a final assembly is reduced as compared to a rifle without this system. The tensioning system is configured to further maintain a uniform tension between upper and lower receiver such that vertical play in the final assembly is also reduced as compared to a rifle without this system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure further provides for a ring mount system&#x2014;barrel nut and handguard alignment system that is configured to effectively align the receiver, barrel and handguard interface system. The ring mount system includes a barrel nut defining a plurality of annular keyway grooves formed on the outer surface of the barrel nut, a hand guard sized to receive the barrel nut within an opening of the handguard and defining a plurality of securing holes to lineup and physically engage the round keyway grooves of the barrel nut, a handguard keyway pin sized and shaped to pass through the securing hole and rest within the annular keyway groove of the barrel nut, and a fastener (like a screw) that engages the handguard keyway pin on each end of the handguard keyway pin on the outside of the handguard, thus preventing the handguard and the barrel nut from disengaging. The keyway pins also linearly align the handguard with respect to the barrel and the upper receiver. The ring mount allows for a universal exterior for precise barrel nut torque specifications. Precise perpendicularity between an internal seating ring of the barrel nut and an exterior surface of the barrel nut provides for accurate alignment of the handguard in relation to the barrel. The system further includes precision mount grooves to provide &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; mounting of the handguard and eliminate or substantially reduce longitudinal play.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure further provides for a real feel handguard that can be molded or pultruded with a composite material. The composite handguard may include a polymer core for use in a rifle or other firearm technology. In this example, the handguard defines an annular cross section, which can be configured in a mold or pultrusion die to accommodate various design choices and geometries. In an example, the handguard is molded or pultruded rather than being wound. The handguard can include carbon and can be made with a plurality of layers including one or more interior fiberglass layers defining an interior opening, a relatively thick or multilayered polymer core formed around the interior fiberglass layers, and one or more exterior fiberglass layers formed around the polymer core. At least one of the interior or exterior fiberglass layers may include a carbon fiber layer that is at least partially formed therein to add reinforcement and other benefits. In an example, the handguard includes a pair of carbon layers positioned within the outer fiberglass layer and spaced apart evenly to form an upper carbon layer and a lower carbon layer, wherein the carbon layers partially extend circumferentially around within the outer fiberglass layers. The handguard can further include anti-rotational &#x201c;ears&#x201d; to eliminate or reduce rotational play of the handguard which results in precision alignment of the handguard to an upper receiver. It can further include precision mount holes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, the carbon layer extends entirely around the circumference of the handguard forming a uniform layer within the outer layer. In yet another example, the handguard is formed defining an interior barrel channel sized and shaped to receive a barrel of a rifle, one or more interior fiberglass layers forming the barrel channel, additional fiberglass layers, one or more exterior fiberglass layers formed annularly around the polymer core and having a pair of spaced apart partial carbon fiber reinforcement layers positioned within the one or more exterior fiberglass layers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another example, the handguard is free from any carbon layer. In still another example the handguard is free of polymer core. The handguard can be formed defining an interior barrel channel sized and shaped to receive a barrel of a rifle. The layers can be formed around the interior fiberglass layers and one or more exterior fiberglass layers are formed annularly around those layers.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example process for forming the handguard includes starting with a bladder and/or mandrel, then layering a composite material which may or may not include carbon, around the bladder or mandrel to a desired thickness. Once the desired thickness is achieved, the layered material is encased in a mold that defines the desired exterior shape. The molding process includes a curing step followed by disassembling the mold and final machining of the resulting handguard. The bladder or mandrel is removed during the disassembling step following the curing step. When using a bladder, air is introduced into the bladder once the layered material and bladder are provided into the mold causing the bladder to expand. Pultrusion is another example process available for forming handguards according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure further provides for a limit block round limiter and spring guide. The limit block is operable for limiting a number of rounds that fit into a magazine and which centers and guides a spring in compression and decompression cycles. The limit block is a removable unit having a base that rests against a bottom plate of a magazine body and extending from the base sized to fit within the spring of a magazine. The limit block limits round capacity and guides a spring during cycling. The base provides a relatively flat support that abuts an end of the spring and a main body of the limit block and is sized and shaped to support the spring as it compresses and decompresses. The main body of the limit block includes tapered sides that extend away from the base towards a follower. The tapered sides are configured to guide the spring for a more effective compression and decompression cycle as rounds are loaded into and/or discharged from the magazine. The main body of the limit block defines a thickness and width that is sufficient to center the spring to keep it from contacting the sides of the main body during cycling. A top portion of the main body forms a notch to provide clearance for a connection piece of the follower that connects to an end of the spring. The tapered sides of the block extend along a longitudinal axis defined by the sides of the magazine body but also to each other forming a smaller thickness at a top portion relative to a bottom portion. The block is rigid and thus serves as a physical limit to block the number rounds that can fit within the magazine body since the follower cannot drop below the height of the limiting block. The block can be formed from various materials and of various sizes depending on the desired round count. The block can be useful when limitations exist related to caliber of ammunition and number of rounds that can be carried within a magazine for a particular hunt, event, etc. The limit block further includes grooves at the base of the limit block to provide for alignment within the magazine body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For purposes of summarizing the disclosure, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure have been described herein.

num="0040">In an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> are directed to a receiver lock tensioning system, also referred to as a rifle receiver alignment system showing an engaged and disengaged configuration. In this example, rifle <b>10</b> is a semi-automatic hunting rifle with an upper receiver <b>12</b> and lower receiver <b>14</b> (also referred to upper section <b>12</b> and lower section <b>14</b>). Rifle <b>10</b> includes a grip <b>18</b> and a trigger <b>16</b>, which when activated through pulling, sends a round of ammunition out through barrel <b>17</b>. Upper receiver <b>12</b> can be disassembled from lower receiver <b>14</b>. In order to assemble rifle <b>10</b>, the exterior portion of upper receiver <b>13</b> is aligned with and pressed into the interior portion of lower receiver <b>15</b>. The interior portion of lower receiver <b>14</b> defines a cavity shaped to receive upper receiver <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Receiver lock tensioning system <b>20</b> includes a plunger pin <b>22</b> that sits within threaded hole <b>28</b> of the lower receiver <b>15</b> and engages an alignment groove <b>31</b> of lug <b>30</b>. System <b>20</b> is located at a connection point between upper receiver <b>12</b> and lower receiver <b>14</b> of rifle <b>10</b>. The system creates tension between the two receiver halves while also providing aid in the alignment, which improves uniform tension between the upper and lower receiver and significantly reduces or eliminates lateral and vertical play in a final assembly. Unwanted movement is commonly referred to as &#x201c;play&#x201d; between the upper receiver and lower receiver.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">System <b>20</b> includes plunger pin <b>22</b> which is configured with a body <b>26</b> that engages hole <b>28</b> in the lower receiver. In this example, hole <b>28</b> is threaded and receives corresponding threads defined on the plunger pin body <b>26</b>. Plunger pin <b>22</b> further includes an interior tension spring and plunger button <b>24</b>. Plunger button <b>24</b> is oriented towards the upper receiver <b>13</b>. When fully assembled, plunger pin <b>22</b> engages with a bottom surface of rear lug <b>30</b> located towards a rear portion of upper receiver <b>12</b>. Rear lug <b>30</b> defines an alignment groove <b>31</b>, which is sized and shaped to receive and engage with plunger button <b>24</b>. When upper receiver <b>12</b> and lower receiver <b>14</b> are connected, rear lug <b>30</b> aligns to receive plunger pin <b>22</b>. Plunger button <b>24</b> fits within alignment groove <b>31</b> and thus, the interior tension spring creates force and tension between the upper and lower receiver so as to substantially reduce and/or eliminate movement between the upper and lower receiver, also known as lateral or vertical play in a final assembly.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> show the alignment and tension system <b>20</b> in the engaged position. Plunger button <b>24</b> is positioned within alignment groove <b>31</b> so that plunger button <b>24</b> is fixed in a compressed position. This engaged position secures upper receiver <b>12</b> to lower receiver <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> show the system <b>20</b> in the disengaged position so that plunger button <b>24</b> is fully extended and not compressed in a disengaged position. When in the disengaged position, upper receiver <b>12</b> is not fully secured/engaged to lower receiver <b>14</b> at the rear portion of upper receiver <b>12</b>. In order to place the receivers in the engaged position, the user would need to properly align rear lug <b>30</b> with plunger pin <b>22</b> and exert sufficient force on the upper receiver so as to engage plunger button <b>24</b> into alignment groove <b>31</b>. The engagement of plunger pin <b>22</b> with rear lug <b>30</b> is adapted to form a secure fit, providing a tight feel of a rifle <b>10</b> and significantly reducing play and movement between the upper and lower receiver of the rifle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Previously, rifles comprised of an upper and lower receiver in an assembled configuration would result in unwanted lateral and vertical play. Forming a tight fit that reduced or eliminated movement and play was not achievable.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> illustrate a ring mount system, also referred to as receiver, barrel, and handguard interface system <b>40</b>. In this example, a plurality of fasteners <b>48</b> interact with a barrel nut <b>44</b> and a handguard <b>42</b>. The system <b>40</b> is put in place to secure handguard <b>42</b> to a barrel of a rifle. The connection is made in such a way as to substantially reduce and/or prevent any linear or rotational movement of the handguard <b>42</b>, also commonly referred to as &#x201c;play&#x201d;. In this example, round keyway pins <b>46</b> fit through apertures <b>53</b> defined on each side of the handguard <b>42</b>. Round keyway pins <b>46</b> are then rested against and within annular keyway grooves <b>49</b> defined on the barrel nut <b>44</b>. The round keyway pins <b>46</b> tightly secure the handguard <b>42</b> to the barrel nut <b>44</b> in a linear orientation on a barrel <b>17</b>. In this example, a universal exterior is provided that allows for precise barrel nut torque specifications. Precise perpendicularity between an internal seating ring of the barrel nut and an exterior surface of the barrel nut provide for accurate alignment of handguard in relation to barrel. The precision mount grooves provide &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; mounting of the handguard and can eliminate or substantially reduce longitudinal play.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Previously, fasteners were used to squeeze the handguard in place while aligning and engaging with the barrel nut itself, however, the alignment pins were never used to rest against the barrel nut itself. In the present disclosure, the round keyway pins <b>46</b> engage with the annular keyway grooves <b>49</b> formed on the barrel nut <b>44</b> so as to exert pressure and maintain the orientation of the handguard <b>42</b> and the barrel nut <b>44</b> as well as securely hold the pieces in place.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Ring mount system <b>40</b> securely fastens and aligns a handguard <b>42</b> to a barrel <b>17</b> of an upper receiver of a rifle. Handguard <b>42</b> and barrel nut <b>44</b> are aligned concentrically where the barrel nut <b>44</b> fits inside the handguard <b>32</b>. Apertures <b>53</b>, located on both the left and right inferior side of handguard <b>42</b>, are aligned with annular keyway grooves <b>49</b> defined on barrel nut <b>44</b>. In an example, the annular grooves are spaced 0.600&#x2033; apart from one another.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Handguard <b>42</b> and barrel nut <b>44</b> are aligned with respect to each other by interface system <b>45</b>, which includes round keyway pins <b>46</b> that enter through aperture <b>53</b> and engage annular keyway grooves <b>49</b> so as to tightly hold barrel nut <b>44</b> and handguard <b>42</b> together. In this example, three round keyway pins <b>46</b> pass through three apertures <b>53</b> and rest in 3 separate annular keyway grooves <b>49</b>. A barrel <b>17</b> passes through a barrel cavity <b>50</b> defined by the barrel nut <b>44</b>. Interface system <b>45</b> includes one or more fastener round keyway pins <b>46</b>, an optional washer <b>47</b>, and end fasteners <b>48</b>. Fastener <b>48</b>, in this example, is a screw that enters washer <b>47</b> and a threaded opening formed on an interior of round keyway pin <b>46</b>. The screws <b>48</b> are fashioned to engage fastener round keyway pin <b>46</b> on each end and on the outside of apertures <b>53</b> thus holding round keyway pins <b>46</b> in place. Apertures <b>53</b> are sized and shaped to form a cavity to receive the head of the screw <b>48</b> and hold round keyway pins <b>46</b> in place against the annular keyway grooves <b>49</b>. This also provides a substantially flush appearance without an undesired flange or other form that extends away from the natural contour of the handguard body.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example, additional fasteners (i.e., screws in this example) are used to affix rails <b>51</b> to a bottom of handguard <b>42</b> so that additional rifle accessories can be used with the rifle, including bipods or tripods commonly used to steady, control and improve the accuracy of the rifle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a cross-section view of ring mount system <b>40</b> whereby barrel nut <b>44</b> and handguard <b>42</b> are aligned concentrically to form an interior barrel cavity <b>50</b>.

In an example the handguard includes carbon. In a further example, the handguard includes fiberglass and in yet another example, the handguard includes both layers of carbon and layers of fiberglass. Carbon allows for the handguard to maintain and achieve desired strength, stability, feel, and light-weight characteristics. This can be achieved through any molding technique including layering materials on a bladder or mandrel followed by molding and curing and/or pultruding a layered material.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is directed to a schematic cross section view of a real feel composite handguard <b>42</b> having a polymer core <b>61</b> according to the present disclosure. The handguard <b>42</b> can be a substantially tubular construction molded to a profile and includes multiple layers of fiberglass and a polymer core. In this example, one or more exterior layers of fiberglass <b>62</b> are provided to surround a polymer core <b>61</b> having a desired thickness. The polymer core <b>61</b> can be layered or fabricated to a predetermined thickness forming an annular geometry surrounding one or more interior fiberglass layers. In another example, one to ten exterior layers of fiberglass are provided. In yet another example, two to five layers are provided. Polymer core <b>61</b> surrounds one or more interior layers of fiberglass <b>64</b>. In an example, one to ten interior layers are fiberglass are provided. In yet another example, two to five layers are provided.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at least one reinforcement carbon fiber layer <b>60</b> is provided within the exterior layers of fiberglass <b>62</b>. In an example, the carbon fiber layers <b>60</b> are strategically positioned within the fiberglass layers <b>64</b> to provide reinforcement to the overall handguard <b>42</b> and additional support and rigidity to the handguard <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The reinforcement carbon fiber layers <b>60</b> can be positioned throughout the exterior fiberglass layers <b>64</b> at various circumferential positions or all the way around throughout the fiberglass layer <b>64</b>. In this example, the carbon fiber layers <b>60</b> are positioned spaced apart evenly with respect to each other so as to form an upper carbon layer and a lower carbon layer. This can provide the structural reinforcement at specific desired areas of the handguard. In another example, the carbon fiber layers <b>60</b> can be positioned so that they are spaced apart to form side carbon fiber layers <b>60</b> (not shown). Additionally, the carbon fiber layers can be positioned annularly so as to form a carbon layer ring (not shown).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Previous handguards are typically fabricated from a single layer of metal, such as aluminum. This results in a handguard having high thermal conductivity, causing the handguard to get extremely hot in warm conditions or extremely cold in cold conditions. The multilayer handguard of the present disclosure reduces the thermal conductivity of the handguard by forty (40) times while maintaining or exceeding structural strength and durability as well as providing an alternative look and feel. This provides for less fluctuation in temperate of the handguard, allowing for direct contact with the handguard and improved overall functionality of the rifle over a broader surrounding temperature range. Carbon fiber can be five to ten times stronger than aluminum and up to about three times stronger than steel. Inserting carbon fiber layers into the fiberglass layers provides for additional strength in the handguard that prevents breakage or loss of structural integrity and shape. The multilayer handguard of the present disclosure further offers advantages over one made solely from carbon fiber, in that carbon fiber can be expensive. Inserting carbon fiber layers into fiberglass provides for a cost-efficient and effective handguard.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b>B</figref>, magazine limit block <b>80</b> is shown for use with a magazine <b>70</b> to limit rounds of ammunition (not shown). A magazine <b>70</b> is shown for holding one or more rounds of ammunition. The magazine <b>70</b> includes a magazine body <b>71</b> defining an interior cavity having an interior perimeter, a follower <b>72</b> for holding rounds of ammunition of a desired size and caliber, a spring <b>73</b> and a base plate <b>75</b>. The follower <b>72</b> is configured to slide up and down within the magazine body <b>71</b>. The spring <b>73</b> is configured to engage the follower <b>72</b> and applies force upward as rounds of ammunition are discharged or emptied. In this example, spring <b>73</b> is a compression spring that rests against the base plate <b>75</b> and connects to a bottom portion of the follower <b>72</b>. As rounds of ammunition are loaded into the magazine body and against the follower <b>72</b>, the spring <b>73</b> is compressed and thus applying a force up against follower <b>72</b>. This causes the follower <b>72</b> to move upward, releasing the compression in the spring <b>73</b>, as rounds of ammunition are discharged.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A limit block <b>80</b> is provided to be inserted into the magazine <b>70</b> and configured to fill space within the interior magazine cavity to reduce or prevent (e.g., limit) the number of rounds that can fit within the magazine <b>70</b>. Limit block <b>80</b> is positioned within an internal channel formed by spring <b>73</b> and abuts and/or rests against bottom plate <b>75</b> within the magazine body <b>71</b>. Limit block <b>80</b> defines one or more alignment grooves <b>182</b> formed on a base <b>82</b> and shaped accommodate and conform to an interior perimeter of the magazine <b>70</b>. Thus, limit block <b>80</b> can fit securely within an interior cavity of magazine <b>70</b>. In this example, base <b>82</b> defines an overall rectangular geometry that matches a cross section geometry of the interior perimeter of the magazine body <b>71</b>. The magazine body <b>71</b> defines a width W and a thickness T, wherein the W is substantially larger than T. Accordingly, a desired caliber of bullet (ammunition), which is typically elongated, securely fits within the magazine body <b>71</b>. The base <b>82</b> of limit block <b>80</b> is configured to fit within these dimensions having a width W<sub>B </sub>and a thickness of T<sub>B</sub>, wherein the W<sub>B </sub>is substantially larger than T<sub>B </sub>and W&#x3e;W<sub>B </sub>and T&#x3e;T<sub>B</sub>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The limit block <b>80</b> provides a structural block to fill the space within housing <b>71</b> and thus reduces the number of rounds of ammunition that can be stored within the magazine <b>70</b>. According to certain laws and regulations relating to hunting, hunters can only use certain types of firearms and ammunition and numbers of rounds to hunt certain types of animals. It can become burdensome to use a specific type of magazine that holds the required number of rounds based on a certain hunting season.

Notch <b>84</b> is configured to create a space to accommodate the follower <b>72</b> and a connection point for the spring <b>73</b>. Main body <b>81</b> is configured with tapered sides <b>85</b>. The tapered sides <b>85</b> allow for a smoother flow of spring <b>73</b> when the spring compresses and decompresses as rounds of ammunition are cycled. The main body <b>81</b> is configured to be a structural support guide for spring <b>73</b> to ensure desired movement and guiding of the follower <b>72</b> during cycling.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Prior attempts to restrict magazine volume do not have a defined cone shape which allows the spring to move freely, unguided and unsupported within the magazine body, which can lead to malfunctioning and misfeeding of the rounds. Main body <b>81</b> defines a width W<sub>L </sub>at or near base <b>82</b> and a thickness T<sub>L</sub>. The tapered sides <b>85</b> gradually extend towards each other forming a smaller upper width W<sub>L-x </sub>and thickness T<sub>L-x </sub>as compared to the width W<sub>L </sub>and thickness T<sub>L</sub>. This forms a substantially truncated &#x201c;cone&#x201d; shape that centers and guides spring <b>73</b> which enhances the movement of follower <b>72</b>. Thus, the limit block <b>80</b> provides for smooth movement of the spring <b>73</b> since the tapering substantially follows the natural movement of the spring while maintaining structural support through its thickness and prevents the spring from undesired collapsing.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Limit block <b>80</b> can define various lengths depending on the desired round count and caliber of ammunition.
