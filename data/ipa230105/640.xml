More specifically, the present invention relates to devices and associated methods for distraction and fusion of vertebral bodies that remain stable when implanted and facilitate fusion following their use for distraction to aid in the correction of spinal deformity by reducing a collapsed disc and establishing sagittal alignment, lordosis, or kyphosis.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The concept of intervertebral fusion for the cervical and lumbar spine following a discectomy was generally introduced in the 1960s. It involved coring out a bone graft from the hip and implanting the graft into the disc space. The disc space was prepared by coring out the space to match the implant. The advantages of this concept were that it provided a large surface area of bone to bone contact and placed the graft under loading forces that allowed osteoconduction and induction enhancing bone fusion. However, the technique is seldom practiced today due to numerous disadvantages including lengthy operation time, destruction of a large portion of the disc space, high risk of nerve injury, and hip pain after harvesting the bone graft.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Presently, at least two devices are commonly used to perform the intervertebral portion of an intervertebral body fusion: the first is the distraction device and the second is the intervertebral body fusion device, often referred to as a cage. Cages can be implanted as standalone devices or as part of a circumferential fusion approach with pedicle screws and rods. The concept is to introduce an implant that will distract a collapsed disc and decompress the nerve root, allow load sharing to enhance bone formation and to implant a device that is small enough to allow implantation with minimal retraction and pulling on nerves.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a typical intervertebral body fusion procedure, a portion of the intervertebral disc is first removed from between the vertebral bodies. This can be done through either a direct open approach or a minimally invasive approach. Disc shavers, pituitary rongeours, curettes, and/or disc scrapers can be used to remove the nucleus and a portion of either the anterior or posterior annulus to allow implantation and access to the inner disc space. The distraction device is inserted into the cleared space to enlarge the disc space and the vertebral bodies are separated by actuating the distraction device. Enlarging the disc space is important because it also opens the foramen where the nerve root exists. It is important that during the distraction process one does not over-distract the facet joints. An intervertebral fusion device is next inserted into the distracted space and bone growth factor, such as autograft, a collagen sponge with bone morphogenetic protein, or other bone enhancing substance may be inserted into the space within the intervertebral fusion device to promote the fusion of the vertebral bodies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Intervertebral fusion and distraction can be performed through anterior, posterior, oblique, and lateral approaches. Each approach has its own anatomical challenges, but the general concept is to fuse adjacent vertebra in the cervical thoracic or lumbar spine. Devices have been made from various materials. Such materials include cadaveric cancellous bone, carbon fiber, titanium, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Devices have also been made into different shapes such as a bean shape, football shape, banana shape, wedge shape, and a threaded cylindrical cage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,070,598 and 7.087,055 to Lim et al. disclose minimally invasive devices for distracting the disc space. The devices include scissor-jack-like linkages that are used to distract a pair of endplates associated with adjacent vertebra from a first collapsed orientation to a second expanded orientation. A pull arm device is used to deliver and distract the device in the disc space. However, the device is primarily used for distraction and not subsequent vertebral fusion, The device would not work as a fusion device, because once the pull arm is disconnected from the device, the device will not be stable enough to maintain proper spacing of the vertebrae until fusion can occur. The endplates of the device are also solid and do not permit bone growth for successful fusion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0114367 to Meyer discloses a device that uses a scissor-jack-like arrangement to distract a disc space. To solve the instability problem of the scissor-jack arrangement, a curable polymer is injected to fill the disc space and the distraction device is disabled from attempting to support the load. The curable polymer and disabling of the device are necessary because the device could not adequately support the distracted disc space. The base plates of the device have at least two or more degrees of freedom, collectively, in a distracted position and are therefore not stable under the loads encountered supporting the disc space. Absent injection of the polymer, and the support and control supplied by the implanting physician via the removable distraction tool, the base plates would collapse, which could cause severe damage to the vertebral bodies.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a device that can distract adjacent vertebral bodies in a minimally invasive manner while providing stable support for the disc space during fusion; particularly, a device that would allow for angular orientation of the base plates to be matched exactly to the unique alignment, or desired alignment, of a patient's spine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment, an expandable intervertebral cage device adapted to be implanted into an intervertebral disc space in a patient's body. The device includes a first base plate having a first outer bearing surface configured to interface with a first vertebra of the intervertebral disc space, a second base plate having a second outer bearing surface configured to interface with a second vertebra of the intervertebral disc space, a proximal block mechanically coupled to the first base plate and the second base plate, wherein the proximal block comprises internal threading, a distal block comprising an internal passage, and exactly two arm assemblies, wherein a first one of the two arm assemblies is arranged on a first side of the device and a second one of the two arm assemblies is arranged on a second side of the device, wherein each of the exactly two arm assemblies comprises a first arm mechanically coupled to the first base plate and the distal block and a second arm is mechanically coupled to the second base plate and the distal block. A screw is arranged partially within the internal threading of the proximal block and passing through the internal passage of the distal block, such that rotation of the screw relative to the proximal block causes a change in distance between the proximal block and the distal block, and a corresponding change in the spacing and lordosis of the device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary

On each side (i.e., each edge perpendicular to both the base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and the proximal/distal axis), intervertebral cage device <b>10</b> includes a first arm <b>16</b>, second arm <b>18</b>, screw <b>19</b>, several rings <b>20</b>, distal block <b>22</b>, proximal block <b>24</b>, pins <b>26</b>, and rods <b>28</b>. The hidden side of the device <b>10</b>, not visible in the perspective views herein, comprises many substantially similar structures to those described with reference to the numbered elements. Intervertebral cage device <b>10</b> is a device that can be used to hold two structures, such as the vertebrae of a spine, in a fixed spatial relationship with respect to one another. As will be described with respect to subsequent figures, device <b>10</b> can be expanded to hold structures in any fixed spatial relationship with a range of distances and angles with respect to one another. Device <b>10</b> provides desirable spacing and lordosis and can be operated using a single screw, as described below, to achieve commonly used intervertebral spacing and lordosis levels. In contrast to the multiple-screw devices described above, the user of a single screw device reduces the complexity and increases the mechanical strength of the device. In some embodiments, at full extension the device <b>10</b> can exhibit about 23&#xb0; of lordosis, for example, which is greater than a commonly used angle for many intervertebral devices.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, first base plate <b>12</b>, which is substantially similar to second base plate <b>14</b>, comprises textured surface <b>30</b>, arm socket <b>32</b>, and rod passage <b>34</b>. First base plate <b>12</b> is a portion of device <b>10</b> that comprises a bearing surface. As used throughout this disclosure, &#x201c;bearing surface&#x201d; refers to the outside surface of a base plate (e.g., <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>) that interfaces with the endplate of a vertebra, other bone, or other structures that are to be held in a fixed spatial relationship from one another. Textured surface <b>30</b> can comprise, for example, any texture that promotes bone growth to hold the base plate <b>12</b>, or which provides grip or traction when compressed against bone. Arm socket <b>32</b> is usable to provide a mechanical connection between base plate <b>12</b> and a corresponding structure, such as first arm <b>16</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. Similarly, rod passage <b>34</b> can be used to facilitate a mechanical connection between base plate <b>12</b> and a corresponding structure, such as proximal block <b>24</b>, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are arranged on opposite from one another in device <b>10</b>, and can be positioned within a range of distances and angles relative to one another, depending on the extent of the expansion of device <b>10</b>, For example, as shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, the device <b>10</b> is in a collapsed position, and base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are relatively close to one another, and arranged substantially parallel to one another. In the configuration shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, the base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are relatively further away from one another on the distal end, and are angled relative to one another (this angle is sometimes referred to as lordosis). In embodiments, the extent of lordosis and/or distance between various parts of the base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can vary. In some embodiments, base plates can each be angled at 23 degrees. In this embodiment, a proximal end of each base plate can remain at a generally constant distance from each other as the device is expanded about pins <b>28</b> (with perhaps a slight change in distance as the plates rotate about pins).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the mechanism by which device <b>10</b> is expanded or collapsed is shown, and in particular first arm <b>16</b>. First arm <b>16</b>, which is substantially similar to second arm <b>18</b>, includes body portion <b>36</b>, first connector <b>38</b>, and second connector <b>40</b>. A substantially similar pair of arms to first arm <b>16</b> and second arm <b>18</b> are included in device <b>10</b> on the side that is not depicted in the perspective views previously shown. Body portion <b>36</b> extends between first connector <b>38</b> and second connector <b>40</b>. The distance between first connector <b>38</b> and second connector <b>40</b> determines in part the extent to which the base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> can be distanced from one another, and the angle between them. First connector <b>38</b> and second connector <b>40</b> can each be rotatably connected to an adjoining structure. So, for example, as shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, first connector <b>38</b> can be connected to first plate <b>12</b> or second plate <b>14</b> via a pin <b>26</b>. Likewise, second connector <b>40</b> can be connected to distal block <b>22</b>. The connections space the parts from one another, while allowing relative rotation between them.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, ring <b>20</b> is depicted, which can also support interconnection between the base plate <b>12</b> and the distal block <b>22</b> via any of the arms. In particular, ring <b>20</b> holds pin <b>26</b> (shown in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) such that it passes through both first base plate <b>12</b> and first connector <b>38</b> of first arm <b>16</b>. In operation, the effects of lateral forces (i.e., forces perpendicular to the proximal&#x2014;distal directions previously described) are mitigated by ring <b>20</b>. Ring <b>20</b> can prevent some types of relative lateral movement between first base plate <b>12</b>, first arm <b>16</b>, and pin <b>26</b>. Ring <b>20</b> does this by snapping into groove <b>52</b> of pin <b>26</b>, as described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, distal block <b>22</b> is shown in perspective. Distal block <b>22</b> includes internal passage <b>42</b>, first bearing <b>44</b>, and second bearing <b>46</b>. Internal passage <b>42</b> is configured to provide a passage for a portion of screw <b>19</b>, as shown previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. In some embodiments, the portion of screw <b>19</b> that passes through internal passage <b>42</b> is a shank (i.e., unthreaded), or else the internal passage <b>42</b> itself is unthreaded, or both, such that there is not co-rotation between distal block <b>22</b> and. screw <b>19</b>, Screw <b>19</b> passes through internal passage <b>42</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A</figref> <b>2</b>D, and as such the distal block <b>22</b> and screw <b>19</b> are fixed relative to one another in the proximal/distal directions. As described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, rotation of screw <b>19</b> can cause screw <b>19</b> to advance in either the proximal or distal direction, which thereby causes a corresponding movement of the distal block <b>22</b> in the same direction. As can be seen in the figures, screw <b>19</b> can define a first diameter at proximal block that is greater than a second diameter at distal block. The diameter of screw at the interface with distal block can be the same or greater than that at proximal block to prevent the screw from advancing distally through distal block. A ring <b>20</b> can prevent the screw <b>19</b> from being pulled proximally through the distal block.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">First bearing <b>44</b> and second bearing <b>46</b> can receive a portion of another object, such as first arm <b>16</b> and second arm <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. First arm <b>16</b> and/or second arm <b>16</b> can rotate relative to first bearing <b>44</b> and/or second bearing <b>46</b>, while remaining mechanically fixed to one another. As described above, rotation of screw <b>19</b> can cause movement of distal block <b>22</b> in the proximal or distal direction. This results in corresponding displacement of the second connector <b>40</b> of the first arm <b>16</b> (and the corresponding structure in the second arm <b>18</b>),</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective depiction of proximal block <b>24</b>. Proximal block <b>24</b> includes internal threads <b>48</b> and rod passage <b>50</b>. Internal threads <b>48</b> can be configured to interact with an adjacent component, such as screw <b>19</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>D</figref>. Proximal block <b>24</b> is connected to first base plate <b>12</b> and second base plate <b>14</b> by rods <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, rod <b>28</b> connects first base plate <b>12</b> with proximal block <b>24</b>. Rod <b>28</b> can pass through rod passages <b>50</b> and <b>34</b> so that the proximal block <b>24</b> is mechanically coupled to first base plate <b>12</b> while allowing the base plates (<b>12</b>, <b>14</b>) to rotate relative to the blocks (<b>22</b>, <b>24</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> depict the connection structures between the first base plate <b>12</b> and adjoining structures. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a pin <b>26</b> that connects the first base plate <b>12</b> to the distal block <b>22</b> via the arms, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a rod <b>28</b> that connects the first base plate <b>12</b> to the proximal block <b>24</b>. Pin <b>26</b> further includes groove <b>52</b> which can hold ring <b>20</b>, as previously described.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In operation, first arm <b>16</b> and second arm <b>18</b> are rotatable and are connected to first base plate <b>12</b> and second base plate <b>14</b>, respectively. Because the structural connection between first base plate <b>12</b> and screw <b>19</b> is substantially similar to the structural connection between second base plate <b>14</b> and screw <b>19</b>, only the former will be described herein in detail. First base plate <b>12</b> is mechanically coupled via pins <b>26</b> to first arm <b>16</b> via arm socket <b>32</b>. First arm <b>16</b> and second aim <b>18</b> are also each mechanically coupled to screw <b>19</b> through distal block <b>22</b>. In all, this connection permits for first base plate <b>12</b> to be indirectly connected to the screw <b>19</b> while still permitting relative rotation between them. Together with rings <b>20</b>, distal block <b>22</b>, proximal block <b>24</b>, and pins <b>26</b>, a mechanical interconnection is formed between each of the base plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> that can be adjusted by an external tool (not shown). Rods <b>28</b> provide a pivot point that results in a specific relationship between the amount of extension of the device <b>10</b> and a relative angle between the first base plate <b>12</b> and the second base plate <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An external tool (not shown) can be used to turn screw <b>19</b>, via head <b>29</b>. Because proximal block <b>24</b> is internally threaded (as shown in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), rotation of screw <b>19</b> causes relative movement of the screw <b>19</b> with respect to the proximal block <b>24</b>. By contrast, distal block <b>2</b>.<b>2</b> is not internally threaded. Rather, distal block <b>22</b> and screw <b>19</b> are connected such that movement of screw <b>19</b> in either the proximal or distal directions (i.e., the direction in which screw <b>19</b> moves relative to proximal block <b>24</b> when rotated) causes a corresponding movement of the distal block <b>22</b>. This can be accomplished as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, where distal block <b>22</b> is pushed and/or pulled by screw <b>19</b>, and the interconnection is made by a spring or clamp on one side holding the distal block <b>22</b> against a flange on the screw <b>19</b>. In alternative embodiments, various other interconnections between the screw and block can be made, which will result in co-movement in the proximal or distal direction without co-rotation. As distal block <b>22</b> is moved by screw <b>19</b>, it forces movement of first arm <b>16</b> and second arm <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As screw <b>19</b> is rotated, due to the internal threading of proximal block <b>24</b>, the distance between the distal block <b>22</b> and proximal block <b>24</b> changes. As the distance between distal block <b>22</b> and proximal block <b>24</b> increases, the arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are caused to rotate. First arm <b>16</b> and second arm <b>18</b> rotate as the device <b>10</b> is converted from a collapsed configuration, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, to an expanded configuration, such as that shown with respect to</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. This rotation results in increased distance between the first base plate <b>12</b> and the second base plate <b>14</b>, as well as increased lordosis, As described with respect to other embodiments below, rotating screw <b>19</b> to change the distance between first base plate <b>12</b> and second base plate <b>14</b>, as well as changing the amount of lordosis, can be useful to provide intervertebral support.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D, and <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> provides such intervertebral spacing, support, and lordosis with a relatively straightforward mechanical structure. The device <b>10</b> can be implanted in a compact configuration, then expanded to the appropriate size and angle by rotating screw <b>19</b>, causing the: changes in angle and spacing previously described, as desired. Referring to FIGS, <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, there can be seen an expandable intervertebral cage device <b>100</b> according to an aspect of the present invention. Device <b>100</b> includes a device body <b>102</b>. Device body <b>102</b> can include a nose portion <b>104</b>, a rear portion <b>106</b>, a pair of opposed base plates <b>108</b> having outer bearing surfaces <b>107</b>, and a plurality of arm assemblies <b>110</b>. Schematic representations of a pair of adjacent vertebral bodies <b>10</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>B</figref>. Each arm assembly <b>110</b> can include a pair of opposed arms <b>112</b> hingedly attached to each other, with each opposing arm <b>112</b> hingedly attached to one of the base plates <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, device <b>100</b> can include three arm assemblies <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>and <b>110</b><i>c, </i>extending crosswise from first side <b>116</b> of device <b>100</b> to second side <b>118</b> of device <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, opposing arms <b>112</b> of arm assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c</i>. are pivotally coupled to a blocks <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, and <b>122</b><i>c </i>with pins <b>114</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>, actuation of second actuation member <b>120</b><i>b </i>in a first direction drives blocks <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>closer together, which causes expansion of arm assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>and distraction of base plates <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">First actuation member <b>120</b><i>a </i>and second actuation member <b>120</b><i>b </i>are capable of being actuated independently of each other. This independent actuation allows for angular orientation of the base plates <b>108</b> to be matched exactly to the unique alignment, or desired planar alignment, of adjacent vertebrae of a patient's spine. Examples of various possible angular orientations of base plates <b>108</b> in the distracted state can be seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>. Such angulations can be done when the device is expanded within the disc space, enabling the device to go between lordotic and kyphotic angles while in the disc space so that the surgeon can adjust as needed to correct the deformity based on observations made during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Conversely, actuation of first actuation member <b>120</b><i>a </i>in the opposite direction drives blocks <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>apart, thereby bringing base plates <b>108</b> closer together. Likewise, actuation of second actuation member <b>120</b><i>b </i>in the opposite direction drives blocks <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>apart, thereby bringing base plates <b>108</b> closer together. This back-drivability of the device <b>100</b> is helpful for sizing the device <b>100</b> and removing the device <b>100</b> if necessary, such as in the event of post-surgical infection, trauma, or failure to fuse.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, non-threaded portion <b>136</b> of actuation member <b>120</b> and its respective rotational coupling to block <b>122</b> enable device <b>100</b> to allow for additional distraction due to in-vivo axial tension. For example, the rotational coupling can be constructed with sufficient clearance to allow block <b>122</b><i>b </i>to temporarily slide closer to <b>122</b><i>a</i>, or block <b>122</b><i>c </i>to temporarily slide closer to block <b>122</b><i>b</i>. However, having distracted slightly under tensile loading the device would return to the original height as compressive loading is returned. The parallelism would remain unchanged, while lordotic endplates may undergo a small angular displacement that would return to the set lordosis with the reapplication of the normal compressive loading. This extensibility of device <b>100</b> could offer great benefits to the fusion process as the endplates, which may be growing into the endplates of the vertebral bodies, would not be pulled away from the endplates by motion of the patient's spine, damaging early bone growth.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, in place of non-threaded portion <b>136</b> and snap ring <b>139</b>, portions of the actuation member <b>120</b> can be reverse threaded to allow distraction without changing the position of the threaded members along the respective axes of the threaded members helping to keep the device from adversely interacting with the anatomy of the patient.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In various embodiments, device body <b>102</b> is shaped to be ergonomic. Device body <b>102</b> can have various shapes, such as, for example, rectangular or kidney-shaped. A kidney-shaped device body <b>102</b> maximizes contact between the device and the vertebral bodies because the base plates of vertebrae tend to be slightly concave. One or both ends of the device may also be tapered to facilitate insertion, This minimizes the amount of force needed to initially separate the vertebral bodies. In addition, the device may be convex along both its length and its width, or bi-convex. Device body can also be comprised of various materials. Such materials can include, for example, titanium, steel, PEEK, carbon fiber and cobalt chromium. The device can also be constructed in various sizes depending on the type of vertebra and size of patient with which it is being used, for example, specifically for an anterior lumbar interbody fusion, oblique or a laterlal interbody fusion. In some embodiments, the threaded member <b>120</b> can be micro-machined or split along its length and reconnected using a bellows or flexible torque transmission device, to be able to operate through an angle that may be necessitated by the shape of the device.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, a locking mechanism can be utilized to prevent rotation of the threaded members to ensure the device remains in the distracted state. In one embodiment, the locking mechanism can be activated with the insertion device. In one embodiment, locking may be enhanced by tightening a threaded nut (not shown) against one or more of the blocks <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As is demonstrated by a simplified form of device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, device <b>100</b> can stably support the disc space because it has negative one degree of freedom once locked in the distracted position with actuation members <b>120</b> in place. From Gruebler's equation, the number of degrees of freedom=3*(n&#x2212;1)&#x2212;2f, where n is the number of links in the linkage and f is the number of one degree of freedom kinematic pairs in the linkage. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the device <b>100</b> has 10 links and 14 kinematic pairs, so 3*(10&#x2212;1)&#x2212;2*14=&#x2212;1 degrees of freedom. The device is therefore actually over constrained (meaning that there are additional constraints beyond the minimum necessary to make it stable), and stable under loading conditions. This allows device <b>100</b> to stably support the disc space upon distraction. In some embodiments, a crush surface or compliant materials may be used in concert with structure to minimize hysteresis that may be present in the device and due to clearance in arm assemblies <b>112</b> necessary for overcoming the over-constraint in devices having fewer than zero degrees of freedom due to redundant constraints.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In operation, device <b>100</b> can be placed between adjacent vertebrae or vertebral bodies and used to distract the endplates of the adjacent vertebral bodies and subsequently serve as a fusion device. One or more insertion tools (not depicted) can be used to insert and distract device <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B and <b>11</b></figref>, the device body <b>102</b> can be seen in its initial compressed configuration, In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>19</b>B</figref>, device body <b>102</b> is in various expanded configurations. The insertion tool can be connected to actuation members <b>120</b> with the proximal block <b>122</b><i>a </i>and first used to insert device <b>100</b> into a desired location. Device <b>100</b> can be inserted with tapered nose portion <b>104</b> first. One device <b>100</b> can be inserted, or, for additional support, two devices <b>100</b> can be inserted. Two devices <b>100</b>, each sized to be inserted within one-half of the evacuated disc space, can be especially useful for treating larger patients in which the device may encounter higher loads. In another embodiment, three or more small devices can be inserted into the disc space in order to very accurately control the orientation and distance between the discs. Three or more distraction mechanisms may be positioned circumferentially between two circular endplates to result in very accurate control and orientation of the base plates. Such a device would resemble a hexapod.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">To distract device <b>100</b>, an insertion tool can be used to rotate actuation members <b>120</b> in a first direction. Actuation of threaded member <b>120</b><i>a </i>in a first direction drives blocks <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>closer together, which causes distraction of base plates <b>108</b>. Likewise, actuation of threaded member <b>120</b><i>b </i>in a first direction drives blocks <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>closer together, which causes distraction of base plates <b>108</b>. Actuation of threaded members <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>in the opposite direction respectively drives blocks <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>and blocks <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>apart, thereby bringing base plates <b>108</b> closer together.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once base plates <b>108</b> are distracted to a desired degree, insertion tools can be disconnected from threaded members <b>120</b> and the device <b>100</b> can remain within the body, in one embodiment, a locking mechanism can be utilized to prevent rotation of the threaded members to ensure the device remains in the distracted state.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once device is inserted and supporting the adjacent vertebral bodies, it can be utilized to promote vertebral fusion. Following distraction, a bone growth stimulant, such as autograft, bone morphogenic protein, or bone enhancing material, can be delivered into an open area defined within the device. In one embodiment, bone growth stimulant is delivered after insertion tools are disconnected. In another embodiment, bone growth stimulant is delivered through an open area between insertion tools, in a further embodiment, bone growth stimulant can be delivered through a hollow chamber within the insertion tools. Device is capable of supporting in-vivo loads during the 6 to 12 weeks that fusion occurs between the vertebral bodies. In one embodiment, openings <b>124</b> in base plates <b>108</b> promote and allow for bone growth into and through the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, when the device is implanted and in the process of being expanded, as blocks come closer together the blocks compress the bone graft or bone fusion material that can be inserted inside device to force the material out of the internal chamber of the device an in the adjacent vertebral end plates. This will enhance bone integration into the end plates. Some bone material will remain within the cage, which will integrate and fuse the center of the cage to the top and bottom of the end plates. In certain embodiments, the bone material can be injected into the device through one of the longitudinal holes in the proximal block of the device that does not have an actuation member therethrough. This could be done with the inserter device or separate extended syringe. In some embodiments, the top and bottom base plates of the device can be coated to enhance bone integration.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternative embodiment, a pin can extend vertical through the device to stabilize the proximal end of the device. Such a device could be expanded utilizing only a distal set of arm assemblies and would provide only lordotic angles. Alternatively, the pin could stabilize the distal end of the device, which could then be expanded with a single screw and one or more proximally located arm assemblies to provide kyphotic angles.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although the various devices described herein are described as being brought from a compressed configuration to an expanded configuration by rotation of a threaded member, the devices can be distracted by any other type of actuation member.

Such mechanisms include, for example, a pop-rivet mechanism, a sardine key and ribbon, a tourniquet and wire, a saw blade/ratchet, a zip-tie-like mechanism, piezo-electric inch worm motors and shape changing materials such as a shape member alloy or a conducting polymer actuator. These alternative locking mechanisms could be designed to make the device behave as if it were locked with a threaded member, preventing the device from being compressed as well as extended, or these mechanisms could afford the device the capability to ratchet upwards post implantation if such action would benefit the patient or provide additional therapy.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Various embodiments of implantation procedures for the disclosed embodiments of expandable intervertebral cage devices may be as follows:</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Lumbar: A lumbar implant can be 8 mm in height, expandable to 14 mm in height, with a length of 25-30 mm and a width of 10-12 mm.
