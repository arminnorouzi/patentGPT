The copyright owner has no objection to the xeroxographic reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wrist watch and particularly to a bracelet type wrist watch which is designed to wear around the wrist as an ornament.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wristwatches have long been designed as jewelry items for adornment of the wrist as well as for their functional timekeeping capability. However, there may be times when adornment is the paramount consideration and it is desired to exhibit a decorative design, precious stones or the like, rather than the face of a timepiece.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Small watches are designed to be worn around the wrist by using leather straps, synthetic resin or metal bands in the form of bracelets. Otherwise, watches are designed to be worn around the neck by using chains or straps in the form of a hanging ornament or pendant, or around the ring finger by using circles. Among these different types of wrist watches customers take their choice to fit their suits or dresses. Thus, there are two different aspects of the wrist watch: an instrument for measuring and showing time, and at the same time, an ornament or accessory matching a dress or suit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently the role of the wrist watch as an ornament has become more important than the role of the wrist watch as an instrument for measuring and showing time. There has been an ever-increasing demand for unique ornamental design.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reversible wristwatches are known in the prior art. One such reversible wristwatch is disclosed in Swiss Pat. No. 138929&#x2014;Schierwater published Jun. 2, 1930 in which a watch case is rotatable about two diametrically opposed pins by means of a strap attachment connected to a collar. This permits protection of the crystal while engaged in sports. However, since the strap attachment conforms to the curvature of the watch, either a spring or an expansion band is provided to give necessary slack to rotate the watch. The patent refers to a caseback which may be ornamental, fitted with a medallion, or having a coat of enamel carrying a decorative motif on the surface of the caseback.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another such reversible wristwatch is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,561, issued Jan. 15, 1985 Bouchet, in which the watch case is rotatably mounted its 6 o'clock-noon axis on two bars perpendicular to the axis, each of the bars being attached to respective opposite ends of a watch strap. Although this wristwatch is primarily intended for two movements and/or two opposed dials each viewable through crystals on opposite sides of the bezel, it suggests that the case might contain only one movement which would be visible from one side of the case only, the other side or bottom of the case being provided with precious or semi-precious stones.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another reversible watch with a decorative back such as an engraved monogram, but with attachment suitable for a leather strap, is shown in French patent application 79 02771 filed Feb. 2, 1979 and published as No. 1 447 692 on Aug. 29, 1980.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are multiple inventions that have been proposed in prior art regarding bringing an advancement and enhanced utility in case of bracelets and wrist watches combination. Furthermore, the utilization of these systems in daily life are quite cumbersome and non-effective. Also, the features of these utility system are quite limited.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The instant invention attempts to overcome deficiencies of the prior art by providing a by providing a wrist watch of unique ornamental design, while still assuring the ease with which the wrist watch can be worn around the wrist.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">None of the previous inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Hence, the inventor of the present invention proposes to resolve and surmount existent technical difficulties to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings of prior art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In light of the disadvantages of the prior art, the following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention and is not intended to be a full description.
