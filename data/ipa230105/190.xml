Conventionally, artificial eyelashes relied on an array of fibers secured by a temporary adhesive to an eyelid of a wearer, just above the wearer's natural, upper eyelash. Eventually, the technology moved on to include artificial eyelashes that secured temporarily to the natural eyelashes themselves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The modern and current status of technology is that highly trained technicians using highly reactive adhesives such as cyanoacrylates may apply individual fibers to individual lashes of a wearer thereby providing a &#x201c;semi-permanent&#x201d; extension to each eyelash. Such eyelash extensions require about two to three hours to apply a full set of extensions to both eyelashes. They typically last for about three weeks, although vigorous touching, washing, or exposure to cleansers may weaken the bond of an extension causing it to separate from a natural lash. Also, lashes may fall out, especially as they age, carrying with them any extension attached.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain complex, precision processes exist for applying individual extensions. Nevertheless, both the &#x201c;full set&#x201d; application and the &#x201c;individual extension&#x201d; application have their own limitations. For example, individual, semi-permanent extensions take more time than many potential wearers are willing to invest for installation or application. Of course, the time in training and safety precautions by a technician comes at a cost, as well. Professional artificial lash extensions also require a professional to apply them. The consumer or end user cannot apply the artificial lashes themselves.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is a method and apparatus to improve comfort, improve longevity, and reduce installation or application time for extensions. It would also be an advance to provide for a degree of artistic shaping of lengths, density (number of filaments per unit distance), or the like. Extensions are distributed along an eyelash of a user, such as from near the medial (center) plane of symmetry of the face toward a lateral or outside edge of the face. For example, near the nose, lashes need to be shorter, and possibly softer, whereas they may be longer near the center or near the outside (lateral) region of the natural lashes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are two main categories of artificial eyelashes: semi-permanent eyelash extensions applied by a professional technician; and daily-wear artificial eyelash extensions that can be applied by a consumer, and are applied and removed daily. Typically, daily-wear artificial eyelashes are applied with a temporary adhesive, are difficult to apply, and are generally considered uncomfortable. They may also come off prematurely with moisture, such as sweat, tears, or the like. They are applied as a group with a plurality of artificial lashes attached at the base. These groups of artificial eyelashes, or strips, can be applied with fingers or tweezers by the person wearing them. They typically require about 20 minutes to apply, generally in the morning.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed is a method and apparatus to allow consumers, or end users, to apply artificial lash extensions themselves in a quick and easy manner, and have the artificial eyelashes be able to remain affixed for more than one day, preferably, more than 3-7 days. Such a product may be applied quickly and easily by the consumer, or user, and allow for multi-day wear.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including a group of segments, where each segment represents a certain lateral (side-to-side) group of extensions having a selected density, where density means the number of individual fibers (filaments) per unit distance laterally. For example, one hundred percent density would be one fiber next to another or one filament next to another across the entire width of a full set of extensions. A fifty percent density would be fifty percent spaces and fifty percent fibers or filaments as extensions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Conventional attempts at a semi-permanent application of a full-coverage extension product in which an array of extensions is applied to a full eyelash causes another entirely unacceptable set of problems. As a temporary arrangement, for a day, such systems may be acceptable. Semi-permanent application means the extensions must remain in place for weeks. This creates maintenance problems and discomfort overcome by the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, eyelashes grow at different rates. When a new, natural eyelash begins to grow, its rate of growth per day is substantially higher than that of an older lash. As lashes age, the rate of growth decreases. Thus, bonding anything to adjacent lashes (new and fast-growing type alongside an older and slower growing type) causes marked discomfort for a user. Techniques, apparatus, and materials in accordance with the invention alleviate this problem. A plurality of artificial eyelash fibers may be fixed at the base and then adhered to a group of natural eyelashes, so they are all affixed together. Thus, a group of artificial eyelashes and a group of natural eyelashes may all be adhered together, but still allow for the natural growth of the natural eyelashes, individually and as a group.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a system and method in accordance with the invention, individual fibers are arranged at a preselected density then bonded together with a substrate, such as a ribbon or tape into which the individual fibers or filaments acting as extensions are embedded, or adhered. An adhesive may be built into the tape or substrate, may be applied after bonding to the filaments or fibers, or both. In certain embodiments, a double-sided tape may adhere by one surface to a structural substrate securing filaments of an extension, while an opposite surface adheres to a natural eyelash. A substrate may have filaments adhered to it by an adhesive or embedded within its base material itself. A double-sided tape may secure to the substrate on the lash side of the substrate, while an opposite face of the tape embeds into itself the natural eyelash to which the extension is applied. In certain embodiments, an artificial eyelash segment may be grouped together and have a base, but initially, have no tape adhesive. One side of such a segment may be dipped in an adhesive, or have an adhesive applied to the appropriate side, or have adhesive applied to both sides.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment in accordance with the invention, segments are formed to be a few millimeters wide (laterally). In such an arrangement, three to six segments may correspond to the overall width of an eyelash of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the segments may be applied to (e.g., placed in contact with) an underside of an eyelash of a user. The substrate is then compressed into place to deform adhesive on the substrate into and among the spaces between individual natural eyelashes. In order to prevent contamination, picking up dust, lint, and so forth, a top liner or cover may be applied on the upper side of the natural lash. In some embodiments, the cover may actually be a substrate of an additional segment of suitable density.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other embodiments, the cover may simply be a clear or colored portion of the same or similar tape used as a substrate in forming each segment. In some embodiments, the cover layer on the upper side of a natural lash may be offset laterally from segments attached to the lower side of the lash. This tends to smooth out any boundaries between adjacent segments, or blend the seams between adjacent segments so it is not apparent that it was there.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, where both upper and lower segments are used, the density of each may be considerably less than the density of segments that will only be applied to the underside of an upper eyelash. In this way, selective densities may be manufactured in order that a technician or wearer may select a density that tends to look more natural. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, according to ancient maxims, the beholder may be close or distant. For a more natural look, additional length is desirable, but density should still be reasonable.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one currently contemplated method for implementing or applying lash extensions as a series of segments adhered to the natural lashes of a wearer, a process may include selecting single or dual extensions. For example, one may select to apply extensions only to an underside of the natural lashes of a user. Alternatively, one may elect to place dual segments, one above and one below the natural lash. These may be selected to be matched, or one may be offset from another.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In fact, the width of one segment may be either different from or the same as that of one placed on an opposite side (top or bottom) of a natural lash to effect a lateral offset. This will tend to reduce any tendency for a change in slope (e.g., bending at a point where there is no substrate support between segments) later. Typically, if a single set of extensions is applied to the upper eyelashes corresponding to each eye, then a cover strip may be applied, looking something like an eyeliner, on the upper side. Alternatively, other treatments may be used, such as curing, drying, or the like in order to reduce or eliminate adhesive properties of the adhesive on the segment that might extrude between the natural eyelashes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The process may next select either lengths, or a range of lengths for the individual segments that will be applied to an eyelash. That is, different lengths of filaments or fibers making up the extensions may be applied. Length may even be variable within a segment. Typically, a distribution will actually be selected in which, for example, closer to the nose or the medial aspect of the face, extensions are the shortest. Closer to the center of the natural eyelash, the filaments will typically be longest, while at the outside or lateral aspect of the natural lashes, length reduces to less than that near the center but still greater than the medial extensions. In some embodiments, a user may desire for the longest length to actually be at the lateral extreme (outermost) segment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A technician may provide a setup or may set up the environment including positioning a wearer in a recumbent position. Necessary trays of segments sit in proximity, for easy access. Typically, it is very useful to have trays labeled as well as presenting a physical distribution of segments within a tray. A technician may then readily work from one side to another in sequence, ordered by the arrangement of the segments on a delivery tray serving up the extensions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, cleaning will be required in order to remove oils naturally occurring on lashes. For example, various adhesives may not bond in the presence of oils. Oils are ubiquitous on skin, transferring to hair, lashes, eyebrows and so forth. Thus, cleaning may involve using soaps, other cleansers, solvents, or the like to remove oils and other contaminant including dust and the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Masking is an optional step in that it provides a clean work area, protection for the eyes themselves, separation or taping down (out of the work space) the lower lashes that are not typically involved in application of extensions, and so forth. Similarly, masking provides a stable space for resting fingers of a technician or hands of a technician in applying extensions. This maintains a clean work area without transferring oils from the face of a subject (wearer) to instruments and hands of a technician.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Proper masking may also stabilize eyelids in a closed configuration. A wearer has an upper eyelid and a lower eyelid. However, masking helps to stabilize the lower eyelid and hold down the lower lash against the lower eyelid. Meanwhile, stabilization of the upper eyelid may assist in fixing the natural lash to aid in the precision of the application of the extension segments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Application of extensions may begin with removing a backer from adhesive on a segment to be applied, positioning that segment with respect to the natural lash, and contacting that natural lash. Pressure may be applied with the nibs of a tweezer. The tweezer is configured to provide comfortable access by the technician, and a full width application of pressure on the tape or substrate pressed against the natural lash. This process of picking up a segment, removing its backer, positioning it at the proper location, in contacting a natural lash, and applying pressure is repeated for each segment. Applying pressure may be done repeatedly especially at boundaries between segments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In fact, even if dual extensions are not used, one may overlap slightly the substrates on adjacent segments. In some embodiments, the substrates may actually have a slight gap or clear space to which no extension fiber or filaments are attached. This provides materials for such overlapping. Again, any overlapping on the same side of the lash, or on an opposite side of the natural lash may provide a more consistent shaping or curvature of the overall set of applied lash extensions.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Following application of a full set of extensions (corresponding to one eye), the technician may apply a cover layer. The cover layer may be another set of extensions. Lash always means the natural lash. The material of the extension may or may not be natural. An extension may typically be an artificial fiber, often mono-filament, but may be a natural fiber or hair. Nevertheless, the cover layer applied may be another set of segments constituting an extension set on an opposite (upper) side of a lash. Alternatively, simple strips, such as the material of the tape or substrate used in the segments may also serve, appearing much like eyeliner, or perhaps another set of eyelashes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Following application of a set of extensions, a technician may brush the lashes and extensions. A round brush, similar to that of a mascara applicator works. It is elongated in a longitudinal direction and has a round cross section orthogonal to its longitudinal direction. Brushing out the extension fibers side to side separates the fibers from one another. Brushing them from near the eyelid away from the eyelid also separates and tends to render uniform the spacing therebetween. Meanwhile, the technician may unmask the user following the completion of application of brushing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Certain definitions may be helpful, since natural and artificial fibers or filaments may be used in a method and apparatus in accordance with the invention. Likewise, natural lashes, artificial lashes, and lash extensions are all mentioned, militating for precise and consistent vocabulary. Context should be clear for all uses of words or terms, herein, but the following definitions reflect an attempt to define and use terms consistently.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A lash or eyelash is a complete natural eyelash, all such terms being interchangeable. Such a term includes the entire plurality of hairs constituting either an upper eyelash or a lower eyelash naturally occurring in an eyelid of a person.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hair means natural hair, a lash hair being a single strand of hair in or from an eyelash.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The width of a lash is the length of an arc, along an eyelid (medial to lateral in medical terminology), spanning the lash. Thus, the width extends in a lateral direction across an entire lash itself, measured from a medial end or edge of the eyelash to the lateral end. Medial and lateral are used in their medical sense as being closest to a center plane of symmetry (medial) and outer edge spaced perpendicularly away from the medial plane (lateral), respectively.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A filament or fiber means a single strand of material, whether natural or artificial, whether woven, braided, twisted, or monofilament, intended to simulate an individual lash hair when incorporated into a lash extension system, device, or product.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Natural material is used to identify materials that occur naturally, in nature, and may be harvested and formed without chemical or biological transformations, such as reactions, refining, leaching, and the like. Hair, feathers, down, wood, cotton, and the like are examples of natural materials.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Artificial material, as an expression, means materials manufactured from raw materials and transforming those materials, typically by heating, refining, processing, reacting, polymerization, or the like to create a material not found naturally. It is physically or chemically constituted in use. Plastics, elastomers, and other polymers, including synthetic fibers derived from petroleum are typical of artificial materials.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An extension is a system, device, and method involving securement of filaments to eyelashes resulting in an appearance of additional length, density (number of filaments per unit distance of width along the eyelash), color, curl, or other observable property. Such augmentation of properties of eyelashes is typically based on some perception or intention of beautification.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Semi-permanent, applied to lash extensions or any portion or combination thereof, means remaining operational for multiple days, at least three days, and usually for seven or more days. This applies to solid materials, adhesives, and so forth, in normal use and not when subjected to extraordinary stress (force per unit area), strain (stretch per unit length), solvents, other reactive chemicals, extremes of pH sufficient to contribute to failure, or the like, which may occur due to exposure to unreasonable conditions not normally expected in the course of reasonably careful wearing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, a method for applying an artificial eyelash to a natural eyelash may include the steps of: cleaning a natural eyelash to remove unwanted dirt and oil; then applying a first adhesive, or a liquid adhesive, to the natural eyelash in a manner that effectively coats the natural eyelash; then allowing the first adhesive to cure and/or become tacky; then applying an artificial eyelash to the underside of the natural eyelash, wherein the artificial eyelash may be described as having a proximate end and a distal end, with the proximate end being the end of the artificial eyelash that would be applied closest to the eyelid of the natural eyelash, and wherein the artificial eyelash may further include a second adhesive, or a pressure-sensitive tape adhesive, which is located near the proximate end and substantially along the length of the proximate end, and wherein the artificial eyelash may include a transverse fiber along the length of the proximate end; and then applying pressure to the artificial eyelash in a manner that mixes the first adhesive and the second adhesive and adheres the artificial eyelash to the natural eyelash.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the transverse fiber may be located on the opposite side of the artificial lash from the second adhesive. This configuration may also be described as having the second adhesive and the transverse fiber on opposite sides of the artificial lash and along the length of the proximate end. The first adhesive, or liquid adhesive, may be comprised of various components, including styrene/acrylates/ammonium methacrylate copolymer, water, adhesion promoter, acrylate copolymer, and a color component or compound such as carbon black. The second adhesive, or pressure-sensitive tape adhesive, may be a non-Newtonian adhesive fluid. The mixing and activating of the first adhesive and the second adhesive, by applying pressure or some other suitable means, may create a fluid bond between the adhesives, which fluid bond allows the natural eyelash to continue to grow at a normal rate while the artificial eyelash is adhered to, but without uncomfortable bunching, wrinkling, or pinching (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;creep&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the artificial eyelash may be packaged in such a manner that the artificial eyelash is removable from the packaging in a manner that allows the second adhesive to become exposed, and ready for application, as the artificial eyelash is removed from the packaging. An artificial eyelash may include a second adhesive that is covered by a backer, or protective film. A backer prevents contamination and curing of the pre-applied adhesive on the artificial eyelash extension. While in the packaging for the artificial eyelash, the artificial eyelash may be positioned so that the backer, or protective film, is relatively securely attached to the packaging. Then, when the artificial eyelash is removed from the packaging, the protective film remains with the packaging and exposes the second adhesive. Thus, the artificial eyelash is prepared for application as soon as it is removed from the packaging. There is no need to apply any other adhesive to the artificial eyelash because the second adhesive, as one example a pressure-sensitive adhesive, is already on the artificial eyelash. In other words, the artificial eyelash is sold to a user in a manner that allows the user to apply the artificial eyelash to their natural eyelashes without the assistance of a technician, and without additional chemicals, preparation materials, special tools, or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the process of method for adhering an artificial eyelash to a natural eyelash may be completed within approximately minutes, and even within sixty (60) seconds. Also, the artificial eyelash may stay or remain adhered or affixed to the natural eyelash for multiple days, at least three (3) days, and even from about 7-14 days.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The process or method for adhering an artificial eyelash to a natural eyelash may be repeated in a substantially similar manner so that artificial eyelashes may be applied to both the underside and topside of a natural eyelash. Such a &#x201c;sandwiched&#x201d; configuration may allow the artificial eyelashes to remain adhered or affixed to the natural eyelashes for approximately 14-28 days.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The foregoing and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0095">It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the drawings herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the drawings, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, but is merely representative of various embodiments of the invention. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref>, a schematic diagram of a system <b>10</b> or a lash extension <b>10</b> illustrates a natural lash <b>12</b> (hereinafter always referred to as a lash), and a series of fibers <b>14</b> or extensions, also sometimes referred to as filaments <b>14</b>. In general, a single extension <b>14</b> may be a single fiber or a single filament of a natural or artificial material. Hereinafter, a fiber <b>14</b>, filament <b>14</b>, or the like will always refer to the material <b>14</b> or the device <b>14</b> that operates as an individual substitute for a natural lash hair in a system <b>10</b> such as the extensions set <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The word &#x201c;extension&#x201d; may be used to refer to both an entire set <b>10</b> or an individual fiber <b>14</b>. Context should make it clear. In the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>10</b> or extension <b>10</b> relies on a substrate <b>16</b> such as a band <b>16</b> or tape <b>16</b>. This substrate <b>16</b> may be film, may be a polymer, and may at different stages be, for example, an uncured polymer, a B-staged polymer where it is partially cured, or may be a fully cured and therefore mechanically stable polymer. This substrate may be any type of pre-applied adhesive suitable for the intended purpose.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two bands <b>16</b> are used, each holding a series of fibers <b>14</b> aligned substantially in parallel and bonded to the natural lash <b>12</b> by an adhesive <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the band <b>16</b> may have an adhesive <b>18</b> applied, at the time of manufacture, or applied at the time of application (installation) to the lashes <b>12</b> of a subject (wearer).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the upper band <b>16</b>, or the upper one of the two bands <b>16</b> is adhered above the natural lash <b>12</b>. Accordingly, it acts as a cover <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, a band <b>16</b> may be applied as a cover <b>20</b> with no additional fibers contributed by its presence. In such an embodiment, the cover <b>20</b> becomes something of an eyeliner layer <b>20</b> that may be colored to match the color of the fibers <b>14</b> or simply be a dark color to match any desired color.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, a synthetic eyelash system <b>10</b> may consist of distinct upper and lower segments of lashes. Each segment may have specific characteristics. Any segment may implement an adhesive tape <b>16</b> in a specific, prescribed manner. An adhesive tape <b>16</b> may be considered as double-sided tape. An adhesive tape may be comprised of poly methyl methacrylate, and may include other compounds. An adhesive <b>18</b> that thickens may be used, and an adhesive may be non-Newtonian. In one embodiment, an adhesive may be absent and replaced with a heat fusion process.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a single band <b>16</b> is formed, holding a series of fibers <b>14</b> or filaments <b>14</b>, which filaments <b>14</b> may be tapered locally (distal end), or along their entire length. In one currently contemplated embodiment, the individual filaments <b>14</b> or fibers <b>14</b> may be tapered only near their distal ends, where the distal end is farthest from the subject. The proximal end is closest to the subject and held by the band <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Typically, the band <b>16</b> in such an embodiment is on the lower extremum of each filament <b>14</b>. Thus, adhesive <b>18</b> is applied on an upper extremum. As a matter of fact, the band <b>16</b> may be melted, injected, or otherwise cured to not only fit below the filaments <b>14</b> but to surround them. An adhesive layer <b>18</b> may be added to the band <b>16</b> at or before the time of application of the system <b>10</b> to a user.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the concept of a tapered filament <b>14</b> is illustrated schematically. As a practical matter, eyelashes <b>12</b> are typically tapered at their distal end as a natural result of their emerging at a smaller diameter than their eventual mature diameter. Nevertheless, lashes <b>12</b> naturally grow like hair at a single thickness along the majority of their length. Therefore, the concept of a taper that is continuous along the entire length of a filament <b>14</b> may exist, but it is not necessary. However, tapering the distal ends or tips of the filaments <b>14</b> provides a much more natural look to the filaments <b>14</b> once applied.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, while continuing to refer generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>25</b></figref>, a system <b>10</b> or extensions <b>10</b> will typically be applied as segments <b>22</b>. A series <b>23</b> of segments <b>22</b> will constitute a set <b>23</b>. When completely applied to the natural lashes <b>12</b> of a subject a set <b>23</b> of segments <b>22</b> constitute a system <b>10</b> of extensions <b>10</b>. That is, a full set <b>23</b>, once applied, becomes a system <b>10</b> or a full extension <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the illustrated embodiment, a tray <b>24</b> or case <b>24</b> is provided with stations <b>25</b> as depressions <b>25</b> or indentations <b>25</b> within a material as holders <b>25</b> for the different segments <b>22</b> to be used in an application. One will note that the density (the number of filaments <b>14</b> or fibers <b>14</b> per unit of width) along the band <b>16</b> of each segment <b>22</b> is comparatively sparse. Typically, the overall density desired is somewhat more dense than the natural lashes <b>12</b>. However, each filament <b>14</b> typically has a somewhat greater diameter than that of a natural lash <b>12</b>. Length is substantially longer than that of a natural lash <b>12</b>. That's why &#x201c;extensions&#x201d; exist.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the illustrated embodiment, the band <b>16</b> on each segment <b>22</b> is covered with a backer <b>21</b> protecting the adhesive <b>18</b> on the band <b>16</b> against contamination, or against other contact. The backer <b>21</b> will eventually be removed by a technician before contacting a subject's natural lash <b>12</b> by the adhesive <b>18</b> on a band <b>16</b> of a segment <b>22</b>. The band <b>16</b> may ultimately be used to refer to the entire continuous expanse of individual bands <b>16</b> for each segment <b>22</b> once applied to natural lashes <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, at the time of installation or application, the band <b>16</b> will be comparatively close (within a millimeter on tow) to the eyelid <b>29</b> of a subject. Thus, a short distance or length of the natural lashes <b>12</b> will proceed from the eyelid <b>29</b> outward toward a distal end. The band <b>16</b> of a segment <b>22</b> will be secured to several natural lashes <b>12</b>, and preferably on the underside of the lash <b>12</b> first. That is, doubling up in a dual extension <b>10</b> is not necessary, although it may be used in some situations. Regardless of the mode of application, as single or dual segments <b>22</b> and extensions <b>10</b>, the filaments <b>14</b> or fibers <b>14</b> extend from the band <b>16</b> away from the eyelid <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, some weeks later, given the growth of the natural lashes <b>12</b>, the band <b>16</b> moves away from the eyelid <b>29</b>. In the illustrated schematic, the band <b>16</b> at some point will therefore be removed and replaced with a new set of segments <b>22</b> against the lashes <b>12</b> as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">An additional mechanism is found useful in the adhesive <b>18</b>. If the adhesive <b>18</b> is excessively rigid, then adjacent lashes <b>12</b>, growing at different rates (distance or length per unit of elapsed time) may cause tension or compression by lashes <b>12</b> against the eyelid <b>20</b>. It has been found preferable to use a rheological material such as a rheological adhesive <b>18</b> in order to permit a certain amount of creep (permanent deformation of molecules) or even yielding (permanent displacement of atoms) of the adhesive over time.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">By rheological material is meant a non-Newtonian material. Newtonian fluids operate according to conventional rules of viscosity. A fluid, whether gas, saturated vapor, or liquid is defined in the art of fluid mechanics as a material that will move under any amount of stress. How fast such a fluid will respond to shear stress is measured in terms of viscosity. A more viscous material (e.g., honey, heavy oils, etc.) will have a different response from that of a thinner, less viscous, or more inviscid liquid (e.g., water, alcohol, etc.).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A rheological material may act like a solid, but flow as a non-Newtonian fluid under sufficient stress or prolonged stress.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, rheological materials may operate as solids under a certain amount of stress (where stress is a force per unit of area, whether tension, compression, or shear), but operate as a fluid or somewhat like a fluid under a higher stress. Various varieties of these non-Newtonian materials that can operate as both solids and fluids may involve highly viscous materials, may involve fillers that tend to stabilize a fluid, or may involve Bingham plastics.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">A Bingham plastic is a material that does not move under some predetermined amount of stress, but then begins to flow once that level of stress is exceeded. A filled Bingham plastic may respond to stress by distorting, and even releasing and readhering to a lash <b>12</b>. Thus, comfort is greatly increased by using a rheological material as the adhesive <b>18</b>. In this way, materials may be used as adhesives <b>18</b> that accommodate the differential growth rates between newer and older natural lashes <b>12</b> captured by a single segment <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, the fact that segments <b>22</b> need not contact one another, provides for more natural movement of the filaments <b>14</b>. This provides a decoupling of stresses between different, neighboring, natural lashes <b>12</b> emerging from an eyelid <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, in certain embodiments, it has been found that filaments <b>14</b> on edge segments <b>22</b> may lose filaments <b>14</b>. Those nearest the medial plane of the face (closest to the nose) and nearest to the lateral aspect of the face (outboard edge of the natural lashes <b>12</b>) need lateral support. Side-to-side throughout the main body of a system <b>10</b>, various fibers <b>14</b> or filaments <b>14</b> have each other, the intervening band <b>16</b> and adhesive <b>18</b> to keep them in place. Little lateral support is available to the last fibers <b>14</b> on each edge. Thus, fibers <b>14</b> may shed from near the ends of the combined overall band <b>16</b> of a system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a fold <b>30</b> or edging <b>30</b> may extend beyond the individual filaments <b>14</b> extending from the base <b>16</b> or band <b>16</b> of an individual segment <b>22</b>. Thus, the lateral-most or the edge segments <b>22</b> may have their band <b>16</b> extended as an edge <b>30</b> or fold <b>30</b>. The fold <b>30</b> may then be doubled back over to form a lateral stabilizer <b>32</b> in the segment <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a process <b>40</b> in accordance with the invention may involve selecting a form or style of extension <b>10</b>. For example, single extensions <b>10</b> may simply adhere to the underside of the natural lash <b>12</b> of a wearer. Dual systems <b>10</b> may bond segments <b>22</b> both below and above the natural lash <b>12</b>. Likewise, the amount of curl or the arc radius of curling, as well as the location at which it begins may be selected. For example, a particular radius of curl may be desirable, and may begin at the band <b>16</b>. Alternatively, curl may actually begin near a distal end. The filaments <b>14</b> or fibers <b>14</b> may actually be straight at the band <b>16</b>. Moreover, the radius of curl may be designed into a set of fibers <b>14</b> in a segment <b>22</b> to be long and sweeping or short and opening quickly with distance away from the eyelid, toward the distal end of the fibers <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">A technician, typically in consultation with a subject (wearer) will typically select a length or a range of lengths to be used for the fibers <b>14</b> in individual segments <b>22</b>. Segments <b>22</b> may typically be from about three to about seven in number to form one system <b>10</b> corresponding to a single eye. It has been found that a group of about six segments <b>22</b> covering a distance of about a few dozen millimeters or a few centimeters will typically accommodate the lash <b>12</b> of one eye or corresponding to one eye.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In a method <b>40</b> in accordance with the invention, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a variety of lengths. They range from nine millimeters closest to the medial plane of the face to twelve millimeters near the center of the extension <b>10</b>. The outer segments <b>22</b> have a length of about ten millimeters in that embodiment.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">A setup <b>46</b> by a technician may involve an arrangement of the subject in a comfortable, typically recumbent, position. The head and neck are properly supported to stabilize the face. Stability aids precision and easy access by the technician and comfort of the subject. Likewise, providing the selection of segments <b>22</b> at the proper lengths, according to the selections <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and arranging them in a tray <b>24</b> close at hand for easy access by the technician. Similarly, adhesives <b>18</b> may need to be provided for in the tray <b>24</b>, although the illustrated embodiment contemplates an adhesive <b>18</b> previously applied to the band <b>16</b> of each segment <b>22</b>, and covered with a backer <b>21</b> that may be removed with or without tools.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, while continuing to refer generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>25</b></figref>, a tweezer <b>70</b> or forcep <b>70</b> may be used, typically made of a handle <b>72</b> or handle portion <b>72</b> and terminating in nibs <b>74</b> at a distal end thereof. Typically, at a proximal end, the handle <b>72</b> may be comprised of a bend that operates as a spring. Alternatively, the handle <b>72</b> may be made in two pieces bonded together at a proximal end and bent in such a curvature that they are by default open at the nibs <b>74</b> at a distal end.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The illustrated embodiment illustrates a training template <b>78</b> having simulated natural lashes <b>12</b> to which a set <b>23</b> of segments <b>22</b> may be attached in training. The nibs <b>74</b> may hold, manipulate, and otherwise move the segment <b>22</b> into contact with the lash <b>12</b>. The adhesive <b>18</b> on the band <b>16</b> or strip <b>16</b> adheres against the lash <b>12</b>. Typically, if a single set <b>23</b> is to be attached to the lash <b>12</b>, then the segments <b>22</b> will typically adhere to the underside of the natural lash <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">A cover <b>20</b> may adhere opposite the band <b>16</b> and adhesive <b>18</b>. Alternatively, another segment <b>22</b> (a dual) having downward facing adhesive <b>18</b> may be the cover <b>20</b>. Another band <b>16</b>, absent any filaments may be applied as a cover <b>20</b> to protect any adhesive <b>18</b> exposed between the natural lashes <b>12</b>. A material to neutralize the adhesive may be painted on, dusted on, or simply result from curing or reacting with the adhesive to form a stable skin thereon.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, while continuing to refer generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>25</b></figref>, the segment <b>22</b> of filaments <b>14</b> or fibers <b>14</b> may be held temporarily in the fingers of a technician in order to expose the backer <b>21</b> protecting the adhesive <b>18</b>. The distal end of the nibs <b>74</b> may be used to capture the backer <b>21</b> and peel it away from the adhesive <b>18</b> on the band <b>16</b> of the segment <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the step of moving a segment <b>22</b> into contact with the lash <b>12</b> by the adhesive <b>18</b> on a band <b>16</b> is illustrated. Meanwhile, in subsequent steps, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates the application of pressure between the nibs <b>74</b> to deform the adhesive, causing it to fill in between and around the lashes <b>12</b>. The band <b>16</b> is consequently bonded with its filaments <b>14</b> as a segment <b>22</b>. The distance between the nibs <b>74</b> may be reduced to approach zero by closing the handles <b>72</b>. Due to being nearly parallel, the nibs <b>74</b> may apply pressure along the entire length of the band <b>16</b> of a segment <b>22</b>, thereby embedding the lashes <b>12</b> thereagainst into the adhesive <b>18</b> on the strip <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, after several segments <b>22</b> have been applied to the natural lash <b>12</b>, a technician may return and apply pressure to previously applied bands <b>16</b> of segments <b>22</b>. This may be particularly effective at locations where adjacent bands <b>16</b> may abut one another, corresponding to adjacent segments <b>22</b>. In one alternative embodiment, a band <b>16</b> may extend laterally slightly beyond the filaments <b>14</b> held thereon. This provides a slight overlap between adjacent bands <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, following installation of a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention, a technician may brush the individual filaments <b>14</b> by drawing a tweezer <b>70</b> laterally over the filaments <b>14</b> in order to separate them. This tends to &#x201c;even up&#x201d; the spacing between individual fibers <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, following application of a system <b>10</b>, an additional segment <b>22</b> or additional segments <b>22</b> may be applied to the upper surface of the original system <b>10</b> or extension system <b>10</b> thereby doubling the number of filaments <b>14</b>. In this regard, one reason why density may be controlled is to render extensions <b>10</b> more natural in appearance.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Most lashes <b>12</b> are enhanced, made to appear thicker, longer, and darker than natural lashes <b>12</b>. These properties are effected by the length, diameter, color, density, and so forth of the fibers <b>14</b> in each segment <b>22</b>. By the same token, in order to not overwhelm the appearance of the eyes, the density of extensions <b>10</b> may be substantially reduced. This is particularly so for the density of individual segments <b>22</b> in a &#x201c;dual&#x201d; application. Segments <b>22</b> are applied in such a dual configuration as under segments <b>22</b><i>a </i>and over segments <b>22</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, individual segments <b>22</b> require compression or pressure to be applied in order to embed the natural lashes <b>12</b> within the adhesive <b>18</b> of a band <b>16</b> of a segment <b>22</b>. When dual extensions <b>10</b> are applied as segments <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>capturing a natural lash <b>12</b> therebetween, densities may be selected to be particularly sparse. This tends to relieve an otherwise overwhelming opacity of the extensions <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a subject is in preparation for applying extension segments <b>22</b> to natural eyelashes <b>12</b>. The subject occupies a restful, recumbent position with the head and neck fully supported at the proper orientation. The lashes <b>12</b> of the subject are thereby more readily and conveniently accessible.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, in an unmasked or non-masked application, conventional chemical substances used require exceeding care and training. Here, adhesives need not be the highly adherent, rapidly setting cyanoacrylates typical of individually applied fibers <b>14</b> of conventional extensions. Adhesives may be pre applied to a segment <b>22</b>. They may be thixotropic or at least much more stable and resistant to dripping. The danger to eyes is minimized. Likewise, because the adhesive is cohesive with itself, injury to eyes and eyelids is not problematic in a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention. In the illustration, a segment <b>22</b> is being applied to a natural lash <b>12</b> that is sufficiently sparse to be almost invisible.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, in one currently contemplated embodiment of a system <b>10</b> and method <b>40</b> in accordance with the invention, a mask <b>80</b> effectively tapes down against the lower eyelid the lower lash. The upper lash <b>12</b> is exposed and easily accessible. In this arrangement, a technician may accidentally touch the band <b>16</b> against the mask <b>80</b>, without danger of contaminating or neutralizing the adhesive <b>18</b>, nor transferring facial oils on any part of the segment <b>22</b>. In this illustration, the segment <b>22</b> is being brought up into contact with the underside of the natural lash <b>12</b>. It is unnecessary, partially due to the masking <b>80</b>, to have the wearer (subject) open the eyelid. The technician can properly orient the lashes <b>12</b> for easy access and contact by the band <b>16</b> and adhesive <b>18</b> of the segment <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> through <b>24</b></figref>, additional masking <b>80</b> may be applied. In the illustrated embodiment, the additional masking <b>80</b> on the upper eyelid <b>29</b> and over the eyebrow provides the ability of a technician to rest fingers or implements without contacting facial oils. Moreover, the segment <b>22</b> (in the nibs <b>74</b> of the tweezers <b>70</b>) is held in the nibs <b>74</b> by the fibers <b>14</b> or filaments <b>14</b> thereof with the adhesive <b>18</b> upward facing on the band <b>16</b>. In this way, the adhesive <b>18</b> may make immediate adhesion with the natural lash <b>12</b> upon contact.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Typically, the adhesive <b>18</b> is sufficiently soft that the pressure of contacting the adhesive <b>18</b> and band <b>16</b> against the underside of the natural lash <b>12</b> will be enough to temporarily support the weight of the segment <b>22</b> against the lash <b>12</b>. Nevertheless, a technician may remove the segment <b>22</b> in order to more perfectly locate it, without damage. Ultimately, the segment <b>22</b> is placed in contact at a proper location and orientation against the underside of the lash <b>12</b>. Then the nibs <b>74</b> may release the segment <b>22</b> and move into position to pressure the lashes <b>12</b> into the adhesive <b>18</b>. This extrusion effects a complete and durable securement of the segment <b>22</b> to the lash <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, clamping or pressure application deforms the adhesive <b>18</b>. The segment <b>22</b> is clamped such that the adhesive <b>18</b> is put under pressure between the band <b>16</b> below the adhesive <b>18</b>, and the natural lash <b>12</b> under the nibs <b>74</b> thereabove. One will note that the masking <b>80</b>, below the natural lash <b>12</b>, as well as the masking <b>80</b> on and above the upper eyelid <b>29</b> provide stabilization and relaxation. The subject need not exert effort or muscular stress to maintain the eyes closed in the desired position. Meanwhile, instruments and fingers are protected against contamination by facial oils that might otherwise interfere with proper adhesion.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, following application of the extensions <b>10</b> on each eye, a brush <b>90</b> may be used to separate, orient, and otherwise urge a uniform spacing between the filaments <b>14</b>. Ultimately, both the lower mask <b>82</b> and the upper or stabilizing mask <b>84</b> may be removed.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, the masks <b>80</b> being removed leave the applied extension <b>10</b> properly secured and having the desired appearance. One will note that the light reflection from the lash <b>12</b> and the filaments <b>14</b> of the extension <b>10</b> obscure the presence of the band <b>16</b> below the natural lash <b>12</b>. Of course, the natural lash <b>12</b> is indistinguishable in this image from the extensions <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In certain embodiments, various adhesives may be used for various purposes and with various component pieces. Adhesives may be described generally in two categories, liquid adhesives and tape adhesives. Any suitable liquid adhesive <b>19</b> may be used. In one embodiment, a first adhesive, or liquid adhesive <b>19</b>, may be used on natural eyelashes. Such a liquid adhesive <b>19</b> may be comprised of water, styrene/acrylates/ammonium methacrylate copolymer, an adhesion promoter, acrylate copolymer, and/or carbon black. The styrene/acrylates/ammonium methacrylate copolymer may be described as a film-forming agent that is water-resistant. In one embodiment, a liquid adhesive may be comprised of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, ammonia (anhydrous), and carbon black. Any suitable tape adhesive may be used, including rheological and non-rheological materials. A tape adhesive may be described as a medical grade adhesive, pressure-sensitive adhesive, double-sided tape with acrylic on both sides. It may be described as a non-Newtonian adhesive compound, or a rheological material. It may include a highly conformable polyethylene carrier for maximum user comfort, and easily die cuttable into various shapes and sizes. The use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive may be helpful because it can allow for some repositioning of an artificial eyelash, or segment, before pressure is applied activating the adhesive and before the artificial eyelash is adhered to the natural eyelash.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-C</figref>, an embodiment of one or more artificial lash segments designed for use as top <b>104</b>, right artificial lashes is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref> illustrates a single-piece, pre-cut artificial lash segment <b>100</b> having an outer edge <b>106</b> and an inner edge <b>108</b>.
