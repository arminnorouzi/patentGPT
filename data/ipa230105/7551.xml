DC can support two or more base stations in simultaneously providing data transmission services for one terminal. These base stations include one master base station and one or more secondary base stations. The master base station may establish a radio resource control (RRC) connection to the terminal, and may transmit an RRC message to the terminal. The master base station further establishes a control plane connection to a core network. Some RRC messages may be transmitted between the secondary base station and the terminal, where the some RRC messages include measurement configuration information used to measure signal quality of a cell, a measurement report, or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">After establishing the RRC connection to the master base station, the terminal may perform conditional primary secondary cell (PSCell) addition (conditional PSCell addition, CPA), to establish a connection to the secondary base station. After establishing the connections to both the master base station and the secondary base station, the terminal may further perform conditional PSCell change (CPC), to change a PSCell connected to the terminal. However, when a terminal having a conditional PSCell addition/change (CPAC) configuration performs master base station handover, for example, the terminal is handed over from a current master base station to a target master base station with better signal quality, air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the target master base station and the terminal are high.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a communication method and apparatus, so that after a terminal performs master base station handover, air interface overheads for performing CPAC by a target master base station and the terminal can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the foregoing objective, the following technical solutions are used in embodiments of this application.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a communication method. The method includes: A terminal receives a first message from a first master node, where the first message includes an identifier of a first candidate PSCell or an identifier of configuration information of the first candidate PSCell, where the first candidate PSCell is included in both a first PSCell list and a second PSCell list; or the first message includes delta configuration information of a candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, where the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell includes an addition/change condition and a configuration of the first candidate PSCell, the first PSCell list includes one or more candidate PSCells configured by the first master node for the terminal, and the second PSCell list includes one or more candidate PSCells configured by a second master node for the terminal. The terminal adds a target PSCell or changes from an original PSCell to the target PSCell based on the first message and first configuration information, where the first configuration information includes an addition/change condition and a configuration of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, the target PSCell is a PSCell in the second PSCell list, and the original PSCell is a PSCell to which the terminal is connected before the terminal is handed over from the first master node to the second master node.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the method in the first aspect, the terminal may receive the first message from the first master node, and add the target PSCell or change from the original PSCell to the target PSCell based on the first message and the first configuration information. A size of the identifier or the information included in the first message is less than a size of configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list. Therefore, air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation, the delta configuration information includes different configuration information in configuration information of a same candidate PSCell configured by the second master node and the first master node for the terminal, and/or configuration information of each candidate PSCell other than the first candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, and/or an identifier of configuration information of a candidate PSCell that is in the first PSCell list and that the second master node determines to release. Based on the foregoing method, the first message may not include full configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, but includes the delta configuration information. Therefore, air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With reference to the first aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, that the terminal adds a target PSCell or changes from an original PSCell to the target PSCell based on the first message and first configuration information includes: The terminal determines second configuration information based on the first message and the first configuration information, where the second configuration information includes an addition/change condition and a configuration of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list; and the terminal adds a PSCell that meets the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list as the target PSCell or changes from the original PSCell to the target PSCell based on the second configuration information. Based on the foregoing method, the terminal may restore the second configuration information based on the first message and the first configuration information, and add the PSCell that meets the addition condition of the candidate PSCell, or change from the original PSCell to the PSCell that meets the change condition of the candidate PSCell, based on the second configuration information. In this way, the first master node may not need to send the second configuration information to the terminal, thereby reducing air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With reference to the first aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the first message includes delta configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list. That the terminal determines second configuration information based on the first message and the first configuration information includes: The terminal determines the second configuration information based on the delta configuration information and the first configuration information. Based on the foregoing method, the terminal may restore the second configuration information based on the delta configuration information and the first configuration information. In this way, the first master node may not need to send the second configuration information to the terminal, thereby reducing air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to the first aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the first message includes the identifier of the first candidate PSCell or the identifier of the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell. That the terminal determines second configuration information based on the first message and the first configuration information includes: The terminal determines the first configuration information corresponding to the identifier of the first candidate PSCell or the identifier of the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell as the second configuration information. Based on the foregoing method, when the second PSCell list is included in the first PSCell list, or the second PSCell list is the same as the first PSCell list, the terminal may determine the first configuration information corresponding to the identifier of the first candidate PSCell or the identifier of the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell as the second configuration information. In this way, the first master node may not need to send the second configuration information to the terminal, thereby reducing air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to the first aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the first configuration information further includes configuration information of the original PSCell, and the delta configuration information includes configuration information that is of any candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list and that is different from the configuration information of the original PSCell. Based on the foregoing method, the first message may not include full configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, but includes the delta configuration information. Therefore, air interface overheads for performing CPAC by the second master node and the terminal can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a communication method. The method includes: A first master node sends a first message to a second master node, where the first message is used to indicate first configuration information of a candidate PSCell in a first PSCell list, the first configuration information includes an addition/change condition and a configuration of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, the first PSCell list includes one or more candidate PSCells configured by the first master node for a terminal, and the second master node is a target master node to which the terminal is handed over. The first master node receives a second message from the second master node, where the second message is obtained based on the first message, and the second message includes an identifier of a first candidate PSCell or an identifier of configuration information of the first candidate PSCell, where the first candidate PSCell is included in both the first PSCell list and a second PSCell list; or the second message includes delta configuration information of a candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, where the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell includes an addition/change condition and a configuration of the first candidate PSCell, and the second PSCell list includes one or more candidate PSCells configured by the second master node for the terminal. The first master node sends a third message to the terminal based on the second message, where the third message includes the identifier of the first candidate PSCell, or the identifier of the configuration information of the first candidate PSCell, or the delta configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the method in the second aspect, the first master node may send, to the second master node, the first message used to indicate the first configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, and receive the second message from the second master node. A size of the identifier or the information included in the second message is less than a size of configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list. Therefore, communication overheads of the first master node and the second master node can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With reference to the second aspect, in a possible implementation, the delta configuration information includes different configuration information in configuration information of a same candidate PSCell configured by the second master node and the first master node for the terminal, and/or configuration information of each candidate PSCell other than the first candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, and/or an identifier of configuration information of a candidate PSCell that is in the first PSCell list and that the second master node determines to release. Based on the foregoing method, the second message may not include full configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, but includes the delta configuration information. Therefore, communication overheads of the first master node and the second master node can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference to the second aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the method further includes: The first master node sends a first release request message to a node to which each candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs, where the first release request message is used to request to release each candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list. Based on the foregoing method, after determining that the terminal is to be handed over to the second master node, the first master node may indicate a node to which each candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs to release the candidate PSCell configured by the first master node for the terminal. In this way, the node to which each candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs may configure the released candidate PSCell for another terminal, thereby saving communication resources.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the second aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, when the first PSCell list includes the first candidate PSCell, the first release request message is further used to indicate a node to which the first candidate PSCell belongs to retain a context with the terminal. Based on the foregoing method, when the second master node configures the first candidate PSCell as a candidate PSCell for the terminal, the first candidate secondary node does not need to regenerate the context with the terminal. Subsequently, if the first candidate PSCell is determined as the target PSCell, the first candidate secondary node may communicate with the terminal by using the retained context.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to the second aspect and the foregoing possible implementations, in a possible implementation, the first message includes configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list; the first message includes an identifier of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list; or the first message includes an identifier of a secondary cell group to which the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs. Based on the foregoing method, the first master node may indicate the first configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list by using the configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, or the identifier of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, or the identifier of the secondary cell group to which the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs. This improves diversity of indicating, by the first master node, the first configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to the second aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the first message further includes an identifier of an original PSCell, and the original PSCell is a PSCell to which the terminal is connected before the terminal is handed over from the first master node to the second master node. Based on the foregoing method, the first master node may further indicate the original PSCell to the second master node, so that the second master node determines to add the original PSCell or add another PSCell for the terminal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to the second aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the delta configuration information includes configuration information that is of any candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list and that is different from configuration information of the original PSCell. Based on the foregoing method, the second message may not include full configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list, but includes the delta configuration information. Therefore, communication overheads of the first master node and the second master node can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a third aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a communication method.

Based on the foregoing method, the second master node may determine the first configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list based on the configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list, so that the second master node determines the configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list based on the first configuration information of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list; or the second master node may determine the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list by using the identifier of the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list or the identifier of the secondary cell group to which the candidate PSCell in the first PSCell list belongs, so that the second master node determines the candidate PSCell in the second PSCell list based on the identifier.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to the third aspect and the foregoing possible implementation, in a possible implementation, the first message further includes an identifier of an original PSCell, and the original PSCell is a PSCell to which the terminal is connected before the terminal is handed over from the first master node to the second master node.

For example, the terminal <b>103</b> may be handed over from the network device <b>101</b> to the network device <b>105</b>. However, after the terminal <b>103</b> performs MN handover, the current MN releases one or more candidate PSCells configured for the terminal <b>103</b>. After establishing an RRC connection to the terminal <b>103</b>, the target MN may reconfigure one or more candidate PSCells for the terminal <b>103</b>, and send, to the terminal <b>103</b>, configuration information of the one or more candidate PSCells configured by the target MN for the terminal to perform CPAC by the terminal, where the configuration information of the one or more candidate PSCells configured by the target MN for the terminal includes a configuration and an addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">However, the configuration and the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell generally include much information. For example, the configuration of the candidate PSCell includes: an identifier of the configuration of the candidate PSCell, and/or a random access resource allocated by the candidate PSCell to the terminal, and/or a cell radio network temporary identifier (C-RNIT), and/or a global cell identifier (CGI) of the candidate PSCell, and/or a physical cell identifier (PCI) of the candidate PSCell, and/or frequency information corresponding to the candidate PSCell. The frequency information corresponding to the candidate PSCell may include one or more of the following: an absolute frequency (for example, absoluteFrequencySSB) of a synchronization signal block, an absolute frequency location (for example, absoluteFrequencyPointA) of a reference resource module (common RB0), a frequency bandwidth list (for example, frequencyBandList), a subcarrier spacing (SCS) specific carrier list (for example, scs-SpecificCarrierList), and the like. The configuration of the candidate PSCell further includes resource information corresponding to the candidate PSCell. The resource information corresponding to the candidate PSCell includes one or more of the following: a bearer configuration parameter (radioBearerConfig), a cell group configuration (cellGroupConfig) parameter, a physical (PHY) layer configuration parameter, a media access control (MAC) layer configuration parameter, a radio link control (RLC) layer configuration parameter, a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer configuration parameter, a service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer configuration parameter, or an RRC layer configuration parameter. The configuration of the candidate PSCell may also be referred to as a CPAC configuration of the candidate PSCell, CPAC configuration information of the candidate PSCell, or the like. This is not limited.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell is used by the terminal to determine whether to add the candidate PSCell, or used by the terminal to determine whether to change from the original PSCell to the candidate PSCell. For example, if the terminal detects that the candidate PSCell meets the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell, the terminal determines to add the candidate PSCell, or changes from the original PSCell to the candidate PSCell. If the terminal detects that the candidate PSCell does not meet the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell, the terminal determines not to add the candidate PSCell, or not to change from the original PSCell to the candidate PSCell.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Optionally, the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell includes an execution event type of the addition/change condition of the candidate PSCell, and the execution event type may also be referred to as a measurement event, a reporting event, or the like. The terminal may measure signal quality of the candidate PSCell, or measure signal quality of the candidate PSCell and signal quality of a neighboring cell of the candidate PSCell, and determine, based on a measurement result and the execution event type, whether to add the candidate PSCell, or determine whether to change from the original PSCell to the candidate PSCell.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a possible implementation, the execution event type includes one or more events. For example, the execution event type may include one or more of the following events: an event A3, an event A4, an event A5, an event B1, or an event B2. The event A3 indicates that signal quality of a neighboring cell is greater than or equal to signal quality of a special cell (SpCell) by a specific offset. The event A4 indicates that signal quality of a neighboring cell is greater than or equal to a specific threshold. The event A5 indicates that signal quality of an SpCell is less than or equal to a threshold 1 and signal quality of a neighboring cell is greater than or equal to a threshold 2. The event B1 indicates that signal quality of an inter-radio access technology (inter-RAT) neighboring cell is greater than or equal to a specific threshold. The event B2 indicates that signal quality of a PCell is less than or equal to a threshold 3 and signal quality of an inter-RAT neighboring cell is greater than or equal to a threshold 4. The foregoing event is merely an example of the event in the execution event type. The execution event type may further include another event. This is not limited. The execution event type further includes a threshold corresponding to the event in the execution event type. The execution event type further includes a time length (timeToTrigger) meeting a trigger condition of the event in the execution event type, a hysteresis value for entering/exiting the event in the execution event type, and/or the like. The event in the execution event type may correspond to one or more thresholds. For example, the event A5 corresponds to two thresholds. A same event in the execution event type may correspond to different measurement metrics. For example, the event A3 may correspond to A3 reference signal received power (RSRP) and A3 reference signal received quality (RSRQ).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In conclusion, a configuration and an addition/change condition of one or more candidate PSCells usually have a large payload size, and air interface overheads for receiving the configuration and the addition/change condition of the one or more candidate PSCells by the terminal are high.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">To resolve a problem of high air interface overheads for performing CPAC by a target MN and a terminal due to MN handover of the terminal, embodiments of this application provide a communication method. A current MN may indicate, to a target MN, configuration information of a candidate PSCell configured by the current MN for a terminal. After the target MN receives the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the current MN for the terminal, where a candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal may include all or some candidate PSCells configured by the current MN for the terminal, the target MN may send, to the terminal based on the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the current MN for the terminal, an identifier of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or an identifier of configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or delta configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal. The terminal receives the identifier of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or the identifier of the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or the delta configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, to obtain, based on the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the current MN for the terminal, the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal. A size of the identifier of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or the identifier of the configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal, or the delta configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal is less than a size of full configuration information of the candidate PSCell configured by the target MN for the terminal delta configuration.
