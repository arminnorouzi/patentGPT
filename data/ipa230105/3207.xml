More precisely, the present invention concerns a redundant pumping system comprising at least one primary roots pump and two pumping sub-systems arranged in parallel. The present invention relates as well to a pumping method by means of this pumping system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vacuum pumping systems are indispensable devices in many industrial fields such as for instance in the food and pharmaceutical industries in freeze drying, distillation, packaging and crystallization processes. and in particular also in the semiconductor industry.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to reach manufacturing processes of always better quality in the semiconductor industry, it is essential that the manufacturing processes be performed under well-controlled atmospheres. With vacuum pumps, it is possible to evacuate process chambers and to provide the clean, low-pressure environment required for many processes as well as to remove unused process gas and by-products. The manufacturing process of semiconductor devices often involves the sequential deposition and patterning of multiple layers. Many of these process steps require vacuum conditions in the process chamber to prevent interference and contamination by gas molecules present in air. Several process steps in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices are usually carried out in process chamber, for instance a vacuum oven, in which wafers are processed for example by chemical vapor deposition or chemical vapor etching. All these processes require a low background pressure in order to avoid contamination mainly by water vapor as well the ability to supply inside the process chamber a process gas. This process gas must be supplied into the process chamber with a precise flow rate, which is normally high. Therefore, pumping systems for the evacuation and maintaining of a predetermined pressure of process gases in semiconductor process chambers need to be able to evacuate the process chamber to a low end-pressure, usually at least 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>mbar, and to handle a high flow rate, in the range of several ten thousands of liter per minute. For this purpose, a roots pump, also called vacuum booster, and a dry backing pump are typically combined. The roots pump allows for the handling of the high flow rate and the backing pump, thanks to its high compression ratio, allows for reaching a sufficiently low end-pressure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Nowadays, in the semiconductor industry, hundreds or even thousands of wafers are processed at the same time in a single process chamber. A failure of the pumping system during the manufacturing process can therefore result in wafers damages and consequently in a very significant financial loss. In order to prevent a failure of the pumping system from having such consequences, it is known and usual to provide for a redundant pumping system. The purpose of a redundant system is to ensure that, when the pump maintaining the process conditions in the process chamber fails, a second pump can take over to prevent too important changes in the process conditions and eventually wafers damages.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several redundant pumping systems, in particular in the field of semiconductor industry, are known from the prior art. In a first known redundant pumping system, schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two pumping sub-systems are arranged in parallel. Each of the two sub-systems comprise a roots pump and a positive displacement pump, as backing pump for the booster pump. For each pumping sub-system, a valve is positioned on the duct connecting the roots pumps and the process chamber. The pumping sub-systems are configured such that each of the sub-system can evacuate alone the process chamber at the desired flow rate. This implies that during normal operation, the two sub-systems are always running but only one valve is open. If the pumping sub-system whose valve is open fails, this valve is closed and the valve of the other pumping sub-system is opened in order to allow the second sub-system to take over.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This kind of redundant systems however has several drawbacks. When a failure happens, severe pressure hunting and contamination of the process chamber are observed. This usually results in heavy damages of the wafers present in the process chamber and in important financial losses.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A second known redundant pumping system used in the semiconductor industry, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, comprises a roots pump connected to the process chamber and two positive displacement pumps arranged in parallel. These two positive displacement pumps are separated from the roots pump by two valves. During normal operation, only one of the both valves is open and only one of the positive displacement pumps acts as backing pump for the roots pump. If this backing pumps fails, the corresponding valve closes and the other valve opens, allowing the second positive displacement pump to act as backing pump for the roots pump.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This second known redundant pumping system has slightly better performances then the above-mentioned first known redundant pumping system in terms of contaminations when a positive displacement pump fails. However, very severe damages of the wafers in the process chamber happen if the roots pump of the system fails.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore a goal of the present invention to propose a novel redundant pumping system and a corresponding pumping method, thanks to which the pressure conditions in a process chamber can be maintained constant even if one of the pumps of the system fails. Thus, the object of the present invention is to propose a novel redundant pumping system and a corresponding pumping method, thanks to which the above-described drawbacks of the known systems are completely overcome or at least greatly diminished.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, these objects are achieved in particular through the elements of the two independent claims. Further advantageous embodiments follow moreover from the dependent claims and the description.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the objects of the present invention are achieved in a first aspect by a redundant vacuum pumping system, comprising a primary roots pump having a gas suction inlet connectable to a process chamber and a gas discharge outlet connected to a first pumping sub-system and a second pumping sub-system, wherein the first pumping sub-system and the second pumping sub-system are arranged to pump in parallel the gas evacuated by the primary roots pump, the first pumping sub-system comprising a first secondary roots pump, a first positive displacement pump and a first valve positioned between the gas discharge outlet of the primary roots pump and the gas suction inlet of the first secondary roots pump, and the second pumping sub-system comprising a second secondary roots pump, a second positive displacement pump and a second valve positioned between the gas discharge outlet of the primary roots pump and the gas suction inlet of the second secondary roots pump, wherein the first pumping sub-system and the second pumping sub-system are configured to pump at a same flow rate, and wherein the primary roots pump is configured to be able to pump at a flow rate F equal to the pumping flow rate of the primary pumping sub-system plus the pumping flow rate of the secondary pumping sub-system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thanks to such a redundant vacuum pumping system, it is possible to ensure that the pressure level in a process chamber can be maintained constant even in the case of failure of one the pumps of the system. It is in particular possible to avoid pressure hunting or contamination of the process chamber in case of failure. Since the primary roots pump is configured to be drivable at the pumping flow rate equal to the total flow rate of the two pumping sub-systems, the primary roots pump can, in case of failure of one of the sub-system, compress the gases evacuated from the process chamber enough that the pumping conditions for the sub-system still running are not changed. In case of failure of the primary roots pump, the gas flow can be pumped by the sub-systems alone. Thanks to the redundant pumping system according to the present invention it is therefore possible to overcome the drawbacks of the systems known from the prior art.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the first positive displacement pump and/or the second positive displacement pump are selected among the group consisting of a dry screw pump, a dry claw pump, a scroll pump, and a diaphragm pump.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the redundant vacuum pumping system comprises comprising a bypass duct with a third valve arranged in parallel to the primary roots pump. Thanks to the bypass duct and the third valve, it is possible to evacuate the flow of gas to be evacuated from the process chamber even if the primary roots pump becomes a pumping obstacle due to failure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first positive displacement pump and the second positive displacement pump are connected to waste gas treatment installations, advantageously scrubbers. With this, is possible to recycle process gases and process by-products evacuated from the process chamber.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pumping flow rate of the primary roots pumps is from 5&#x2032;000 l/min to 100&#x2032;000 l/min, advantageously between 10&#x2032;000 l/min and 70&#x2032;000 l/min, preferably between 25&#x2032;000 l/min and 55&#x2032;000 l/min. With this, the redundant vacuum pumping system of the present invention can be implemented in existing manufacturing lines, especially in the semiconductor industry.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the redundant vacuum pumping system comprises failure detecting means for detecting a failure of any of the primary roots pump, of the first secondary roots pump, of the second secondary roots pump, of the first positive displacement pump or of the second positive displacement pump. Thanks to these failure detection means, it is possible to detect rapidly any failure and to switch in consequence a valve, if required.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the failure detecting means are configured to be able to actuate the first valve, the second valve, and/or the third valve in case of a detected failure. This is particularly advantageous since in case of a detected failure the correct valve can be actuated automatically by the failure detecting means.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a second aspect, the objects of the present invention are achieved by a pumping method by means of a redundant vacuum pumping system according to the present invention, wherein the primary roots pump is driven all the time at a nominal flow rate equal to the sum of the flow rate of the first pumping sub-system and of the flow rate of the second pumping sub-system. With this pumping method, it is ensured that even in case of failure of any of the pumps of the redundant vacuum pumping system, the pressure level in the process chamber can be maintained constant and wafer damages avoided.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a first preferred embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the pumping system comprises a bypass duct with a third valve and wherein the third valve is switched to its open position when a failure of the primary roots pump is detected by the failure detecting means. Thanks to this, the flow of gas that needs to be evacuated from the process chamber can be evacuated through the bypass duct in case of failure of the primary roots pump of the redundant vacuum pumping system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another preferred embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the failure detecting means close the first valve when a failure of the first secondary roots pump or of the first positive displacement pump is detected. With this, it is possible to close automatically the first vale in case of failure of any of the pumps of the first pumping sub-system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet another preferred embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, the failure detecting means close the second valve when a failure of the second secondary roots pump or of the second positive displacement pump is detected. With this, it is possible to close automatically the second vale in case of failure of any of the pumps of the second pumping sub-system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The specific embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the attached Figures that show:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a first redundant pumping system known from the prior art;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a second redundant pumping system known from the prior art; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a preferred embodiment of a redundant pumping system according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a first redundant pumping system <b>100</b> known from the prior art. The known redundant pumping system <b>100</b> comprises two pumping sub-systems <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> arranged in parallel for pumping the process chamber <b>101</b>. As mentioned above, redundant pumping systems are provided in situation in which it must absolutely be ensured that the pressure level in the chamber <b>101</b> is maintained at all time during certain manufacturing processes, especially in the semiconductor industry.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pumping system <b>100</b> must be configured not only to be able to reach a predetermined end-pressure but to handle a large flow of gases F. This is in particular important where chemical vapor etching processes or chemical vapor deposition are involved. These processes require that a constant flow of process gases is fed into the chamber <b>101</b>, these gases and the residues of the processes having to be pumped away by the pumping system <b>100</b>. In order to reach a sufficiently low end-pressure and to be able to pump a large flow of gases, the known pumping systems typically used in the semiconductor industry employ a combination of a positive displacement pump, advantageously a dry screw pump, and a roots pump, known also as booster pump. Thanks to the dry screw pump with its high compression ratio, a low end-pressure can be reached, while with the roots pump a very large flow of gases can efficiently be handled.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the two pumping sub-systems <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> comprise therefore a roots pump <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and a dry screw pump <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>.

First, it suffers from severe pressure hunting when the system must switch from sub-system <b>110</b> to sub-system <b>120</b>. This pressure hunting leads to contamination in the process chamber <b>101</b> which are unacceptable in many applications. Furthermore, during a certain amount of time after the detection of the failure of sub-system <b>110</b>, the pressure will raise in the process chamber <b>101</b> eventually leading to wafer damaging kept in the chamber <b>101</b>. Finally, since during normal operation pumps <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> of sub-system <b>120</b> are running all the time, the pressure between the inlet of roots pump <b>121</b> and valve <b>123</b> is kept at the end-pressure of sub-system <b>120</b>. This implies that, when valve <b>123</b> is suddenly opened in reaction to a failure detection of sub-system <b>110</b>, the pressure in the process chamber will be affected. Such pressure changes make impossible to guarantee high-quality process conditions in the process chamber.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates a second redundant pumping system <b>200</b> known from the prior art. The system <b>200</b> differs from system <b>100</b> in that the two pumping sub-systems <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> comprise each only a positive displacement pump <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, such as a dry screw pump. In order to handle an important flow of gas F, the system <b>200</b> comprises a roots pump <b>202</b>, which is &#x201c;mutual&#x201d; to both sub-systems <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>. During normal operation, valve <b>213</b> is open and valve <b>223</b> is closed. The entire flow of gas F is therefore pumped solely by the roots pump <b>202</b> and the dry screw pump <b>212</b>. In case of failure of the dry screw pump <b>212</b>, the valve <b>213</b> is closed and the valve <b>223</b> is opened such that the flow of gas F can be evacuated by the combination of the roots pump <b>202</b> and the dry screw pump <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the redundant system <b>200</b>, in comparison to the redundant system <b>100</b>, has improved performances in terms of being able to maintain a constant pressure in the process chamber <b>201</b> in case of failure of the dry screw pump <b>212</b>, it has the major drawback that a failure of the roots pump <b>202</b> results in an unacceptable and constant raise of pressure in the process chamber <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates a redundant pumping system <b>300</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The pumping system <b>300</b> comprises a primary roots pump <b>302</b>, connectable to a process chamber <b>301</b>, and two pumping sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, each of them comprising a secondary roots pump <b>311</b>, respectively <b>321</b>, and a positive displacement pump <b>312</b>, respectively <b>322</b>, such as dry screw pumps. During normal operation, the valve <b>313</b> and the valve <b>323</b> are always open, half of the gas flow F evacuated from the process chamber <b>301</b> being pumped by the sub-system <b>310</b>, and the other half being pumped by the sub-system <b>320</b>. Essential for the proper implementation of this invention is that the primary roots pump <b>302</b> is drivable at the same pumping speed as the total pumping speed of the sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. In other terms, during normal operation, the primary roots pump <b>302</b> is not participating in the pumping effort and the pressure P1 at its inlet <b>302</b><i>a </i>is the same as the pressure P2 at its outlet <b>302</b><i>b</i>, i.e. the compression ratio of the primary roots pump <b>302</b> in normal operation is equal to 1. This can be achieved by having a primary roots pump whose pumping speed can be adapted or by having a primary roots pump whose maximal pumping speed is equal to the pumping speed of the sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The idea beyond the present invention is better explained with a concrete implementation example. For this example, let us assume that the flow rate of gas F required to be evacuated from the process chamber is equal to 20&#x2032;000 l/min. As mentioned above, the inventive redundant pumping system <b>300</b> is configured such that the primary roots pump <b>302</b> can be driven with a pumping speed equal to F and such that each sub-system <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> has a pumping speed equal to F/2, in this example equal to 10&#x2032;000 l/min. Since the entering and existing flow rates of the primary roots pump <b>302</b> are equal, the compression ratio of the primary roots pump <b>302</b> during normal operation K<sub>normal </sub>is equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This means that during normal operation, the performances of the pumping system <b>300</b> in terms of pumping speed and end-pressure are the same as if the primary roots pump <b>302</b> would not be present, would be switched off or would fail (as long as it does not represent an obstacle to the evacuation). During normal operation, the end pressure of the complete system <b>300</b> is given by the end pressure of each of the sub-systems <b>310</b>, respectively <b>320</b>, divided by K<sub>0</sub>, the compression ratio at zero flow rate and at its outlet pressure. Typically, sub-systems <b>310</b>, respectively, <b>320</b>, have an end-pressure of the order of 0.1 mbar. Primary roots pumps have in this pressure range a compression ratio K<sub>0 </sub>of the order of 50. The end pressure of the whole system <b>300</b> is consequently of the order of 2*10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>mbar.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If now the sub-system <b>320</b> would fail, the valve <b>323</b> will be closed and the whole flow F would need to be accommodated by the combination of the primary roots pump <b>302</b> and the sub-system <b>310</b>. Since the flow rate of the sub-system <b>310</b> is fixed and equal to F/2, the primary roots pump <b>302</b> must compress the gas evacuated from the process chamber with a factor 2. This happens automatically as soon as the flow rate beyond the primary roots pumps <b>302</b> drops from F down to F/2 due to the failure of the sub-system <b>320</b>. Naturally, the pressure P3 at the inlet of the sub-system <b>311</b><i>a </i>becomes two times higher than during normal operation, but since the primary roots pump <b>302</b> now participates in the pumping effort by compressing the gas evacuated from the processing chamber <b>301</b> by a factor 2, the end-pressure as well as the pumping speed are not affected by the failure of sub-system <b>320</b> and the pressure in the process chamber can be maintained constant even in that case.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, as mentioned above, in case of failure of the primary roots pump <b>302</b>, the performances of the system <b>300</b> are not affected at all as long as the two sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are running normally. As it is extremely improbable that the primary roots pump <b>302</b> and one of the sub-systems <b>310</b> or <b>320</b> would fail at the same time, the redundant pumping system <b>300</b> according to the present invention allows for circumventing the drawbacks of the redundant systems known from the prior art.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, it is possible to provide in addition for a bypass duct <b>303</b> with a valve <b>304</b> in the pumping system <b>300</b>. With the additional bypass duct <b>303</b> it is possible to evacuate the process chamber <b>301</b> with the two sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> and to maintain a constant pressure in the chamber <b>301</b> even if the primary roots pump <b>302</b> becomes a pumping resistance du to failure. In such a case, the flow F is deviated through the bypass duct <b>304</b> and directed in the two sub-systems <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, it is advantageous to connect the gas discharge outlet of both positive displacement pumps <b>312</b> and <b>322</b> to at least one waste gas treatment installation, advantageously scrubbers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finally, it should be pointed out that the foregoing has outlined one pertinent non-limiting embodiment. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that modifications to the disclosed non-limiting embodiment can be effected without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. As such, the described non-limiting embodiment ought to be considered merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications.
