A user of a vehicle, such as an automobile, motorcycle, a bus, a recreational vehicle (RV), a semi-trailer truck, a tractor or other type of farm equipment, a train, a plane, a drone, a helicopter, a personal transport link vehicle, or the like, may connect a primary device (e.g., mobile phone) to the vehicle's head unit to project (or, in other words, serve) a graphical user interface to the head unit. The head unit may then present the graphical user interface via a display coupled to the head unit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many cases, a primary device may receive data for one or more applications of the primary device and may transmit the data to a vehicle head unit. For example, a vehicle operator may receive one or more messages while traveling in vehicles and may want to display the messages on a display of the vehicle head unit. In some examples, the primary device may transmit data to a proprietary cloud, and the proprietary cloud may transmit the data to the head unit. However, such implementation requires the data to be converted into a proprietary format, which may render the data difficult to use once removed from the proprietary cloud.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, techniques of this disclosure are directed to providing a companion application for establishing a peer to peer communication channel to send arbitrary data between a primary device and a head unit. According to the disclosed techniques, the companion application may process and transmit data between the primary device and the head unit in data segments via a wireless network connection operating in accordance with a wireless networking protocol, such as Bluetooth&#xae; communication protocol or Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy communication protocol. The companion application may receive an indication of data to be transferred between the primary device and the vehicle head unit and determine an amount of data to be transferred based on the indication of the data. The companion application may further determine whether the amount of data satisfies a maximum packet size for the wireless networking protocol. Responsive to determining that the amount of data does not satisfy the maximum packet size, the companion application may segment the data into a plurality of packets and transmit the data in the plurality of packets using the wireless network connection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this respect, various aspects of the techniques may provide a peer to peer communication channel that enables a primary device and a head unit to transmit data directly with each other, thereby eliminating the need for a central server. The peer to peer communication channel provides a decentralized environment that minimizes single point of failure and thereby potentially promote vehicle network communication. Furthermore, by segmenting data into data segments and transmitting data in a plurality of packets, the disclosed techniques enhance the overall reliability and fault-tolerance of data communication. By restart transmitting only undelivered packets, various aspects of the techniques may enable the primary device and the head unit to operate more efficiently (e.g., in terms of processor cycles expended, memory consumed, memory bus bandwidth utilized, wireless bandwidth consumed, etc.) as restart transmitting the entire data requires additional resources (e.g., processor cycles, memory space, memory bus bandwidth, wireless bandwidth, etc.).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, a method includes receiving, by a first application executing on a primary device and from a second application executing on the primary device, an indication of data to be transferred between the primary device and a vehicle head unit, wherein the primary device and the vehicle head unit are communicatively coupled via a wireless network connection operating in accordance with a wireless networking protocol; determining, by the first application and based on the indication of the data, an amount of data to be transferred from the primary device to the vehicle head unit; determining, by the first application, whether the amount of data satisfies a maximum packet size for the wireless networking protocol; responsive to determining that the amount of data does not satisfy the maximum packet size: segmenting, by the first application, the data into a plurality of packets, wherein each packet from the plurality of packets includes an amount of data that satisfies the maximum packet size; and sending, from the primary device and to the vehicle head unit, the plurality of packets using the wireless network connection; and responsive to determining that the amount of data satisfies the maximum packet size, sending, from the primary device and to the vehicle head unit, a single packet using the wireless network connection, wherein the single packet includes the data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some examples, a method includes receiving, by a first application executing on a vehicle head unit, from a primary device, and using a wireless network connection, a plurality of packets, wherein the packets are configured in accordance with a wireless networking protocol, wherein each of the packets include a portion of data provided by a first application executing on the primary device, wherein the data is segmented into the plurality of packets by a second application executing on the primary device, and wherein the data has a size that is larger than a maximum packet size for the wireless networking protocol;

For example, to receive data produced in a vehicle, an application of a mobile device needs to connect to the proprietary server to access in-vehicle data. Using a proprietary server to transmit data between the mobile device and the vehicle requires the in-vehicle data to be converted into a proprietary format, which may render the data difficult to use once removed from the proprietary server. The techniques of this disclosure may improve vehicle network communication. Using companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> and companion application <b>115</b> of vehicle head unit <b>102</b> to transmit data may provide a peer to peer communication channel that enables primary device <b>100</b> and vehicle head unit <b>102</b> to communicate directly with each other, thereby eliminating the need for a central server.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the disclosed techniques, companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> and/or companion application <b>115</b> of vehicle head unit <b>102</b> may process and transmit data between primary device <b>100</b> and vehicle head unit <b>102</b> in one or a plurality of packets via transport <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In operation, companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> may receive, from an application <b>104</b> executing on primary device <b>100</b>, an indication of data to be transferred between primary device <b>100</b> and vehicle head unit <b>102</b>. Instead of directly transmitting the data from primary device <b>100</b> to vehicle head unit <b>102</b>, companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> may determine an amount of data to be transferred between primary device <b>100</b> and vehicle head unit <b>102</b> based on the indication of the data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> may further determine whether the amount of data satisfies a maximum packet size for the wireless networking protocol of transport <b>109</b>. For example, transport <b>109</b> may be a wireless transport operating in accordance with a wireless networking protocol having limited packet sizes, such as Bluetooth&#xae; communication protocol or Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy communication protocol, and companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> may determine whether the amount of data to be transferred between primary device <b>100</b> and vehicle head unit <b>102</b> satisfies the limited packet size.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Responsive to determining that the amount of data does not satisfy the maximum packet size, companion application <b>105</b> of primary device <b>100</b> may segment the data into data segments and transmit a plurality of packets containing the data segments to companion application <b>115</b> of vehicle head unit <b>102</b> via transport <b>109</b>.

By restart transmitting only the undelivered packets, various aspects of the techniques may enable the primary device and the head unit to operate more efficiently (e.g., in terms of processor cycles expended, memory consumed, memory bus bandwidth utilized, wireless bandwidth consumed, etc.) as restart transmitting the entire data requires additional resources (e.g., processor cycles, memory space, memory bus bandwidth, wireless bandwidth, etc.).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">While described with respect to primary device <b>100</b>, vehicle head unit <b>102</b> may perform various aspects of the peer to peer communication techniques described in this disclosure.
