These services may include credit or loan underwriting that may extend a credit balance or load to customers, including business entities. When initially onboarding a customer or client entity, the customer may be required to provide initial entity data, including information about financial accounts and financial statuses of the entity and formational documents and information for the entity. For example, the entity may be required to provide information from articles of incorporation, tax status, an employer identification number (EIN), and the like. However, manual input of this data is time consuming and requires numerous inputs to a digital form. This further requires additional processing time to verify the data that is provided by the entity, and requires additional risk analysis, which consumes processing resources while taking additional time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need to address deficiencies with conventional computing systems used by service providers to automate data entry and processing between systems to reduce data processing times and required inputs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a networked system suitable for implementing the processes described herein, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exemplary system architecture for application programming interfaces used to interface with partner services providers to automatically perform data entry and filling within form data structures, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram of service provider interactions with a partner service provider to provide automated data entry and filling within form data structures for onboarding, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart for automatic data entry for form data structures using application programming interfaces, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer system suitable for implementing one or more components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Provided are methods for automatic data entry for form data structures using application programming interfaces. Systems suitable for practicing methods of the present disclosure are also provided.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In service provider systems, such as credit provider systems and other financial service providers, underwriting systems may be utilized to extend credit or other loaned customers and other entities, such as businesses and companies, based on risk assessment and risk analysis processes performed by the service provider systems. With new companies, such as start-up businesses and enterprises, credit extension and onboarding with a service provider may require significant data, which may take time to verify and require significant processing resources. Further, the start-up businesses may have different and difficult to ascertain resources, which may further affect onboarding of new entities. In order to solve these issues with data entry and verification for onboarding systems, the service provider may customize and deploy one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that specifically integrate and communicate data with partner service providers, such as an incorporation firm that provides business incorporation services, to automatically obtain verified and validated data that may be input to one or more digital forms. These forms may correspond to data structures that include the received information. This further provides automatic transmission of electronic communications to complete form filling and onboarding of the entity with the service provider.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An online service provider may provide an account, credit, and/or expense management system that may provide data aggregators that receive and monitor data for an entity, as well as connect with one or more financial computing systems for financial accounts. The financial accounts may include one or more credit accounts, debit cards, direct debit/credit through automated clearing house (ACH), wire transfers, gift cards, and other types of funding sources that may be issued to the entity by the online system and/or other financial service providers (e.g., banks). Thus, a networked system and provider may include a framework and architecture to provide payment gateways, billing platforms, eCommerce platforms, invoicing, and additional services. For example, a credit provider system may offer services, software, online resources and portals, and infrastructure used to onboard an entity and provide access to these services to the entity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this regard, an entity, such as a company or other organization, may request onboarding with a credit service provider, for example, to open and/or receive a loan or credit account that provides one or more payment cards or other financial accounts to the entity. These accounts and/or payment cards may be used by employees, management, and the like of the entity to process payments. Conventionally, the entity may be onboarded by providing necessary documents to verify the entity's identity and/or business standing, such as incorporation documents, EIN, tax status and/or documents, and the like. The entity may also provide data regarding the entity's financial status, accounts, and balances, such as initial seed money, investments, and global available balance(s) that may be used for repayment of extended credit or loans. In this regard, the entity may provide access or a link to data, such as through an integration with one or more banking systems utilized by the entity for one or more available balances of funds. This data may be provided through uploading data and/or entry of input to a digital form. However, this is time consuming, requires data processing and network communication resources, and further requires data confirmation and validation, which wastes additional data processing resources and time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to expedite digital form filling and data uploading of data required for uploading, a credit and/or expense management service provider may provide an automated form filling API and operations. The service provider may generate and deploy an onboarding API specifically for a partner service provider, such as an incorporation firm, tax and/or financial account provider, or the like. The API may be specifically configured to interface with the computing systems of the partner service provider, such as by allowing for API calls and data exchanges between the internal systems of the service provider and the external computing systems of the partner service provider. The API may be specifically configured and deployed for the computing infrastructure and systems of the partner service provider, which may allow for receiving and/or converting data into data structures and data formats compatible with the internal computing services of the service provider requiring the onboarding.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thereafter, the service provider may utilize an authorization and authentication protocol and framework that allows servers and services of the partner service provider to be authenticated with the service provider. For example, oAuth may be used as an authorization standard and protocol to allow the partner service to access and/or exchange information with the service provider. This enables the partner service provider to allow authenticated access and use of the service provider's computing systems and services. In this regard, once authenticated, the partner service provider may then provide data to the service provider for an entity that is being referred to the service provider for onboarding and obtaining service provided by the service provider. The data may include information from one or more documents completed with and/or uploaded to the partner service provider for the entity. For example, the data may include one or more incorporation documents, tax and/or financial account documents or data (e.g., tax status, employer identification number (EIN) or other tax identification, IRS EIN filings or applications, etc.), certificates of good standing, company documents, or the like. In this regard, the partner service provider may receive the data when providing one or more services to the entity by the partner service provider. When the data is provided to the service provider, a referral code identifying the data and the entity may be generated and assigned to the entity for data stored in one or more databases.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The onboarding API of the service provider's computing system may be accessed through one or more API integrations with the computing system of the partner service provider in order to share the data for the entity between the computing systems. The partner service provider may therefore execute one or more API calls to the onboarding API, which may include a data loading in one or more data containers for network communications exchanged via the API calls. Thus, the onboarding API may receive one or more API calls having the corresponding data for the entity from the partner service provider. The onboarding API and the onboarding computing systems of the service provider may then parse the data to identify what information is available in the received data for the entity, and where the data is correspondingly entered to a digital form for onboarding the entity with the service provider. In certain embodiments, the data in the API call(s) may specifically designate the data and the corresponding field of a digital form. For example, the onboarding API may designate data from different fields or placements in received documents or may receive data in specific formats used by the onboarding operations of the service provider.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, in other embodiments, the data may be converted by the onboarding API and/or partner service provider system to one or more data structures that are capable of processing and/or for entry to specific fields of a digital form used to onboard the entity with the service provider. This may include using intelligent machine learning (ML) models and/or data extraction operations (e.g., text extraction, image processing, optical character recognition (OCR), and the like). Once the data is in one or more data structures capable of being handled by the onboarding API and/or onboarding operations of the service provider, the service provider may begin automated form filling using the data in the data structures. This may include adding the data into one or more digital form fields and generating a digital form data structure for the digital form. The digital form may be stored in a database of the service provider for use with the prefilled data that has been automatically entered to the digital form based on the data received from the partner service provider. Further, a generated referral code for the entity may be associated with the digital form for storage and later retrieval by the entity, the service provider, and/or the partner service provider for processing and completion. The referral code for the referral by the partner service provider may also be shared back with the partner service provider's computing system using the API and one or more API calls executed between the two computing systems.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once the digital form has partially or completely been prefilled using the data from the partner service provider, such as after parsing and converting the data into usable data formats and structures with the digital form, the service provider may transmit an electronic communication or message to the entity. The message may be transmitted to a digital address for the entity, which may be received from the partner service provider with the entity's data. The message may include a link to a universal resource location or identifier (URL or URI), which may allow retrieval of the digital form and/or may present a webpage or interface having the digital form with prefilled data automatically entered. The message may also or instead include an attachment for the digital form and/or may provide the digital form in a body of the message having the interface fields that are prefilled. In further embodiments, the message may correspond to an email notification to an email address of the entity and/or used by a member of the entity (e.g., founder, administrative department or personnel, etc.). The message may further identify additional required data for the message.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Based on the digital form, the service provider may reduce risk analysis and/or risk data processing for the entity based on the entity's organizational data being received from the trusted partner service provider. Since the data is being received from a trusted source, the data may not be required to be validated and/or the validations reduce steps, processing, or risk threshold requirements. The credit provider system may provide an electronic data processing framework that integrates into a payment network and/or computing system of a financial service provider at a point that allows for real-time data acquisition and/or processing of transactions once onboarded. Additionally, the system's framework may integrate with one or more client devices (e.g., personal computers, mobile devices, etc.), online scheduling resources, personnel management systems, and/or enterprise business software to receive data for an entity. Thus, risk processes to provide these services may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In further embodiments, a real-time bidirectional link between the computing systems of the service provider and partner service provider may provide automated updating of form filling status and requirements, such as whether the entity has been onboarded. This may include provide a completion status, where completion of onboarding of the entity may provide a reward to the partner service provider from the service provider. The bidirectional link may be used to update messages by the partner service provider with the entity for completion and/or referral, such as by removing any webpage banners and/or messages transmitted between the partner service provider and the entity for referring the service provider for services. These may be exchanged through additional API calls and the like of the onboarding API and system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a networked system <b>100</b> suitable for implementing the processes described herein, according to an embodiment.

If the referral data for the entity is successfully linked, a referral token may be generated and the referral token and/or link for the referral may be provided to the corresponding one of referral partners.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At interaction <b>4</b>, a signup having a link containing the partner's referral token and/or referral link is transmitted to a customer entity <b>308</b>, which may be a potential customer or other entity that may be onboarded with the service provider for services. This may include a redirect URL <b>310</b>, which may redirect customer entity <b>308</b> to a soft signup having prefilled data <b>312</b>. Redirect URL may utilize the referral token and/or referral link to access a webpage or the like that may provide processes for completing a digital form. However, to expedite form filling and automate data entry in particular fields for customer entity <b>308</b>'s data, at interaction <b>5</b>, data is fetched for fields to prefill for the partner's referral token to customer entity <b>308</b>. Soft signup prefilled data <b>312</b> may be obtained by interacting with a customer/onboarding <b>316</b> process, which may access a know your customer (KYC) knowledge base <b>318</b> to verify referral data for the entity and/or add additional data from available KYC data.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Interaction <b>6</b> by customer/onboarding <b>316</b> with onboarding API <b>210</b> thereafter retrieves the referral data for customer entity <b>308</b> through onboarding API <b>210</b>. The referral data may be retrieved and/or loaded to digital form and/or interface fields and elements using the referral data from partner database <b>304</b> and/or filestore <b>306</b>. Thereafter, a dashboard API <b>314</b> may be presented with the digital form with partially or completely filled data fields and entity data may be presented for onboarding and decision-making of whether to onboard customer entity <b>308</b>. Further, when providing the prefilled form and/or adjudicating an onboarding request by customer entity <b>308</b>, exceptions may be granted, and additional favor may be provided, as the data from referral partners <b>302</b> may be considered more trustworthy. Thus, risk analysis and fraud data processing may be reduced based on the trusted referral data.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At an interaction <b>7</b>, an event occurs when an account in onboarded or rejected with an associated referral token. For example, a real-time/bidirectional link may be maintained between onboarding API <b>210</b> and referral partners <b>302</b> may be maintained to update referral partners <b>302</b> of any changes to a status of a referral to a customer entity having the prefilled form for onboarding. If changes are made, such as if the customer entity being referred to the service provider for onboarding via onboarding API <b>210</b> submits their application and digital form, a callback or webhook may be used to update the status. This may cause referral partners <b>302</b> to discontinue display of a link to sign up to the service provider, view their referral token, code, or weblink, and/or receive electronic communications informing the entity to sign up with the service provider via the prefilled form. Additionally, referral partners <b>302</b> may be provided a payment, credit, or bonus for the referral. This may be provided after submission of an onboarding digital form, approval, or the like, and may be immediate bonuses or accrued over a time period (e.g., to obscure which entities have performed onboarding).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart <b>400</b> for automatic data entry for form data structures using application programming interfaces, according to an embodiment. Note that one or more steps, processes, and methods of flowchart <b>400</b> described herein may be omitted, performed in a different sequence, or combined as desired or appropriate.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>402</b> of flowchart <b>400</b>, an onboarding API with a partner service is established to exchange onboarding data. The onboarding API may be established by a service provider and for the partner service may correspond to an API endpoint used by the partner service to exchange API calls, such as by executing an API call to the onboarding API endpoint used to communicate data for a referral of one or more potential customer entities to the service provider by the partner service. Thus, the API endpoint for the partner service may allow specific data for the partner service to be communicated and/or converted for use by the service provider with onboarding attempts by the potential customer entities.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At step <b>404</b>, entity data associated with organization and/or onboarding parameter for an entity are received via the API. The entity data may correspond to referral data, such as data processed and/or received by the partner service when services have been provided to the entity (e.g., incorporation, tax, financial, or other services). Entity data may therefore be provided from one or more documents provided by and/or based on one or more services provided to the entity by the partner service, which may also be relevant to the service provider when onboarding the entity for services provided by the service provider to the entity (e.g., account, credit and underwriting, expense management, and the like). At step <b>406</b>, the entity data is converted for use with an onboarding system and the API for digital form filling. The conversion of the data may be for specific data formats and structures required for automatic form filling, such as when storing and/or entering the data to one or more data fields of a digital form and/or interface for the digital form.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>408</b>, the converted data is automatically associated, without user input, with a digital form and/or data fields and elements for the digital form. This may include entering the data into a form that is storable for the converted entity data in a database or the like. In some embodiments, the data may be associated with particular data fields for the digital form that may be later used to fill data within data fields of the digital form. In other embodiments, a digital form may be intelligently prefilled, such as using a machine learning (ML) model, with the converted data and/or data structures for the converted data. Thus, a form may be prefilled with, and/or the converted data and/or data structures may be associated with, corresponding data fields within a digital form.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Once a form is automatically filled and/or the converted data is associated with the digital form, at step <b>410</b>, an accessible data structure for the converted data and/or digital form is stored. This may include storing a data structure for the converted data that is associated with particular fields and elements of the digital form. In other embodiments, a prefilled form may be generated with the converted data in data fields, and a data structure for that form may be stored. At step <b>412</b>, a message for access to the digital form via the accessible data structure is communicated, such as to an entity's digital address (e.g., email address, dashboard within another website or application, or the like). In some embodiments, the message may be sent by the service provider; however, the message may also or instead be sent by the partner service performing the referral.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, using various embodiments discussed herein, companies can better (e.g., more efficiently and more accurately) automatically perform data entry into data fields and elements, which eliminates the need for manual data entry within these fields and elements. Further, this may expedite the data processing and inputs required to complete digital forms with services providers. The provided API integrations and endpoints provided herein therefore improve data communications and processing between separate computing systems for different service providers, thereby unifying data across different platforms and utilizing validated data that reduces risk analysis processing.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer system suitable for implementing one or more components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment.
