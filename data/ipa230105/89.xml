There are multiple steps that are involved in properly making authentic injera. For example, injera generally requires a batter mixture that has proper viscosity to retain leavening gasses (which are forms from the combination of air; water vapor or steam; carbon dioxide; and biological) while cooking. The injera batter should also be thin enough so as to result in a finished injera which is preferably one centimeter or less in thickness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Injera traditionally has been cooked by independently pouring the injera batter onto the cooking plate by hand and placing the cooking plate on a stone oven. Once cooked, each injera is removed from the cooking plate by hand. Injera is normally patterned into a generally round and flat shape or configuration, much like a tortilla or a pancake. A cover may be placed over the injera batter cooking on a cooking plate to assist in the shaping and even cooking of the injera batter. With all of the required movements the injera cooking process is generally very taxing on the cook's body and requires a great deal of training and experience with the most experienced cooks having the capability of cooking around 100 injeras per hour.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The spongy texture of injera is preferably radially uniform and is preferably soft and flexible and has a unique brownish color. Some or all of these multiple requirements have prevented the successful automation of the injera production process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to an injera baking apparatus that applies certain features and/or processes of the traditional injera baking process and modernizing such process in order to automate and mass produce injera while requiring little to no experience or training to out cook the most experienced injera cookers or bakers.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Briefly, the present invention comprises an automated injera baking apparatus having a support frame and a rotating table housed within the support frame. The rotating table includes a stand supporting a circular rotating top surface thereon and a motor assembly powering the circular rotation of the rotatable top surface with respect to the stand. The circular rotating top surface includes a plurality of removable injera cooking plate radially supported thereon in an equally spaced condition.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The automated injera baking apparatus includes a burner assembly supported underneath the circular rotating top surface in a fixed condition. The burner assembly having a plurality of heating burners continuously heating the injera cooking plates containing uncooked injera batter thereon during the operation of the circular rotating top surface with each of the heating plates containing the uncooked injera batter thereon maintaining a consistent injera batter cooking temperature during the rotation of the heating plates between heating burners.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The automated injera baking apparatus also includes an injera batter pour system connected to the support frame and a source of injera batter. The injera batter pour system includes a pour arm having a first end connected to a motor assembly and a second end having an injera batter dispensing nozzle connected thereto with the nozzle dispensing a pre-measured shot of injera batter in a generally round and flat configuration onto each injera cooking plate rotated underneath the nozzle of the batter pour system during the operation of the circular rotating top surface. In one embodiment of the present invention the cooking plate located underneath the nozzle of the batter pour system and a cooking plate containing a cooked injera batter are located adjacent each other and each lacking a heating burner located underneath.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The automated injera baking apparatus also includes an automated injera removal robotic arm located proximal the support frame having an injera transfer spatula connected to a free end of the injera removal robotic arm and a sensor to detect the presence of injera on the injera transfer spatula. The injera removal robotic arm replicating an operator's hand, wrist, and arm motion for the removal of the cooked injera from the cooking plate using a spatula and the stacking of the cooked injera onto a transfer pan.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The automated injera baking apparatus may further includes at least three covers each covering injera batter on a series of at least three different heating plates and a cover transfer arm assembly connected to the support frame with the cover transfer arm assembly repeatedly removing the cover from the cooking plate containing the cooked injera batter and transferring the cover onto one of the cooking top containing the uncooked injera batter to assist in the shaping and even cooking of the uncooked injera batter. The cover transfer arm assembly includes an elongated arm having a first end connected to a cover transfer arm motor and a second end having a cover grasping handle. A feature of the automated injera baking apparatus of the present invention is that the rotation of each heating plate from a batter loading position to an injera batter cooked and ready for removal position may be less than 8 seconds.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of an injera baking apparatus of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of an injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pouring system of the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a top view showing injera batter dispensed or poured onto a heating plate;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of an octagon burner of the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a lid arm supporting a cooking cover thereon of the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a skeletal view of a rotational table of the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial view of the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> in use;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of an automated injera removal arm that may be used with the of the injera baking machine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a partial view of the automated injera removal arm in use with the injera baking apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide an injera baking apparatus to automate and mass produce the injera baking process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">There has thus been outlined the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
