Some other embodiments are characterised by what is stated in the other claims. Inventive embodiments are also disclosed in the specification and drawings of this patent application. The inventive content of the patent application may also be defined in other ways than defined in the following claims. The inventive content may also be formed of several separate inventions, especially if the invention is examined in the light of expressed or implicit sub-tasks or in view of obtained benefits or benefit groups. Some of the definitions contained in the following claims may then be unnecessary in view of the separate inventive ideas. Features of the different embodiments of the invention may, within the scope of the basic inventive idea, be applied to other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0016">In one embodiment, the horizontal cross-section of the preceding apparatus has a round shape, and the crossover duct is arranged to the round preceding apparatus so that a distal wall of the crossover duct is tangentially directed in respect of the preceding apparatus. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator may be improved by guiding/pushing particles towards the outer wall of said guiding separator already at the outlet of the preceding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0017">In one embodiment, the horizontal cross-section of the preceding apparatus has a round shape, and the distal wall has an offset in respect of the preceding apparatus, the offset being no more than 0.1&#xd7;D from a tangential plane of the preceding apparatus. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator may be improved by guiding/pushing particles towards the outer wall of said guiding separator already at the outlet of the preceding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0018">In one embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the preceding apparatus is polygon, e.g. rectangle or square, and that the crossover duct is arranged at a vertical edge of the preceding apparatus so that a distal wall of the crossover duct is attached to said vertical edge. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator may be improved by guiding/pushing particles towards the outer wall of said guiding separator already at the outlet of the preceding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0019">In one embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the preceding apparatus is polygon, e.g. rectangle or square, and a distal wall of the crossover duct has an offset in respect of a vertical edge of the preceding apparatus, the offset being no more than 0.1&#xd7;D from said vertical edge. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator may be improved by guiding/pushing particles towards the outer wall of said guiding separator already at the outlet of the preceding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0020">In one embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the preceding apparatus is polygon, e.g. rectangle or square, and the distal wall of the crossover duct is perpendicular to an outlet wall of the preceding apparatus that comprises the outlet. An advantage is that it is very easy to be constructed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0021">In one embodiment, a relation of the height H of the crossover duct to the width d thereof is H/d&#x3c;3.75 at the outlet. An advantage is that the duct flow-through section has a relatively narrow shape, thus guiding the particles away from the cyclone gas outlet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0022">In one embodiment, the cross-sectional area of the crossover duct decreases towards the inlet. An advantage is that velocity of gas flow in the cross-over duct may be accelerated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0023">In one embodiment, the width of the crossover duct is decreasing towards the inlet. An advantage is that the particles are guided further away from the gas outlet in the cyclone separator. The angle leading to a decreased width pushes the particles further towards the cyclone outer wall where gas solid separation can take place.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024">In one embodiment, the width of the crossover duct is decreasing towards the inlet so that a proximal wall of the crossover duct is arranged at a first angle a in relation to a distal wall thereof, wherein the first angle &#x3b1;&#x3c;40&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0025">An advantage is that the particles are guided further away from the gas outlet in the cyclone separator. The angle leading to a decreased width pushes the particles further towards the cyclone outer wall where gas solid separation can take place.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0026">In one embodiment, a bump is arranged in the flow channel for limiting the cross-sectional area of the flow channel. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator may be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0027">In one embodiment, the height h of the bump in relation to width d of the flow channel is selected as: h/d&#x3c;0.3. An advantage is that the flow-through area is not largely occupied by the bump, thus pressure losses do not increase significantly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028">In one embodiment, the length l of the bump 11 in relation to height h thereof is selected as: 1/h&#x3c;4. An advantage is that there is enough space left till the cyclone separator inlet is reached, thus allowing the flow to expand back which reduces pressure losses while the particles do not easily expand back due to their inertia.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0029">In one embodiment, the preceding apparatus is a venturi apparatus having a round cross-section, the venturi apparatus comprising a feeding channel arrangement for feeding material in the venturi apparatus, wherein the feeding channel arrangement comprises one or more feeding channel(s) arranged, as seen from above, at a second angle &#x3b2; in relation to the direction of the distal wall of the crossover duct, wherein said second angle &#x3b2; is selected in range of 90&#xb0;&#xb1;70&#xb0;. An advantage is that the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator connected to the venturi apparatus may be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">In one embodiment, the feeding channel arrangement of the venturi apparatus comprises one feeding channel only. An advantage is that the feeding channel arrangement has a simple and light structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">In one embodiment, the feeding channel arrangement comprises at least two feeding channels. An advantage is that this may provide more flexibility to a plant layout and, if necessary, feeding of two or more materials to be mixed in the preceding apparatus may be promoted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">In one embodiment, the feeding channel arrangement is arranged on same side of a centre line of the venturi apparatus as the crossover duct. An advantage is that the mixing in the venturi is enhanced and also the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator connected to the venturi apparatus may be enhanced, especially when gas flow has a high bulk velocity, meaning that bulk velocity &#x3e;5 m/s in the feeding channel, preferably &#x3e;6 m/s, even more preferably &#x3e;7 m/s.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">In one embodiment, the feeding channel arrangement is arranged on opposite side of a centre line of the venturi apparatus as the crossover duct. An advantage is that the mixing in the venturi is enhanced and also the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator connected to the venturi apparatus may be enhanced, especially when gas flow has a low bulk velocity, meaning that bulk velocity &#x3c;5 m/s in the feeding channel, preferably &#x3c;4 m/s.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">In one embodiment, the venturi apparatus has an expanded upper portion, and that the outlet is arranged to said expanded upper portion. An advantage is that the venturi enhances mixing due to the expansion and resulting turbulence/recirculation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0035">Some embodiments illustrating the present disclosure are described in more detail in the attached drawings, in which</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of a cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic top view of another cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic top view of a third cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic top view of a fourth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of a fifth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic top view of a sixth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of a seventh cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of an eighth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of a ninth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic top view of a tenth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic side view of the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic top view of an eleventh cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic top view of a twelfth cyclone separator arrangement in partial cross-section,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>a </i></figref>shows principles for defining certain dimensions of a flow channel, and</p><p id="p-0047" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b </i></figref>shows principles for defining certain dimensions of a preceding apparatus.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0048" num="0056">In the figures, some embodiments are shown simplified for the sake of clarity.
