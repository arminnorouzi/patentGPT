Specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for effective utilization of privileged information in organizational and personal risk management systems for modern organizations whose personnel are physically distributed and often mobile, in a manner that can be a trusted basis for coordinated action and which protects the privacy and security of the privileged information. Such privileged information may originate within the organization, among the personnel of the organization, or from trusted sources external to the organization.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern organizations are often characterized in that both material and human assets are geographically distributed across many different locations, and must function in disparate operational and regulatory environments. Nonetheless, organizations still have a duty of care for those assets, resulting in obligations to the organization itself, its personnel and stakeholders, and regulators, among many others. Modern communication and information management techniques provide resources for meeting this duty of care; however, their effectiveness depends upon several critical elements.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Data security is one such element, and is essential at least in part because data being managed is related to the operational status and vulnerabilities of all the organization's assets. Data may therefore be critical proprietary information to the organization, resulting in the need for security measures to protect it.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of an organization's human assets, there are additional needs for maintaining and protecting privacy. This may differ from location to location within the same organization; for example, California's California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides extensive data privacy provisions that include protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of human assets, among other things, which is also required by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Accordingly, privacy is another critical element for maintaining and meeting an organization's duty of care.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Modern organizations also have a duty of care to protect at least their human assets from threats and provide a safe working environment. Addressing threatening situations requires that organizational users and systems be integrated so that such protection can be realized as quickly as possible, and that compliance with policies and procedures can be adhered to.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Evidentiary requirements are another important element in terms of duty of care obligations, as an organization must often prove that it has provided its duty of care if challenged by regulators, its risk mitigation partners, or any of its personnel who consider they have been damaged by the organization's failure to do so. Therefore, communications and information management systems must account for and enable forensic utility of the organization's data.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Duty of care issues illustrate an essential duality faced by modern organizations: they must collect and analyze a large amount of information extensively, but that information may, itself, represent a liability if it is not managed appropriately. Many of these issues can be significantly mitigated if the duty of care is limited to the organization's material assets, but it is increasingly the case that the value of an organization's assets resides more so in its human assets rather than its material assets. Therefore, limiting the duty of care to material assets is of limited, and decreasing, value to an organization. Even in this case, however, supporting the operational effectiveness, not just the mere existence, of asset protection systems, is critical if the organization's ability to support meeting its duty of care is called into question.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Modern organizations are also faced with challenges stemming from a need to make informed decisions in the shortest time possible. In order to make such informed decisions, organizations must get feedback or input from multiple members of their organizations, Many of these members are available and reachable through mobile connections on mobile devices, due to an increasingly mobile world and remote working environments where human assets are increased spread across more and more locations. Organizations are faced with challenges in establishing priority connections to members in a such a mobile environment to deliver and receive important information quickly, elevating priority for responses and for requests and, furthermore, structuring these communications so the organization can make rapid and informed decisions. Organizations are able to connect increasingly distributed groups of people; however, ubiquitous mobile connectivity has not yet provided these organizations with capabilities to connect to their mobile users utilizing structured and prioritized messaging in a way that satisfies these challenges and enables meeting the duty of care issues illustrated above.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there is a need in the art for improvements to gathering, maintaining, managing, and processing information within organizations to meet its substantial duty of care obligations in an increasingly distributed business world. There is a further need for improvements in helping organizations assess and mitigate risks in such an operating environment. There is also a need in the art for improvements in the manner in which communications between businesses and their customers can be integrated into an approach for maintaining and meeting an organization's duty of care for both material and human assets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is a framework for risk assessment and mitigation that combines the Internet of Things (IoT) with an Internet of PersonsTM (IoP) approach to deliver, in one aspect of the present invention, a risk management service that incorporates elements of both organizational and personal risk management. Such a risk management service enables organizations to manage their risks in response to unexpected events, such as environmental or weather issues, civil disruptions, loss of infrastructure, and public health and safety events such as pandemics, through the exchange of trusted messages and analysis of information contained in such messages. These messages provide the basis for a coordinated organizational response to these events, protect the privacy and security of the information used for this response, and preserve a secure record of all the data and metadata associated with all messages for subsequent operational or forensic analysis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The framework for risk assessment and mitigation is provided in one or more systems and methods that provide a private, secure, and auditable means of coordination between an organization and individual ones or groups of its mobile users, through the risk management service. The service internal, cloud-based components with a private mobile messaging system (PMMS), a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for exchanging privileged information between the organization and both its and individual users and external data sources in a private and secure manner, a secure portal for the organization's system managers to manage external trusted data sources and define the rules required to implement the organization's risk management procedures, and outbound APIs for communicating information within the service to its users and to external systems that are needed to implement specific actions associated with risk management. This last instance of APIs act as event relays for communicating information in response to events that represent a defined risk, where the receiver is on the same Internet Protocol network, and where the receiver is also able to accept information via its own web services-based APIs, such as for external systems.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention includes several components that interact in a private, secure and authenticated manner, and which perform the systems and methods described further herein. These may include a system client, which may act as a gateway for a dedicated application for a PMMS that is installed on personal mobile devices of the organization's personnel and registered with the organization. The system also includes extensions, which are software that permits integration of the service with trusted external data sources, both in terms of receiving external inbound alerts from external sources based on configurable rules defined by the organization. These external inbound alerts may be escalated into an &#x201c;InSite Event&#x201d;, as well as external outbound commands or alerts to external systems, which may or may not be the same external systems. A cloud-implemented server environment hosts a system manager which provides administration, operations, and analysis by the organization, a database, a rules engine, and a message manager for all message traffic.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is designed to work over Internet-connected and mobile carrier networks. By establishing priority connectivity through Internet, push technology services and wireless carrier networks to mobile users of the organization, the invention improves organizational decision making, workforce security and safety, and raises the standard of mobile connectivity and information distribution. The invention is designed to deliver low-bandwidth structured messaging over a dedicated and prioritized network while minimizing use of mobile device resources such as battery power, computing, memory, and bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present is comprised, in one embodiment thereof, of a system client configured to manage interaction with a system user and including at least one system client database and a system client user interface controlled by an application server, a mobile client configured to manage interaction with personnel of the organization who are mobile users of the system and have one or more mobile devices registered to them, and a secure messaging server configured to manage interaction between the system client and the mobile client and with one or more external systems providing supportive services to either of the system client or the mobile client, the secure messaging server including an application server component and a database server component each performing messaging functions in the interaction between the system client and the mobile client and with one or more external system. Through the exchange of trusted messages, the organizational risk management system can coordinate the response of the organization and its mobile users in response to unexpected events, ensure the privacy of all the data utilized in the coordination of the organization's response for the protection of the organization, its personnel, and, as necessary, external sources contributing data to the system, and create a permanent database record of all responses of the organization and its constituent users and external systems.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is one objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of implementing a risk management service for organizations. It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of improving operational efficiency for organizations with distributed and/or mobile stakeholders, as well as enhanced support, security, and safety for all mobile stakeholders of the organization, within such a risk management service. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of protecting and containing all privileged information within such a risk management service. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a system and method for timely communication of trusted messages to all personnel in the organization that form the basis for coordinated actions on the part of the personnel within such a risk management service. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a system and method implementing actions on the part of distributed personnel of the organization that reduce the risk to the personnel, individually or collectively, and to the organization itself, within such a risk management service.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a system and method for analyzing and implementing an organizational response to unexpected events. It still a further objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of training personnel for effective organizational response to unexpected events. It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of demonstrating that an organization has met its duty of care to its personnel and others to whom such a duty is owed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other objects, embodiments, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments, taken together with any accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating components in a computing environment and risk assessment and mitigation platform that operates within a risk management service according to one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a further diagram of a risk assessment and mitigation platform of a risk management service according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is still another diagram of a risk assessment and mitigation platform of a risk management service according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of steps in a process of performing a risk assessment and mitigation platform in the risk management service according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S) OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description of the present invention, reference is made to the exemplary embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention and how it is practiced.

These elements may comprise one or more of the data processing modules <b>132</b>, and may include a system client <b>135</b> which is a dedicated application for a private mobile messaging system <b>136</b> (PMMS) that may be installed on personal mobile devices <b>139</b> of the organization's users <b>102</b>, and registered with the organization <b>106</b>. The PMMS <b>136</b> may itself be considered a data processing module <b>132</b>; regardless, the system client <b>135</b> and, where applied, the PMMS <b>136</b>, are configured to ensure that trusted messages <b>103</b> that at least include individual risk and action information <b>111</b> are conveyed from one or more mobile clients <b>137</b>, using one or more mobile applications <b>138</b>, to the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The data processing modules <b>132</b> may also include a data collection module <b>150</b>, which manages one or more inbound application programming interfaces (APIs) <b>152</b>, which enable extensions that permit integration of the risk management service <b>100</b> with trusted data sources in the one or more external systems <b>105</b> based on configurable rules defined by the organization <b>106</b>. External systems <b>105</b> may be any system that is external to the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>, and which are connected thereto via extensions that are enabled the one or more inbound APIs <b>152</b>, and by one or more outbound APIs <b>156</b> for outbound commands or alerts to external systems.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The data processing modules <b>132</b> also include a system manager <b>160</b>, which is configured to provide functions of administration and operation, as well as analysis of the input data <b>110</b> by the organization to identify information that defines the risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>. The data processing modules <b>132</b> may further include a rules engine <b>170</b> which further develops one or more responses <b>186</b> to this defined risk <b>162</b>, and a message manager <b>180</b>, which coordinates message traffic within the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Individual risk and action information <b>111</b> may be communicated via trusted mobile messages <b>103</b> from one or more mobile applications <b>138</b>, which are associated with mobile devices <b>139</b> and users <b>102</b>. Users <b>102</b> may manipulate the mobile applications <b>138</b> stored or accessed from their mobile devices <b>139</b> to convey information as to a number of different events or activities. Additionally, the mobile devices <b>139</b> may automatically generate and transmit the individual risk and action information <b>111</b> when a particular action is detected, for example using sensors or other devices that are connected or coupled to the mobile applications <b>138</b>, so that no user manipulation is necessary. Regardless, individual risk and action information <b>111</b> may include a report or eyewitness account, a request for support or assistance, a monitor or panic signal, a survey broadcast, or a door access request. It is to be noted that many other examples of such individual risk and action information <b>111</b> are also possible, and that any type of notification generated by a user <b>102</b>, a mobile application <b>138</b>, or a mobile device <b>139</b> are possible and within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not to be limited to any one type of individual risk or action information <b>111</b> referenced herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">External event information <b>120</b> is, as noted above, information that is generated and transmitted in trusted external messages <b>104</b> from external systems <b>105</b> to a data ingest module <b>150</b>, a system manager <b>160</b>, or any other module, component, or processor within the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>. External event information <b>120</b> may include facilities management information, weather or disaster event information (such as for example severe rainstorms or snowstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes or earthquakes), news information such as a news bulletin, intrusion detection notification, a card access failed notification, a camera movement detection notification, a facial recognition notification, or other event requiring immediate notification and attention that is reported by an external system <b>105</b>, such as for example a gunshot or gunfire, an armed attacker/ active shooter present, or other instance of chaos or mayhem occurring.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The input data <b>110</b> may further include facilities information <b>128</b> which describes one or more organizational facilities. Such organizational facilities may be impacted by any event that also impacts the organizational users <b>102</b> and the organization itself <b>106</b>, and therefore the risk management service <b>100</b> may incorporate such facilities information <b>128</b> to both define a risk <b>162</b> and model a most appropriate or necessary response to an event reflected in mobile messages <b>103</b> or external messages <b>104</b>. The risk management service <b>100</b> may further include, and/or access, a secure, cloud-based, organizational database <b>154</b>, configured to store input data <b>110</b>, including any metadata <b>164</b> that is extracted and developed, and any other information that is relevant to an organization <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be understood that the input data <b>110</b> need not be provided when an event occurs that triggers the generation of individual risk and action information <b>111</b> or external event information <b>120</b>. The present invention may include one or more background processes that ingest data from external sources on a periodic or continual basis, such as for example earthquake data from United States Geological Service. Therefore, the ingest of input data <b>110</b> may not be on behalf of, or at the behest of, any particular organization. The present invention may therefore include one or more levels of structure that are higher than any particular organization <b>106</b> that implements the risk management service <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Where such input data <b>110</b> is obtained a higher structural level than any organization <b>106</b>, the present invention invokes configurable rules <b>172</b> to notify an organization <b>106</b> that is subscribed to that data source, and those rules <b>172</b> determine how any given organization wishes to handle the information therein. For example, one organization may want to generate an eyewitness report when the earthquake is within 1 mile and magnitude 4.0, whereas another organization may have set a lower threshold for distance and higher for magnitude.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> incorporates and performs multiple algorithms that together perform the functions of aggregating and integrating input data <b>110</b>, analyzing the information in that input data <b>110</b> to define a specific risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>, determining what should happen to address the defined risk <b>162</b>, and communicating event relays <b>193</b> representative of responses <b>186</b> thereto. The various elements of the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may each perform one or more of these algorithms, which are applications of mathematical processes on the various input data <b>110</b> and metadata <b>164</b> as described further below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system manager <b>160</b> performs one or more algorithms that together operate to identify, develop, correlate and integrate all risk information in the input data <b>110</b> that is relevant to individuals and/or facilities of the organization <b>106</b> from both the individual risk and action information <b>111</b> and the external event information <b>120</b>, and define the specific risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>. This is accomplished by analyzing an overlap in metadata <b>164</b> that is relative to events reflected in the action individual risk and information <b>111</b>, external events reflected in the event information <b>120</b>, and any other internal or external events identified by the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>. Metadata <b>164</b> may be based on a plurality of factors; for example, metadata may represent a configurable proximity of events for one or more characteristics that include general location, specific positioning, date, time, user role, department, active work status, etc. The system manager <b>160</b> uses this information to identify and define a specific risk <b>162</b> to the organization <b>106</b> from the overlap in metadata <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example, the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may include an algorithm where the PMMS <b>136</b> identifies and surveys all users <b>102</b> for whom a last reported geolocation of their mobile devices <b>139</b> is within a defined geographic region that is associated with an event (e.g. flood, earthquake) to determine their status and, if necessary, respond to their needs.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example, an algorithm may be applied to associate all messages that are related to an initiating event or message. In this case, the database <b>154</b> may be queried for all messages that contain a reference to the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) in their metadata <b>164</b>. This subset of messages may be further refined by reference to the time of the messages and the geolocation of the mobile device <b>139</b>, both being items that may also be derived from metadata <b>164</b>. Using this algorithm, an appropriate set of users <b>102</b>, and their status (using both message data and metadata <b>164</b>) may be identified and provided to the system manager <b>160</b> for subsequent follow-up action.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In yet another example, an algorithm may be applied to identify all users <b>102</b> who are organizationally associated with an individual (derived from information in the organizational database <b>154</b>) who represents an established health risk. These users <b>102</b> may then be directed to implement an appropriate protocol to establish their status.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In still a further example, an algorithm may be applied to determine the status and geolocation of one or more users <b>102</b> that request monitoring or support by the organization <b>106</b>. This may be discerned from the message data and metadata <b>164</b> in survey messages broadcasted to their mobile devices <b>139</b> and updating the status and geolocation automatically and in real time based on the information returned.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In still another example, the risk assessment and mitigation platform may identify patterns of behavior that occurred as a collection of prior, and seemingly unrelated, events that resulted in another more critical event, these patterns may be used to drive an algorithm configured to search for possible future critical events. In an illustrative example of this, assume that last week there were five events that occurred within a mile radius around a known site within the organization within 5 minutes, each of which appeared to be unrelated&#x2014;such as two separate strangers lurking around the site, an unscheduled fire drill, a broken door, and graffiti&#x2014;that resulted in an armed robbery which was later determined to have connected the five events. This pattern of events may be actively searched for using one or more algorithms, with an alert being raised if they occur.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The rules engine <b>170</b> performs one or more algorithms that together operate to identify and aggregate all information regarding the specific risk <b>162</b> to the organization <b>106</b>. This information may include a resulting status of all of the affected organizational individuals, and their compliance with organizational policies and procedures. The rules engine <b>170</b> applies one or more rules <b>172</b> to organize this information for further use by the system manager <b>160</b> according to one or more rules, and to develop action requests <b>182</b> (such as for example in surveys <b>184</b>) and responses <b>186</b>, and evaluate those responses <b>186</b> for further action needed. For example, the rules engine <b>170</b> may apply the rules <b>172</b> to aggregate responses <b>186</b> to a survey <b>184</b> that is broadcasted to either all users, a user-defined subset, or a specific mobile user, to determine what automated system or procedural flow should occur to further address the defined risk <b>162</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The message manager <b>180</b> is configured at least in part to push the action requests <b>182</b> from the rules engine <b>170</b> to the organization's users <b>102</b> through their mobile clients <b>137</b>, and process responses <b>186</b> from mobile clients <b>137</b> confirming the receipt of the action requests <b>182</b> and the compliance of the organization's users <b>102</b>. Action requests <b>182</b> may therefore themselves be considered a form of output data <b>190</b>, as they may form the content of trusted output messages <b>194</b> to the registered organizational users <b>102</b> and external systems <b>105</b> as a result of the processing steps performed in risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> and risk management service <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, other data processing modules <b>132</b> are also possible and within the scope of the present invention. For example, the risk assessment platform <b>140</b> may include an audit manager <b>210</b> for maintaining an audit trail and performing other compliance and mitigation functions. Such an audit manager <b>210</b> may be configured to track action requests <b>182</b> and responses <b>186</b> thereto, as well as the timing at least of such responses <b>186</b>, for example where event relays <b>193</b> are used to broadcast surveys <b>184</b> to affected organizational individuals.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Output data <b>190</b> may include, as noted above, outbound alerts <b>192</b>, event relays <b>193</b>, and messages <b>194</b>, and may be communicated to a several different people, places, or systems, and for many different reasons. For example, an event relay <b>193</b> may be initiated to convey messages <b>194</b> to organizational individuals <b>195</b>, or to external systems <b>196</b>. Output data <b>190</b> may be configured to a display <b>197</b>, for example on the user interface <b>200</b>. Output data <b>190</b> may also comprise compliance and other reporting information <b>198</b>, and a mitigation assessment <b>199</b> as discussed further herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Trusted mobile messages <b>103</b> and trusted external messages <b>104</b> include specific metadata <b>164</b>, in information that is not directly supplied by the mobile users <b>102</b>, the external systems <b>105</b>, or the system manager <b>160</b>. This metadata <b>164</b> may nevertheless be provided by one or more servers that connect the system clients <b>135</b> with the system manager <b>160</b>, a mobile telecommunications network, mobile devices <b>139</b>, other devices accessing the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>, or some combination of these elements.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Metadata <b>164</b> may include many different pieces of information. This may include a Globally-Unique Identifier (GUID) for each trusted mobile message <b>103</b> or trusted external message <b>104</b>, and may identify the originating source of each message, for example the organizational user <b>102</b> or the system client <b>135</b>. Metadata <b>164</b> may also identify the type of message, the time the message was originated, the date the message was originated, and where the message is responsive to a survey <b>184</b> initiated by the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>, an associated message identifier that correlates the message with the particular survey <b>184</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Metadata <b>164</b> may also include device-specific information that is relative to each mobile message <b>103</b> or external message <b>104</b>, where this information is available and/or as reported by the device itself. For example, metadata <b>164</b> may identify the location of the device communicating with the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> or messaging manager <b>180</b>, a status of the device, and any other information provided by communicating devices to aid subsequent analysis of the metadata <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">All metadata <b>164</b> that is associated with each mobile message <b>103</b> or external message <b>104</b> (either originating or survey-responsive), as well as the message data that comprises the content provided by the organizational user <b>102</b>, or system manager <b>160</b>, or message manager <b>180</b>, is stored in the secure, cloud-based organizational database <b>154</b> of the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>. Using this metadata <b>164</b>, the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may perform several analyses, through properly structured database queries and one or more mathematical models or functions that process information in the mobile messages <b>103</b> and external messages <b>104</b>, to generate output data <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">These analyses of metadata <b>164</b> may include assessing a status of the mobile device <b>139</b> or organizational user <b>102</b> who issued the mobile message <b>103</b>, such as determining a response time, a reported status, and a last reported location, for example for all users <b>102</b> who are expected to respond to a specific survey <b>184</b>. Response times may be assessed according to an anticipated or expected response time of the user <b>102</b> that may be calculated based on many different factors, for example based on the user's prior history of responding and prior response times, proximity to an event (for example, the user <b>102</b> should respond within x minutes following a y event), or any other characteristic influencing a user's ability to respond, or defined by a particular set of rules. A reported status may generate a particular assessment of the user's state and a need for follow-up with that user <b>102</b>, for example where the user messages a particular phrase or phrases that are flagged as troublesome. Similarly, a user's last reported location may be generate a particular assessment of the user's state and need for follow-up, for example where a fire has been reported and user's last reported location was near the location of the fire, or for example where a user <b>102</b> who is required by rules established by a government agency responding to a health emergency to maintain a particular distance from other users, the analyses determine that distancing rules are not being adhered to.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Analyses of metadata <b>164</b> in the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may also include determining the location and status of any users <b>102</b> who have requested support. The present invention therefore may calculate a user's geo-location based on information in the metadata <b>164</b>, as well as their movement characteristics. The present invention may also assess the user's status, reported or otherwise, following support requests from such location information, for example if the user <b>102</b> has moved a significant distance or to a particular place. In such an example, a user <b>102</b> who has requested support following a report of an armed intruder may not report a status, but their location can be analyzed to determine where assets may be deployed to help the user <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Analyses of metadata <b>164</b> in the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may also include a time of receipt and the acknowledgement, if any, of a responsive message directing specific action on the part of a user <b>102</b>. Timings of receipts and acknowledgements may be calculated and compared with expected receipt timings and acknowledgements, and assessments can be made where the present invention may infer that certain additional events have occurred.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may fuse or aggregate information in mobile messages <b>103</b> from users <b>102</b>, and/or in external messages <b>104</b> from external systems <b>105</b>, to enhance the credibility of reported events. Analysis of metadata <b>164</b> may therefore include analyzing information in such messages <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> to determine what information to fuse, and how to fuse, in response for example to the particular reported event. An analysis of metadata <b>164</b> may include initiating a response by the system manager <b>164</b> to any message received from a registered user <b>102</b> and, if necessary, a dialogue with the user <b>102</b>. Analysis in such a context may therefore include making an assessment that a response <b>186</b> is necessary based on the metadata <b>164</b>, and further than a dialogue must be initiated, for example to obtain further information, determine a user status, etc. Fusion of information in the mobile messages <b>103</b> and/or in external messages <b>104</b> may further assist such as assessment, for example where several users <b>102</b> have reported the same event and one user has become isolated from other users <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Analysis of metadata <b>164</b> in the present invention may further include an identification of all user locations within a defined geographic area of interest. For example, where an external message <b>104</b> is received reporting a sudden weather event such as a tornado (or where a tornado is expected to strike, or along its expected trajectory), the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may analyze metadata <b>164</b> to identify all registered users <b>102</b> that are located within a certain radius of the tornado, where it is expected to strike, or within its path. Such an analysis may also be used for contact tracing, for example in a public health emergency, to identify all users <b>102</b> who have had contact with a person reporting an infection or identify all users <b>102</b> within a certain distance of a user <b>102</b> who reports a status of (or who is reported as having) experiencing symptoms of an infection. Similarly, the present invention may determine a dissemination of a survey <b>186</b> to a specific set of users <b>102</b> from the system manager based on the metadata <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Metadata <b>164</b> may also be used to determine an assignment of requests from users <b>102</b> for actions to responsible individuals within the organization, and follow-up with those responsible individuals until those actions are completed. Metadata <b>164</b> may be analyzed to assess whether those actions have been completed, for example based on other messages or signals from the mobile devices <b>139</b> associated with them, and survey responsible individuals until the actions have been completed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Metadata <b>164</b> may also be analyzed to determine the status, the last reported location, and the availability of all registered users <b>102</b>. For example, metadata from the last messages sent by mobile devices <b>139</b> of an organization's users <b>102</b> may be examined to immediately assess where all its users <b>102</b> are and whether they are available to respond to a particular event.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Metadata <b>164</b> may also be assessed to identify all users <b>102</b> to whom specific information from trusted external sources may be relevant. Metadata <b>164</b> may also provide information that enables implementation, through an event relay algorithm as an outcome of the application of rules <b>172</b> from the rules engine <b>170</b>, of specific actions by external systems <b>105</b> in response to information received from users <b>102</b> and/or trusted external information sources.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present invention may also model metadata <b>164</b> to assess a response to a specific event to evaluate compliance with organizational policies, organizational duty of care, and/or compliance with regulatory or governmental directives. For example, if the users <b>102</b> are required to wash their hands every 20 minutes, and maintain a specified distance from all other individuals in the organization <b>106</b>, the metadata <b>164</b> may indicate whether each user <b>102</b> has visited a washing station within 20 minutes of their last visit, and whether they have come closer than the specified distance to any other user <b>102</b>. If not, a compliance message may be generated as output data <b>190</b> to an external system <b>196</b> via an event relay <b>193</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Metadata <b>164</b> may also be used in training scenarios, for example to train individuals on organization response procedures for unexpected events, and subsequently assess actual responses and compare those to expected actions. Data from training and assessments of individuals may be used to improve organizational policy or generate reporting, such as where the organization <b>106</b> is required to certify that is has achieved certain training scores or levels of compliance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The plurality of algorithms employed by the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> of the risk management service <b>100</b> may access input data <b>110</b> and metadata <b>164</b> from the organizational database <b>154</b>, which may comprise a very large number of database records. The present invention contemplates a structure for this database <b>154</b> that enables an efficient response to queries for the information stored therein. Additionally, the algorithms may employ may different techniques for evaluating such large amounts of information and modeling or simulating outcomes therefrom.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The plurality of algorithms may also be configured to request and retrieve information from the database <b>154</b> on a frequent or continual basis where needed to account for information that is highly dynamic, such as geolocation of mobile devices <b>139</b>, to provide relevant and current results. Algorithms must therefore be flexible as to when and how often to retrieve information to perform the various data processing functions described herein. Additionally, algorithms must be flexible to accommodate changes in the one or more rules <b>172</b> applied by the rules engine <b>170</b> and system manager <b>160</b>, as such rules <b>172</b> be arbitrarily defined and/or modified. For example, the definition of a geographic &#x201c;area of interest&#x201d; may change frequently, and the algorithms must include structures to accommodate these definitions and changes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Algorithms must also be configured for consistency. The information used by the algorithms may be internally inconsistent. For example, there may be conflicting inputs from different users <b>102</b>. The algorithms applied by the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may therefore utilize an approach such as hierarchical weighting for resolving inconsistencies at least as to the input data <b>110</b>. Still further, the plurality of algorithms may be configured to determine trends over long periods of time relative to a specific event or response, and may apply weights or biases to certain types of input data <b>110</b> or metadata <b>164</b> for modeling such trends.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As noted above, the risk assessment and mitigation platform both receives messages <b>104</b> from external systems <b>105</b> containing input data <b>110</b>, and sends event relays <b>193</b> to external systems <b>196</b> as output data <b>190</b>. There are many examples of external systems <b>105</b> and <b>196</b> in the present invention; in one such example, such a system performs access control, such as for building security, badge or keycard authorization, managing door locks and cameras, etc. The messaging and event relay aspects are extensions of the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> to such external systems <b>105</b> and <b>196</b>, such that the present invention has the capability of extending to many different types of external system <b>105</b> and. Any type of external system <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> is contemplated as an extension of the present invention, regardless of whether it is a proprietary system or that of a third party or parties, and regardless of whether it incoming or outbound, or both.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Where the present invention extends to an external system <b>105</b> and <b>196</b> such as one performing access control, it should be understood that many aspects of integration of such systems must be considered in order to effectively extend the present invention to achieve the desired functionality. It should be further understood that many implementations of such exemplary access control are possible.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, when an event occurs within an organization <b>106</b> implementing the risk management service <b>100</b>, the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may push that to an external system <b>105</b> or <b>196</b> via an event relay <b>193</b>, e.g. to notify of the event. That access control system can display the alert, or turn on a camera, or lock down a door, etc., based on how the event relay is configured (such as whether it is an instruction to initiate a textual or oral alert, or an instruction to a device such as a camera or door to perform a specific action.) Conversely, when an event occurs within an external system <b>105</b> itself that is coupled to the risk management service <b>100</b> for an organization, then that external system <b>105</b> calls an inbound API <b>152</b> to notify the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> of an external event. For example, where the risk management service <b>100</b> receives a &#x201c;door forced open&#x201d; alert, the present invention may initiate different types of responsive event relays <b>193</b>. In such an example, respective tenant stakeholders may be notified, a task may be assigned to some registered organizational user <b>102</b>, or a command may be forwarded to a public address system.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Event relays <b>193</b> in the present invention are configured by a system user, for example via the user interface and management portal <b>200</b> and support tool configured therewith, based on their organizational needs. It is to be understood therefore that an organizational system user may define a type of event that, when it occurs, is to be analyzed and used to define an organizational risk <b>162</b>, and further whether a response in some form is to be generated and relayed, as well as what type of event relay <b>193</b> should be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, types of events triggering an event relay <b>193</b> may be both user-centric and external (for example, a weather event or the access control issue described above). User-centric events may include a message <b>103</b> that the user <b>102</b> is in danger or in panic, the user <b>102</b> is in need of support, the user <b>102</b> wants to report something they saw, the user <b>102</b> checked in to work, or the user <b>102</b> wants to or has accessed a building.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Types of responsive event relays <b>193</b> may include sending a push notification to organizational individuals <b>195</b>, assigning a task to specific organizational individuals <b>195</b>, sending an email or text (both intra-organizational and extra-organizational), sending a command to an external system <b>196</b>, and sending a notification to an external system <b>196</b>. It is to be understood that many types of events and responsive event relays <b>193</b> are possible and within the scope of the present invention, and therefore the present invention is not to be limited to any one type of event or type of event relay <b>193</b> described herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are further diagrams illustrating the various aspects of the risk management service <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, inbound information that is internal to the organization <b>106</b> is provided within mobile messages <b>103</b>, and inbound information that is external to the organization <b>106</b> is provided within external messages <b>104</b>. Mobile messages <b>103</b> are generated using mobile applications <b>138</b> configured with mobile devices <b>139</b> and associated with registered organizational users <b>102</b>. Individual risk and action information <b>111</b> in messages <b>102</b> may be either manually initiated or automatically initiated, and represents information such as mobile alerts, reports and eyewitness accounts of events, requests for support or assistance, monitor or panic signals, survey broadcasts (and responses thereto) and facilities access requests on behalf of the registered organizational users <b>102</b>. Other information includes reports or alerts by organizational users <b>102</b> of trespassers or intruders, smoke from tobacco or vaping products, or compliance/lack of compliance with particular procedures. Other types of individual risk and action information <b>111</b> may also be provided in the mobile messages <b>103</b>, and therefore the present invention is not to be limited to any one type of information, or content of a message <b>102</b>, described herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, inbound information may be related to public health issues, for example where state or federal authorities have implemented directions or guidelines aimed at protecting public health in a public health emergency, and/or imposed a duty of care on organizations to comply with such directions or guidelines. A mobile alert, report or notification may be provided in such an example by registered organizational users <b>102</b> that reflects a user's temperature, and compliance with procedures for having a temperature taken, as well as for other on-the-spot testing and compliance with testing protocols. Users <b>102</b> may also report compliance or lack of compliance with directions or guidelines to ensure that proper policies and procedures are followed, for example for risk mitigation and improving adherence to such directions and guidelines.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">External messages <b>104</b> are generated by external systems <b>105</b> as noted above. These may include facilities management information, or alerts or notifications about weather events, news bulletins that contain information relevant to the organization <b>106</b>, its location, or its facilities, detected instructions, failed access requests, motion detection, facial recognition failure, or other active emergency such as reported gunfire, an unauthorized weapon present, or an active shooter. As with individual risk and action information <b>111</b>, other types of external event information <b>120</b> may also be provided in the external messages <b>104</b>, and therefore the present invention is not to be limited to any one type of information, or content of a message, described herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Messaging in the risk management service <b>100</b> may be controlled by the message manager <b>180</b>, together with one or both of the private mobile messaging system <b>136</b>, or the inbound application programming interfaces (APIs) <b>152</b>. The private mobile messaging system <b>136</b> may itself be controlled by the message manager <b>180</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, messaging within the organization itself is handled by the message manager <b>180</b> via the private mobile messaging system <b>136</b>, while messaging outside of the organization is handled via the APIs <b>152</b>. The inbound APIs <b>152</b> may be utilized for ingesting both mobile messages <b>103</b> and external messages <b>104</b>. Regardless, these messages <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> carry the input data <b>110</b> which is used in the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> to perform the various functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> manages these inbound APIs <b>152</b> in a cloud-based environment. API services, event and system management, and event relay services are all performed within such a cloud-based environment. In addition to enabling inbound mobile messages <b>103</b> and external messages <b>104</b>, these APIs <b>152</b> may also communicate with mobile clients <b>137</b> and external systems <b>105</b> to request event data, and may also be configured to perform initial processing that makes preliminary decisions based on the mobile messages <b>103</b> and external messages <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Event and system management may include functions such as logging all events that occur, aggregating and analyzing metadata to evaluate events and define a risk to the organization, and applying rules to address the defined risk, initiate responses to organizational users, and initiate instructions to communicate event relays. Event and system management may be performed by one or more of the system manager <b>160</b>, the rules engine <b>170</b>, and the message manager <b>180</b>, and the specific functions performed within the event and system management aspect are further performed within the plurality of algorithms described herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Event relay services include notifying people or systems of events and instructions for responsive actions to those events. This aspect of the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may also assign responsibility for various follow-on actions, and provide notifications or commands to organizational users via mobile applications. Notifications and commands may also be generated for external systems <b>196</b> or affected organizational individuals <b>195</b> that are external to the organization <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may further include providing one or more user interfaces <b>200</b> that enable access to system functions through a management portal. A system user may utilize the management portal, via user interface <b>200</b>, to configure various aspects of system functionality, such as monitoring or tracking events, people, and reports, configuring, viewing, or adjusting related maps that illustrate events or organizational facilities, and configuring and tracking survey broadcasts and task assignments.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The management portal and user interfaces may be provided as part of a user support tool that allows users to configure this functionality within the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> and risk management service <b>100</b>, and settings for the performance of this functionality. This may be done using a display on a graphical user interface, and/or via web-based or application-based modules. Tools and pull-down menus on such a display (or in web-based or application-based modules) may also be provided to customize these functionalities and monitor performance within the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> and risk management service <b>100</b>. Users may access the support tool, management portal, and user interface <b>200</b> using desktop, laptop, mobile, and mainframe computing systems, as well as applications resident on such systems, and on mobile telephony, tablet, or wearable computing devices.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Outbound information that is both internal and external to the organization <b>106</b> is conveyed within trusted messages <b>196</b>. Outbound information is communicated via event relays <b>193</b> in mobile messages <b>196</b> that are generated by the message manager <b>180</b>, the private mobile messaging system <b>136</b>, or both, and are sent to mobile clients <b>137</b> on their mobile devices <b>139</b> using mobile applications <b>138</b>, and associated with registered organizational individuals <b>196</b>. These may include notifications, commands, alerts, task or responder assignments, surveys of mobile devices, or actionable forms that users can engage with to response to messages, acknowledge receipt, or comply with policies or procedures. Outbound information may also sent in event relays <b>196</b> communicated directly to organizational facilities, or systems controlling facilities, for example lockdown or open commands, such as where doors are capable of being remotely opened and closed by control systems in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment without human involvement. In such an example, the risk management and assessment platform <b>140</b> may generate an event relay to facilities comprised of an instruction to open or close particular doors automatically in response to a particular threat, or lock down some or all of an organizational facility.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Events relays <b>193</b> of outbound information may also be sent to external systems <b>196</b> or external individuals <b>195</b> via messages <b>194</b>. This may also include facilities management information, for example where facilities are outside the control of the organization itself. This may include activating nearest cameras or video equipment, initiating a facility lockdown, initiating a marquee strobe to broadcast a message, initiating and facilitating two-way radio communications, providing a public address, and sending emails, texts, or other messages, through either Internet-based or mobile network-based platforms.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process <b>400</b> for performing the risk management service <b>100</b> of the present invention. The process <b>400</b> begins at step <b>410</b> by receiving input data <b>110</b> in mobile messages <b>103</b>, for example from mobile clients <b>137</b> associated with organizational users <b>102</b>, and external messages <b>104</b> from external systems <b>105</b>, relating to a risk or potential risk to an organization <b>106</b>. At step <b>420</b>, the process <b>400</b> identifies and defines the risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>, by analyzing individual risk and action information <b>111</b>, external event information <b>120</b>, and facilities information <b>128</b> transmitted in the mobile messages <b>103</b>, external messages <b>104</b>, and in any other format for conveying relevant information.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">This is accomplished by performing one or more algorithms on the input data <b>110</b>, by applying mathematical models, processes, formulas or functions to analyze the information contained therein as discussed above. At steps <b>430</b>, the one or more algorithms performed in the process <b>400</b> fuse the individual risk and action information <b>111</b>, external event information <b>120</b>, and facilities information <b>128</b>, and at step <b>440</b> message metadata <b>164</b> is extracted and analyzed to identify overlap in the information therein, and to discern additional event-related information. For example, metadata <b>164</b> is analyzed to correlate a proximity of a reported event to one or more of an organizational user <b>102</b> or an organizational facility. Many types of analytics of such metadata <b>164</b> are possible, as noted above, and are within the scope of the present invention. Additionally, many types of mathematical processing may be performed on such metadata <b>164</b> to discern the information needed to satisfy the particular objectives for which the risk management service <b>100</b> has been implemented by each organization, and are also within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As noted above, messages within the risk management service <b>100</b> include specific metadata <b>164</b>, which is information that not directly supplied by organizational users <b>102</b>, external systems <b>105</b>, or facilities; instead, this information is further descriptive of the input data <b>110</b>. This metadata <b>164</b> may include globally-unique identifiers for each message, and identify the source, type, time, date, and related messages, location, status, and any other descriptive information or characteristics that can aid in subsequent mathematical analyses and processes applied to the input data <b>110</b> to define risk <b>162</b> and perform the various objectives of the risk management service <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>450</b>, the process <b>400</b> applies one or more rules <b>172</b> to processed metadata <b>164</b> to both identify affected organizational users <b>102</b> and affected organizational facilities, and formulate action requests <b>182</b> based on defined protocols for compliance with organizational policies and procedures. These action requests <b>182</b> represent an organizational response <b>186</b> to the defined risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>, and may be translated in a number of different wants to ensure that a duty of care is realized and ensure compliance and mitigation of such risk <b>162</b>. For example, action requests <b>182</b> may be applied as a broadcast survey <b>184</b> as noted in step <b>460</b> to affected organizational users <b>102</b>, and the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may invoke the private mobile messaging system <b>136</b> for carrying out the broadcast survey <b>182</b> by communicating messages to affected organizational users <b>102</b>, and any affected external individuals as well.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">At step <b>470</b>, the process <b>400</b> assesses a state of the defined risk <b>162</b> based on responses <b>186</b> received to the action requests <b>182</b>. This subsequent information is used to determine the status of the affected organizational users <b>102</b> and affected organizational facilities. Such responses <b>186</b> may be communicated to the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> via the private mobile messaging system <b>136</b> and/or the message manager <b>180</b> and/or via the outbound APIs <b>156</b>, and this may again involve an analysis of metadata <b>164</b>. At step <b>480</b>, the process <b>400</b> determines the compliance with organizational policies and procedures based on analytics applied to the responses <b>186</b> to action requests <b>182</b>, and determines any further action needed to respond to and/or address the defined risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>. At step <b>490</b>, the process <b>400</b> either takes further action, or pushes one or more event relays <b>193</b> to the affected organizational users <b>195</b> and/or external systems <b>196</b> to provide further communications such as notifications, alerts, commands, surveys, task assignments, actionable forms, and any other information needed to meet the particular organizational objectives for implementing the risk management service <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may include, as noted above, a private mobile messaging system (PMMS) <b>136</b> that acts as a trusted messaging service, for example between system clients <b>135</b> and the system manager <b>160</b> for trusted mobile messages <b>103</b>. Trusted mobile messages <b>103</b> are private messages between the system manager <b>160</b> of the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>, and some or all of its registered system clients <b>135</b>, which manage one or more mobile clients <b>137</b>. These private messages are not preserved on the mobile devices <b>139</b> of users <b>102</b>, and cannot be forwarded or transferred from the mobile devices <b>139</b> to any recipient other than the system manager <b>160</b>. The association between registered mobile devices <b>139</b> and the organization's personnel is typically provided by the operating system of the mobile devices <b>139</b>, but may be supplemented by use of a personal identification number (PIN) known only by the individual associated with the mobile device <b>139</b> in the registration process. Trusted mobile messages <b>103</b> are also secure, as all messaging in the PMMS <b>136</b> is encrypted.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Trusted mobile messages <b>103</b> are also authentic. This is because all messages from system clients <b>135</b> are originated by responsible a system manager(s) <b>160</b> of the organization, while all message content provided externally is controlled by the relevant inbound API <b>152</b> for such external systems <b>105</b>, such that origination of those messages is controlled by those APIs <b>152</b> only. Trusted external messages <b>104</b> are further curated by responsible system managers <b>160</b> before incorporation into the service's messaging. Further, all message content from system clients <b>135</b> only comes from those personal mobile devices <b>139</b> that have been registered with the risk management service <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">All information within the PMMS <b>136</b> is preserved in the secure, cloud-based database <b>154</b>, with access limited to the organization's system manager(s) <b>160</b>. This permits the organization <b>106</b> to certify its adherence to policies and procedures to preserve the privacy and security of the information contained in the trusted messages <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. System managers <b>160</b> are only permitted to analyze, summarize, or distribute data products derived from this information as permitted by the organization's policies and procedures. No system clients <b>135</b> have access to this information except as provided by the system manager <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Examples of a private mobile messaging system may be further found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,812,607 and 9,705,841.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The risk management service <b>100</b> also provides, in another embodiment of the present invention, an audit trail and risk/litigation mitigation function to help organizations <b>106</b> comply with policies and procedures, and legal and regulatory requirements, in a timely and comprehensive manner. As noted above, the audit manager <b>210</b> may be configured to maintain an audit trail and carry out mitigation functions, for example to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as early as possible.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Auditing and mitigation functions in the risk management service <b>100</b> of the present invention leverage the private, managed network aspect that connects the organization's employees, and may include a dashboard, for example configured with the user interface <b>200</b>, that tracks and stores all organizational actions and displays them to relevant system users and affected organizational users <b>102</b>. Using such a dashboard, a manager tasked with responsibility for auditing, compliance and mitigation may, when faced with a litigation sensitive event (e.g., an injury, a dismissal, a retaliation claim), enter that event into the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>. The rules engine <b>170</b> may then be applied to examine the type of event that was entered and the organizational user that made the entry, and apply one or more rules <b>172</b> to determine who should be informed of the event and who has access to the information. The manager's responsive actions may be tracked and displayed via the dashboard, which may have controlled access to minimize the possibility of tampering or data corruption.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Through functions such as auditing and mitigation, and generally due to the cloud-based structure that monitors registered organizational users <b>102</b> network-wide within an organization <b>106</b>, the risk management service <b>100</b> maintains management control of every important event that occurs within its purview, and which represents a defined risk <b>162</b> faced by the organization <b>106</b>. Auditing and mitigation further ensures that all action requests <b>182</b>, surveys, <b>184</b>, and responses <b>186</b> to such requests <b>182</b> or surveys <b>184</b> or both, and other event relays <b>193</b>, re timely, and that there is an audit trail maintained for all actions taken. Aspects such as the dashboard may allow an event to be kept open until all the required responses are completed and the one or more rules governing responses to defined risks <b>162</b> have been satisfied. Even after an event is closed, the present invention may maintain and store an audit trail of the organization's actions and outcomes thereof for future uses.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Auditing and mitigation functions may further enable particular service features, such as for example a special employee network that is designed to empower registered organizational users <b>102</b> to report important complaints such as discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation complaints. In such an embodiment, the special employee network is designed to ensure privacy and protect users' personally identifiable information. In such a scenario, the organization <b>106</b> may designate someone internal (or a neutral third party outside the organization) as a compliance officer, who's task is to investigate any employee complaints. Each employee within such a network may have a private connection to that compliance officer, and any employee complaint goes only to the designated compliance officer. This private connection to the organization <b>106</b> can also be used by employees to report any organizational activities that the employee believes to be illegal, unethical, or not correct. This enables the organization <b>106</b> to address any whistleblower inputs as quickly as possible.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Other particular service features within the auditing and mitigation functions may include discrimination and harassment minimization, to protect both employees and customers, employment law issues such as wage law violations, immigration. audits, breach of contract situations, intellectual property violations, equal opportunity violation allegations, and unsafe workplace allegations. The auditing and mitigation functions may also be applied in many other possible use case scenarios.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Organizations <b>106</b> may also implement specific risk mitigation systems and integrate such systems, externally controlled or otherwise, within the risk management service <b>100</b>. Common risk mitigation systems include electronic security systems, video surveillance systems, data network security systems, and any other special-purpose systems to meet unique organizational needs.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Electronic security systems are systems primarily focused on ensuring the security and safety of organizational assets when those assets are present within the organization's facilities. These systems include, for example, access control, intrusion detection, and fire detection. Such systems are typically connected to local and, in some cases, wide-area networks that are often dedicated to security functions. They often depend upon dedicated monitoring, either by the organization <b>106</b> itself, or by third-party services and may also include additional, internal functionality such as significant reporting capabilities that can provide forensic utility.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Video surveillance systems provide substantial forensic utility and, particularly when coupled with real-time image analysis, significant support for human asset safety and security. Widespread availability of camera and video systems, and the wide availability of IP connectivity for these devices, means that such systems can be implemented with sufficient density to provide a high degree of coverage for an organization's facilities.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Data security is another area of significant risk for organizations <b>106</b>. Network security is provided in the risk management service <b>100</b> in a mature set of network monitoring, network intrusion detection, and network traffic analysis systems. Because the timelines associated with network security threats are so short, these systems provide extensive real-time analysis, monitoring, and mitigation capabilities.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b>, one or more of the system manager <b>160</b>, the rules engine <b>170</b>, and the message manager <b>180</b> may include or access a machine learning modeling layer that is comprised of one or more neural networks that further evaluate the input data <b>110</b> to increase accuracy in the algorithms therein. These one or more neural networks are tuned to adjust the aggregation and integration of input data <b>110</b> and analysis thereof to define a specific risk faced by the organization, determine how to address the defined risk <b>162</b>, and improve the overall performance of the risk management service <b>100</b>. The present invention therefore contemplates that one or more techniques of artificial intelligence may be applied to the data processing and mathematical functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">There are many types of neural networks, which are computing systems that &#x201c;learn&#x201d; to perform tasks without being programmed with task-specific rules, based on examples. Neural networks generally are based on arrays of connected, aggregated nodes (or, &#x201c;neurons&#x201d;) which are computational units that transmit signals to each other in multiple layers over connections. Connections are activation or transfer functions that &#x201c;fire&#x201d; these nodes and combine inputs according to mathematical equations or formulas. Different types of neural networks generally have different configurations of these layers of connected, aggregated nodes, but they can generally be described as an input layer, a middle or &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; layer, and an output layer. These layers may perform different transformations on their various inputs, using different mathematical calculations or functions. Signals travel between these layers, from the input layer to the output layer via the middle layer, may traverse layers, and nodes, multiple times.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Signals are transmitted between nodes over connections, and the output of each node is calculated in a non-linear function that sums all of the inputs to that node. Weight matrices and biases are typically applied to each node, and each connection, and these weights and biases are adjusted as the neural network processes inputs and transmits them across the nodes and connections. These weights represent increases or decreases in the strength of a signal at a particular connection. Additionally, nodes may have a threshold, such that a signal is sent only if the aggregated output at that node crosses that threshold. Weights generally represent how long an activation function takes, while biases represent when, in time, such a function starts; together, they help gradients minimize over time. At least in the case of weights, they can be initialized and change (i.e. decay) over time, as a system learns what weights should be, and how they should be adjusted. In other words, neural networks evolve as they learn, and the mathematical formulas and functions that comprise neural networks design can change over time as a system improves itself.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A machine learning modeling layer comprised of one or more neural networks may be applied in the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> by analyzing the overlap in the metadata <b>164</b> between the individual risk and action information <b>111</b> and the external event information <b>120</b> to calculate weights and biases for the mathematical functions used to process inputs and assign values to each node thereof. The weights and biases may also assigned within the various layers (or, nodes and connections) of the one or more neural networks, and adjusted as individual risk and action information <b>111</b> for each organizational user <b>102</b> is processed, and as further information (such as facilities information <b>128</b>) is identified. Many examples of such an application are possible. For example, where messages <b>103</b> or <b>104</b> are sent with common language that indicates classification as raising a particular issues, the machine learning modeling layer may be applied to model potential responses to survey broadcasts <b>184</b> based on simulated or predicted movement or responses of the affected organizational users <b>102</b> or predicted status of organizational facilities. Those potential responses may then be compared with actual responses <b>186</b>, for example movement of affected organizational users <b>102</b> based on geo-location signals transmitted by their associated mobile devices <b>139</b>, and further actions can be decided upon accordingly.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented in many different computing environments <b>130</b>. For example, the risk assessment and mitigation platform <b>140</b> may be implemented in conjunction with a special purpose computer, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit element(s), an ASIC or other integrated circuit, a digital signal processor, electronic or logic circuitry such as discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device or gate array such as a PLD, PLA, FPGA, PAL, and any comparable means.

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Accordingly, many alterations, modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings, may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the present invention may apply additional machine learning techniques, and/or other models, to evaluate input data <b>110</b> and metadata <b>164</b>. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description. For example, notwithstanding the fact that the elements of a claim are set forth below in a certain combination, it must be expressly understood that the invention includes other combinations of fewer, more or different elements, which are disclosed in above even when not initially claimed in such combinations.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The words used in this specification to describe the invention and its various embodiments are to be understood not only in the sense of their commonly defined meanings, but to include by special definition in this specification structure, material or acts beyond the scope of the commonly defined meanings. Thus if an element can be understood in the context of this specification as including more than one meaning, then its use in a claim must be understood as being generic to all possible meanings supported by the specification and by the word itself.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The definitions of the words or elements of the following claims are, therefore, defined in this specification to include not only the combination of elements which are literally set forth, but all equivalent structure, material or acts for performing substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result. In this sense it is therefore contemplated that an equivalent substitution of two or more elements may be made for any one of the elements in the claims below or that a single element may be substituted for two or more elements in a claim. Although elements may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, it is to be expressly understood that one or more elements from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and that the claimed combination may be directed to a sub-combination or variation of a sub-combination.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Insubstantial changes from the claimed subject matter as viewed by a person with ordinary skill in the art, now known or later devised, are expressly contemplated as being equivalently within the scope of the claims. Therefore, obvious substitutions now or later known to one with ordinary skill in the art are defined to be within the scope of the defined elements.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The claims are thus to be understood to include what is specifically illustrated and described above, what is conceptually equivalent, what can be obviously substituted and also what essentially incorporates the essential idea of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
