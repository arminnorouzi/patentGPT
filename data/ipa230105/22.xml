One such application is in the field of hydroponics, where a common method of providing water to the plants or crops being grown is through a flood/drain system, which is also commonly referred to as an ebb/flow or a fill/drain system. For ease of understanding, the term flood/drain will be used throughout this specification.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unlike other hydroponic methods such as nutrient film technique or deep water culture where the roots of the plants being grown are constantly submerged in water, flood/drain systems leave the roots of the plants exposed to air. This allows the plants to be sufficiently oxygenated without the need to artificially oxygenate the water system. To provide the required water to the plants, flood/drain systems rely on a two phase system. In the first &#x201c;flood&#x201d; phase, a grow tray containing the plants is filled with liquid (water or a nutrient solution) to a predetermined height as quickly as possible. Once the &#x201c;flood&#x201d; phase is over, the &#x201c;drain&#x201d; phase begins, wherein water is quickly drained from the tray. The quick draining has the secondary effect of pulling oxygen towards the root structure as the water drains, further promoting healthy roots and oxygenation of these roots.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical flood/drain systems work by providing a reservoir or similar holding tank below the grow tray and using a pump to fill the tray through a flush-mounted port on the bottom of the grow tray. An overflow port is also provided in the grow tray to set the height to which the grow tray is filled to. This overflow port redirects excess water back to the reservoir. Once the pump is stopped, the remaining water in the grow tray returns through the flush-mounted port back to the reservoir, draining the tray. A timer is used to periodically turn on and off the pump, the frequency and duration of which are chosen depending on the plants being grown.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flood/drain systems are comparatively simpler and in many cases produce healthier plants than other hydroponic systems, and accordingly, they have been studied with some interest with a view to adapting or creating flood/drain systems for large scale or commercial use. A big hurdle however, in the development of these systems is that these larger scale hydroponic set-ups require a number of vertically stacked grow trays to achieve optimum space usage. These systems may also be referred to in the art as multi-tiered systems. Currently, flood/drain systems pose an issue as they require a number of plumbing connections between each vertically stacked tray, which adds to the complexity of the system as well as the difficulty in removing trays for harvesting etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similar problems exist in other non-vertically stacked operations where the grow trays are moved along conveyor belts or similar to maximize automation of the process. In these instances, the required connections to the reservoir make such a system unfeasible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention seeks to at least partially overcome these problems, enabling use of a flood/drain system on larger scale growing operations, in particular but not limited to those using grow trays that are vertically stacked and/or moved/transported by automated or semi-automated means such as through a conveyor belt, chain or rollers. The present invention may also be advantageous for other systems in which containers or irrigation channels require filling and draining.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first broad aspect, there is provided a valve assembly for allowing filling and draining of a container with a liquid, comprising: a filling catchment containing at least one opening for receiving liquid and at least one drainage orifice, the filling catchment being located within the container;

A holding tank or reservoir <b>103</b> is positioned under the grow trays <b>101</b> and includes a pump <b>104</b> and a conduit <b>105</b> which is connected to each grow tray. There is a check valve (not shown) between the conduit and each tray except the uppermost tray. This check valve prevents liquid from entering the tray from the conduit, as well as prevents liquid from leaving the tray while the pump is active due to the pressure exerted by the pump. Each grow tray is also provided with an overflow outlet <b>106</b> which is connected to the grow tray below, with the exception of the bottommost tray which is connected to the reservoir <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The flooding/draining of the grow trays <b>101</b> is carried out in this system through the following method. The pump <b>104</b> is turned on, conveying liquid from the reservoir <b>103</b> up through the conduit <b>105</b> as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The liquid is prevented from entering all but the uppermost tray by the check valves. The uppermost tray is filled to a predetermined height set by the height of the overflow outlet <b>106</b>. As liquid continues to enter the uppermost tray, it is directed through the overflow outlet into the tray below which then fills with liquid until the height set by the overflow outlet is reached, wherein liquid flows into the next tray, and so on until liquid returns to the reservoir via the overflow outlet of the bottommost tray. When the pump is turned off, liquid drains from each tray through the conduit, the check valves now allowing liquid to flow in the opposite direction, leaving each tray and returning to the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Such a system requires at least one connection between the conduit and each tray, if not a further connection between adjacent trays in the form of the overflow outlet. This limits the adaptability of the system, as the addition or removal of trays requires connecting or disconnecting trays from the conduit, and hinders the ability of a user to remove the trays for planting or harvesting. This is particularly a problem in larger scale operations where it may be advantageous to automate or semi-automate the planting/harvesting processes. In these operations, the ability of a user or autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicle to remove the tray and deliver it to a location for planting/harvesting by workers or machinery is complicated by the need to disconnect and reconnect these connections. Currently, this is only possible for nutrient film technique or deep water culture systems, which provide less healthy crops and reduced yield compared to those grown by flood/drain systems but which do not require these connections.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present invention seeks to provide a valve and associated system which overcomes these issues by providing a system wherein no direct connections are required between the growing trays. This is accomplished by the use of a novel valve assembly configured to fill a container while liquid is poured into it and drain the same container when liquid ceases to be poured into the assembly. This valve assembly may further convey liquid into the valve assembly of another container when draining to create a multi-tiered system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present disclosure will become better understood from the following examples of non-limiting embodiments.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a system <b>200</b> consisting of a series of four vertically arranged grow trays <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>204</b>. It will be understood that the number of trays is more or less arbitrary, and other embodiments may include more or fewer trays. The system also includes a reservoir, pump and conduit (not shown in this figure), and it will be understood that any known reservoir, pump and conduit combination may be used provided that the combination can convey liquid stored in the reservoir to a nozzle <b>205</b> or other suitable outlet located above the uppermost grow tray <b>201</b>. In some embodiments, the reservoir, pump and conduit may be substantially similar to those in existing systems (with any direct connections between the conduit and the trays removed), reducing the cost of converting an existing growing system.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each grow tray is provided with a valve assembly <b>206</b>, comprising a filling catchment <b>207</b> and a drainage outlet <b>208</b>. The drainage outlet is sized to fit into an opening in the grow tray so that liquid can pass out of the grow tray through the drainage outlet. The filling catchment in this embodiment has a plurality of drainage orifices or openings <b>210</b> which allow liquid to leave the filling catchment and enter the interior of the tray. Each grow tray also includes an overflow outlet <b>209</b> which sets a maximum height to which the grow tray may be filled.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system is in a state where the pump has been turned off and stopped conveying liquid through the nozzle <b>205</b>, following a previous phase where the liquid was passing through the nozzle <b>205</b> into the uppermost grow tray <b>201</b>. In this embodiment, water is envisioned as the liquid passing through the system. As a result, the filling catchment is empty as all water has left through the openings <b>210</b> into the interior of the grow tray. Because water is not flowing into the filling catchment, the filling catchment is in a first position where water can flow out of the grow tray through the drainage outlet <b>208</b> as shown in the figure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The water flowing out of the uppermost grow tray <b>201</b> through drainage outlet <b>208</b> is conveyed into the filling catchment <b>207</b> of the second tray <b>202</b>. As water continues to flow from the uppermost container <b>201</b> into the filling catchment, the filling catchment is moved into a second position preventing liquid from exiting the grow tray <b>202</b>. As shown in the figure, water is constantly draining from the openings <b>210</b> in the filling catchment of grow tray <b>202</b> such that when the uppermost grow tray <b>201</b> is drained of water and ceases to convey water to the valve assembly of grow tray <b>202</b>, the filling catchment of grow tray <b>202</b> will move to a first position and allow the second grow tray <b>202</b> to drain into the third grow tray <b>203</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows the situation wherein the second grow tray <b>202</b> has been filled to the maximum height allowed by the overflow outlet <b>209</b>. Excess water that passes into the overflow outlet is conveyed to the filling catchment of the third tray <b>203</b>, and begins to fill the third tray.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The valve assembly of the third tray <b>203</b> is moved into the second position by the flow of water from the overflow outlet of the second tray <b>202</b>. This prevents water from flowing out of the third tray which has begun to fill. As the water in the third tray has not reached the height set by the overflow outlet, no water has entered the fourth tray <b>204</b>, and accordingly the valve assembly within the fourth tray is in the first position. In this embodiment, the drainage outlet and overflow outlet of the fourth tray <b>204</b> convey water back to the reservoir. It will be understood that in other embodiments, the fourth tray may instead convey water to a fifth tray, or there may be only three trays, the third tray conveying water to the reservoir, or any other number of trays wherein the bottommost tray returns water to the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the overflow outlet <b>209</b> is able to be adjusted to define different maximum heights to which the grow trays can be filled. This may be accomplished by any known methods, such as providing a telescoping or extending mechanism within the body of the overflow outlet. This allows a user to optimize the flood/drain system in each tray for the particular crop being grown or the particular root system of the plants within the grow tray.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a valve assembly <b>300</b> according to the present invention in a first position. The valve assembly <b>300</b> includes a filling catchment <b>301</b> which has a large opening <b>302</b> in which water can be conveyed as well as smaller drainage orifices or openings <b>303</b> which allow water to drain from the filling catchment. In this embodiment, these openings drain into the container, however it will be understood that in other embodiments, the openings may drain out of the container while still allowing the assembly to function. The filling catchment of this embodiment has a frusto-conical shape with the top of the filling catchment, including the opening <b>302</b>, having a greater diameter than the bottom of the filling catchment. This maximizes the amount of water which can enter the filling catchment, while reducing size and encouraging draining through the smaller openings <b>303</b>. This embodiment of a valve assembly is adapted to be located within a container with at least an opening in a bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The valve assembly <b>300</b> also includes a plugging member in the form of a rod <b>304</b> and plug <b>307</b>. The plugging member is movable with the filling catchment. The plug <b>307</b> is located in a drainage chamber <b>305</b> which also includes an opening <b>309</b> into the drainage outlet <b>306</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the filling catchment is in a first position wherein liquid can pass into the drainage outlet <b>306</b> via opening <b>309</b>. A biasing member in the form of a spring <b>308</b> provides a force to bias the filling catchment into the first position unless a force is applied to the filling catchment in a direction substantially towards the opening <b>309</b>. In preferred embodiments, this force is balanced to be equal to or greater the force due to the weight of a volume of water within the filling catchment greater than the volume required to reach at least some of the smaller openings <b>303</b>, that is to say if there is insufficient water in the filling catchment to continue flowing out of the smaller openings, then the filling catchment moves to the first position. In this embodiment, the drainage chamber <b>305</b> is configured so that a bottom surface of the chamber contacts the bottom surface of the container in which the valve assembly is located, in a way that creates a watertight seal between the two surfaces. This only allows the flow of liquid out of the container through the drainage outlet <b>306</b> in the drainage chamber <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows the valve assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in a second position.

The first element in this embodiment is hemi-spherical in shape and is sized to fit into an opening <b>404</b> in the drainage chamber <b>401</b> to the drainage outlet <b>403</b>. The second element <b>407</b> is sized to be larger than the opening <b>404</b>. In this embodiment, the second element also has a flange around its circumference, and the opening <b>404</b> has a corresponding recess or lip which together provide a watertight seal when the plug is in the second position, as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> most clearly shows rod <b>408</b> which is fully extended out of the tube <b>405</b> in the second position, and the plugging member prevents any liquid from flowing through the opening <b>404</b> and thus leaving the container through the drainage outlet <b>403</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Side and top views of another embodiment of a valve assembly according to the present invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> respectively. This assembly <b>500</b> includes a filling catchment <b>501</b> connected to a plugging member <b>502</b> and an arm <b>503</b> connected to a pivot <b>504</b> at an opposing end to the filling catchment. Unlike the previous embodiments, the filling catchment in this embodiment is not in a frusto-conical shape but rather is shaped such that a lower internal surface proximate the location of plugging member <b>502</b> on the opposing side is provided at a distal end of the filling catchment to the pivot <b>504</b>. The internal side surfaces are sloped so that any liquid which enters the catchment is directed towards this lower surface. In this embodiment, a drainage orifice (not shown) is provided in the lower surface of the filling catchment. The plugging member is in the form of a partially frusto-conical rubber stopper in this embodiment. In preferred embodiments, the pivot may be in the form of protrusions on the arm <b>503</b> or catchment <b>501</b> which cooperate with corresponding recesses or openings in a base <b>506</b> to provide the pivoting function. It will be understood that in other embodiments, other known methods of providing a pivoting function may be used without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">This embodiment also includes an adjustable overflow outlet <b>505</b> which is located on the base <b>506</b> which also is connected to the pivot <b>504</b>. The base <b>506</b> can be attached to a container through any known methods, such as by screws or bolts. The adjustable overflow outlet <b>505</b> may be adjusted, for example, by the use of a castle nut. As in the previous embodiments, the overflow outlet acts to create a maximum height within the container for a liquid to fill to. A grate or mesh <b>507</b> is also provided in the filling catchment located over the drainage orifices to prevent any solids (such as soil particles) from blocking the drainage orifices.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A cross-sectional view of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> is shown in place in a container in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The assembly located within the container <b>601</b> comprises filling catchment <b>602</b>, plugging member <b>603</b>, overflow outlet <b>604</b>, pivot <b>605</b> and arm <b>606</b>. The overflow outlet <b>604</b> and pivot <b>605</b> are mounted on a base <b>609</b>. Drainage outlet <b>607</b> is also provided in the container <b>601</b>. The plugging member <b>603</b>, which is in this embodiment in the form of a partially frusto-conical shaped rubber stopper, has an internal channel <b>608</b> which is connected to a drainage orifice <b>609</b> located in a lower surface of the filling catchment <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> also includes an adjustable overflow outlet <b>604</b> which is located on base <b>609</b> which includes an internal overflow channel <b>610</b> in fluid communication with the overflow outlet at a first end <b>611</b> and an exterior of the container at a second end <b>612</b>. The first and second ends of the channel are offset such that liquid is conveyed towards the same location as the drainage outlet <b>607</b>. The base <b>609</b> in this embodiment is attached to the container <b>601</b> by means of screws <b>613</b>. It will be understood that in other embodiments, the base may be connected to the container by other methods, or integrated into the container itself. The cross-sectional view also shows that a mesh or grate <b>614</b> which is positioned over the drainage orifice <b>609</b> so that solids, for example soil particles or other contaminants, cannot cause the orifice to become clogged over repeated filling and draining processes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the pivot causes the filling catchment and the plugging member to be movable in an arc-like motion from a first &#x2018;upper&#x2019; position to a second &#x2018;lower&#x2019; position, wherein a drainage outlet in the container is sealed by the plugging member in the second position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows the plugging member <b>502</b> in a first position while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the plugging member <b>603</b> in a second position. A biasing member, for example a spring located under the arm, is provided to bias the filling catchment and plugging member into the first position unless a force is applied to overcome it. In preferred embodiments, the biasing member is in the form of a compression spring located at a distal end of the base to the pivot, though it will be understood that in other embodiments, other biasing means may be used instead. As in the other embodiments, the force required to move the filling catchment may be balanced against the weight of liquid within the filling catchment, such that the catchment moves from the first position to the second position when the catchment is partially or substantially filled with water. Additionally or alternatively, the force required to overcome the biasing member may be balanced against the force exerted by water entering the filling catchment from a height, preferably where the height is the distance between the drainage outlet of the container above and the filling catchment of the valve assembly.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">By arranging the assembly in this manner, the overall height of the valve can be reduced relative to the previous embodiment, allowing more containers to be fitted a system of equivalent volume. Further, assemblies with this reduced height may be retrofitted to existing systems which may have low clearance between containers. The arcuate motion of the plugging member may also act to reduce the chance of the filling catchment becoming stuck on the biasing member when the plugging member moves between positions relative to movements in a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Rather than the filling catchment containing a number of drainage orifices which convey liquid into the container as in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b></figref> include a single drainage orifice in a lower surface of the catchment, as well as an internal channel within the plugging member. Any liquid within the filling catchment in this embodiment is thus conveyed through this internal channel and out of the container.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thus, when liquid is poured into the filling catchment in this embodiment, the filling catchment and plugging member move to the second position where liquid cannot flow through the drainage outlet of the container. The drainage orifice and internal channel of the plugging member are sized to only allow a reduced flow of liquid relative to the drainage outlet, such as by providing the orifice and/or channel with a smaller diameter than the drainage outlet. As a result, liquid will leave the filling catchment far slower than liquid will enter the catchment, filling the catchment to the point it overflows and fills the container. Liquid will constantly drain at a slow rate from the drainage orifice and channel out of the filling catchment, preferably into the filling catchment of a second container or a reservoir for re-use. As the amount of liquid in the filling catchment decreases, the biasing member will act to bring the plugging member back into the first position, allowing the liquid that has filled the container to rapidly drain. The liquid can be directed into the filling catchment of a second container, repeating the process in a similar manner as described in respect to the previous embodiments. In some embodiments, the amount and rate of liquid conveyed through the drainage orifice may be insufficient to cause the plugging member of the second valve assembly to move, in other embodiments the flow of liquid may begin the flooding process for the second container prior to the draining process beginning in the first container.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As an example of a potential application for the aforementioned valve assemblies and systems, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a system for growing plants according to the present invention. System <b>700</b> consists of a housing <b>701</b>, in which two columns or stacks of vertically arranged grow trays <b>702</b> can be seen, as well as a reservoir <b>703</b> under each column. Not visible in this figure is a conduit that extends inside the wall of the housing <b>701</b> capable of conveying liquid from the reservoir to the uppermost grow tray, wherein a valve assembly as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> is located in each grow tray. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, one grow tray <b>702</b> has been removed from the system, showing the absence of any direct connections for channeling liquid in and out of the grow tray. The removal of the grow tray has left a space <b>704</b>. Such a space may include a drawer-like sliding mechanism or other method of allowing a tray to easily slide in and out of the column.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the embodiments above have been described in reference to vertically stacked growing trays, it will be appreciated that the valve assembly may be used in any sort of hydroponic operation where trays are removed/replaced for harvesting/planting. For instance, this valve may be particularly suited to operations which utilize a conveyor belt for easy harvesting, as no connections are required between a grow tray and a reservoir and a nozzle for dispensing water or other nutrient solution may be provided above the conveyor belt for supplying liquid to the grow trays.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some other embodiments, the valve assembly may be particularly suited for use as part of a modular hydroponic system where more trays can easily be added to the system without requiring the additional trays to be connected to any form of conduit.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the foregoing description of certain embodiments, specific terminology has been resorted to for the sake of clarity.
