That is, the condenser <b>122</b> is connected to the fluid storage tank <b>121</b> through the supply line <b>128</b>, and pressurizes the low-temperature CO<sub>2 </sub>supplied from the fluid storage tank <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pump <b>123</b> is disposed at a rear end of the condenser <b>122</b>, and is connected to the condenser <b>122</b> through the supply line <b>128</b>. The pump <b>123</b> serves to provide driving force for supplying fluid to the drying chamber <b>140</b>.

The filter <b>126</b> serves to remove foreign substances from the fluid supplied to the drying chamber <b>140</b>, so that pure fluid from which the foreign substances are removed is supplied to the drying chamber <b>140</b>. As an example, the filter <b>126</b> may be installed in the supply line <b>128</b> to be disposed at a rear end of the fluid storage tank <b>121</b>, the pump <b>123</b>, and the heater <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A valve <b>127</b> is installed in the supply line <b>128</b> and may be provided in plural. As an example, the valve <b>127</b> may be disposed between the fluid storage tank <b>121</b> and the condenser <b>122</b>, between the pump <b>123</b> and the reservoir tank <b>124</b>, between the reservoir tank <b>124</b> and the heater <b>125</b>, and between the heater <b>125</b> and the drying chamber <b>140</b>, respectively.

In addition, the drying chamber <b>140</b> may be provided with a fixed installation table (not shown) on which the developed wafer is mounted. When the wafer is dried, the drying chamber <b>140</b> is sealed from the outside. Meanwhile, the supercritical fluid is sufficiently mixed with the developer and then discharged from the drying chamber <b>140</b> through a main exhaust line <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Meanwhile, supercritical fluid refers to a state of matter existing at a temperature and pressure above a critical point at which liquid and gas are separated.

As an example, a main valve <b>151</b> may be installed in the main exhaust line <b>150</b>, and exhaustion through the main exhaust line <b>150</b> or an auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> to be described later may be performed through opening and closing of the main valve <b>151</b>. Meanwhile, the supercritical fluid exhausted from the drying chamber <b>140</b> may be exhausted through the main exhaust line <b>150</b> down to a first pressure, and pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> at this time may be in a high pressure state of 80 bar or more. Meanwhile, the first pressure may have a value within a range of 20 bar to 80 bar, for example.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The auxiliary exhaust unit <b>160</b> increases exhaust velocity of the supercritical fluid exhausted from the drying chamber <b>140</b>. As an example, the auxiliary exhaust unit <b>160</b> includes an auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b>, a negative pressure tank <b>162</b>, a first valve <b>163</b><i>a</i>, a second valve <b>163</b><i>b</i>, a pipe <b>164</b> for forming negative pressure, and a pump <b>165</b> for forming negative pressure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> is connected to the main exhaust line <b>150</b>. The auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> provides a flow path for exhausting the supercritical fluid at a pressure equal to or lower than the first pressure when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than the first pressure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The negative pressure tank <b>162</b> is installed in the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b>, and communicates with the drying chamber <b>140</b> when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than the first pressure. Accordingly, a difference in pressure between the drying chamber <b>140</b> and the negative pressure tank <b>162</b> is greater than a difference in pressure between the drying chamber <b>140</b> and atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, even when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is lower than the first pressure, an exhaust velocity of the supercritical fluid from the drying chamber <b>140</b> may be greater. Meanwhile, the negative pressure tank <b>162</b> may maintain a closed state by opening the main valve <b>151</b> and closing the first valve <b>163</b><i>a </i>and the second valve <b>163</b><i>b </i>when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is greater than the first pressure. Thereafter, when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than the first pressure, the main valve <b>151</b> is closed and the first valve <b>163</b><i>a </i>and the second valve <b>163</b><i>b </i>are opened, and the negative pressure tank <b>162</b> and the drying chamber <b>140</b> communicate with each other. Accordingly, supercritical fluid is exhausted through the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first valve <b>163</b><i>a </i>is installed in the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> to be disposed at a front end of the negative pressure tank <b>162</b>, and the second valve <b>163</b><i>b </i>is installed in the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> to be disposed at a rear end of the negative pressure tank <b>162</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is greater than the first pressure, the main valve <b>151</b> installed in the main exhaust line <b>150</b> is opened so that the supercritical fluid is exhausted only through the main exhaust line <b>150</b>. Thereafter, when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than the first pressure, the main valve <b>151</b> installed in the main exhaust line <b>150</b> is closed, and the first valve <b>163</b><i>a </i>and the second valve <b>163</b><i>b </i>installed in the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> are opened so that the supercritical fluid is exhausted only through the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Meanwhile, when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than a second pressure, the main valve <b>151</b> installed in the main exhaust line <b>150</b> is opened and the first valve <b>163</b><i>a </i>and the second valve <b>163</b><i>b </i>installed in the auxiliary exhaust line <b>161</b> are closed to prevent the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> from being in a negative pressure state. Accordingly, exhausting from the drying chamber <b>140</b> is made only through the main exhaust line <b>150</b>. In this case, exhaustion from the drying chamber <b>140</b> is performed by a difference in pressure between the drying chamber <b>140</b> and atmospheric pressure. Meanwhile, the second pressure may be higher than approximately atmospheric pressure and may have a value of 2 bar or less. Hereinafter, the exhaustion performed by the pressure difference between the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> and the atmospheric pressure is referred to as natural exhaust.

Thereafter, a developer remaining on a wafer is dried by the supercritical fluid in a state in which the drying chamber is closed (S<b>120</b>). Thereafter, when the drying of the developer is completed, the supercritical fluid is exhausted from the drying chamber (S<b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, supercritical fluid is exhausted from a drying chamber until internal pressure of the drying chamber decreases to a first pressure (S<b>132</b>). In other words, the method for drying a wafer includes a first exhaust step for exhausting supercritical fluid from the drying chamber until the internal pressure of the drying chamber decreases to the first pressure.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the first exhaust step may include a 1-1 exhaust step S<b>132</b>-<b>1</b> in which the exhaust of the supercritical fluid from the drying chamber is performed until the internal pressure of the drying chamber decreases to a third pressure (greater than the first pressure) through natural exhaust, and a 1-2 exhaust step in which the supercritical fluid is exhausted by a pressure difference between a main negative pressure tank and the drying chamber while the internal pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or less than the third pressure and greater than the first pressure.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto, and the first exhaust step may not include the 1-1 exhaust step and the 1-2 exhaust step, and the supercritical fluid may be exhausted only through natural exhaust until the internal pressure of the drying chamber decreases to the first pressure. Meanwhile, the third pressure may have a value of approximately 80 bar to 100 bar.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Thereafter, a second exhaust step of exhausting the supercritical fluid from the drying chamber through the auxiliary exhaust unit when the internal pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than the first pressure may be performed (S<b>134</b>). Looking at this in more detail, when the pressure of the drying chamber decreases to the first pressure, a main valve installed in the main exhaust line is closed, and the first and second valves installed in the auxiliary exhaust line are opened, such that the supercritical fluid is exhausted through a negative pressure tank or orifice portion installed in the auxiliary exhaust line. Alternatively, when the pressure of the drying chamber decreases to the first pressure, the main valve installed in the main exhaust line is closed, and the first and second valves installed in the auxiliary exhaust line are opened, so that exhausting of the drying chamber is performed by an auxiliary exhaust pump of the auxiliary exhaust unit.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this case, the supercritical fluid may be discharged from the drying chamber by a pressure difference between the internal pressure of the drying chamber and the negative pressure formed by the negative pressure tank or the orifice portion of the auxiliary exhaust unit. Alternatively, the exhaust of the supercritical fluid from the drying chamber may be accomplished by an auxiliary exhaust pump of the auxiliary exhaust unit. Accordingly, the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid may be shortened by exhausting the supercritical fluid from the drying chamber through the auxiliary exhaust unit compared to the case of exhausting the supercritical fluid by natural exhaust through the difference in pressure between atmospheric pressure and the drying chamber.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Meanwhile, looking at this in more detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it can be seen that when the supercritical fluid is continuously exhausted through the main exhaust line when the pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than a first pressure P1, the exhaust time takes approximately 60 s. However, it can be seen that when the supercritical fluid is exhausted through the auxiliary exhaust line of the auxiliary exhaust line, the exhaust time takes approximately 15 s. In other words, it can be seen that when the supercritical fluid is exhausted from the drying chamber using the difference in pressure between the negative pressure tank of the auxiliary exhaust unit and the drying chamber, the exhaust time is reduced.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it can be seen that a ratio (slope) of a pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber <b>140</b> to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid, when the supercritical fluid is continuously exhausted through the main exhaust line when the pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than a first pressure, has an absolute value smaller than an absolute value of a ratio (slope) of a pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber <b>140</b> to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid when the supercritical fluid is exhausted through the auxiliary exhaust line of the auxiliary exhaust unit, when the pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than a first pressure P1.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">However, when the pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than the first pressure, the ratio (slope) of the pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid is not limited to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, when the first pressure P1 is 80 bar, when a section in which the pressure of the drying chamber is from 80 bar to 20 bar is referred to as a first section, and a section in which the pressure of the drying chamber is 20 bar or less, is referred to as a second section, the ratio (slope) of the pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid at the first section may have an absolute value within a range of 0.75 to 9.0 bar/sec, and the ratio (slope) of the pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid at the second section may have an absolute value within a range of 0.95 to 2 bar/sec. Accordingly, the ratio (slope) of the pressure reduction amount of the drying chamber to the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid at the first pressure P1 or less may have an absolute value within a range of 0.75 to 9.0 bar/sec.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, when the pressure of the drying chamber <b>140</b> is equal to or lower than the first pressure P1, the exhaust time of the supercritical fluid may have a value within a range of 10 s to 50 s.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thereafter, when the internal pressure of the drying chamber is equal to or lower than a second pressure, a third exhaust step of exhausting supercritical fluid from the drying chamber by natural exhaust may be performed (S<b>136</b>). Accordingly, it is possible to prevent negative pressure from being formed in the drying chamber.
