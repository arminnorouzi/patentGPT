This printing saddle is generated with symmetry at the edges of the internal electrode pattern for each layer. Therefore, in a ceramic electronic device having a high stacking density, the sheet tends to be greatly curved at the edge portion of the internal electrode pattern adjacent to an upper cover sheet due to accumulation of the printing saddles due to the stacking.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, when electric field intensity at the chip end is locally increased due to the influence of the printing saddle, it is considered that the insulating property is degraded. When the failure analysis of short-life chips is actually performed, failure points tended to be concentrated on the left and right edges of the internal electrode layer. In order to increase the capacity density of ceramic electronic devices, it is desirable to make the dielectric green sheet thinner to increase the stacking density. Therefore, the effect of these printing saddles becomes more remarkable as the capacity density increases.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the other hand, the curvature of the stacked internal electrode patterns also has an effect of improving adhesion between the upper cover sheet and the internal electrode pattern due to anchor effect. As the number of the stacked layers of the ceramic electronic devices is increased, there is a risk that the internal electrode patterns will be misaligned when pressed with a strong force when the upper cover sheet is stacked after the internal electrode patterns are stacked. Therefore, it is desired to reduce the pressing pressure. As a result, the adhesion between the internal electrode pattern and the upper cover sheet is reduced, and the risk of delamination increases. This delamination causes poor moisture resistance and the like. In a multi-layered product, when the curvature of the internal electrode pattern is too small, the risk of delamination at the interface between the internal electrode pattern and the upper cover sheet tends to increase due to the decrease in the anchor effect.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A description will be given of an embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(Embodiment) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment, in which a cross section of a part of the multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b> is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cross sectional view taken along a line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a cross sectional view taken along a line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

When the multilayer chip <b>10</b> is manufactured, a lower cover sheet that becomes the first cover layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>after firing is arranged on a minus side in the Z-axis direction. On this lower cover sheet, the stack units to be the dielectric layer <b>11</b> and the internal electrode layer <b>12</b> after the firing are sequentially stacked toward the plus side in the Z-axis direction. An upper cover sheet to be the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>after the firing is stacked on the stacked structure. Pressing is performed each time each stack unit is stacked. After the stacking, the firing is performed. Since the number of pressing against the lower cover sheet to be the first cover layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>is large, the adhesion of the first cover layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>is higher than that of the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>. As the number of pressing increases, the number of pores and the like decreases, so that the pore ratio (porosity) of the first cover layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>is lower than that of the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>after the firing.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the internal electrode pattern to be the internal electrode layer <b>12</b> after the firing is printed by screen printing, a printing saddle is generated at the edge portion. Therefore, by going through the stacking process, the interface a between the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the uppermost internal electrode layer <b>12</b> is curved after the firing. At this interface a, both ends in the Y-axis direction are curved so as to project to the plus side in the Z-axis direction more than the vicinity of the center. The height of the curved portion on the minus side in the Y-axis direction is referred to as a height A. The height of the curved portion on the plus side in the Y-axis direction is referred to as a height B. The height A is the height from the lower end on the minus side in the Z-axis direction to the upper end on the plus side in the Z-axis direction at the interface between the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the uppermost internal electrode layer <b>12</b>. The height B is the height from the lower end on the minus side in the Z-axis direction to the upper end on the plus side in the Z-axis direction at the interface. The lower end on the minus side in the Z-axis direction at the interface tends to be located near the center in the Y-axis direction. The height of the capacity section <b>14</b> in the Z-axis direction (the shortest height from the first cover layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>) is referred to as a height C. The height C tends to be a height near the center of the capacity section <b>14</b> in the Y-axis direction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiment focuses on the ratio of the heights A and B of the curved portion with respect to the height C (curved amount ratio). In concrete, the curved amount ratio Q (%) is defined as (A+B)/2C&#xd7;100(%). When the curved amount ratio Q is large, the curved amount of the curved portion is large with respect to the height C of the capacity section <b>14</b>. When the curved amount ratio Q is too large, the electric field strength in the curved portion may be locally increased and the insulating property may be degraded. Therefore, an upper limit is set for the curved amount ratio Q. On the other hand, when the curved amount ratio Q is small, the curved amount of the curved portion is small with respect to the height C of the capacity section <b>14</b>. When the curved amount ratio Q is too small, the anchor effect between the second cover layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the uppermost internal electrode layer <b>12</b> is reduced, and delamination may occur. Therefore, a lower limit is set for the curved amount ratio Q. By setting the upper limit and the lower limit of the curved amount ratio Q, it is possible to realize the multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b> having excellent insulating property and less delamination. In the embodiment, the curved amount ratio Q is 0.5% or more and 1.6% or less.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The curved amount ratio Q is preferably 1.3% or less from the viewpoint of suppressing the local increase in the electric field strength in the curved portion. From the viewpoint of suppressing the decrease in the anchor effect, the curved amount ratio Q is preferably 0.7% or more.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The larger the number of layers L of the internal electrode layer <b>12</b> is, the greater the influence of the printing saddle is. For example, when the number of layers L is 600 or more, the influence of the printing saddle becomes particularly remarkable. Therefore, when the number of layers L is 600 or more, the effect of adjusting the curved amount ratio Q becomes remarkable. The number of layers L is, for example, 800 or more, or 920 or more.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The amount of metal conductive paste printed on a large-sized multilayer ceramic capacitor is larger than that of a small-sized multilayer ceramic capacitor. For example, in a multilayer ceramic capacitor having a shape of 1608 shape (length 1.6 mm, width 0.8 mm, height 0.8 mm) or more, the influence of the printing saddle becomes particularly remarkable. Therefore, in a multilayer ceramic capacitor having a size of 1608 or more, the effect of adjusting the curved amount ratio Q becomes remarkable. The multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b> has, for example, a size of 2012 shape (length 2.0 mm, width 1.25 mm, height 1.25 mm) or more, or a 3216 shape (length 3.2 mm, width 1.6 mm, height 1.6 mm) or more.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The higher the stacking density is, the greater the effect of the printing saddle is. For example, when the stacking density P is defined as P=L/C, the influence of the printing saddle becomes particularly remarkable when P=0.58 or more. Therefore, in a multilayer ceramic capacitor having P=0.58 or more, the effect of adjusting the curved amount ratio Q becomes remarkable. For example, the stacking density P is 0.73 or more, or 0.76 or more.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The larger the height C is, the larger the size of the multilayer ceramic capacitor is. Therefore, the influence of the printing saddle becomes larger. For example, when the height C is 800 &#x3bc;m or more, the influence of the printing saddle becomes particularly remarkable. Therefore, in a multilayer ceramic capacitor having the height C=800 &#x3bc;m or more, the effect of adjusting the curved amount ratio Q becomes remarkable. For example, the height C is 1100 &#x3bc;m or more, or 1600 &#x3bc;m or more.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, a description will be given of a manufacturing method of the multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a manufacturing method of the multilayer ceramic capacitor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(Making process of raw material powder) A dielectric material for forming the dielectric layer <b>11</b> is prepared.

Further, it can be seen that the smaller the height &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the height &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the printing saddle are, the smaller the height A and the height B in the curved portion after laminating are. That is, the curved amount ratio Q can be reduced by reducing the printing saddle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">With respect to the examples 1 to 5 and the comparative examples 1 to 3, delamination and long-term insulation failure were investigated. The long-term insulation failure is the number of NG in an accelerated test in which a voltage load is applied in a high temperature environment in 400 samples (the number of NG when the IR is 1/100 or less of that before the test at 9.45 V, 105 degrees C., 200 hours). The delamination is the number of samples for which delamination is confirmed by polishing up to the internal electrode and inspecting the number of samples of 200. The results are shown in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">In the comparative example 1, long-term insulation failure occurred. It is considered that this was because the curved amount ratio Q exceeds 1.60% and is too large. On the other hand, no long-term insulation failure occurred in any of the examples 1 to 5. It is considered that this was because the curved amount ratio Q was 1.60% or less and was appropriately reduced.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Next, in the comparative examples 2 and 3, the delamination occurred. It is considered that this was because the curved amount ratio Q was less than 0.50% and too small, and a sufficient anchor effect could not be obtained. On the other hand, the delamination did not occur in any of the examples 1 to 5. It is considered that this was because the curved amount ratio Q was 0.50% or more and was appropriately increased.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">(Examples 6 to 7) Next, the curved amount ratio Q was adjusted by changing the dilution rate &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the metal conductive paste for the internal electrode pattern. In the comparative example 2, the dilution rate &#x201c;d&#x201d; was set to 8%. In the example 6, the dilution rate &#x201c;d&#x201d; was set to 10%. In the example 7, the dilution rate &#x201c;d&#x201d; was set to 12%. The results are shown in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the height &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the height &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the printing saddle could be increased by increasing the dilution ratio &#x201c;d&#x201d;, and as a result, the curved amount ratio Q could be increased. This is because the viscosity of the metal conductive paste increased due to the increase in the dilution ratio &#x201c;d&#x201d;. As described above, when the curved amount ratio Q was too small, it could be seen that the curved amount ratio Q could be increased by increasing the height &#x201c;a&#x201d; and the height &#x201c;b&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>a</entry><entry>b</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>C</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>d</entry><entry>(nm)</entry><entry>(nm)</entry><entry>(&#x3bc;m)</entry><entry>(&#x3bc;m)</entry><entry>(&#x3bc;m)</entry><entry>P</entry><entry>Q</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>COMPAR-</entry><entry>&#x2002;8%</entry><entry>11</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>5.5</entry><entry>5.2</entry><entry>1179.1</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry>0.45%</entry></row><row><entry>ATIVE</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>EXAMPLE 2</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>EXAMPLE 5</entry><entry>10%</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>37</entry><entry>9.9</entry><entry>7.8</entry><entry>1175.5</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry>0.75%</entry></row><row><entry>EXAMPLE 7</entry><entry>12%</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>41</entry><entry>11.5</entry><entry>11.7</entry><entry>1168.8</entry><entry>0.76</entry><entry>0.99%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, it is to be understood that the various change, substitutions, and alterations could be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
