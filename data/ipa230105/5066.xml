Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used herein in both the alternative and conjunctive sense, unless otherwise indicated. The terms &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; and &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; are used to be examples with no indication of quality level. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. Moreover, while certain embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to predictive data analysis, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed concepts can be used to perform other types of data analysis.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">I. OVERVIEW AND TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments of the present invention disclose techniques for performing predictive data analysis steps/operations that are configured to generate a predicted risk measure for a predictive entity. These techniques are in turn configured to improve the efficiency of performing the noted predictive data analysis steps/operations and reliability of the generated results. Typically, predictive data analysis steps/operations require analysis of large amounts of data in order to accurately generate a predictive output. Accordingly, a predictive output may be inaccurate or unreliable in an instance in which insufficient amounts of data are available. Additionally, existing techniques are time consuming and require a lot of computational resources. There is a need for improved systems and methods that are configured to generate accurate predictive outputs in an efficient manner in an instance in which limited data and/or computing resources are available. Various embodiments of the present invention address that need by disclosing techniques for training risk determination machine learning models using per-horizon historical claim sets for ground-truth predictive entities whose per-horizon historical claim counts satisfy a per-horizon historical claim count threshold. The inventors have confirmed, via experiments and theoretical calculations, that various embodiments of the disclosed techniques improve efficiency and accuracy of predictive data analysis systems and predictive data analysis relative to various state-of-the-art solutions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, various embodiments of the present invention address the challenge of computing a risk index for caregivers for whom there is no direct data (e.g., caregivers who are not submitting their own health claims with sufficient regularity) to provide a conventionally computed direct risk index. These caregivers may be at risk of serious adverse health outcomes and often fail to look after their own health due to their stressful circumstances. In contrast, the care recipients associated with these caregivers may have an abundance of indirect data relating to the caregivers' circumstances. A goal of various embodiments of the present invention is to generate and utilize a caregiver risk determination machine learning model that can be built using a subset of the data for which there is sufficient direct caregiver data and corresponding care recipient data. The model can then be used to make predictions about the health status of caregivers using as input the (abundant) care recipient data and some other known caregiver attributes. In this way, health risks in a population that is difficult to reach can be accurately predicted.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The predictive model at the heart of various embodiments of the present invention may be a supervised regression model which predicts a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (typically used as a prediction tool for patients with comorbid conditions) of a caregiver over a time period of interest (e.g., two years). The data from the model is taken from the small pool of caregivers who have submitted sufficient claims during the two years after a diagnosis to compute a CCI score. These claims are then used to calculate the CCI score for these caregivers in the dataset. A supervised regression model is then built that will be able to interpolate a CCI across the entire population of caregivers in the cohort, even those who are not submitting any claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">II. DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;predictive entity&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes an entity with respect to which one or more predictive tasks/operations are performed. In some embodiments, a predictive entity may refer to a data object that describes a caregiver entity (e.g., patient, member or the like). The caregiver entity may receive healthcare services or products (or any other type of service or product) rendered by a provider. The caregiver entity may be associated with a health insurance insurer and may be considered a member of a program associated with the health insurance insurer. An example predictive entity may correspond with an identifier (e.g., caregiver identifier such as patient name, member ID and/or the like). The example caregiver entity may be associated with a recipient entity (e.g., care recipient entity) that is in turn associated with a primary event. In some embodiments the predictive entity (e.g., caregiver entity) may be one of a plurality of candidate predictive entities but may be outside a ground-truth subset of the plurality of candidate predictive entities.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;primary event&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes a record of an occurred event associated with a predictive entity. An example primary event may be determined based at least in part on a diagnosis timestamp for a care recipient entity. The care recipient entity may, in some examples, be associated with a caregiver entity. The primary event may comprise a primary event code defining one or more primary event attributes (e.g., medical claim attributes). The primary event may correspond with a care recipient entity diagnosis that is associated with an increased or increasing predicted risk measure for an associated predictive entity (e.g., caregiver entity) over a prediction time horizon. For example, the primary event may precipitate or lead to one or more medical claim entries, diagnoses and/or the like for a caregiver entity that is associated with the care recipient entity. In some embodiments, a medical claim entry may refer to a data object that describes a request for payment/reimbursement for services rendered, materials used, equipment provided, and/or the like (e.g., a claim or claim filing). In various embodiments, a claim may be a request for payment/reimbursement for a consultation with a primary care doctor, a medical procedure or an evaluation performed by a medical practitioner, a laboratory test performed by a laboratory, a surgery, durable medical equipment provided to an injured member, medications or other materials used in the treatment of a care recipient entity or caregiver entity, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;risk determination machine learning model&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes operations and/or parameters of a machine learning model that is configured to process hidden features of a predictive entity (e.g., caregiver entity) and generate a predicted risk measure for the predictive entity. In some embodiments, the risk determination machine learning model may be generated based at least in part on a ground-truth risk measure for each of a plurality of ground-truth predictive entities in a ground-truth subset of a plurality of candidate predictive entities. In some examples, each ground-truth risk measure is determined based at least in part on a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score for a per-horizon historical claim set associated with the ground-truth predictive entity. Each of the ground-truth subset of predictive entities may be associated with a primary event. An example of a risk determination machine learning model is a trained supervised machine learning model (e.g., a trained supervised regression model, a convolutional neural network model, and/or the like). In some embodiments, an example input to the risk determination machine learning model may be or comprise a multi-dimensional vector. Similarly, an example output from the risk determination machine learning model may be or comprise a multi-dimensional vector. In some embodiments, input features for the risk determination machine learning model may include hidden features (e.g., claim features such as count of claims, frequency of claims or the like), care recipient entity information/data (e.g., historical claim data), known caregiver entity data/information (e.g., demographic information such as age, gender, geographic location and/or the like), combinations thereof, and/or the like. The operations of the risk determination machine learning model may lead to performing one or more prediction-based actions or tasks.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;hidden features&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes one or more features/attributes associated with a predictive entity that are processed by a risk determination machine learning model in order to generate a predictive output (e.g., a predicted risk measure). Example hidden features may include member demographic information/data (e.g., age, gender, co-morbidities and/or the like), claim frequency, claim type, claim value/amounts (e.g., billed, paid and the like), number of hospitalizations, hospitalization time, duration of service, provider demographic information/data (e.g., specialty), diagnosis codes, procedure codes, facility, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;predicted risk measure&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes a predictive output representative of an inferred measure of risk with respect to a predictive entity. In some embodiments, the predicted risk measure may be or comprise a morbidity index defining an expected survival period for the predictive entity. An example predicted risk measure may be or comprise a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score. The example predicted risk measure may be generated using a risk determination machine learning model and based at least in part on one or more hidden features of the example predictive entity. The predicted risk measure may be used to perform one or more prediction-based actions with respect to the predictive entity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;ground-truth predictive entity&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes a predictive entity that is associated with a per-horizon claim count that satisfies a per-horizon claim count threshold. For example, a ground-truth predictive entity may be a predictive entity having a number of claims within a defined prediction time horizon that satisfies a claim count threshold.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;ground-truth risk measure&#x201d; may refer to a data object that describes a determined measure of risk with respect to a ground-truth predictive entity that is determined based at least in part on a per-horizon historical claim set for the ground-truth predictive entity. The per-horizon historical claim set may refer to a count of claims of a predictive entity (e.g., care recipient entity) occurring within a prediction time horizon that satisfies a predetermined threshold (e.g., a per-horizon claim count threshold). The example ground-truth risk measure may be determined based at least in part on a CCI score for the per-horizon historical claim set. In some embodiments, a plurality of ground-truth risk measures associated with a ground-truth subset of ground-truth predictive entities may be utilized to train a machine learning model (e.g., a risk determination machine learning model).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;prediction time horizon&#x201d; may refer to a data object describing a defined-length time period following a primary event. The prediction time horizon may begin with a primary event timestamp (e.g., diagnosis timestamp) and terminate after a predetermined time period subsequent to the primary event timestamp (e.g., three months, six months, two years, or the like).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;patient profile&#x201d; may refer to a data object storing and/or providing access to information/data associated with a patient/individual. The patient profile may also comprise member information/data, member features, and/or similar words used herein interchangeably that can be associated with a given member identifier for a patient/individual, claim, and/or the like. In some embodiments, member information/data can include age, gender, poverty rates, known health conditions, home location, profession, access to medical care, medical history, claim history, member identifier (ID), and/or the like. Member information/data may also include marital status, employment status, employment type, socioeconomic information/data (e.g., income information/data), relationship to the primary insured, insurance product information/data, insurance plan information/data, member classifications, language information/data, and/or the like.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">III.

In some embodiments, the ground-truth risk measure may be a measure of risk that is determined based at least in part on a per-horizon claim set for the ground-truth predictive entity associated therewith. By way of example, the per-horizon claim set may be a count of claims, frequency of claims, combinations thereof, and/or the like, occurring within a prediction time horizon that satisfies a predetermined threshold (e.g., per-horizon claim count threshold).

In some embodiments, training the risk determination machine learning model includes generating training data that is used to train the risk determination machine learning model. In some embodiments, training the risk determination machine learning model includes generating hidden features that serve as inputs to the risk determination machine learning model during training operations. As discussed herein, hidden features may include features or attributes that are associated with a predictive entity such as, for example, without limitation, member demographic information/data (e.g., age, gender, co-morbidities), claim frequency, claim type, claim value/amounts, number of hospitalizations, hospitalization time, duration of service, provider demographic information/data (e.g., specialty), diagnosis codes, procedure codes, facility, and/or the like. Additionally, the risk determination machine learning model may be generated based at least in part on one or more known attributes associated with an example predictive entity such as demographic information/data (e.g., age, geographic information) and the like.

Subsequently, the trained risk determination machine learning model may be used to generate a predicted risk measure, which may be or comprise a CCI score, for all caregivers.
