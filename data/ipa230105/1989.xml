In the case of standard tractor trailers, at highway speeds, aerodynamic drag is responsible for approximately half of the vehicle's fuel burn, meaning that even slight reductions in aerodynamic drag can result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and annual savings in fuel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are several physical areas on tractor trailers that account for the most significant portion of fuel usage. In the case of class <b>8</b> semi-trailers, the more perpendicular and vertical front areas of the tractor such as the radiator grill and windshield are significant, along with the gap between the tractor and trailer, as well as the rear doors. This invention discloses a means to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the rear impact guard, sometimes referred to as the ICC bumper or underride guard, which can account for up to 2% of the vehicle drag, and over 1% of a tractor trailer's fuel consumption.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, there is a need for an improved underride guard which reduces the aerodynamic resistance of vehicle such as tractor trailer trucks, without negatively affecting the safety or structural performance of the underride guard.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide an underride guard for a vehicle having a more aerodynamic design than existing underride guards.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide an underride guard that has an improved aerodynamic performance without negatively affecting safety.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other objects are achieved by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a rear impact guard is provided. The rear impact guard includes at least one vertical member, and a horizontal member connected to a distal end of the at least one vertical member, the horizontal member having a plurality of flow through passages allowing for air flow through the horizontal member.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a semi-trailer is provided. The semi-trailer includes a rear impact guard mounted at a rear end of the semi-trailer, the rear impact guard having a pair of vertical members, and a horizontal member carried at respective distal ends of the pair of vertical members. The horizontal member has a plurality of through passages allowing for air flow through the horizontal member to reduce aerodynamic drag of the semi-trailer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method for reducing the aerodynamic drag of a vehicle or trailer is provided. The method includes the steps of mounting an underride guard to a rear of the vehicle or trailer, the underride guard having at least one vertical member and a horizontal member connected to a distal

As shown therein, the semi-trailer <b>10</b> includes a rear impact guard <b>12</b>, which is required on all trailers and many trucks by federal law to improve safety. The rear impact guard <b>12</b> on any semi-trailer or truck has size, mounting position, and strength/safety requirements mandated by federal law, and normally consists of two vertical structural members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that attach to the underside of the trailer, and a horizontal member <b>18</b> connected to the distal ends of the vertical members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that prevents smaller vehicles from going under the trailer in the event of a collision. The rear impact guard is also commonly referred to as an (Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) bumper or underride guard.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a rear impact guard <b>20</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As shown therein, the rear impact guard <b>20</b> has two vertical structural members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, as is known in the art, and a horizontal member <b>22</b>. As illustrated, the horizontal member <b>22</b> is generally rectangular or square in cross-section, and has a plurality of through openings or passages <b>24</b> aligned in the driving direction of the trailer. In an embodiment, the horizontal member <b>22</b> is solid in construction, other than the through openings <b>24</b>. The through passages are of a shape, configuration, size and location so as to maintain the structural integrity and intended function of the rear impact guard <b>20</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the through passages <b>24</b> may be triangular in shape and may extend generally from a point adjacent to the top of the horizontal member <b>22</b> to a point adjacent to the bottom of the horizontal member <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the through passages <b>24</b> in the horizontal member <b>22</b> of the rear impact guard <b>20</b> allow air to flow through the horizontal member <b>22</b> in the driving direction, thereby reducing the aerodynamic drag of the impact guard <b>20</b>, and therefore reducing fuel consumption.

Importantly, the horizontal member <b>172</b> has a vertical rear face <b>174</b> (rather than terminating at a sharp point), which presents a rear-ward facing surface for the attachment of reflective tape or reflective painting. In an embodiment, the height of the vertical rear face may be selected to comply with regulations relating to visibility or conspicuity. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, the horizontal members may be formed using any means known in the art, such as via weldment or extrusion.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning finally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, a rear impact guard <b>150</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The rear impact guard <b>150</b> includes a pair of vertical members <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> and a horizontal member <b>156</b>. The horizontal member <b>156</b> includes a solid portion <b>158</b> and a plurality of flow-through portions <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. It is contemplated that the flow through portions may be formed by corrugations of any configuration, such as those disclosed above. In an embodiment, the vertical members <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may likewise include some solid (i.e., non-flow-through) sections and some flow through sections. This hybrid approach could allow the outward, or any section with the highest velocity and drag, to be flow through and other lower velocity sections to be non-flow through, giving flexibility to the design options to reduce drag while meeting safety and conspicuity requirements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rear impact guard of the present invention therefore minimizes the aerodynamic drag of a semi-trailer, reducing fuel consumption and overall operating cost. In particular, allowing airflow through the guard's vertical and/or horizontal members, or portions of the members, reduces aerodynamic drag. This is accomplished by a design that allows flow through in the driving direction, but maintains structural stiffness to provide the needed strength and energy absorption in the driving direction to meet federal safety requirements. This would significantly reduce fuel consumption without any safety impact. In fact, the structural design could be tailored to improve safety performance by adding some &#x201c;crumple zone&#x201d; functionality while reducing drag and saving fuel which could lead to widespread industry adoption.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain embodiments, as disclosed above, the rear impact guards are configured to more efficiently direct airflow around the guard, or portions of the guard's vertical or horizontal members, to reduce the aerodynamic drag. This can be accomplished by designing the guard's forward and/or rear faces to more efficiently direct airflow around the guard reducing aerodynamic drag and fuel consumption. This could be done for the entire guard, or for portions of the guard. A combined (some flow through, some non-flow through) design approach might be desired for locating reflectors or reflective tape on the rear-facing sides, or for improved structural performance in certain areas.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is contemplated that the rear impact guards disclosed herein can be manufactured from a variety of materials known in the art such as, for example, steel, aluminum, or hybrid construction, or non-metallic composite construction. The rear impact guards can be connected to a vehicle using any means known in the art such as via bolting, welding or brazing. The rear impact guard, itself, can be constructed using welding, brazing, bolting and/or extrusion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In any of the above-described embodiments, the horizontal members may be manufactured to be thicker in the areas where the horizontal members attach to the vertical supports. This thickness may be provided by a thicker top plate, an additional top plate and/or via thicker internal webbing (i.e., the internal members that define the air flow passages). For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the X-shaped braces may be manufactured to be thicker in the area of the vertical supports <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. This increased thickness allows for a more robust and reliable structural connection to the vertical members, such as by welding.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As alluded to above, the flow through passages may take any shape or configuration. In an embodiment, the horizontal member may be formed by welding a plurality of small sections of cylindrical tubing to one another (where, in such case, the flow through passages are circular in shape). Welding square tube sections can likewise be utilized to form a horizontal member with square passages.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the present invention has been disclosed above as a rear impact guard for a semi-trailer, it is not intended that the present invention be so limited in this regard. In particular, it is contemplated that the rear impact guard of the present invention may be utilized on a variety of vehicles including, but not limited to, semi-trailers, tractor trailers, trucks, automobiles and the like. It is further envisioned that other structural or non-structural components of the trailer or vehicle can be configured with flow-through passages in a similar manner, with the same benefit of reducing aerodynamic drag. Such components may include, for example, bumpers, deflectors and the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to the detailed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.
