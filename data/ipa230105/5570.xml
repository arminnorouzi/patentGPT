id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Techniques are provided for generating an array-specific range of Tm values to be used for calling a sample in a given array positive or negative for a target nucleic acid sequence. A sample well in an array is provided with a control sample containing a control nucleic acid sequence. The control sample is amplified by thermal cycling the sample well. A Tm value for the control sample is identified and compared to an expected Tm value for the control nucleic acid sequence to calculate a relationship between the identified control Tm value and the expected control Tm value. By applying this relationship to an expected Tm value for a target nucleic acid sequence, an array-specific range of Tm values for the target nucleic acid sequence is generated and can be used for calling an experimental sample in the same array positive or negative for the target nucleic acid sequence.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to techniques used in PCR systems and, more particularly, to generating an array-specific range of Tm values to be used for calling a sample positive or negative for a target nucleic acid sequence in a given array.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the United States, Canada, and Western Europe infectious disease accounts for approximately 7% of human mortality, while in developing regions infectious disease accounts for over 40% of human mortality. Infectious diseases lead to a variety of clinical manifestations. Among common overt manifestations are fever, pneumonia, meningitis, diarrhea, and diarrhea containing blood. While the physical manifestations suggest some pathogens and eliminate others as the etiological agent, a variety of potential causative agents remain, and clear diagnosis often requires a variety of assays to be performed. Traditional microbiology techniques for diagnosing pathogens can take days or weeks, often delaying a proper course of treatment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a method of choice for rapid diagnosis of infectious agents. PCR can be a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool to diagnose infectious disease. A challenge to using PCR as a primary means of diagnosis is the variety of possible causative organisms and the low levels of organism present in some pathological specimens. It is often impractical to run large panels of PCR assays, one for each possible causative organism, most of which are expected to be negative. The problem is exacerbated when pathogen nucleic acid is at low concentration and requires a large volume of sample to gather adequate reaction templates. In some cases, there is inadequate sample to assay for all possible etiological agents. A solution is to run &#x201c;multiplex PCR&#x201d; wherein the sample is concurrently assayed for multiple targets in a single reaction. While multiplex PCR has proven to be valuable in some systems, shortcomings exist concerning robustness of high level multiplex reactions and difficulties for clear analysis of multiple products. To solve these problems, the assay may be subsequently divided into multiple secondary PCRs. Nesting secondary reactions within the primary product often increases robustness. However, this further handling can be expensive and may lead to contamination or other problems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fully integrated multiplex PCR systems integrating sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis are user friendly and are particularly well adapted for the diagnostic market and for syndromic approaches. The FilmArray&#xae; (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah) is such a system, a user friendly, highly multiplexed PCR system developed for the diagnostic market. The single sample instrument accepts a disposable &#x201c;pouch&#x201d; that integrates sample preparation and nested multiplex PCR. Integrated sample preparation provides ease-of-use, while the highly multiplexed PCR provides both the sensitivity of PCR and the ability to test for up to 30 different organisms simultaneously. This system is well suited to pathogen identification where a number of different pathogens all manifest similar clinical symptoms. Current available diagnostic panels include a respiratory panel for upper respiratory infections, a blood culture panel for blood stream infections, a gastrointestinal panel for GI infections, and a meningitis panel for cerebrospinal fluid infections. Other panels are in development.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally speaking, the temperature at which DNA strands denature depends on the sequence characteristics of the DNA. Accordingly, in many PCR systems, a range of Tm (the temperature at which half of the nucleic acid has melted) values are used to call a positive or a negative for an assay. If an identified Tm for a sample falls outside of the range of Tm values for a particular nucleic acid sequence, the sample is called negative for that nucleic acid sequence, but if the identified Tm for the sample falls within the range of Tm values for the nucleic acid sequence, the sample is called positive for that nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, this range of Tm values can be fairly broad and still be useful in distinguishing between DNA associated with different pathogen species, because different pathogen species typically have quite different Tm values. However, the Tm values for the DNA of related pathogens may vary only slightly. Consequently, when a Tm window is too broad, it may be difficult to distinguish between closely related pathogens due to overlap in Tm value ranges for each pathogen. For instance, some assays amplify nucleic acids multiple strains of a given pathogen, and some assays can amplify similar pathogen species, both of which may fall into the overly broad Tm window. Accordingly, narrowing the range of Tm values used to identify a particular nucleic acid sequence could lead to greater specificity and sensitivity when distinguishing between related species. However, up to this point, these ranges of Tm values used to identify nucleic acid sequences have been difficult to narrow, because the melting temperature of a given nucleic acid sequence may vary between pouch runs due to subtle differences in pouch chemistry concentrations, amount of amplicon, instrument characteristics, etc. In other words, when this range of Tm values is too narrow, there is a risk of not identifying a target nucleic acid sequence even when it is present due to variations in its melting temperature between pouch runs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a method for generating an array-specific range of Tm values to be used for calling a sample positive or negative for a target nucleic acid sequence in a given array is provided, the method comprising: providing, in an array, a control sample well with a control sample containing a control nucleic acid sequence, primers configured for amplifying the control nucleic acid sequence, a fluorescent dye, and components for amplification;

Advantageously, the normalized, array-specific range of Tm values for a target nucleic acid sequence will generally be narrower than the reference range of Tm values that is currently used to call samples positive or negative for the target nucleic acid. Accordingly, narrowing the range of Tm values used to identify a particular nucleic acid sequence leads to greater specificity and sensitivity when distinguishing between related species. That is, when the ranges of Tm values used to call samples positive or negative for each target nucleic acid are narrower, it is easier to distinguish between related pathogens that have similar ranges of Tm values, and more accurately call the sample positive or negative only for a specific target nucleic acid sequence (and not related target nucleic acid sequences that have similar ranges Tm values). Moreover, the techniques discussed herein may be easily implemented into existing systems, because no modification of the pouch or array is required.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Example embodiments are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The stability of the resulting hybrid depends upon the length, GC content, and the extent of the base-pairing that occurs. The extent of base-pairing is affected by parameters such as the degree of complementarity between the probe and target molecules and the degree of stringency of the hybridization conditions. The degree of hybridization stringency is affected by parameters such as temperature, salt concentration, and the concentration of organic molecules such as formamide, and is determined by methods known to one skilled in the art. Probes, primers, and oligonucleotides may be detectably-labeled, either radioactively, fluorescently, or non-radioactively, by methods well-known to those skilled in the art. dsDNA binding dyes may be used to detect dsDNA.

Illustratively, the DNA binding agent is an intercalating agent or minor groove binder. LCGREEN&#xae; Plus (BioFire Defense) is the dsDNA binding dye used in the examples herein, but it is understood that other dsDNA binding dyes may be used.

Cp may be determined experimentally based on a manually set threshold, although other methods for determining Cp are known in the art. Other points may be used as well, such as using a first, second, or nth order derivative, illustratively as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,303,305, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Such suitable procedures include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of any type (single-step, two-steps, or others); strand displacement amplification (SDA); nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA); cascade rolling circle amplification (CRCA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP); isothermal and chimeric primer-initiated amplification of nucleic acids (ICAN); target based-helicase dependent amplification (HDA); transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), next generation sequencing techniques, and the like. Therefore, when the term PCR is used, it should be understood to include other alternative amplification methods, including amino acid quantification methods. It is also understood that the methods included herein may be used for other biological and chemical processes that involve thermal cycling followed by melting curve analysis. For amplification methods without discrete cycles, reaction time may be used where measurements are made in cycles or Cp, and additional reaction time may be added where additional PCR cycles are added in the embodiments described herein.

However, it is understood that such instruments and pouches are illustrative only, and the nucleic acid preparation and amplification reactions discussed herein may be performed in any of a variety of open or closed system sample vessels as are known in the art, including 96-well plates, plates of other configurations, arrays, carousels, and the like, using a variety of nucleic acid purification and amplification systems, as are known in the art. While the terms &#x201c;sample well&#x201d;, &#x201c;amplification well&#x201d;, &#x201c;amplification container&#x201d;, or the like are used herein, these terms are meant to encompass wells, tubes, blisters, and various other reaction containers, as are used in these amplification systems.

Pouch <b>510</b> is similar to FIG. 15 of U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295, with like items numbered the same. Fitment <b>590</b> is provided with entry channels <b>515</b><i>a </i>through <b>515</b><i>l</i>, which also serve as reagent reservoirs or waste reservoirs. Illustratively, reagents may be freeze dried in fitment <b>590</b> and rehydrated prior to use. Blisters <b>522</b>, <b>544</b>, <b>546</b>, <b>548</b>, <b>564</b>, and <b>566</b>, with their respective channels <b>514</b>, <b>538</b>, <b>543</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>553</b>, <b>562</b>, and <b>565</b> are similar to blisters of the same number of FIG. 15 of U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295. Second-stage reaction zone <b>580</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is similar to that of U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295, but the second-stage wells <b>582</b> of high density array <b>581</b> are arranged in a somewhat different pattern. The more circular pattern of high density array <b>581</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> eliminates wells in corners and may result in more uniform filling of second-stage wells <b>582</b>. As shown, the high density array <b>581</b> is provided with 102 second-stage wells <b>582</b>. Pouch <b>510</b> is suitable for use in the FilmArray&#xae; instrument (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah). However, it is understood that the pouch embodiment is illustrative only.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">While other containers may be used, illustratively, pouch <b>510</b> is formed of two layers of a flexible plastic film or other flexible material such as polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate, polypropylene, polymethylmethacrylate, and mixtures thereof that can be made by any process known in the art, including extrusion, plasma deposition, and lamination. Metal foils or plastics with aluminum lamination also may be used. Other barrier materials are known in the art that can be sealed together to form the blisters and channels. If plastic film is used, the layers may be bonded together, illustratively by heat sealing. Illustratively, the material has low nucleic acid binding capacity.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">For embodiments employing fluorescent monitoring, plastic films that are adequately low in absorbance and auto-fluorescence at the operative wavelengths are preferred. Such material could be identified by testing different plastics, different plasticizers, and composite ratios, as well as different thicknesses of the film. For plastics with aluminum or other foil lamination, the portion of the pouch that is to be read by a fluorescence detection device can be left without the foil. For example, if fluorescence is monitored in second-stage wells <b>582</b> of the second-stage reaction zone <b>580</b> of pouch <b>510</b>, then one or both layers at wells <b>582</b> would be left without the foil. In the example of PCR, film laminates composed of polyester (Mylar, DuPont, Wilmington Del.) of about 0.0048 inch (0.1219 mm) thick and polypropylene films of 0.001-0.003 inch (0.025-0.076 mm) thick perform well. Illustratively, pouch <b>510</b> is made of a clear material capable of transmitting approximately 80%-90% of incident light.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the illustrative embodiment, the materials are moved between blisters by the application of pressure, illustratively pneumatic pressure, upon the blisters and channels. Accordingly, in embodiments employing pressure, the pouch material illustratively is flexible enough to allow the pressure to have the desired effect. The term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; is herein used to describe a physical characteristic of the material of pouch. The term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; is herein defined as readily deformable by the levels of pressure used herein without cracking, breaking, crazing, or the like. For example, thin plastic sheets, such as Saran&#x2122; wrap and Ziploc&#xa9; bags, as well as thin metal foil, such as aluminum foil, are flexible. However, only certain regions of the blisters and channels need be flexible, even in embodiments employing pneumatic pressure. Further, only one side of the blisters and channels need to be flexible, as long as the blisters and channels are readily deformable. Other regions of the pouch <b>510</b> may be made of a rigid material or may be reinforced with a rigid material.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Illustratively, a plastic film is used for pouch <b>510</b>. A sheet of metal, illustratively aluminum, or other suitable material, may be milled or otherwise cut, to create a die having a pattern of raised surfaces. When fitted into a pneumatic press (illustratively A-5302-PDS, Janesville Tool Inc., Milton Wis.), illustratively regulated at an operating temperature of 195&#xb0; C., the pneumatic press works like a printing press, melting the sealing surfaces of plastic film only where the die contacts the film. Various components, such as PCR primers (illustratively spotted onto the film and dried), antigen binding substrates, magnetic beads, and zirconium silicate beads may be sealed inside various blisters as the pouch <b>510</b> is formed. Reagents for sample processing can be spotted onto the film prior to sealing, either collectively or separately. In one embodiment, nucleotide tri-phosphates (NTPs) are spotted onto the film separately from polymerase and primers, essentially eliminating activity of the polymerase until the reaction is hydrated by an aqueous sample. If the aqueous sample has been heated prior to hydration, this creates the conditions for a true hot-start PCR and reduces or eliminates the need for expensive chemical hot-start components.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Pouch <b>510</b> may be used in a manner similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295. In one illustrative embodiment, a 300 &#x3bc;l mixture comprising the sample to be tested (100 &#x3bc;l) and lysis buffer (200 &#x3bc;l) is injected into an injection port (not shown) in fitment <b>590</b> near entry channel <b>515</b><i>a</i>, and the sample mixture is drawn into entry channel <b>515</b><i>a</i>. Water is also injected into a second injection port (not shown) of the fitment <b>590</b> adjacent entry channel <b>515</b><i>l</i>, and is distributed via a channel (not shown) provided in fitment <b>590</b>, thereby hydrating up to eleven different reagents, each of which were previously provided in dry form at entry channels <b>515</b><i>b </i>through <b>515</b><i>l</i>. These reagents illustratively may include freeze-dried PCR reagents, DNA extraction reagents, wash solutions, immunoassay reagents, or other chemical entities. Illustratively, the reagents are for nucleic acid extraction, first-stage (or &#x201c;PCR1&#x201d;) multiplex PCR, dilution of the multiplex reaction, and preparation of second-stage PCR reagents, as well as control reactions. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, all that need be injected is the sample solution in one injection port and water in the other injection port. After injection, the two injection ports may be sealed. For more information on various configurations of pouch <b>510</b> and fitment <b>590</b>, see U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295, already incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">After injection, the sample is moved from injection channel <b>515</b><i>a </i>to lysis blister <b>522</b> via channel <b>514</b>. Lysis blister <b>522</b> is provided with beads or particles <b>534</b>, such as ceramic beads, and is configured for vortexing via impaction using rotating blades or paddles provided within the FilmArray&#xae; instrument. Bead-milling, by shaking or vortexing the sample in the presence of lysing particles such as zirconium silicate (ZS) beads <b>534</b>, is an effective method to form a lysate. It is understood that, as used herein, terms such as &#x201c;lyse,&#x201d; &#x201c;lysing,&#x201d; and &#x201c;lysate&#x201d; are not limited to rupturing cells, but that such terms include disruption of non-cellular particles, such as viruses.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a bead beating motor <b>819</b>, comprising blades <b>821</b> that may be mounted on a first side <b>811</b> of support member <b>802</b>, of instrument <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Blades may extend through slot <b>804</b> to contact pouch <b>510</b>. It is understood, however, that motor <b>819</b> may be mounted on other structures of instrument <b>800</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, motor <b>819</b> is a Mabuchi RC-280SA-2865 DC Motor (Chiba, Japan), mounted on support member <b>802</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the motor is turned at 5,000 to 25,000 rpm, more illustratively 10,000 to 20,000 rpm, and still more illustratively approximately 15,000 to 18,000 rpm. For the Mabuchi motor, it has been found that 7.2V provides sufficient rpm for lysis. It is understood, however, that the actual speed may be somewhat slower when the blades <b>821</b> are impacting pouch <b>510</b>. Other voltages and speeds may be used for lysis depending on the motor and paddles used. Optionally, controlled small volumes of air may be provided into the bladder <b>822</b> adjacent lysis blister <b>522</b>. It has been found that in some embodiments, partially filling the adjacent bladder with one or more small volumes of air aids in positioning and supporting lysis blister during the lysis process. Alternatively, other structure, illustratively a rigid or compliant gasket or other retaining structure around lysis blister <b>522</b>, can be used to restrain pouch <b>510</b> during lysis. It is also understood that motor <b>819</b> is illustrative only, and other devices may be used for milling, shaking, or vortexing the sample.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Once the cells have been adequately lysed, the sample is moved through channel <b>538</b>, blister <b>544</b>, and channel <b>543</b>, to blister <b>546</b>, where the sample is mixed with a nucleic acid-binding substance, such as silica-coated magnetic beads <b>533</b>. The mixture is allowed to incubate for an appropriate length of time, illustratively approximately 10 seconds to 10 minutes. A retractable magnet located within the instrument adjacent blister <b>546</b> captures the magnetic beads <b>533</b> from the solution, forming a pellet against the interior surface of blister <b>546</b>.

One or more wash buffers from one or more of injection channels <b>515</b><i>c </i>to <b>515</b><i>e </i>are provided via blister <b>544</b> and channel <b>543</b> to blister <b>546</b>. Optionally, the magnet is retracted and the magnetic beads <b>533</b> are washed by moving the beads back and forth from blisters <b>544</b> and <b>546</b> via channel <b>543</b>. Once the magnetic beads <b>533</b> are washed, the magnetic beads <b>533</b> are recaptured in blister <b>546</b> by activation of the magnet, and the wash solution is then moved to blister <b>522</b>.

After several cycles of mixing, the solution is contained in blister <b>564</b>, where a pellet of first-stage PCR primers is provided, at least one set of primers for each target, and first-stage multiplex PCR is performed. If RNA targets are present, a reverse-transcription (RT) step may be performed prior to or simultaneously with the first-stage multiplex PCR. First-stage multiplex PCR temperature cycling in the FilmArray&#xae; instrument is illustratively performed for 15-30 cycles, although other levels of amplification may be desirable, depending on the requirements of the specific application. The first-stage PCR master mix may be any of various master mixes, as are known in the art. In one illustrative example, the first-stage PCR master mix may be any of the chemistries disclosed in US2015/0118715, herein incorporated by reference, for use with PCR protocols taking 20 seconds or less per cycle.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">After first-stage PCR has proceeded for the desired number of cycles, the sample may be diluted, illustratively by forcing most of the sample back into blister <b>548</b>, leaving only a small amount in blister <b>564</b>, and adding second-stage PCR master mix from injection channel <b>515</b><i>i</i>. Alternatively, a dilution buffer from <b>515</b><i>i </i>may be moved to blister <b>566</b> then mixed with the amplified sample in blister <b>564</b> by moving the fluids back and forth between blisters <b>564</b> and <b>566</b>. If desired, dilution may be repeated several times, using dilution buffer from injection channels <b>515</b><i>j </i>and <b>515</b><i>k</i>, or injection channel <b>515</b><i>k </i>may be reserved for sequencing or for other post-PCR analysis, and then adding second-stage PCR master mix from injection channel <b>515</b><i>h </i>to some or all of the diluted amplified sample. It is understood that the level of dilution may be adjusted by altering the number of dilution steps or by altering the percentage of the sample discarded prior to mixing with the dilution buffer or second-stage PCR master mix comprising components for amplification, illustratively a polymerase, dNTPs, and a suitable buffer, although other components may be suitable, particularly for non-PCR amplification methods. If desired, this mixture of the sample and second-stage PCR master mix may be pre-heated in blister <b>564</b> prior to movement to second-stage wells <b>582</b> for second-stage amplification. Such preheating may obviate the need for a hot-start component (antibody, chemical, or otherwise) in the second-stage PCR mixture.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The illustrative second-stage PCR master mix is incomplete, lacking primer pairs, and each of the 102 second-stage wells <b>582</b> is pre-loaded with a specific PCR primer pair (or sometimes multiple pairs of primers). If desired, second-stage PCR master mix may lack other reaction components, and these components may be pre-loaded in the second-stage wells <b>582</b> as well. Each primer pair may be similar to or identical to a first-stage PCR primer pair or may be nested within the first-stage primer pair. Movement of the sample from blister <b>564</b> to the second-stage wells <b>582</b> completes the PCR reaction mixture. Once high density array <b>581</b> is filled, the individual second-stage reactions are sealed in their respective second-stage blisters by any number of means, as is known in the art. Illustrative ways of filling and sealing the high density array <b>581</b> without cross-contamination are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,295, already incorporated by reference. Illustratively, the various reactions in wells <b>582</b> of high density array <b>581</b> are simultaneously thermal cycled, illustratively with one or more Peltier devices, although other means for thermal cycling are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In certain embodiments, second-stage PCR master mix contains the dsDNA binding dye LCGreen&#xae; Plus (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) to generate a signal indicative of amplification. However, it is understood that this dye is illustrative only, and that other signals may be used, including other dsDNA binding dyes and probes that are labeled fluorescently, radioactively, chemiluminescently, enzymatically, or the like, as are known in the art. Alternatively, wells <b>582</b> of high density array <b>581</b> may be provided without a signal, with results reported through subsequent processing.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">When pneumatic pressure is used to move materials within pouch <b>510</b>, in one embodiment a &#x201c;bladder&#x201d; may be employed. The bladder assembly <b>810</b>, a portion of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, includes a bladder plate <b>824</b> housing a plurality of inflatable bladders <b>822</b>, <b>844</b>, <b>846</b>, <b>848</b>, <b>864</b>, and <b>866</b>, each of which may be individually inflatable, illustratively by a compressed gas source. Because the bladder assembly <b>810</b> may be subjected to compressed gas and used multiple times, the bladder assembly <b>810</b> may be made from tougher or thicker material than the pouch. Alternatively, bladders <b>822</b>, <b>844</b>, <b>846</b>, <b>848</b>, <b>864</b>, and <b>866</b> may be formed from a series of plates fastened together with gaskets, seals, valves, and pistons. Other arrangements are within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Success of the secondary PCR reactions is dependent upon template generated by the multiplex first-stage reaction. Typically, PCR is performed using DNA of high purity. Methods such as phenol extraction or commercial DNA extraction kits provide DNA of high purity. Samples processed through the pouch <b>510</b> may require accommodations be made to compensate for a less pure preparation. PCR may be inhibited by components of biological samples, which is a potential obstacle. Illustratively, hot-start PCR, higher concentration of taq polymerase enzyme, adjustments in MgCl<sub>2 </sub>concentration, adjustments in primer concentration, and addition of adjuvants (such as DMSO, TMSO, or glycerol) optionally may be used to compensate for lower nucleic acid purity. While purity issues are likely to be more of a concern with first-stage amplification and single-stage PCR, it is understood that similar adjustments may be provided in the second-stage amplification as well.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">When pouch <b>510</b> is placed within the instrument <b>800</b>, the bladder assembly <b>810</b> is pressed against one face of the pouch <b>510</b>, so that if a particular bladder is inflated, the pressure will force the liquid out of the corresponding blister in the pouch <b>510</b>. In addition to bladders corresponding too many of the blisters of pouch <b>510</b>, the bladder assembly <b>810</b> may have additional pneumatic actuators, such as bladders or pneumatically-driven pistons, corresponding to various channels of pouch <b>510</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show an illustrative plurality of pistons or hard seals <b>838</b>, <b>843</b>, <b>852</b>, <b>853</b>, and <b>865</b> that correspond to channels <b>538</b>, <b>543</b>, <b>553</b>, and <b>565</b> of pouch <b>510</b>, as well as seals <b>871</b>, <b>872</b>, <b>873</b>, <b>874</b> that minimize backflow into fitment <b>590</b>. When activated, hard seals <b>838</b>, <b>843</b>, <b>852</b>, <b>853</b>, and <b>865</b> form pinch valves to pinch off and close the corresponding channels. To confine liquid within a particular blister of pouch <b>510</b>, the hard seals are activated over the channels leading to and from the blister, such that the actuators function as pinch valves to pinch the channels shut. Illustratively, to mix two volumes of liquid in different blisters, the pinch valve actuator sealing the connecting channel is activated, and the pneumatic bladders over the blisters are alternately pressurized, forcing the liquid back and forth through the channel connecting the blisters to mix the liquid therein. The pinch valve actuators may be of various shapes and sizes and may be configured to pinch off more than one channel at a time. While pneumatic actuators are discussed herein, it is understood that other ways of providing pressure to the pouch are contemplated, including various electromechanical actuators such as linear stepper motors, motor-driven cams, rigid paddles driven by pneumatic, hydraulic or electromagnetic forces, rollers, rocker-arms, and in some cases, cocked springs. In addition, there are a variety of methods of reversibly or irreversibly closing channels in addition to applying pressure normal to the axis of the channel. These include kinking the bag across the channel, heat-sealing, rolling an actuator, and a variety of physical valves sealed into the channel such as butterfly valves and ball valves. Additionally, small Peltier devices or other temperature regulators may be placed adjacent the channels and set at a temperature sufficient to freeze the fluid, effectively forming a seal. Also, while the design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is adapted for an automated instrument featuring actuator elements positioned over each of the blisters and channels, it is also contemplated that the actuators could remain stationary, and the pouch <b>510</b> could be transitioned in one or two dimensions such that a small number of actuators could be used for several of the processing stations including sample disruption, nucleic-acid capture, first and second-stage PCR, and other applications of the pouch <b>510</b> such as immuno-assay and immuno-PCR. Rollers acting on channels and blisters could prove particularly useful in a configuration in which the pouch <b>510</b> is translated between stations. Thus, while pneumatic actuators are used in the presently disclosed embodiments, when the term &#x201c;pneumatic actuator&#x201d; is used herein, it is understood that other actuators and other ways of providing pressure may be used, depending on the configuration of the pouch and the instrument.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Other prior art instruments teach PCR within a sealed flexible container.

linear model. When the linear model is used to normalize, all analyte assays show some reduction in the standard deviation of the distribution of Tm values. When the linear model is not used to normalize, most analyte assays still show some reduction in the standard deviation of the distribution of Tm values. In any case, reduction of the standard deviation may enable tighter Tm ranges, producing greater specificity and sensitivity. This normalization performs the best when reducing variability for a constant amplicon level, as seen in QC data. The normalization can reduce variability, to a lesser degree, from different concentrations of amplicon, as seen in the LoD data. The normalization can also reduce variability when dealing with multiple sources of irregularity, as seen in Trend data.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 5</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0198">Next, Tm values were clustered, normalized, and plotted to investigate whether these clusters would align with calculated sequence Tm value distributions.

Combining these normalizations can further increase the precision of the Tm measurement. It has been observed that higher concentrations of dsDNA binding dyes (such as LCGreen Plus) lead to increases in Tm. This is thought to be due to DNA bound with the dsDNA binding dye requiring slightly more energy in order for the strands to disassociate. Generally speaking, a lower final concentration of template will lead to higher amounts of bound dye per template strand, resulting in higher Tms. It is possible to estimate final concentration using assay Cp, and therefore normalize the Tms to account for this effect. It is understood that the magnitude of this effect will vary from dye to dye, and the Cp correction may need to be adjusted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0249">732 total pouches were run, with 246 alpha, 243 beta, and 243 gamma, each of which are sets of target nucleic acids that should result in amplification of a specific subset of the targets on the panel.
