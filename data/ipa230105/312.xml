In particular, aspects of the disclosure relate to medical systems, devices, and methods for performing a medical procedure using, in some embodiments, a medical device capable of being inserted through an insertion device and into the body to treat a treatment site and deflecting or otherwise positioning the medical device relative to a distal end of the insertion device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wide variety of medical techniques and instruments have been developed for diagnosis and/or treatment within a patient's body, such as within a patient's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic sub-mucosal resection (ESR), mucosal resection (EMR), polypectomy, mucosectomy, etc., are minimally invasive treatment methods for both malignant and non-malignant lesions. Endoscopic medical procedures, such as, for example, ESR, may be used to excise sessile adenomas or other unwanted tissue (e.g., tumors attached to a bodily surface) from the surface of an anatomical lumen (e.g., stomach, esophagus, colon, etc.). Such procedures often require the resection of one tissue plane while leaving an underlying tissue plane intact, or other precise treatments. Commonly, snares or other medical devices are used during such medical procedures, for resecting tissue from a treatment site. However, many conventional snares or medical devices operate in only one degree of freedom, and deflection of the snare (or another end effector) is often limited and/or dependent on the tip deflection of an endoscope or other device used for insertion into the patient. Furthermore, devices that may allow for separate deflection may require a number of operators, multiple hands, various movements of the hands, wrists, arms, etc. of the operator(s), an increased cognitive load on the operator(s) to obtain the desired movement, and/or other issues These concerns may increase the duration, costs, and risks of the medical procedure. The devices and methods of this disclosure may rectify some of the deficiencies described above or address other aspects of the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of this disclosure relate to, among other things, systems, devices, and methods for performing one or more medical procedures.

In at least one example, port <b>36</b>A may include a one-way valve having an outer housing containing an inner elastomeric and/or gelatinous sealing member. Although not shown, one or more lumens, tubes, conduits, channels, etc. may be positioned within insertion device <b>12</b> and/or medical device <b>14</b> and may fluidly connect port <b>36</b>A to electrode <b>38</b>, for example, to deliver fluid out of electrode outlet <b>38</b>C.

The energy source may be, for example, an electrocautery source, a radio frequency generator, a heating source, a current generator, etc. In other aspects, the energy source may be a part of medical device handle <b>26</b> (e.g., an internal battery in medical device handle <b>26</b>). Although not shown, one or more actuators (e.g., foot pedals, buttons, switches, etc.) may control the delivery of energy from the energy source, and thus control the delivery of energy from electrode <b>38</b>. Alternatively, medical device <b>14</b> may be used to apply suction. In this example, medical device handle <b>26</b> may include a suction port, for example, to couple medical device handle <b>26</b> and medical device shaft <b>28</b> to a suction source.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In at least one aspect, medical device <b>14</b> may be used for monopolar electrosurgery, and may include a return electrode positioned remotely from electrode <b>38</b> on or otherwise adjacent to the subject.

Adapter <b>16</b> also includes a distal portion <b>16</b>B, for example, configured to be coupled to a portion of port <b>22</b>. As mentioned, adapter <b>16</b> may be positioned on or over or otherwise coupled to port <b>22</b> of insertion device handle <b>18</b>, and medical device shaft <b>28</b> may be inserted through adapter <b>16</b>, into port <b>22</b>, and through the working channel of insertion device <b>12</b> to distal end <b>20</b>A of insertion device shaft <b>20</b>. Port <b>22</b> may include a one-way valve, a luer, a seal, threading, and/or any appropriate connection or mating element to help maintain a secure connection between insertion device handle <b>18</b> and adapter <b>16</b>, inhibit, minimize, or prevent back-flow (e.g., fluid flowing proximally out of port <b>22</b>), and/or inhibit, minimize, or prevent leakage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, adapter <b>16</b> may help to form a fulcrum or pivot point for medical device handle <b>26</b>, for example, such that main handle body <b>26</b>A may move relative to socket body <b>26</b>B. Adapter <b>16</b> may also help to allow for medical device <b>14</b>, and thus medical device shaft <b>28</b> to move proximally or distally relative to insertion device <b>12</b>, allowing for distal end <b>30</b> of medical device shaft <b>28</b> to move relative to insertion device distal end <b>20</b>A.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, distal portion <b>16</b>B of adapter <b>16</b> may include one or more slits <b>42</b>A, for example, extending longitudinally in a portion of distal portion <b>16</b>B. In some configurations, a distal portion of the one or more slits <b>42</b>A may be wider than a proximal portion of the one or more slits <b>42</b>A. Adapter <b>16</b> may also include a lock nut <b>42</b>B and threading <b>42</b>C, for example, on distal portion <b>16</b>B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, lock nut <b>42</b>B may be movable (e.g., rotatable) on threading <b>42</b>C. Although not shown, lock nut <b>42</b>B may include an internal threading that is configured to interact with threading <b>42</b>C. Lock nut <b>42</b>B may include one or more protrusions or grip features <b>42</b>D, for example, to help the user manipulate lock nut <b>42</b>B.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Rotation of lock nut <b>42</b>B on threading <b>42</b>C in a first direction (e.g., clockwise) may translate lock nut <b>42</b>B along adapter <b>16</b> in a first direction (e.g., distally), and rotation of lock nut <b>42</b>B on threading <b>42</b>C in a second direction (e.g., counterclockwise) may translate lock nut <b>42</b>B along adapter <b>16</b> in a second direction (e.g., proximally). In a distalmost position, lock nut <b>42</b>B may at least partially overlap with one or more slits <b>42</b>A.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, port <b>22</b> may include one or more extensions <b>22</b>A, for example, extending radially outward. In this aspect, when adapter <b>16</b> is coupled to port <b>22</b>, projections <b>42</b>E and extensions <b>22</b>A may interact to help secure adapter <b>16</b> to port <b>22</b>. For example, with lock nut <b>42</b>B proximally retracted, distal portion <b>16</b>B may be in a first configuration, for example, with one or more slits <b>42</b>A in open configuration(s). Adapter <b>16</b> may be positioned over a portion of port <b>22</b> of insertion device <b>12</b> with distal portion <b>16</b>B in the first configuration. Then, lock nut <b>42</b>B may be distally translated, for example, via rotation and interaction with threading <b>42</b>C. The movement of lock nut <b>42</b>B may tighten distal portion <b>16</b>B, for example, by reducing the size or width of slits <b>42</b>A, and transitioning distal portion <b>16</b>B into a second configuration, for example, with one or more slits <b>42</b>A in closed configuration(s).

Arced portion <b>16</b>C may help the user to maintain a comfortable, or otherwise suitable, position while handling various components of medical system <b>10</b> (e.g., insertion device <b>12</b> and medical device <b>14</b>). In some aspects, adapter <b>16</b> may be at least partially flexible, for example, allowing a user to manipulate (e.g., bend) adapter <b>16</b> and thus position medical device <b>14</b> in a position that is comfortable or otherwise suitable for the user and the medical procedure. Furthermore, although not shown, adapter <b>16</b> may include a one-way valve, a luer, a seal, and/or any appropriate connection or mating element to help maintain a secure connection between port <b>22</b> and adapter <b>16</b> and/or around medical device shaft <b>28</b>, inhibit, minimize, or prevent back-flow (e.g., fluid flowing proximally out of adapter <b>16</b>), and/or inhibit, minimize, or prevent leakage.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> illustrate various features of the medical device <b>14</b>, including main handle body <b>26</b>A and socket body <b>26</b>B of medical device handle <b>26</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates socket body <b>26</b>B as transparent, allowing internal features of medical device handle <b>26</b> to be visible.

A crimp <b>54</b>C may be positioned around a portion of medical device shaft <b>28</b> within slot <b>54</b>B, for example, to help couple medical device shaft <b>28</b> to medical device handle <b>26</b>. In this aspect, a portion of medical device shaft <b>28</b> and crimp <b>54</b>C may be positioned within channel <b>54</b>A and slot <b>54</b>B of one half of socket body <b>26</b>B, and then the other half of socket body <b>26</b>B may be coupled to the first half of socket body <b>26</b>B to enclose the portion of medical device shaft <b>28</b> and crimp <b>54</b>C. Crimp <b>54</b>C may move (i.e., proximally and/or distally) within slot <b>54</b>B as insertion device shaft <b>20</b>, and thus medical device shaft <b>28</b>, moves (e.g., bends) within the patient, for example, as insertion device shaft <b>20</b> and medical device shaft <b>28</b> traverse a tortuous path within the patient.

Each wire mount <b>48</b> may include a wire slot <b>48</b>A, for example, extending in a longitudinal direction of main handle body <b>26</b>A. Wire slots <b>48</b>A may help align each steering wire <b>50</b> with each wire mount <b>48</b>, which may help prevent steering wire <b>50</b> from crimpling, etc. Each wire slot <b>48</b>A may be connected to or otherwise adjacent to a wire opening <b>48</b>B, for example, extending approximately perpendicular to wire slot <b>48</b>A along an outer circumference of ball portion <b>22</b>. For example, wire openings <b>48</b>B may be radially inward extending indentations in the outer circumference of ball portion <b>22</b>. Additionally, wire openings <b>48</b>B may include crimping slots <b>48</b>C. Crimping slots <b>48</b>C may be formed by ball portion <b>34</b>, for example, by a base portion <b>48</b>D and an extended portion <b>48</b>E. In these aspects, one steering wire <b>50</b> may be positioned within wire slot <b>48</b>A, wire opening <b>48</b>B, and crimping slot <b>48</b>C. Extended portion <b>48</b>E may be brought toward (e.g., compressed toward) base portion <b>48</b>D, for example, with pliers, a vice, or other force applying mechanism, in order to form a crimp and secure steering wire <b>50</b> within wire mount <b>48</b>, for example, within wire slot <b>48</b>A. This process may be performed for each steering wire <b>50</b> and each wire mount <b>48</b>. Additionally, any portion of steering wire <b>50</b> that extends proximal to or beyond wire mount <b>48</b> may be cut, tied off, or otherwise removed or positioned to not interfere with the movement of main handle body <b>26</b>A. Furthermore, the crimp that secures each steering wire <b>50</b> may be positioned approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of main handle body <b>26</b>A.
