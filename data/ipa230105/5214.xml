Modification of Present Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The disclosed embodiments are not limited to the embodiments described above and may be carried out in various modes without departing from the spirit thereof, and for example, the following modifications are possible.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Modification 1</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the description according to the present embodiment, the biomagnetic field information acquisition portion <b>511</b> acquires the biomagnetic field information from the magnetic sensor array <b>10</b>. However, the biomagnetic field information acquisition portion <b>511</b> may include a sensor that acquires the biomagnetic field from the human body <b>90</b>. Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> includes the CT device <b>40</b>. However, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may omit the CT device <b>40</b>. For example, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may acquire the image information from a CT device outside the medical apparatus <b>1</b> or may acquire the image information from a storage medium storing the image information. Furthermore, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may include an MRI device instead of the CT device <b>40</b>. The image information acquisition portion <b>515</b> may acquire the image information including an MRI image, and the model image generation portion <b>521</b> may generate the organ model image SI and the three-dimensional heart model OM from the image information including the MRI image. An existing technique is applicable as the technique of generating the three-dimensional organ model OM from the image information including the MRI image. Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> includes the electrocardiograph <b>80</b>. However, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may omit the electrocardiograph <b>80</b>. For example, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may acquire the electrocardiographic information from an electrocardiograph outside the medical apparatus <b>1</b>. Further, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may not acquire the electrocardiographic information. Further, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may omit the healthy subject biopotential magnetic information. Even in this case, the abnormality of the magnetic field is specified from the biomagnetic field information (the first magnetic field information) so as to detect the lesion position information.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Modification 2</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The synthetic image CI is displayed such that at least one of the lesion position image LI, the magnetic field strength distribution image MI, and the device position image PI is superimposed on the organ model image SI. However, in the synthetic image CI, each of the organ model image SI, the lesion position image LI, the magnetic field strength distribution image MI, and the device position image PI may be represented apart. Furthermore, on the display screen <b>61</b>, the organ model image SI, the lesion position image LI, the magnetic field strength distribution image MI, and the device position image PI may be displayed in different display areas. In this case, the entire image displayed on the display screen <b>61</b> is the synthetic image CI.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Modification 3</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the device position image PI and the lesion position image LI, the mode (color) of the image changes in accordance with the difference in the position of the corresponding virtual plane VP. However, in the device position image PI and the lesion position image LI, the mode of the image may be unchanged and fixed even when the position of the corresponding virtual plane VP changes. Furthermore, the shapes of the device position image PI and the lesion position image LI may be switched as appropriate in accordance with the operation of the operating portion <b>70</b>. The device position image PI may have a shape representing the shape of the distal end portion of the catheter <b>20</b>. The synthetic image CI according to the present embodiment includes the one device position image PI corresponding to the distal end portion of the one catheter <b>20</b>. However, the synthetic image CI may include the plurality of device position images PI corresponding to the distal end portions of the plurality of catheters, respectively. Here, by the operation of the operating portion <b>70</b>, among the device position images PI, only the device position image PI corresponding to the selected catheter may be displayed. That is, the catheter of which the device position image PI is displayed may be switched by the operation of the operating portion <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the device position images PI may have different shapes from each other.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Modification 4</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The content of the magnetic field strength distribution image MI illustrated according to the present embodiment is an example, and the content of the magnetic field strength distribution image MI is not limited to the content according to the above-described embodiment. For example, in the magnetic field strength distribution image MI according to the above embodiment, the strength of the biomagnetic field MFh is represented in a contour, but the strength of the biomagnetic field MFh may be represented using the difference in the color, a numerical value, or a line graph. Furthermore, the orientation of the biomagnetic field MFh may be represented by a triangle, symbol, etc. Furthermore, the magnetic field strength distribution image MI may be replaced with the image representing the flow and density of the current generated by the living body. Even in this case, it can be said that the image representing the flow and density of the current generated by the living body is the image indicating the strength of the biomagnetic field.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Modification 5</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The display example of the display screen <b>61</b> according to the present embodiment is an example, and displays other than the display example described above may be used. Part of the above-described display example may be undisplayed, and other images may be added. For example, the first window FW may be undisplayed, or the blood pressure and the image of the operating portion may be displayed.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Modification 6</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the description, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is used for arrhythmia treatment. However, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may be used for treatments other than arrhythmia treatment. Furthermore, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may also be used for treatment of organs other than the heart. For example, the medical apparatus <b>1</b> may be used for treatment of the brain. In this case, the magnetic sensor array <b>10</b> may have a hat shape that is worn by the human body <b>90</b> to be treated.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Modification 7</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the description, the catheter <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is a cautery catheter using plasma. However, the cautery method by the catheter <b>20</b> may be not only generation of plasma but also flowing of high-frequency currents or irradiation of lasers. Furthermore, it may be used for not only cauterization but also injection of drugs by puncture or for other applications.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Modification 8</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the catheter <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment, the marker <b>24</b> and the distal tip <b>22</b> are configured as separate members. However, the marker <b>24</b> and the distal tip <b>22</b> may not be separate members. For example, a cauterization high-frequency current and a position-detection current are alternately applied to the distal tip <b>22</b> so that the distal tip <b>22</b> may be provided with the function of a marker. Furthermore, although the medical apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes the catheter <b>20</b>, it may include a medical tool such as a guide wire, endoscope, or dilator instead of the catheter <b>20</b>. In this case, the synthetic image CI may be used to display the relative position of the distal end portion of the medical tool with respect to the biomagnetic field distribution.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Modification 9</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the description, the catheter <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is configured to use the magnetic field generated when the current flows through the coil as the marker <b>24</b>. However, the use of a permanent magnet as the marker <b>24</b> may eliminate the need of the current flowing through the coil as the marker <b>24</b> to check the distal end position of the catheter. Furthermore, the magnetic field strength generated by the permanent magnet is constant, and therefore the magnetic field strength that is supposed to be generated by the living body may be determined by obtaining the difference between the magnetic field strength detected by the magnetic sensor array <b>10</b> and the magnetic field strength generated by the permanent magnet. However, in a case where the permanent magnet is used as the marker <b>24</b>, when the magnetic field strength generated by the permanent magnet is extremely larger than the magnetic field strength generated by the living tissue, it is difficult to properly detect the magnetic field generated by the living tissue with the magnetic sensor array <b>10</b>. Therefore, it is desirable that the magnetic field strength generated by the permanent magnet is equal to or less than 100 times the magnetic field strength generated by the living tissue.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Modification 10</heading><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The configuration according to the present embodiment is also applicable to apparatuses other than medical apparatuses. For example, the configuration according to the present embodiment is also applicable to examination systems, examination methods, image generation apparatuses, image generation methods, etc.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although the present mode has been described above based on an exemplary embodiment and modifications, the embodiment described above is to facilitate understanding of the present mode and not to limit the present mode. The present mode may be modified or improved without departing from the spirit thereof and the scope of claims, and the present mode includes the equivalent thereof.
