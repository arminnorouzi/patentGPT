As a solutions for implementing such remote work, there is a desktop virtualization technology (VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) connection), for example. Furthermore, recent improvements in technologies such as network speed and security have enabled one to do their work for their company from home just as well. As the demand for such remote work increases, the demand for printing files that are in the company using a PC and a printer at home also increases. For this demand, there is a print system (a job management service) which can print files via the Internet using a printer at home by connecting a VDI to the company's intranet. By using this service, a user can acquire a printout of a file of the company even if they are at home.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In Japanese Patent No. 4872631, a print job that has been printed out by a client is stored in a print server, and when a user card is held over a card reader of a printer, the user is authenticated by user information stored in the card and the print server storing the print job of the user is specified. Japanese Patent No. 4872631 describes a service in which print jobs of the user are requested from the specified print server and the print server searches for the print jobs, displays a list of the found print jobs, prompts the user to select a desired print job, and then prints it.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a business model in which a company that owns printing apparatuses rents out a printing apparatus to a user. By connecting a device for user authentication and then authenticating using a card or inputting a password via the device by employing the technology described in Japanese Patent No. 4872631, printing is executed only for an authenticated user, and thereby, erroneous printing can be prevented. However, if printing apparatuses are managed with such a device for authentication being connected to the printing apparatuses, the burden on a company renting out the printing apparatuses increases.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the present invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned problem with

The information terminal <b>101</b> is an information terminal such as a PC or a smartphone owned by a user. A Web browser <b>106</b> is installed and available on the information terminal <b>101</b>. The printing apparatus <b>102</b> is a printing apparatus owned by the user. A request module <b>107</b> (a web browser) that can make a request via the Internet is installed and is available on the printing apparatus <b>102</b>. In the embodiment, although the printing apparatus <b>102</b> communicates with the job management server <b>104</b> by a web application on a browser, communication may be performed via firmware mounted on the printing apparatus <b>102</b>, and the present invention is not limited to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The job management server <b>104</b> provides a function for storing a file uploaded by a user, issuing a print code, creating a print job with a print code, accepting a print code, creating a print job based on the accepted print code, and the like. Here, the print code is a unique code issued by the job management server <b>104</b> by the information terminal <b>101</b> requesting the job management server <b>104</b> to issue a print job based on a file uploaded by the user. The print code thus issued by the job management server <b>104</b> is notified to the information terminal <b>101</b>, and the print code is used when instructing printing from the printing apparatus <b>102</b> as described later.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The job management server <b>104</b> that has received the print code generates a print job based on the print code and requests the printer management server <b>105</b> to perform printing. By this, the printer management server <b>105</b> transmits a print job to the printing apparatus <b>102</b> and thereby causes it to execute printing. The printer management server <b>105</b> also stores information relating to the printing apparatus <b>102</b>.

The print code information DB <b>404</b> stores the ID of the printing apparatus, print code, user ID, expiration date, and print job information of the printing apparatus. This print code will become unavailable after the expiration date.

Here, a print code is uniquely determined and registered for an ID of each printing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, by virtue of the embodiment, a print job is generated in association with an ID of a printing apparatus, user information, and a print code. As a result, when a user inputs a print code in the printing apparatus, the user ID, the print code, and the ID of the printing apparatus are transmitted to the job management server <b>104</b> from the printing apparatus. The job management server <b>104</b> searches for a target print job based on the print code information, and when the target print job is found, a print command for the print job is issued to the printing apparatus. This allows the user to perform the hold printing simply by entering the print code, without requiring complicated authentication work, a separate authentication device, or the like. This can prevent erroneous printing even in, for example, a business model in which a printing apparatus is rented to a user.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the above-described embodiment, description has been given using an example in which the job management server <b>104</b> and the printer management server <b>105</b> are provided; however, as described above, one server may have the functions of these two servers.
