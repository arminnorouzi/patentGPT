It has been estimated that about 80% of all carcinomas express the truncated glycans, the Tn Antigen and the sialylated form, Sialyl Tn (STn). With few exceptions, Tn and STn are not expressed in normal, healthy tissues. Furthermore, the non-human immunogenic sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), seems to be differentially expressed on carcinomas such as breast cancer in the form of Neu5Gc-STn (GcSTn).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple aberrant glycosylation forms have been described in human cancers, identifying specific glycans as a class of cell surface molecules suitable for specific tumor targeting (Cheever, M. A. et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep. 1; 15(17):5323-37). For example, various human cancer types (such as bladder, breast, cervical, colon, lung, and ovarian cancer among others) show high expression of STn antigen, which is rare in normal human tissues (Karlen, P. et al., Gastroenterology. 1998 December;11 5(6):1395-404; Ohno, S. et al, Anticancer Res. 2006 November-December;26(6A):4047-53). In addition, the presence of STn on tumor-associated mucins relates to cancer with poor prognosis and is therewith considered an attractive epitope for cancer detection and targeted therapy (Cao, Y. et al., Virchows Arch. 1997 September;431(3):159-66; Julien, S. et al., Br J Cancer. 2009 Jun. 2; 100(11):1746-54; Itzkowitz, S. H. et al., Cancer. 1990 Nov. 1; 66(9):1960-6; Motoo, Y. et al., Oncology. 1991; 48(4):321-6; Kobayashi, H. et al., J Clin Oncol. 1992 January;10(1):95-101). Tn and STn formation is associated with somatic mutations in the gene Cosmc that encodes a molecular chaperon required for the formation of the activate T-synthase (Ju, T. et al., Nature. 2005 Oct. 27; 437(7063):1252; Ju, T. et al., Cancer Res. 2008 Mar. 15; 68(6):1636-46). It can also result from increased expression of the sialyl transferase, ST6GalNAc I (Ikehara, Y. et al., Glycobiology. 1999 November; 9(11):1213-24; Brockhausen, I. et al., Biol Chem. 2001 February;382(2):219-32). De-novo expression of STn can modulate carcinoma cells, change the malignant phenotype, and lead to more aggressive cell behaviors (Pinho, S. et al., Cancer Lett. 2007 May 8; 249(2):157-70). Although STn is highly expressed in malignant tissues, low levels are also found on healthy human cells (Jass, J. R. et al., J Pathol. 1995 June;176(2):143-9; Kirkeby, S. et al., Arch Oral Biol. 2010 November; 55(11):830-41). STn alone has attracted attention as a target for cancer detection and therapy (Cheever, M. A. et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep. 1; 15(17):5323-37). STn is also present in mucins associated with cancer stem cells (Engelmann et al., Cancer research, 2008, 68, 2419-2426) and STn is implicated in immune supression (Carrascal, M. A., et al., Molecular Oncology. 2014. 8(3): 753-65).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the presence of STn, other glycosylation changes have been described in cancer. One of them involves Neu5Gc. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and Neu5Gc are the two major sialic acids on mammalian cell surfaces. Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc differ only in that Neu5Gc includes an additional oxygen atom associated with chemical group attached to carbon 5. Due to the loss of a functional gene, humans can only synthesize sialic acid in the form of Neu5Ac, but not Neu5Gc. However, Neu5Gc can be metabolically incorporated into humans from animal-derived dietary sources such as red meats (Tangvoranuntakul, P. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Oct. 14; 100(21):12045-50; Nguyen, D. H. et al., J Immunol. 2005 Jul. 1; 175(1):228-36; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,682,794, 8,084,219, US2012/0142903, WO2010030666 and WO2010030666). Neu5Gc is significantly abundant among human tumors (Higashi, H. et al., Cancer Res. 1985 August; 45(8):3796-802; Miyoshi I. et al., Mol Immunol. 1986. 23: 631-638; Hirabayashi, Y. et al., Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987. 78: 614-620; Kawachi. S, et al., Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol. 1988. 85: 381-383; Devine, P. L. et al., Cancer Res. 1991. 51: 5826-5836; Malykh, Y. N. et al, Biochimie. 2001. 83: 623-634 and Inoue, S. et al., 2010. Glycobiology. 20(6): 752-762) and remarkably low in normal human tissues, which had been overlooked for several decades (Diaz, S. L. et al., PLoS One. 2009. 4: e4241; Tangvoranuntakul, P. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003. 100: 12045-12050; Varki, A. et al., Glycoconj J. 2009. 26: 231-245). The increased metabolic accumulation of diet-derived Neu5Gc in cancer tissue compared to healthy human tissues is likely explained by at least three factors: rapid growth with underproduction of competing endogenous Neu5Ac, enhanced macropinocytosis induced by growth factors (Dharmawardhane, S. et al., Mol Biol Cell. 2000 October;11(10):3341-52; Simonsen, A. et al., Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2001 August; 13(4):485-92; Johannes, L. et al., Traffic. 2002 July; 3(7):443-51; Amyere, M. et al., Int J Med Microbiol. 2002 February;291(6-7):487-94), and the upregulation of gene expression of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter gene sialin by hypoxia (Yin, J. et al., Cancer Res. 2006 Mar. 15; 66(6):2937-45). In addition, all humans tested to date include a polyclonal antibody reservoir against non-human Neu5Gc, which makes it the first example of a xeno-autoantigen (Padler-Karavani, V. et al., Glycobiology. 2008 October;18(10):818-30; Varki, N. M. et al., Annu Rev Pathol. 2011; 6:365-93). The accumulation of dietary Neu5Gc in malignant tumors in the face of an anti-Neu5Gc response was shown to facilitate tumor progression by inducing a low-grade chronic inflammation (Hedlund, M. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 Dec. 2; 105(48):18936-41). Thus, Neu5Gc containing glycan epitopes on human tumors represent a valuable possibility for drug targeting. A recent study suggests the existence of antibodies against Neu5Gc-containing STn (GcSTn), but not Neu5Ac-STn (AcSTn), in cancer patients and explores their potential as a specific biomarker for cancer detection (Padler-Karavani, V. et al., Cancer Res. 2011 May 1; 71(9):3352-63).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There remains a need in the art for therapeutic antibodies capable of binding glycans, including glycans associated with disease and diseased cells and tissues.

Amino sugars may also be monomers within a glycan. Glycans including such sugars are herein referred to as aminoglycans. Amino sugars, as used herein, are sugar molecules that include an amine group in place of a hydroxyl group, or in some embodiments, a sugar derived from such a sugar. Examples of amino sugars include, but are not limited to glucosamine, galactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, sialic acids (including, but not limited to, N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid) and L-daunosamine.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As used herein the term &#x201c;glycan-interacting antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that can interact with a glycan moiety.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is used in the broadest sense and embraces various formats including, but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies), antibody conjugates (including, but not limited to antibody-drug conjugates), antibody variants [including, but not limited to antibody mimetics, chimeric antibodies (e.g. antibodies with amino acid sequences derived from more than one species), and synthetic variants], and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit a desired biological activity (e.g., binding, activating, inhibiting, stabilizing, degrading, and/or modulating one or more targets). Antibodies are primarily amino-acid based molecules but may include one or more post-translational or synthetic modifications. Post-translational modifications may include glycosylation.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refers to a portion of an intact antibody or fusion-protein thereof, in some cases including at least one antigen binding region. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fv fragments, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs); diabodies; tri(a)bodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site. Also produced is a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Glycan-interacting antibodies may include one or more of these fragments and may, for example, be generated through enzymatic digestion of whole antibodies or through recombinant expression.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">&#x201c;Native antibodies&#x201d; are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Genes encoding antibody heavy and light chains are known and segments making up each have been well characterized and described (Matsuda, F. et al., 1998. The Journal of Experimental Medicine. 188(11); 2151-62 and Li, A. et al., 2004. Blood. 103(12: 4602-9, the content of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable domain&#x201d; refers to specific antibody domains found on both the antibody heavy and light chains that differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. Variable domains include hypervariable regions. As used herein, the term &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; refers to a region within a variable domain that includes amino acid residues responsible for antigen binding. The amino acids present within the hypervariable regions determine the structure of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that become part of the antigen-binding site of the antibody. As used herein, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refers to a region of an antibody that includes a structure that is complimentary to its target antigen or epitope. Other portions of the variable domain, not interacting with the antigen, are referred to as framework (FW) regions. The antigen-binding site (also known as the antigen combining site or paratope) includes the amino acid residues necessary to interact with a particular antigen. The exact residues making up the antigen-binding site are typically elucidated by co-crystallography with bound antigen, however computational assessments can also be used based on comparisons with other antibodies (Strohl, W.R. Therapeutic Antibody Engineering. Woodhead Publishing, Philadelphia Pa. 2012. Ch. 3, p 47-54, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).

Each of CDRs have favored canonical structures with the exception of the CDR-H3, which includes amino acid sequences that may be highly variable in sequence and length between antibodies resulting in a variety of three-dimensional structures in antigen-binding domains (Nikoloudis, D. et al., 2014. Peed. 2:e456). In some cases, CDR-H3s may be analyzed among a panel of related antibodies to assess antibody diversity. Various methods of determining CDR sequences are known in the art and may be applied to known antibody sequences (Strohl, W.R. Therapeutic Antibody Engineering.

These regions consist of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. Fv fragments can be generated by proteolytic cleavage, but are largely unstable. Recombinant methods are known in the art for generating stable Fv fragments, typically through insertion of a flexible linker between the light chain variable domain and the heavy chain variable domain [to form a single chain Fv (scFv)] or through the introduction of a disulfide bridge between heavy and light chain variable domains (Strohl, W.R. Therapeutic Antibody Engineering. Woodhead Publishing, Philadelphia Pa. 2012.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">As used herein, the term &#x201c;single chain Fv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; refers to a fusion protein of VH and VL antibody domains, wherein these domains are linked together into a single polypeptide chain by a flexible peptide linker. In some embodiments, the Fv polypeptide linker enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. In some embodiments, scFvs are utilized in conjunction with phage display, yeast display or other display methods where they may be expressed in association with a surface member (e.g. phage coat protein) and used in the identification of high affinity peptides for a given antigen.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments include a heavy chain variable domain V<sub>H </sub>connected to a light chain variable domain V<sub>L </sub>in the same polypeptide chain. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The term &#x201c;intrabody&#x201d; refers to a form of antibody that is not secreted from a cell in which it is produced, but instead target one or more intracellular protein. Intrabodies may be used to affect a multitude of cellular processes including, but not limited to intracellular trafficking, transcription, translation, metabolic processes, proliferative signaling and cell division. In some embodiments, methods of the present invention may include intrabody-based therapies. In some such embodiments, variable domain sequences and/or CDR sequences disclosed herein may be incorporated into one or more construct for intrabody-based therapy. In some cases, intrabodies of the invention may target one or more glycated intracellular protein or may modulate the interaction between one or more glycated intracellular protein and an alternative protein.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The term &#x201c;chimeric antigen receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;CAR&#x201d; as used herein, refers to artificial receptors that are engineered to be expressed on the surface of immune effector cells resulting in specific targeting of such immune effector cells to cells expressing entities that bind with high affinity to the artificial receptors. CARs may be designed to include one or more segments of an antibody, antibody variable domain and/or antibody CDR, such that when such CARs are expressed on immune effector cells, the immune effector cells bind and clear any cells that are recognized by the antibody portions of the CARs. In some cases, CARs are designed to specifically bind cancer cells, leading to immune-regulated clearance of the cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous cells (or clones), i.e., the individual antibodies making up the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.

Humanized antibodies may include one or more back-mutation that include the reversion of one or more amino acids back to amino acids found in a donor antibody. Conversely, residues from donor antibodies included in humanized antibodies may be mutated to match residues present in human recipient antibodies.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies of the present invention may be antibody mimetics. The term &#x201c;antibody mimetic&#x201d; refers to any molecule which mimics the function or effect of an antibody and which binds specifically and with high affinity to their molecular targets. In some embodiments, antibody mimetics may be monobodies, designed to incorporate the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) as a protein scaffold (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,673,901; 6,348,584). In some embodiments, antibody mimetics may be those known in the art including, but are not limited to affibody molecules, affilins, affitins, anticalins, avimers, DARPins, Fynomers and Kunitz and domain peptides. In other embodiments, antibody mimetics may include one or more non-peptide region.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody variant&#x201d; refers to a biomolecule resembling an antibody in structure, sequence and/or function, but including some differences in their amino acid sequence, composition or structure as compared to another antibody or a native antibody.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Antibody Development</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Glycan-interacting antibodies of the present invention are developed to bind antigens such as those described herein. As used herein, an &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; is an entity which induces or evokes an immune response in an organism. An immune response is characterized by the reaction of the cells, tissues and/or organs of an organism to the presence of a foreign entity. Such an immune response typically leads to the production by the organism of one or more antibodies against the foreign entity, e.g., antigen or a portion of the antigen. In some cases, methods of immunization may be altered based on one or more desired immunization outcomes. As used here, the term &#x201c;immunization outcome&#x201d; refers to one or more desired effects of immunization. Examples include high antibody titers and/or increased antibody specificity for a target of interest.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Antigens of the invention may include glycans, glycoconjugates (including, but not limited to glycoproteins and glycolipids), peptides, polypeptides, fusion proteins, or any of the foregoing and may be conjugated or complexed to one or more separate adjuvants or heterologous proteins. In some embodiments, antigens used according to methods of the present invention may include sialylated glycans, such as STn. Antigens having STn may include mucins. Mucins are a family of proteins that are heavily glycosylated. They are a component of many tumors originating from epithelial cells (Ishida, A. et al., 2008. Proteomics. 8: 3342-9, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). They are highly expressed by submaxillary glands and can be found at high levels in saliva and mucous. Animal-derived submaxillary mucins may be used as antigens to generate anti-STn antibodies in immunogenic hosts. Submaxillary mucin from different species differ in their STn content with regard to AcSTn versus GcSTn forms. Porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM) is particularly rich in GcSTn, which makes up about 90% of total STn. STn from bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) includes roughly equal percentages of GcSTn and AcSTn. Ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM) is particularly rich in AcSTn, which makes up about 90% of total STn. In some cases, solutions prepared for immunization may be modified to include one or more of PSM, BSM and OSM depending on the desired target of antibodies resulting from such immunization. PSM may be used in immunizations to generate antibodies in immunogenic hosts that are more likely to be specific for GcSTn. PSM is rich in Neu5Gc-containing mucin-type, glycoproteins that are decorated with GcSTn. Among the currently known sources of high Neu5Gc content is red meat; especially submaxillary glands were previously described as a rich source of Neu5Gc due to the high expression of the CMAH enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction to produce the Neu5Gc precursor, CMP-Neu5Ac. In some cases, PSM may be used to prevent a pan-anti-Neu5Gc response and induce a more specific immune response against GcSTn. OSM may be used in immunizations to generate antibodies in immunogenic hosts that are more likely to be specific for AcSTn.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a glycan-interacting antibody that is GcSTn-specific. The antibody has little cross-reactivity to Neu5Ac-STn or Tn. The antibody can bind GcSTn but has reduced affinity for AcSTn.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, antigens may be subjected to enzymatic digestion prior to immunization to modulate the resulting immune response in immunogenic hosts. In one example, submaxillary mucins may be treated with trypsin or proteinase K enzymes prior to immunization. The activity of such enzymes may help to cleave off and thereby reduce the percentage and variability of non-STn epitopes. Glycan moieties may shield regions of the peptide where they are attached from enzymatic proteolysis and thereby remain intact.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Antibody titers resulting from immunizations may have different antibody levels depending on the type and amount of antigen used in such immunizations. In some cases, certain antigens may be selected for use in immunizations based on the expected titer.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As used herein, an &#x201c;adjuvant&#x201d; is a pharmacological or immunological agent that modifies the effect of other agents. Adjuvants according to the present invention include, but are not limited chemical compositions, biomolecules, therapeutics, and/or therapeutic regimens. Adjuvants may include Freund's adjuvant (complete and/or incomplete), immunostimulatory oligonucleotides [e.g. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs)], mineral-containing compositions, bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins, bioadhesives, mucoadhesives, microparticles, lipids, liposomes, muramyl peptides, N-oxidized polyethylene-piperazine derivatives, saponins and/or immune stimulating complexes (ISCOs). In some embodiments, adjuvants may include oil-in-water emulsions (e.g. sub-micron oil-in-water emulsions).

In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may be labeled for purposes of detection with a detectable label known by one of skill in the art. The label can be a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, enzyme, or enzyme co-factor, or any other labels known in the art. In some aspects, the antibody that binds to a desired antigen is not labeled, but may be detected by binding of a labeled secondary antibody that specifically binds to the primary antibody.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Antibodies of the present invention (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), intracellularly made antibodies (i.e., intrabodies), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. Antibodies of the present invention (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) can be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, such antibodies are of human, murine (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken origin. The antibodies of the present invention can be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific, trispecific, or of greater multispecificity). Multispecific antibodies can be specific for different epitopes of a target antigen of the present invention, or can be specific for both a target antigen of the present invention, and a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous glycan, peptide or solid support material. (See, e.g., WO 93/17715; WO 92/08802; WO 91/00360; WO 92/05793; Tutt, A. et al., <i>Trispecific F</i>(<i>ab</i>)3 <i>derivatives that use cooperative signaling via the TCR/CD</i>3 <i>complex and CD</i>2 <i>to activate and redirect resting cytotoxic T cells</i>. J Immunol. 1991 Jul. 1; 147(1):60-9; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; and Kostelny, S.

In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibodies are prepared using hybridoma technology (Kohler, G. et al., <i>Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity</i>. Nature. 1975 Aug. 7; 256(5517):495-7). For hybridoma formations, first, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent (e.g., a target antigen of the invention) to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, J. W., <i>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</i>. Academic Press. 1986; 59-1031). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, rabbit, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (&#x201c;HAT medium&#x201d;), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, D. et al., <i>A human hybrid myeloma for production of human monoclonal antibodies</i>. J Immunol. 1984 December; 133(6):3001-5; Brodeur, B. et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York. 1987; 33:51-63).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, myeloma cells may be subjected to genetic manipulation. Such manipulation may be carried out using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) mutagenesis as described herein. Alternatively, transfection methods known in the art may be used. NSO myeloma cells or other mouse myeloma cell lines may be used. For example, Sp2/0-Ag14 can be an alternative cell line for hybridoma development.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs)&#x2014;induced gene editing provides an alternative gene knock out method. TALENs are artificial restriction enzymes generated by fusing the TAL effector DNA binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain. Similar to ZFNs, TALENs induce double-strand breaks at desired loci that can be repaired by error-prone NHEJ to yield insertions/deletions at the break sites (Wood, A. J. et al., Targeted genome editing across species using ZFNs and TALENs. Science. 2011 Jul. 15; 333(6040):307). Cellectis Bioresearch (Cambridge, Mass.) provides the service of TALEN design and plasmid construction. The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies. Preferably, the binding specificity (i.e., specific immunoreactivity) of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known by those skilled in the art. The binding specificity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by Scatchard analysis (Munson, P. J. et al., <i>Ligand: a versatile computerized approach for characterization of ligand</i>-<i>binding systems</i>. Anal Biochem. 1980 Sep. 1; 107(1):220-39). In some cases, antibody specificity for regions of a given antigen may be characterized by chemically modifying the antigens prior to assaying for antibody binding. In one example, periodate treatment may be used to destroy the C6 side chain of sialic acids. Assays may be conducted with and without periodate treatment to reveal whether or not binding in untreated samples is sialic acid-specific. In some cases, antigens having 9-O-acetylated sialic acid may be subjected to mild base treatment (e.g. with 0.1 M NaOH) to destroy 9-O-acetyl groups. Assays may be conducted with and without mild base treatment to reveal whether or not binding in untreated samples depends on 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium or RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Alternative methods to clone hybridomas may include those provided by kits from STEMCELL Technologies (Vancouver, BC, Canada), e.g. ClonaCell&#x2122;-HY kit, containing methylcellulose-based semi-solid medium and other media and reagents, to support the selection and growth of hybridoma clones. However, the media in this kit contain FCS, which provides an exogenous source for Neu5Gc incorporation. Though the machinery for endogenous Neu5Gc synthesis is destroyed in Cmah<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> hybridoma, Neu5Gc incorporated from the culture media may also pose a problem in some cases (Bardor, M. et al., Mechanism of uptake and incorporation of the non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid into human cells. J Biol Chem. 2005. 280: 4228-4237). In such instances, The culture media may be supplemented with Neu5Ac to eliminate Neu5Gc incorporation by metabolic competition (Ghaderi, D. et al., Implications of the presence of N-glycolylneuraminic acid in recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins. Nat Biotechnol. 2010. 28: 863-867).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells. Host cells may include, but are not limited to HEK293 cells, HEK293T cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) may be produced by various procedures known by those skilled in the art. For the production of polyclonal antibodies in vivo, host animals, such as rabbits, rats, mice, cows, horses, donkeys, chickens, monkeys, sheep or goats, are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled antigens, for example, by intraperitoneal and/or intradermal injection. In some embodiments, injection material may be an emulsion containing about 100 &#x3bc;g of antigen or carrier protein. In some embodiments, injection materials may include a glycan-rich composition such as non-human mammalian submaxillary mucin in solution. Various adjuvants can also be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species. Adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, TITERMAX&#xae; (CytRx Corp, Los Angeles, Calif.), keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and <i>Corynebacterium parvum</i>. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using glycans and/or free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of antibodies in serum from an immunized animal can be increased by selection of antibodies, e.g., by adsorption of antigens onto a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Glycan-interacting antibodies, variants and fragments thereof may be selected and produced using high throughput methods of discovery. In one embodiment, glycan-interacting antibodies that include synthetic antibodies, variants and fragments thereof are produced through the use of display libraries. The term &#x201c;display&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the expression or &#x201c;display&#x201d; of proteins or peptides on the surface of a given host. The term &#x201c;library&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a collection of unique cDNA sequences and/or the proteins that are encoded by them. A library may contain from as little as two unique cDNAs to hundreds of billions of unique cDNAs. In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies that are synthetic antibodies are produced using antibody display libraries or antibody fragment display libraries. The term &#x201c;antibody fragment display library&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a display library wherein each member encodes an antibody fragment containing at least one variable region of an antibody. Such antibody fragments are preferably Fab fragments, but other antibody fragments such as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are contemplated as well. In an Fab antibody fragment library, each Fab encoded may be identical except for the amino acid sequence contained within the variable loops of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the Fab fragment. In an alternative or additional embodiment, amino acid sequences within the individual V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>regions may differ as well.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Display libraries may be expressed in a number of possible hosts including, but not limited to yeast, bacteriophage, bacteria and retroviruses. Additional display technologies that may be used include ribosome-display, microbead-display and protein-DNA linkage techniques. In a preferred embodiment, Fab display libraries are expressed in yeast or in bacteriophages (also referred to herein as &#x201c;phages&#x201d; or &#x201c;phage particles&#x201d;. When expressed, the Fabs decorate the surface of the phage or yeast where they can interact with a given antigen. An antigen that includes a glycan or other antigen from a desired target may be used to select phage particles or yeast cells expressing antibody fragments with the highest affinity for that antigen. The DNA sequence encoding the CDR of the bound antibody fragment can then be determined through sequencing using the bound particle or cell. In one embodiment, positive selection is used in the development of antibodies. In some embodiments, negative selection is utilized in the development of antibodies. In some embodiments, both positive and negative selection methods are utilized during multiple rounds of selection in the development of antibodies using display libraries.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In yeast display, cDNA encoding different antibody fragments are introduced into yeast cells where they are expressed and the antibody fragments are &#x201c;displayed&#x201d; on the cell surface as described by Chao et al. (Chao, G. et al., <i>Isolating and engineering human antibodies using yeast surface display</i>. Nat Protoc. 2006; 1(2):755-68). In yeast surface display, expressed antibody fragments may contain an additional domain that includes the yeast agglutinin protein, Aga2p. This domain allows the antibody fragment fusion protein to attach to the outer surface of the yeast cell through the formation of disulphide bonds with surface-expressed Aga1p. The result is a yeast cell, coated in a particular antibody fragment. Display libraries of cDNA encoding these antibody fragments are utilized initially in which the antibody fragments each have a unique sequence. These fusion proteins are expressed on the cell surface of millions of yeast cells where they can interact with a desired antigenic target antigen, incubated with the cells. Target antigens may be covalently or otherwise modified with a chemical or magnetic group to allow for efficient cell sorting after successful binding with a suitable antibody fragment takes place. Recovery may be by way of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or other cell sorting methods known in the art. Once a subpopulation of yeast cells is selected, the corresponding plasmids may be analyzed to determine the CDR sequence.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Bacteriophage display technology typically utilizes filamentous phage including, but not limited to fd, F1 and M13 virions.

Antibody fragment expression on bacteriophages may be carried out by inserting the cDNA encoding the fragment into the gene expressing a viral coat protein. The viral coat of filamentous bacteriophages is made up of five coat proteins, encoded by a single-stranded genome. Coat protein pIII is the preferred protein for antibody fragment expression, typically at the N-terminus. If antibody fragment expression compromises the function of pIII, viral function may be restored through coexpression of a wild type pIII, although such expression will reduce the number of antibody fragments expressed on the viral coat, but may enhance access to the antibody fragment by the target antigen. Expression of viral as well as antibody fragment proteins may alternatively be encoded on multiple plasmids. This method may be used to reduce the overall size of infective plasmids and enhance the transformation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">As described above, after selection of a host expressing a high affinity antibody or antibody fragment, (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) the coding regions from the antibody or antibody fragment can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The DNA sequence encoding a high affinity antibody can be mutated for additional rounds of selection in a process known as affinity maturation. The term &#x201c;affinity maturation&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a method whereby antibodies are produced with increasing affinity for a given antigen through successive rounds of mutation and selection of antibody- or antibody fragment-encoding cDNA sequences. In some cases, this process is carried out in vitro. To accomplish this, amplification of CDR coding sequences may be carried out using error-prone PCR to produce millions of copies containing mutations including, but not limited to point mutations, regional mutations, insertional mutations and deletional mutations. As used herein, the term &#x201c;point mutation&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid mutation in which one nucleotide within a nucleotide sequence is changed to a different nucleotide. As used herein, the term &#x201c;regional mutation&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid mutation in which two or more consecutive nucleotides are changed to different nucleotides. As used herein, the term &#x201c;insertional mutation&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid mutation in which one or more nucleotides are inserted into a nucleotide sequence. As used herein, the term &#x201c;deletional mutation&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid mutation in which one or more nucleotides are removed from a nucleotide sequence. Insertional or deletional mutations may include the complete replacement of an entire codon or the change of one codon to another by altering one or two nucleotides of the starting codon.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Mutagenesis may be carried out on CDR-encoding cDNA sequences to create millions of mutants with singular mutations in CDR heavy and light chain regions. In another approach, random mutations are introduced only at CDR residues most likely to improve affinity. These newly generated mutagenic libraries can be used to repeat the process to screen for clones that encode antibody fragments with even higher affinity for the target antigen. Continued rounds of mutation and selection promote the synthesis of clones with greater and greater affinity (Chao, G. et al., <i>Isolating and engineering human antibodies using yeast surface display</i>.

A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal immunoglobulin and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (Morrison, S. L., <i>Transfectomas provide novel chimeric antibodies</i>. Science. 1985 Sep. 20; 229(4719):1202-7; Gillies, S.

Often, framework residues in the human framework regions are substituted with corresponding residues from the CDR and framework regions of the donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding, and by sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,762 and 5,585,089; Riechmann, L. et al., <i>Reshaping human antibodies for therapy</i>. Nature. 1988 Mar. 24; 332(6162):323-7, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089); veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, E.

Humanized antibodies of the present invention may be developed for desired binding specificity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular-mediated cytotoxicity, etc.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some cases, human frameworks are selected by alignment of donor antibody sequences with human framework sequences to find human framework candidates with the highest level of homology. In some cases, framework regions may be selected from more than one human framework candidate (e.g., framework regions 1-3 may be selected from one candidate and framework region 4 may be selected from an alternative candidate). In some cases, framework regions may be selected from human consensus sequences to avoid the risk of including immunogenic epitopes created by somatic mutations. Consensus sequences are sequences formed by comparing many sequences and adopting most commonly occurring residues at each position. In some cases, human frameworks may be selected from human germline sequences. These may be identified through database searching (e.g., using the NCBI protein database or other databases).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Light and heavy chain human frameworks may be selected from the same or from different clones. Light and heavy chains derived from the same clone have a greater likelihood of associating to form binding sites that are functional; however, the conserved nature of the interface between heavy and light chains typically allows light and heavy chains from different clones to associate and be functional. Frequency of pairing between human light and heavy chain frameworks can be reviewed, for example, in Tiller et al., 2013. MAbs. 5(3): 445-70, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Residues in humanized antibody sequences may be considered for &#x201c;back-mutation&#x201d; to improve or restore antibody affinity lost during humanization. Back-mutation involves changing residues altered during humanization back to those present in the original non-human antibody sequence. Residues that are candidates for back-mutation may be identified, for example, by comparison to standard conformations found in canonical antibody structures (see Al-Lazikani, et al., 1997. J. Mol. Biol. 273: 927-48, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Unusual canonical residues may be identified and targeted for back-mutation. In some cases, residues that are candidates for back-mutation may be &#x201c;Vernier residues&#x201d;, a term used to refer to residues in contact with CDRs. These residues have a higher likelihood of impacting CDR positioning and conformation, and therefor antibody affinity and/or specificity (Strohl, W. R. Therapeutic Antibody Engineering. Woodhead Publishing, Philadelphia Pa. 2012. Ch. 6, p117). In some cases, human framework regions are kept constant and CDRs from donor antibodies are back-mutated to fit human CDR regions while maintaining binding through empirical methods.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Completely human antibodies (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients, so as to avoid or alleviate immune reaction to foreign protein. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art, including the antibody display methods described above, using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences.

For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin polynucleotide complexes can be introduced randomly, or by homologous recombination, into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells, in addition to the human heavy and light chain polynucleotides. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin polynucleotides can be rendered nonfunctional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a glycan, glycoconjugate and/or polypeptide of the invention.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce useful human IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE antibodies.

Sites of implantation may include the dorsal region of mice (subcutaneous implantation), although implantation in the same organ as the original tumor may be an option (orthotopic implantation, i.e. pancreas, oral cavity, ovary, mammary fat pad, brain, etc.). In addition, independently of the tumor origin, some approaches may include implanting primary tumors in the renal capsule in an effort to increase engraftment success rates. A variety of mouse strains having different degrees of immunosuppression may be used in such studies. For hormone sensitive tumors, some studies may use hormone supplementation with the intent of increasing engraftment rates.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;region of antibody recognition&#x201d; refers to a segment located on any part of the molecule, an attached group or located on a region of interaction between the glycan and another molecule, including, but not limited to another glycan, protein, membrane, cell surface structure, or extracellular matrix component. In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at interchain target sites, wherein the term &#x201c;interchain&#x201d; means within the present polymeric chain. Interchain target sites may include regions of antibody recognition having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or at least 10 residues, bonds between residues or combinations of residues and bonds. In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at regions of interaction between one or more glycan chains. Such regions may be between 2, 3, 4 or at least 5 glycan chains.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at regions of interaction between glycan branch chains connected to a common parent chain. In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at regions of interaction between a glycan branch chain and a parent chain. In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at regions of interaction between glycans and proteins. Such regions of interaction may include chemical bonds between the glycan and the protein, including, but not limited to covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrostatic bonds, hydrophobic bonds and hydrogen bonds. In some embodiments, regions of antibody recognition are located at regions of interaction between glycans and other biomolecules including, but not limited to lipids and nucleic acids. Such regions of interaction may include chemical bonds between the glycan and the biomolecule, including, but not limited to covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrostatic bonds, hydrophobic bonds and hydrogen bonds.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0174">In some embodiments, glycan targets of the present invention are components of glycoconjugates. As used herein, the term &#x201c;glycoconjugate&#x201d; refers to any entity joined with a glycan moiety. In some embodiments, glycoconjugates are glycolipids. As used herein, the term &#x201c;glycolipid&#x201d; refers to a class of lipids wherein a carbohydrate moiety is covalently attached. In some embodiments, carbohydrate moieties present on glycolipids may be glycans. In some embodiments, lipid components of glycolipids include ceramide moieties. Examples of glycolipids contemplated as targets of the present invention include, but are not limited to glyceroglycolipids (including, but not limited to galactolipids and sulfolipids), glycosphingolipids (including, but not limited to cerebrosides (e.g., galactocerebrosides, glucocerebrosides and sulfatides), gangliosides, globosides and glycophosphosphingolipids) and glycosylphosphatidylinositols. When located within cell membranes, glycan moieties of glycolipids are located on the extracellular side of the membrane where they may interact with other cells as well as cell signaling ligands (Maccioni, H. J. et al., <i>Organization of the synthesis of glycolipid oligosaccharides in the Golgi complex</i>. FEBS Lett. 2011 Jun. 6; 585(11):1691-8).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">In some embodiments, glycoconjugate targets of the present invention are glycoprotein and/or proteoglycans. Glycoproteins refer to any proteins that are covalently bonded with glycans. Proteoglycans are a class of proteins that are heavily glycosylated with glycans that often carry a negative charge. This property makes them very hydrophilic and important components of connective tissue.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Cancer-Related Targets</heading><p id="p-0178" num="0176">In some embodiments, targets of the present invention are cancer-related antigens or epitopes. As used herein, the term &#x201c;cancer-related&#x201d; is used to describe entities that may be in some way associated with cancer, cancerous cells and/or cancerous tissues. Many cancer-related antigens or epitopes that include glycans have been identified that are expressed in correlation with tumor cells (Heimburg-Molinaro, J. et al., Cancer vaccines and carbohydrate epitopes. Vaccine. 2011 Nov. 8; 29(48):8802-26). These are referred to herein as &#x201c;tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens&#x201d; or &#x201c;TACAs.&#x201d; TACAs include, but are not limited to mucin-related antigens [including, but not limited to Tn, Sialyl Tn (STn) and Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen], blood group Lewis related antigens [including, but not limited to Lewis<sup>Y </sup>(Le<sup>Y</sup>), Lewis<sup>X </sup>(Le<sup>X</sup>), Sialyl Lewis<sup>X </sup>(SLe<sup>X</sup>) and Sialyl Lewis<sup>A </sup>(SLe<sup>A</sup>)], glycosphingolipid-related antigens [including, but not limited to Globo H, stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) and glycosphingolipids that include sialic acid], ganglioside-related antigens [including, but not limited to gangliosides GD2, GD3, GM2, fucosyl GM1 and Neu5GcGM3] and polysialic acid-related antigens. Many of such antigens are described in International Publication No. WO2015054600, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0177">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include Lewis blood group antigens. Lewis blood group antigens include a fucose residue linked to GlcNAc by an al-3 linkage or an al-4 linkage. They may be found on both glycolipids and glycoproteins. Lewis blood group antigens may be found in the body fluid of individuals that are secretors of these antigens. Their appearance on red cells is due to absorption of Lewis antigens from the serum by the red cells.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0178">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include Le<sup>Y</sup>. Le<sup>Y </sup>(also known as CD174) is made up of Gal&#x3b2;1,4GlcNAC having &#x3b1;1,2- as well as &#x3b1;1,3-linked fucose residues yielding the Fuca(1,2)Gal&#x3b2;(1,4)Fuca(1,3)GlcNAc epitope. It is synthesized from the H antigen by &#x3b1;1,3 fucosyltransferases which attach the &#x3b1;1,3 fucose to the GlcNAc residue of the parent chain. Le<sup>Y </sup>may be expressed in a variety of cancers including, but not limited to ovarian, breast, prostate, colon, lung and epithelial. Due to its low expression level in normal tissues and elevated expression level in many cancers, the Le<sup>Y </sup>antigen is an attractive target for therapeutic antibodies.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0179">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include Le<sup>X</sup>. Le<sup>X </sup>includes the epitope Gal&#x3b2;1-4(Fuc&#x3b1;1-3)GlcNAc&#x3b2;-R. It is also known as CD15 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1). This antigen was first recognized as being immunoreactive with sera taken from a mouse subjected to immunization with F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Le<sup>X </sup>was also found to correlate with embryonic development at specific stages. It is also expressed in a variety of tissues both in the presence and absence of cancer, but can also be found in breast and ovarian cancers where it is only expressed by cancerous cells.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0180">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include SLe<sup>A </sup>and/or SLe<sup>X</sup>. SLe<sup>A </sup>and SLe<sup>X </sup>are made up of structures Neu5Aca2-3Gal&#x3b2;1-3(Fuc&#x3b1;1-4)GlcNAc&#x3b2;-R and Neu5Aca2-3Gal&#x3b2;1-4(Fuc&#x3b1;1-3)GlcNAc&#x3b2;-R, respectively. Their expression is upregulated in cancer cells. The presence of these antigens in serum correlates with malignancy and poor prognosis. SLe<sup>X </sup>is mostly found as a mucin terminal epitope. It is expressed in a number of different cancers including breast, ovarian, melanoma, colon, liver, lung and prostate. In some embodiments of the present invention, SLe<sup>A </sup>and SLe<sup>X </sup>targets include Neu5Gc (referred to herein as GcSLe<sup>A </sup>and GcSLe<sup>X</sup>, respectively).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0181">In some cases, cancer-related targets of the invention may include mucins. Ishida et al demonstrate that interaction of MUC2 with dendritic cells (with anti-tumor activity) leads to dendritic cell apoptosis (Ishida, A. et al., 2008. Proteomics. 8: 3342-9, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In some aspects, the present invention provided anti-mucin antibodies to prevent dendritic cell apoptosis and support anti-tumor activity.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0182">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include glycolipids and/or epitopes present on glycolipids, including, but not limited to glycosphingolipids. Glycosphingolipids include the lipid ceramide linked to a glycan by the ceramide hydroxyl group. On the cell membrane, glycosphingolipids form clusters referred to as &#x201c;lipid rafts&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0183">In some embodiments, TACA targets of the present invention include Globo H. Globo H is a cancer-related glycosphingolipid first identified in breast cancer cells. The glycan portion of Globo H includes Fuc&#x3b1;(1-2)Gal&#x3b2;(1-3)GalNAc&#x3b2;(1-3)Gal&#x3b1;(1-4)Gal&#x3b2;(1-4)Glc&#x3b2;(1). Although found in a number of normal epithelial tissues, Globo H has been identified in association with many tumor tissues including, but not limited to, small cell lung, breast, prostate, lung, pancreatic, gastric, ovarian and endometrial tumors.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0184">In some embodiments, cancer-related glycosphingolipid targets of the present invention include gangliosides. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids having one or more sialic acid. According to ganglioside nomenclature, G is used as an abbreviation for ganglioside. This abbreviation is followed by the letters M, D or T referring to the number of sialic acid residues attached (1, 2 or 3 respectively). Finally the numbers 1, 2 or 3 are used to refer to the order of the distance each migrates when analyzed by thin layer chromatography (wherein 3 travels the greatest distance, followed by 2, and then 1). Gangliosides are known to be involved in cancer-related growth and metastasis and may be expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells. Gangliosides expressed on tumor cells may include, but are not limited to GD2, GD3, GM2 and fucosyl GM1 (also referred to herein as Fuc-GM1). In some embodiments of the present invention, glycan-interacting antibodies are directed toward GD3. GD3 is a regulator of cell growth. In some embodiments, GD3-directed antibodies are used to modulate cell growth and/or angiogenesis. In some embodiments, GD3-directed antibodies are used to modulate cell attachment. GD3 associated with some tumor cells may include 9-O-acetylated sialic acid residues (Mukherjee, K. et al., 2008. J Cell Biochem. 105: 724-34 and Mukherjee, K. et al., 2009. Biol Chem. 390: 325-35, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In some cases, antibodies of the invention are selective for 9-O-acetylated sialic acid residues. Some antibodies may be specific for 9-O-acetylated GD3s. Such antibodies may be used to target tumor cells expressing 9-O-acetylated GD3. In some embodiments of the present invention, glycan interacting antibodies are directed toward GM2. In some embodiments, GM2-directed antibodies are used to modulate cell to cell contact. In some embodiments, ganglioside targets of the present invention include Neu5Gc. In some embodiments, such targets may include a GM3 variant having Neu5Gc (referred to herein as GcGM3). The glycan component of GcGM3 is Neu5Gca2-3Gal&#x3b2;1-4Glc. GcGM3 is a known component of tumor cells (Casadesus, A. V. et al., 2013. Glycoconj J. 30(7):687-99, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0185">In some embodiments, TACAs of the present disclosure include at least one Neu5Gc residue.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Recombinant Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0188" num="0186">Recombinant antibodies (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) of the invention may be generated using standard techniques known in the art. In some embodiments, recombinant antibodies may be anti-glycan antibodies. Further antibodies may be anti-STn antibodies (e.g. anti-GcSTn or anti-AcSTn antibodies). Recombinant antibodies of the invention may be produced using variable domains obtained from hybridoma cell-derived antibodies produced according to methods described herein. Heavy and light chain variable region cDNA sequences of antibodies may be determined using standard biochemical techniques. Total RNA may be extracted from antibody-producing hybridoma cells and converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR amplification may be carried out on resulting cDNA to amplify variable region genes. Such amplification may include the use of primers specific for amplification of heavy and light chain sequences. In other embodiments, recombinant antibodies may be produced using variable domains obtained from other sources. This includes the use of variable domains selected from one or more antibody fragment library, such as an scFv library used in antigen panning. Resulting PCR products may then be subcloned into plasmids for sequence analysis. Once sequenced, antibody coding sequences may be placed into expression vectors. For humanization, coding sequences for human heavy and light chain constant domains may be used to substitute for homologous murine sequences. The resulting constructs may then be transfected into mammalian cells for large scale translation.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Anti-Tn Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0189" num="0187">In some embodiments, recombinant antibodies of the invention (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) may be anti-Tn antibodies. Such antibodies may bind to targets having Tn. Anti-Tn antibodies may be specific for Tn or may bind other modified forms of Tn, such as Tn linked to other moieties, including, but not limited to additional carbohydrate residues. In some cases anti-Tn antibodies may be anti-sialyl-Tn antibodies. Such antibodies may bind to sialylated Tn that includes Neu5Ac and/or sialylated Tn that include Neu5Gc. Some anti-Tn antibodies may bind specifically to clusters of Tn antigen.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Anti-STn Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0188">In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention (e.g., glycan-interacting antibodies) may specifically bind to STn. Anti-STn antibodies of the invention may be categorized by their binding to specific portions of STn antigens and/or by their specificity for AcSTn versus GcSTn. In some cases, anti-STn antibodies of the invention are Group 1 antibodies. &#x201c;Group 1&#x201d; antibodies according to the invention are antibodies capable of binding AcSTn and GcSTn. Such antibodies may also be referred to herein as pan-STn antibodies due to their ability to associate with a wider range of STn structures.

In some cases, Group 2 antibodies may associate with the portion of STn indicated by the largest ellipse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Some Group 2 antibodies preferably bind to structures with AcSTn over structures with GcSTn. Further anti-STn antibodies may be Group 3 antibodies. As referred to herein, &#x201c;Group 3&#x201d; antibodies are antibodies capable of binding STn, but may also bind a broader set of related structures. Unlike Group 2 antibodies, Group 3 antibodies do not require that such structures have an O-linkage to serine or threonine. In some embodiments, Group 3 antibodies may associate with the portion of STn indicated by the largest ellipse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. Finally, some anti-STn antibodies of the invention may be Group 4 antibodies. As referred to herein, &#x201c;Group 4&#x201d; antibodies are capable of binding to both AcSTn and GcSTn as well as the un-sialylated Tn antigen, and therefore have broader specificity.

Some such antibodies may recognize epitopes formed by the clustering of STn, including epitopes that include areas of contact between neighboring STn structures. Such epitopes may be formed by the clustering of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more STn structures.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">In some embodiments, anti-STn antibodies of the present disclosure may be used bind cellular proteins carrying STn. Such antibodies may be useful for targeting cellular proteins associated with cancer cells that are distinguishable from similar proteins in non-cancerous cells by STn expression.

Such analysis may include comparisons between antibodies binding to the same or similar epitopes.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0202">Antibodies sequences of antibodies binding to the same epitope may be analyzed for variation in light and/or heavy chain sequences. Such analysis may include germline sequences and/or CDR sequences. Information obtained from such analysis may be used to identify (and optionally to modify, delete, replace or repair) conserved amino acid residues; conserved segments of amino acids; amino acid positions with conserved side chain characteristics; conserved CDR lengths; and other features conserved among antibodies binding to the same epitope. This information may be used to design variants or to inform antibody optimization procedures to improve antibody affinity, specificity, protein folding, stability, manufacturing, expression and/or immunogenicity.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0203">Sequence analysis may include aligning two or more antibodies that bind to the same or similar epitopes to identify similarities. Such analysis may compare the sequence and/or length of antibody regions (e.g., CDRs, variable domains, germline segments). Amino acid insertions, amino acid deletions, and substitutions may be identified and assessed. Sequence differences may be compared against antibody affinity and/or specificity.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">In some cases, sequence analyses are conducted to identify (and optionally to modify, delete, replace or repair) one or more of unpaired cysteines or irregular disulfides; glycosylation sites (e.g., N-linked NXS/T sites); acid cleavage sites, amino acid oxidation sites, conformity with mouse germline sequences; asparagine deamidation sites; aspartate isomerization sites; N-terminal pyroglutamate formation sites; and aggregation-prone patches in CDRs.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">In some cases, the present invention provides sequence analysis-informed variants of antibodies presented herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sequence analysis-informed variant&#x201d; refers to an antibody variant that has been modified based on one or more conclusions derived from antibody sequence analysis. In some cases, antibodies of the invention may be modified to produce antibody variants that include modifications to one or more of antibody affinity, specificity, protein folding, stability, manufacturing, expression and/or immunogenicity.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0206">Some sequence analysis-informed variants include one or more CDR length modification. CDR length modified antibodies may include one or more added or deleted amino acids in one or more CDRs relative to an original antibody sequence. In some cases, sequence analysis-informed variants may include a substitution of one or more CDRs with one or more CDRs derived from another antibody (e.g., an antibody binding to the same or similar epitope). In some cases, sequence analysis-informed variants may include a substitution of a heavy or light chain variable domain from another antibody (e.g., an antibody binding to the same or similar epitope). Sequence analysis-informed variants may include modifications to one or more germline genes that the antibody is expressed from. Such modifications may include point mutations, regional mutations, insertional mutations or deletional mutations. In some case, germline gene modifications are carried out to move CDRs from one known germline gene to another. Sequence analysis-informed variants may include other variants described herein, including, but not limited to scFvs, monobodies, diabodies, intrabodies, CARs, antibody mimetics, etc.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0207">In some embodiments, sequence and/or structural analysis may be used to inform the construction of antibody fragment display libraries (including, but not limited to scFv libraries, phage display libraries, and yeast display libraries). In one example, sequence alignment may be carried out to align two or more antibodies with a common antigen or epitope and amino acid residues may be identified that are conserved among the aligned antibodies or that are variable among the aligned antibodies. In such cases, antibody fragment display libraries may be constructed such that variability among library members is primarily limited to the variable amino acids identified in the sequence analysis. In some cases, such libraries may be used to identify variants with altered affinity and/or specificity for a target antigen (e.g., STn) or a specific epitope of the target antigen (e.g., the epitopes recognized by Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 antibodies as described in Example 1, herein below).</p><p id="p-0212" num="0208">In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be modified to remove, replace or otherwise eliminate one or more unpaired cysteine residues. In some cases, unpaired cysteine residues may be reactive and in some cases may affect antibody affinity and/or specificity. Accordingly, some antibodies of the invention have been modified to eliminate unpaired cysteine residues. In some cases, such variants may have modified epitope specificity and/or affinity. In some cases, modification of unpaired cysteine residues may alter antibody folding. In some cases, these variants include a substitution or deletion of one or more cysteine residues. In some cases, these variants include one or more additional amino acid residues (including, but not limited to, the addition of one or more cysteine residues) to prevent or reduce undesired effects from unpaired cysteine residues. In some cases, cysteine residues are replaced with an amino acid having a hydrophobic side chain (e.g., tyrosine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine or tryptophan).</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Antibody Testing and Characterization</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0209">Antibodies described herein may be tested and/or characterized using a variety of methods. Such methods may be used to determine a variety of characteristics that may include, but are not limited to, antibody affinity; specificity; and activity (e.g., activation or inhibition of cellular signaling pathways or other cellular or biological activities). Antibody testing may further include testing in vivo (e.g., in animal and/or human studies) for one or more of toxicity, therapeutic effect, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, absorption, deposition, metabolism, and excretion. Testing in animals may include, but is not limited to, testing in mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, pigs, primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys), sheep, goats, horses, and cattle.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Cell-Based Assays</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0210">In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may be tested or characterized through the use of one or more cell-based assays.

Examples of cell-based in vivo assays include tumor models in which tumor cells are injected or otherwise introduced into a host.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0211">In some cases, cells used in cell-based assays may express one or more target glycans recognized by one or more antibodies of the invention. Such glycans may be naturally expressed by such cells or, alternatively, cells may be induced to express one or more glycans desired for purposes of a particular assay. Induced expression may be through one or more treatments that upregulate expression of glycosylated proteins or enzymes that regulate glycosylation. In other cases, induced expression may include transfection, transduction, or other form of introduction of one or more genes or transcripts for the endogenous expression of one or more glycosylated proteins or enzymes involved in regulation of glycosylation.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0212">In some cases, cell-based assays used herein may include the use of cancer cells. Many cancer cell lines are available for experiments to test antibodies of the invention. Such cells may express target glycan or may be induced to express target glycans. Additionally, cancer cell lines may be used to test antibodies of the invention, where the cancer cell lines are representative of cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cell (CSC) cell lines may be isolated or differentiated from cancer cells grown in culture (e.g., through sorting based on markers specific for cancer stem cells). Cell lines used in cell-based assays may include, but are not limited to breast, colon, ovary, lymphocyte, bone marrow, and skin cell lines. Specific cell lines may include, but are not limited to SNU-16 cells, LS-174T cells, MC38 cells, TOV-112D cells, TOV-21G cells, Jurkat E6.1 cells, K-562 cells, B16-F0 cells, B16-F10 cells, LS180 cells, COL0205 cells, TB4 cells, HT29 cells, Panc1 cells, HPAC cells, HPAFII cells, RKO cells, SW480 cells, and SNU-C2A cells.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0213">In some embodiments, ovarian cancer cell lines may be used.

Cancer stem cell populations may be isolated from OVCAR3 cell cultures through selection based on specific cell surface markers such as CD44 (involved in cell adhesion and migration), CD133 and CD117 (Liang, D. et al., 2012. BMC Cancer. 12: 201, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). OV90 cells are epithelial ovarian cancer cells that were similarly derived from human ascites (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,038). OV-90 cells may also express CD44 when activated (Meunier, L. et al., 2010.

The antibody binding specificity to AcSTn vs. GcSTn can be determined using the array or other methods of determining specificity known in the art. In addition, the binding profile of antibodies to O-acetylated STn can be determined. The loss of O-acetylation on STn is relevant to cancer as cancer-associated expression correlates with increased STn recognition by antibodies (Ogata, S. et al., Tumor-associated sialylated antigens are constitutively expressed in normal human colonic mucosa. Cancer Res. 1995 May 1; 55(9):1869-74) In some cases, glycan arrays may be used to determine recognition of STn vs. Tn.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">Antibody Fragment Display Library Screening Techniques</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0217">In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may be produced and/or optimized using high throughput methods of discovery. Such methods may include any of the display techniques (e.g. display library screening techniques) disclosed in International Patent Application No. WO2014074532, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, synthetic antibodies may be designed, selected or optimized by screening target antigens using display technologies (e.g. phage display technologies). Phage display libraries may include millions to billions of phage particles, each expressing unique antibody fragments on their viral coats. Such libraries may provide richly diverse resources that may be used to select potentially hundreds of antibody fragments with diverse levels of affinity for one or more antigens of interest (McCafferty, et al., 1990. Nature. 348:552-4; Edwards, B. M. et al., 2003. JMB. 334: 103-18; Schofield, D. et al., 2007. Genome Biol. 8, R254 and Pershad, K. et al., 2010. Protein Engineering Design and Selection. 23:279-88; the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Often, the antibody fragments present in such libraries include scFv antibody fragments that include a fusion protein of V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>antibody domains joined by a flexible linker. In some cases, scFvs may contain the same sequence with the exception of unique sequences encoding variable loops of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). In some cases, scFvs are expressed as fusion proteins, linked to viral coat proteins (e.g. the N-terminus of the viral pIII coat protein). V<sub>L </sub>chains may be expressed separately for assembly with V<sub>H </sub>chains in the periplasm prior to complex incorporation into viral coats. Precipitated library members may be sequenced from the bound phage to obtain cDNA encoding desired scFvs. Such sequences may be directly incorporated into antibody sequences for recombinant antibody production, or mutated and utilized for further optimization through in vitro affinity maturation.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Development of Cytotoxic Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0218">In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may be capable of inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP). ADCC is an immune mechanism whereby cells are lysed as a result of immune cell attack. Such immune cells may include CD56+ cells, CD3&#x2212; natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and neutrophils (Strohl, W. R. Therapeutic Antibody Engineering. Woodhead Publishing, Philadelphia Pa. 2012.

Such antibodies, for example, may be engineered according to any of the methods disclosed by Alderson, K. L. et al., J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011. 2011:379123). In the case of mouse antibodies, different isotypes of antibodies are more effective at promoting ADCC. IgG2a, for example, is more effective at inducing ADCC than is IgG2b. Some antibodies of the present invention, including mouse IgG2b antibodies may be reengineered to be IgG2a antibodies. Such reengineered antibodies may be more effective at inducing ADCC upon binding cell-associated antigens. In some embodiments, antibodies are reengineered by modifying or introducing one or more post-translational modifications to improve ADCC and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) biological activity.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">In some embodiments, genes encoding variable regions of antibodies developed according to methods of the present invention may be cloned into mammalian expression vectors encoding human Fc regions.

ADCs are antibodies in which one or more cargo (e.g., therapeutic agents) are attached [e.g. directly or via linker (e.g. a cleavable linker or a non-cleavable linker)]. ADCs are useful for delivery of therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs or cytotoxic agents) to one or more target cells or tissues (Panowski, S. et al., 2014. mAbs 6:1, 34-45). In some cases, ADCs may be designed to bind to a surface antigen on a targeted cell. Upon binding, the entire antibody-antigen complex may be internalized and directed to a cellular lysosome. ADCs may then be degraded, releasing the bound cargo. Where the cargo is a cytotoxic agent, the target cell will be killed or otherwise disabled. Cytotoxic agents may include, but are not limited to cytoskeletal inhibitors [e.g., tubulin polymerization inhibitors, and kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitors], DNA damaging agents (e.g., calicheamicins, duocarmycins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers such as talirine and tesirine), topoisomerase inhibitors [e.g., camptothecin compounds or derivatives such as 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) and exatecan derivative DXd], transcription inhibitors (e.g., RNA polymerase inhibitors such as amanitin), and kinase inhibitors [e.g., phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors].</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">Tubulin polymerization inhibitors may include, but are not limited to, maytansines (e.g., emtansine [DM1] and ravtansine [DM4]), auristatins, tubulysins, and <i>vinca </i>alkaloids or derivatives thereof.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymeric carrier&#x201d; refers to a polymer or a modified polymer, which may be covalently attached to one or more therapeutic agents and/or antibodies. Polymeric carriers may provide additional conjugation sites for therapeutic agents, increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio and enhancing therapeutic effects of ADCs. In some embodiments, polymeric carriers used in this invention may be water soluble and/or biodegradable. Such polymeric carriers may include, but are not limited to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (polyHPMA), poly(&#x3b1;-amino acids) [e.g., poly(L-lysine), poly(L-glutamic acid), and poly((N-hydroxyalkyl)glutamine)], carbohydrate polymers [e.g., dextrins, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), and polysialic acid], glycopolysaccharides (e.g., homopolysaccharide such as cellulose, amylose, dextran, levan, fucoidan, carraginan, inulin, pectin, amylopectin, glycogen and lixenan; or homopolysaccharide such as agarose, hyluronan, chondroitinsulfate, dermatansulfate, keratansulfate, alginic acid and heparin), glycolipids, glycoconjugates, polyglycerols, polyvinyl alcohols, poly(acrylic acid), polyketal and polyacetal [e.g., poly(l-hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethylformal), also known as PHF or FLEXIMER&#xae;, described in U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, therapeutic agents are attached to polymeric carriers directly or via linkers, and the polymeric carriers are attached to the antibodies directly or via linkers. In some embodiments, linkers may comprise an oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic, diglycolic acid, tartaric, glutamic, fumaric, or aspartic moiety, including amide, imide, or cyclic-imide derivatives of each thereof, and each optionally substituted.

Cleavable linkers may break down under certain conditions (such as changes in pH, temperature, or reduction) or cleaved by enzymes (e.g., proteases and glucuronidases) to allow release of therapeutic agents from ADCs. Such linkers may include a labile bond such as an ester bond, amide bond, or disulfide bond. Non-limiting cleavable linkers may include pH-sensitive linkers (e.g., hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, thioether, orthoester, acetal, or ketal); reduction-sensitive linkers [e.g., N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP), N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene or 2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl 4-(1-(pyridin-2-yldisulfanyl)ethyl)benzoate (SMPT)]; photosensitive linkers; and enzymatically cleavable linkers [e.g., peptide linkers such as valine-citrulline, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (vc-PAB), maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC-vc-PAB), linkers cleavable by glucuronidases, such as glucuronide-MABC, or linkers cleavable by esterases].</p><p id="p-0230" num="0226">In other embodiments, linkers may be non-cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers may increase plasma stability of the ADCs compared to cleavable linkers. Exemplary non-cleavable linkers include maleimide alkane and maleimide cyclohexane (MCC).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0227">Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) of the invention may be prepared using any method known in the art. For example, therapeutic agents may be modified to contain a functional group that can react with a functional group on the antibody. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) may be prepared by reacting the two functional groups to form a conjugate. In some cases, polymeric carriers may be modified to contain functional groups that can react with the functional group on the therapeutic agents and the functional group on the antibody under different chemical conditions. Antibodies, polymeric carriers, and therapeutic agents may be linked to form the antibody-polymer-drug conjugates through sequential chemical reactions. Conjugation to antibodies may employ a lysine or a cysteine residue as the conjugation site. In some embodiments, antibodies may be engineered to have additional lysine or cysteine residues. Such approaches may avoid disruption of antibody structure (e.g., interchain disulfide bonds) and maintain antibody stability and/or activity.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0228">As described herein, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is the average number of therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs or cytotoxic agents) conjugated to the antibodies. In some embodiments, drug-to-antibody ratio of an ADC of the invention is at least 1:1, at least 2:1, at least 4:1, at least 6:1, at least 8:1, at least 10:1, at least 12:1, at least 15:1, at least 20:1 or at least 25:1.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0229">In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be tested for their ability to promote cell death when developed as ADCs. Cell viability assays may be performed in the presence and absence of secondary antibody-drug conjugates. Antibodies with potent cell growth inhibition may then be used to design direct antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The use of such secondary antibody-drug conjugates in cell-based cytotoxic assays may allow for quick pre-screening of many ADC candidates. Based on such assays, an unconjugated antibody candidate is directly added to cells in the presence of a secondary antibody that is conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents (referred to herein as a 2&#xb0; ADC). Internalization of the antibody/2&#xb0; ADC complex into cells that express a high density of the targeted antigen can achieve a dose-dependent drug release within the cells, causing a cytotoxic effect to kill the cells (e.g., tumor cells), while cells expressing a low density of the targeted antigen are not affected (e.g., normal cells).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0230">ADCs of the invention may be designed to target cancer cells. Such ADCs may include antibodies directed to one or more tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA). In some cases, ADCs of the invention are anti-STn antibodies. In some embodiments, ADCs include one or more of the variable domains presented in Table 2. Such ADC may also include at least one human IgG constant region, including, but not limited to any of those presented in Table 3.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">Development of Chimeric Antigen Receptors</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0231">In some embodiments, antibody sequences of the invention may be used to develop a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are transmembrane receptors expressed on immune cells that facilitate recognition and killing of target cells (e.g. tumor cells). CARs typically include three basic parts. These include an ectodomain (also known as the recognition domain), a transmembrane domain and an intracellular (signaling) domain. Ectodomains facilitate binding to cellular antigens on target cells, while intracellular domains typically include cell signaling functions to promote the killing of bound target cells. Further, they may have an extracellular domain with one or more antibody variable domains described herein or fragments thereof. CARs of the invention also include a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. CARs may be designed to include one or more segments of an antibody, antibody variable domain and/or antibody CDR, such that when such CARs are expressed on immune effector cells, the immune effector cells bind and clear any cells that are recognized by the antibody portions of the CARs.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0232">Characteristics of CARs include their ability to redirect T-cell specificity and reactivity toward a selected target in a non-MHC-restricted manner, exploiting the antigen-binding properties of monoclonal antibodies. The non-MHC-restricted antigen recognition gives T cells expressing CARs the ability to recognize antigen independent of antigen processing, thus bypassing a major mechanism of tumor escape. Moreover, when expressed in T-cells, CARs advantageously do not dimerize with endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0233">CARs engineered to target tumors may have specificity for one or more tumor associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). In some embodiments, ectodomains of these CARs may include one or more antibody variable domains or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments, CARs are expressed in T cells, and may be referred to as &#x201c;CAR-engineered T cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;CAR-Ts&#x201d;. CAR-Ts may be engineered with CAR ectodomains having one or more antibody variable domains.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">Structural Features of Chimeric Antigen Receptors</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0234">With gene-transfer technology, T cells can be engineered to stably express antibodies on their surface, conferring a desired antigen specificity. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) combine an antigen-recognition domain of a specific antibody with an intracellular domain of the CD3-zeta chain or Fc&#x3b3;RI protein having T cell activating properties into a single chimeric fusion protein. CAR technology provides MHC-unrestricted recognition of target cells by T cells. Removal of the MHC restriction of T cells facilitates the use of these molecules in any patient, and also, in both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, usually restricted to MHC class I or II epitopes, respectively. The use of Ab-binding regions allows T cells to respond to epitopes formed not only by protein, but also carbohydrate and lipid. This chimeric receptor approach is especially suited to immunotherapy of cancer, being able to bypass many of the mechanisms by which tumors avoid immunorecognition, such as MHC down-regulation, lack of expression of costimulatory molecules, CTL resistance, and induction of T cell suppression, and where the use of both CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL and CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells are best combined for optimum antitumor efficacy. This approach has been demonstrated to be applicable to a wide range of tumor antigens, in addition to viruses such as HIV (Finney, et al., <i>J. Immunology, </i>2004, 172:104-113).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0235">Although chimeric antigen receptors can trigger T-cell activation in a manner similar to that of endogenous T-cell receptors, in practice, the clinical application of CAR technology has been impeded by inadequate in vivo expansion of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. For example, first generation CARs included as their signaling domain the cytoplasmic region of the CD3 or Fc receptor &#x3b3; chain. These first generation CARs were tested in phase I clinical studies in patients with ovarian cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma, and were found to induce modest responses, effectively redirecting T cell cytotoxicity but failing to enable T cell proliferation and survival upon repeated antigen exposure. The prototypes for second generation CARs involved receptors encompassing both CD28 and CD3, and second generation CARs have been tested for treatment of B cell malignancies and other cancers (Sadelain, et al., (2009) <i>Current Opinion in Immunology, </i>21(2):215-223). Thus, CARs have rapidly expanded into a diverse array of receptors with different functional properties.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0236">More recently, it was discovered that CAR-mediated T-cell responses can be enhanced with the addition of a costimulatory domain. In preclinical models, the inclusion of the CD137 (4-1BB) signaling domain was found to significantly increase antitumor activity and in vivo persistence of chimeric antigen receptors as compared with inclusion of the CD3-zeta chain alone (Porter, et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>2011, 365:725-733).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0237">Thus, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, antibody sequences of the invention may be used to develop a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). In some embodiments, CARs are transmembrane receptors expressed on immune cells that facilitate recognition and killing of target cells (e.g. tumor cells).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0238">In many cancers, tumor-specific antigens for targeting have not been defined, but in B-cell neoplasms, CD19 is an attractive target. Expression of CD19 is restricted to normal and malignant B cells and B-cell precursors. A pilot clinical trial of treatment with autologous T cells expressing an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CART19) was performed in patients with advanced, p53-deficient chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). The generation of a CD19-specific immune response in bone marrow was demonstrated by temporal release of cytokines and ablation of leukemia cells that coincided with peak infiltration of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. (Porter, et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>2011, 365:725-733).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0239">Further structural features of CARs may include any of those disclosed in several PCT Publications assigned to City of Hope and having the common inventor Michael Jensen. For example, PCT Publication WO 00/23573 describes genetically engineered, CD20-specific redirected T cells expressing a cell surface protein having an extracellular domain that includes a receptor specific for CD20, an intracellular signaling domain, and a transmembrane domain. Use of such cells for cellular immunotherapy of CD20<sup>+</sup> malignancies and for abrogating any untoward B cell function. In one embodiment, the cell surface protein is a single chain FvFc:&#x3b6; receptor where Fv designates the VH and VL chains of a single chain monoclonal antibody to CD20 linked by peptide, Fc represents a hinge-CH2-CH3 region of a human IgG1, and &#x3b6; represents the intracellular signaling domain of the zeta chain of human CD3. A method of making a redirected T cell expressing a chimeric T cell receptor by electroporation using naked DNA encoding the receptor. Similarly, PCT Publication WO 02/077029 describes genetically engineered, CD19-specific redirected immune cells expressing a cell surface protein having an extracellular domain that includes a receptor which is specific for CD19, an intracellular signaling domain, and a transmembrane domain. Use of such cells for cellular immunotherapy of CD19<sup>+</sup> malignancies and for abrogating any untoward B cell function. In one embodiment, the immune cell is a T cell and the cell surface protein is a scFvFc:&#x3b6; receptor where Fv designates the VH and VL chains of a single chain monoclonal antibody to CD19, Fc represents at least part of a constant region of an IgG1, and represents the intracellular signaling domain of the T cell antigen receptor complex zeta chain (zeta chain of human CD3). The extracellular domain scFvFc and the intracellular domain zeta are linked by a transmembrane domain such as the transmembrane domain of CD4. A method of making a redirected T cell expressing a chimeric T cell receptor by electroportion using naked DNA encoding the receptor. These chimeric antigen receptors have the ability, when expressed in T cells, to redirect antigen recognition based on the monoclonal antibody's specificity. The design of scFvFc: receptors with target specificities for tumor cell-surface epitopes is a conceptually attractive strategy to generate antitumor immune effector cells for adoptive therapy as it does not rely on pre-existing anti-tumor immunity. These receptors are &#x201c;universal&#x201d; in that they bind antigen in a MHC independent fashion, thus, one receptor construct can be used to treat a population of patients with antigen positive tumors.

These consist of two heavy and two light chains, one each from two different antibodies, where the two Fab regions (the arms) are directed against two antigens, and the Fc region (the foot) comprises the two heavy chains and forms the third binding site.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0251">Of the two paratopes that form the tops of the variable domains of a bispecific antibody, one can be directed against a target antigen and the other against a T-lymphocyte antigen like CD3. In the case of trifunctional antibodies, the Fc region may additionally binds to a cell that expresses Fc receptors, like a mactrophage, a natural killer (NK) cell or a dendritic cell. In sum, the targeted cell is connected to one or two cells of the immune system, which subsequently destroy it.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0252">Other types of bispecific antibodies have been designed to overcome certain problems, such as short half-life, immunogenicity and side-effects caused by cytokine liberation. They include chemically linked Fabs, consisting only of the Fab regions, and various types of bivalent and trivalent single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), fusion proteins mimicking the variable domains of two antibodies. The furthest developed of these newer formats are the bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and mAb2's, antibodies engineered to contain an Fcab antigen-binding fragment instead of the Fc constant region.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0253">A bispecific, single-chain antibody Fv fragment (Bs-scFv) was successfully used to kill cancer cells. Some human cancers are caused by functional defects in p53 that are restored by gene therapy with wild-type p53. Weisbart, et al., describe the construction and expression of a bispecific single-chain antibody that penetrates living colon cancer cells, binds intracellular p53, and targets and restores its wild type function (Weisbart, et al., <i>Int. J. Oncol. </i>2004 October;25(4):1113-8; and Weisbart, et al., <i>Int. J. Oncol. </i>2004 December; 25(6):1867-73). In these studies, a bispecific, single-chain antibody Fv fragment (Bs-scFv) was constructed from (i) a single-chain Fv fragment of mAb 3E10 that penetrates living cells and localizes in the nucleus, and (ii) a single-chain Fv fragment of a non-penetrating antibody, mAb PAb421 that binds the C-terminal of p53. PAb421 binding restores wild-type functions of some p53 mutants, including those of SW480 human colon cancer cells. The Bs-scFv penetrated SW480 cells and was cytotoxic, suggesting an ability to restore activity to mutant p53. COS-7 cells (monkey kidney cells with wild-type p53) served as a control since they are unresponsive to PAb421 due to the presence of SV40 large T antigen that inhibits binding of PAb421 to p53. Bs-scFv penetrated COS-7 cells but was not cytotoxic, thereby eliminating non-specific toxicity of Bs-scFv unrelated to binding p53. Fv fragments alone were not cytotoxic, indicating that killing was due to transduction of p53. A single mutation in CDR1 of PAb421 VH eliminated binding of the Bs-scFv to p53 and abrogated cytotoxicity for SW480 cells without altering cellular penetration, further supporting the requirement of PAb421 binding to p53 for cytotoxicity (Weisbart, et al., <i>Int. J. Oncol. </i>2004 October;25(4):1113-8; and Weisbart, et al., <i>Int. J. Oncol. </i>2004 December; 25(6):1867-73).</p><p id="p-0258" num="0254">In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may be diabodies. Diabodies are functional bispecific single-chain antibodies (bscAb). These bivalent antigen-binding molecules are composed of non-covalent dimers of scFvs, and can be produced in mammalian cells using recombinant methods. (See, e.g., Mack et al, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </i>92: 7021-7025, 1995). Few diabodies have entered clinical development. An iodine-123-labeled diabody version of the anti-CEA chimeric antibody cT84.66 has been evaluated for pre-surgical immunoscintigraphic detection of colorectal cancer in a study sponsored by the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00647153) (Nelson, A.

TascFvs have been found to be poorly soluble and require refolding when produced in bacteria, or they may be manufactured in mammalian cell culture systems, which avoids refolding requirements but may result in poor yields. Construction of a tascFv with genes for two different scFvs yields a &#x201c;bispecific single-chain variable fragments&#x201d; (bis-scFvs). Only two tascFvs have been developed clinically by commercial firms; both are bispecific agents in active early phase development by Micromet for oncologic indications, and are described as &#x201c;Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTE).&#x201d; Blinatumomab is an anti-CD19/anti-CD3 bispecific tascFv that potentiates T-cell responses to B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Phase 2.

These typically include two scFvs (one binding to CD3 on Tcells and one binding to a target antigen on the surface of a cell being targeted for destruction). In some embodiments, the two scFvs are joined by a linker. In other embodiments, the two scFvs are different regions on an antibody. The clinical activity of BiTE antibodies corroborates findings that ex vivo expanded, autologous T-cells derived from tumor tissue, or transfected with specific T-cell receptors, have shown therapeutic potential in the treatment of solid tumors. While these personalized approaches prove that T-cells alone can have considerable therapeutic activity, even in late-stage cancer, they are cumbersome to perform on a broad basis. This is different for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies, which facilitate generation of tumor-specific T-cell clones, and also for bi- and tri-specific antibodies that directly engage a large proportion of patients' T-cells for cancer cell lysis. The potential of global T-cell engagement for human cancer therapy by T-cell-engaging antibodies is under active investigation (Baeuerle P A, et al., Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics. 2009, 11(1):22-30 and Baeuerle P A and Reinhardt C, Cancer Res. 2009, 69(12): 4941-4, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0258">Third generation molecules include &#x201c;miniaturized&#x201d; antibodies. Among the best examples of mAb miniaturization are the small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs) from Trubion Pharmaceuticals.

Presumably, such a molecule might offer the advantages of increased tissue or tumor penetration claimed by fragments while retaining the immune effector functions conferred by constant domains. At least three &#x201c;miniaturized&#x201d; SMIPs have entered clinical development. TRU-015, an anti-CD20 SMIP developed in collaboration with Wyeth, is the most advanced project, having progressed to Phase 2 for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Earlier attempts in systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) and B cell lymphomas were ultimately discontinued. Trubion and Facet Biotechnology are collaborating in the development of TRU-016, an anti-CD37 SMIP, for the treatment of CLL and other lymphoid neoplasias, a project that has reached Phase 2. Wyeth has licensed the anti-CD20 SMIP SBI-087 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including RA, SLE and possibly multiple sclerosis, although these projects remain in the earliest stages of clinical testing.

While IgG4 molecules are unstable and can exchange light-heavy chain heterodimers with one another, deletion of the hinge region prevents heavy chain-heavy chain pairing entirely, leaving highly specific monovalent light/heavy heterodimers, while retaining the Fc region to ensure stability and extended half-life in vivo. This configuration may minimize the risk of immune activation or oncogenic growth, as IgG4 interacts poorly with FcRs and monovalent unibodies fail to promoteintracellular signaling complex formation. These contentions are, however, largely supported by laboratory, rather than clinical, evidence.

Intrabodies are a form of antibody that is not secreted from a cell in which it is produced, but instead targets one or more intracellular proteins.

In some embodiments, methods described herein include intrabody-based therapies. In some such embodiments, variable domain sequences and/or CDR sequences disclosed herein are incorporated into one or more constructs for intrabody-based therapy. For example, intrabodies may target one or more glycated intracellular proteins or may modulate the interaction between one or more glycated intracellular proteins and an alternative protein.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0273">More than two decades ago, intracellular antibodies against intracellular targets were first described (Biocca, Neuberger and Cattaneo <i>EMBO J. </i>9: 101-108, 1990). The intracellular expression of intrabodies in different compartments of mammalian cells allows blocking or modulation of the function of endogenous molecules (Biocca, et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>9: 101-108, 1990; Colby et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>101: 17616-21, 2004). Intrabodies can alter protein folding, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA interactions and protein modification. They can induce a phenotypic knockout and work as neutralizing agents by direct binding to the target antigen, by diverting its intracellular traffic or by inhibiting its association with binding partners. They have been largely employed as research tools and are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of human diseases as viral pathologies, cancer and misfolding diseases. The fast growing bio-market of recombinant antibodies provides intrabodies with enhanced binding specificity, stability and solubility, together with lower immunogenicity, for their use in therapy (Biocca, abstract in <i>Antibody Expression and Production Cell Engineering </i>Volume 7, 2011, pp. 179-195).</p><p id="p-0278" num="0274">In some embodiments, intrabodies have advantages over interfering RNA (iRNA); for example, iRNA has been shown to exert multiple non-specific effects, whereas intrabodies have been shown to have high specificity and affinity of to target antigens. Furthermore, as proteins, intrabodies possess a much longer active half-life than iRNA. Thus, when the active half-life of the intracellular target molecule is long, gene silencing through iRNA may be slow to yield an effect, whereas the effects of intrabody expression can be almost instantaneous.

Intrabodies are often recombinantly expressed as single domain fragments such as isolated VH and VL domains or as a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody within the cell. For example, intrabodies are often expressed as a single polypeptide to form a single chain antibody comprising the variable domains of the heavy and light chain joined by a flexible linker polypeptide. Intrabodies typically lack disulfide bonds and are capable of modulating the expression or activity of target genes through their specific binding activity. Single chain antibodies can also be expressed as a single chain variable region fragment joined to the light chain constant region.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0277">As is known in the art, an intrabody can be engineered into recombinant polynucleotide vectors to encode sub-cellular trafficking signals at its N or C terminus to allow expression at high concentrations in the sub-cellular compartments where a target protein is located. For example, intrabodies targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are engineered to incorporate a leader peptide and, optionally, a C-terminal ER retention signal, such as the KDEL (SEQ ID NO: 23) amino acid motif. Intrabodies intended to exert activity in the nucleus are engineered to include a nuclear localization signal. Lipid moieties are joined to intrabodies in order to tether the intrabody to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Intrabodies can also be targeted to exert function in the cytosol. For example, cytosolic intrabodies are used to sequester factors within the cytosol, thereby preventing them from being transported to their natural cellular destination.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0278">There are certain technical challenges with intrabody expression. In particular, protein conformational folding and structural stability of the newly-synthesized intrabody within the cell is affected by reducing conditions of the intracellular environment. In human clinical therapy, there are safety concerns surrounding the application of transfected recombinant DNA, which is used to achieve intrabody expression within the cell. Of particular concern are the various viral-based vectors commonly-used in genetic manipulation. Thus, one approach to circumvent these problems is to fuse protein transduction domains (PTD) to scFv antibodies, to create a &#x2018;cell-permeable&#x2019; antibody or &#x2018;Transbody.&#x2019; Transbodies are cell-permeable antibodies in which a protein transduction domain (PTD) is fused with single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies (Heng and Cao, 2005<i>, Med Hypotheses. </i>64:1105-8).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0279">Upon interaction with a target gene, an intrabody modulates target protein function and/or achieves phenotypic/functional knockout by mechanisms such as accelerating target protein degradation and sequestering the target protein in a non-physiological sub-cellular compartment. Other mechanisms of intrabody-mediated gene inactivation can depend on the epitope to which the intrabody is directed, such as binding to the catalytic site on a target protein or to epitopes that are involved in protein-protein, protein-DNA, or protein-RNA interactions.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0280">In one embodiment, intrabodies are used to capture a target in the nucleus, thereby preventing its activity within the nucleus. Nuclear targeting signals are engineered into such intrabodies in order to achieve the desired targeting. Such intrabodies are designed to bind specifically to a particular target domain. In another embodiment, cytosolic intrabodies that specifically bind to a target protein are used to prevent the target from gaining access to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from exerting any biological activity within the nucleus (e.g., preventing the target from forming transcription complexes with other factors).</p><p id="p-0285" num="0281">In order to specifically direct the expression of such intrabodies to particular cells, the transcription of the intrabody is placed under the regulatory control of an appropriate tumor-specific promoter and/or enhancer. In order to target intrabody expression specifically to prostate, for example, the PSA promoter and/or promoter/enhancer can be utilized (See, for example, U.S. Pat.

There are a number of distinct advantages that a &#x2018;Transbody&#x2019; would possess over conventional intrabodies expressed within the cell. For a start, &#x2018;correct&#x2019; conformational folding and disulfide bond formation can take place prior to introduction into the target cell. More importantly, the use of cell-permeable antibodies or Transbodies' would avoid the overwhelming safety and ethical concerns surrounding the direct application of recombinant DNA technology in human clinical therapy, which is required for intrabody expression within the cell. &#x2018;Transbodies&#x2019; introduced into the cell would possess only a limited active half-life, without resulting in any permanent genetic alteration.

These molecules can work as neutralizing agents against amyloidogenic proteins by preventing their aggregation, and/or as molecular shunters of intracellular traffic by rerouting the protein from its potential aggregation site (Cardinale, and Biocca, <i>Curr.

Calculation of the percent identity of two polymeric sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second polymeric sequence for optimal alignment and non-identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The residues at corresponding positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same residue as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using methods such as those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 1989, 4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can, alternatively, be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using an NWSgapdna.CMP matrix. Methods commonly employed to determine percent identity between sequences include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988); incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments, derivatives include native or starting proteins that have been modified with an organic proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous derivatizing agent, and post-translational modifications. Covalent modifications are traditionally introduced by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the protein with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side-chains or terminal residues, or by harnessing mechanisms of post-translational modifications that function in selected recombinant host cells. The resultant covalent derivatives are useful in programs directed at identifying residues important for biological activity, for immunoassays, or for the preparation of anti-protein antibodies for immunoaffinity purification of the recombinant glycoprotein. Such modifications are within the ordinary skill in the art and are performed without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0327">Certain post-translational modifications are the result of the action of recombinant host cells on the expressed polypeptide. Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently post-translationally deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues. Alternatively, these residues are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues may be present in the proteins used in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0328">Other post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T.

Multiple aberrant glycosylation forms have been described in human cancers, identifying specific tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) as a class of cell surface molecules suitable for specific tumor targeting (Cheever, M. A. et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep. 1; 15(17):5323-37). TACA antigen expression has been found in epithelial cancers including, but not limited to, breast, colon, lung, bladder, cervical, ovarian, stomach, prostate, and liver. TACA antigen expression has been found in embryonal cancers including, but not limited to, yolk sac tumors and seminomas. In addition, TACA antigen expression has been found in many melanomas, carcinomas, and leukemias of various tissues (Heimburg-Molinaro et al., Vaccine. 2011 Nov. 8: 29(48):8802-8826). Antibodies of the present invention that target one or more TACA are referred to herein as &#x201c;anti-TACA antibodies.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0360" num="0355">It has been estimated that about 80% of all carcinomas express a truncated glycan, the Tn Antigen. With few exceptions, Tn and the sialylated form Sialyl Tn (STn), are not expressed in normal, healthy tissues. Furthermore, the non-human immunogenic sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), seems to be differentially expressed on carcinomas such as breast cancer in the form of Neu5Gc-STn (GcSTn).</p><p id="p-0361" num="0356">Multiple aberrant glycosylation forms have been described in human cancers, identifying specific glycans as a class of cell surface molecules suitable for specific tumor targeting (Cheever, M. A. et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep. 1; 15(17):5323-37). For example, various human cancer types (such as bladder, breast, cervical, colon, lung, and ovarian cancer among others) show high expression of STn antigen, which is rare in normal human tissues (Karlen, P. et al., Gastroenterology. 1998 December;11 5(6):1395-404; Ohno, S. et al, Anticancer Res. 2006 November-December;26(6A):4047-53). In addition, the presence of STn on tumor-associated mucins relates to cancer with poor prognosis and is therewith considered an attractive epitope for cancer detection and targeted therapy (Cao, Y. et al., Virchows Arch. 1997 September;431(3):159-66; Julien, S. et al., Br J Cancer. 2009 Jun. 2; 100(11):1746-54; Itzkowitz, S. H. et al., Cancer. 1990 Nov. 1; 66(9):1960-6; Motoo, Y. et al., Oncology. 1991; 48(4):321-6; Kobayashi, H. et al., J Clin Oncol. 1992 January;10(1):95-101). Tn and STn formation is associated with somatic mutations in the gene Cosmc that encodes a molecular chaperon required for the formation of the activate T-synthase (Ju, T. et al., Nature. 2005 Oct. 27; 437(7063):1252; Ju, T. et al., Cancer Res. 2008 Mar. 15; 68(6):1636-46). It can also result from increased expression of the sialyl transferase, ST6GalNAc I (Ikehara, Y. et al., Glycobiology. 1999 November; 9(11):1213-24; Brockhausen, I. et al., Biol Chem. 2001 February;382(2):219-32). De novo expression of STn can modulate carcinoma cells, change the malignant phenotype, and lead to more aggressive cell behaviors (Pinho, S. et al., Cancer Lett. 2007 May 8; 249(2):157-70). Although STn is highly expressed in malignant tissues, low levels are also found on healthy human cells (Jass, J. R. et al., J Pathol. 1995 June;176(2):143-9; Kirkeby, S. et al., Arch Oral Biol. 2010 November; 55(11):830-41). STn alone has attracted attention as a target for cancer detection and therapy (Cheever, M. A. et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep. 1; 15(17):5323-37).</p><p id="p-0362" num="0357">In addition to the presence of STn, other glycosylation changes have been described in cancer. One of them involves Neu5Gc. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and Neu5Gc are the two major sialic acids on mammalian cell surfaces. Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc differ only in that Neu5Gc comprises an additional oxygen atom associated with chemical group attached to carbon 5. Due to the loss of a functional gene, humans can only synthesize sialic acid in the form of Neu5Ac, but not Neu5Gc. However, Neu5Gc can be metabolically incorporated into humans from animal-derived dietary sources such as red meats (Tangvoranuntakul, P. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Oct. 14; 100(21):12045-50; Nguyen, D. H. et al., J Immunol. 2005 Jul. 1; 175(1):228-36; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,682,794, 8,084,219, US2012/0142903, WO2010030666 and WO2010030666, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Neu5Gc is significantly abundant among human tumors (Higashi, H. et al., Cancer Res. 1985 August; 45(8):3796-802; Miyoshi I. et al., Mol Immunol. 1986. 23: 631-638; Hirabayashi, Y. et al., Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987. 78: 614-620; Kawachi. S, et al., Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol. 1988. 85: 381-383; Devine, P. L. et al., Cancer Res. 1991. 51: 5826-5836; Malykh, Y. N. et al, Biochimie. 2001. 83: 623-634 and Inoue, S. et al., 2010. Glycobiology. 20(6): 752-762) and remarkably low in normal human tissues, which had been overlooked for several decades (Diaz, S. L. et al., PLoS One. 2009. 4: e4241; Tangvoranuntakul, P. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003. 100: 12045-12050; Varki, A. et al., Glycoconj J. 2009. 26: 231-245). The increased metabolic accumulation of diet-derived Neu5Gc in cancer tissue compared to healthy human tissues is likely explained by at least three factors: rapid growth with underproduction of competing endogenous Neu5Ac, enhanced macropinocytosis induced by growth factors (Dharmawardhane, S. et al., Mol Biol Cell. 2000 October;11(10):3341-52; Simonsen, A. et al., Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2001 August;13(4):485-92; Johannes, L. et al., Traffic. 2002 July;3(7):443-51; Amyere, M. et al., Int J Med Microbiol. 2002 February;291(6-7):487-94), and the upregulation of gene expression of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter gene sialin by hypoxia (Yin, J. et al., Cancer Res. 2006 Mar. 15; 66(6):2937-45). In addition, all humans tested to date comprise a polyclonal antibody reservoir against non-human Neu5Gc, which makes it the first example of a xeno-autoantigen (Padler-Karavani, V. et al., Glycobiology. 2008 October;18(10):818-30; Varki, N. M. et al., Annu Rev Pathol. 2011; 6:365-93). The accumulation of dietary Neu5Gc in malignant tumors in the face of an anti-Neu5Gc response was shown to facilitate tumor progression by inducing a low-grade chronic inflammation (Hedlund, M. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 Dec. 2; 105(48):18936-41). Thus, Neu5Gc containing glycan epitopes on human tumors represent a valuable possibility for drug targeting. A recent study suggests the existence of antibodies against Neu5Gc-containing STn (GcSTn), but not Neu5Ac-STn (AcSTn), in cancer patients and explores their potential as a specific biomarker for cancer detection (Padler-Karavani, V. et al., Cancer Res. 2011 May 1; 71(9):3352-63).</p><p id="p-0363" num="0358">MUC1 is a key cell surface glycoprotein that is normally extensively glycosylated but is underglycosylated in tumor cells. Sparse glycosylation of MUC1 leads to exposure of immunogenic antigens. These may be along the MUC1 core peptide sequence or along core carbohydrate residues. These TACAs include, but are not limited to N-acetylgalactosamine (Tn), sialyl(&#x3b1;2,6)N-acetylgalactosamine (STn) and galactose(&#x3b2;1-3)N-acetylgalactosamine (also known as Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen or TF). It has been estimated that about 80% of all carcinomas express Tn among the core carbohydrates of MUC1 with STn being strongly expressed on human carcinoma cells and linked to cancer progression and metastasis. With few exceptions, Tn and STn are not expressed in normal healthy tissues. Sialic acid forms a prominent epitope on STn. The invention takes advantage of the fact that aberrant Neu5Gc-STn (GcSTn) glycan expression appears to be highly specific to various carcinomas.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0359">In the case of MUC1, Neu5Gc incorporation into STn yields a tumor-specific target, a site that is an attractive target for antibody-based therapies to treat tumor tissue. In some embodiments of the present invention, glycan-interacting antibodies target MUC1 expressing cancer cells comprising Neu5Gc. To date, Neu5Gc has been detected in glycoconjugates from a number of human cancer tissues including, but not limited to colon cancer, retinoblastoma tissue, melanoma, breast cancer and yolk sac tumor tissue.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;anti-tumor cell immune activity&#x201d; refers to any activity of the immune system that kills or prevents growth and/or proliferation of tumor cells. In some cases, anti-tumor immune activity includes recognition and tumor cell killing by natural killer (NK) cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Adaptive anti-tumor immune responses include tumor antigen uptake and presentation by antigen presenting cells (APCs,) such as dendritic cells (DCs,) leading to modulation of T cell anti-tumor activity and/or expansion of B cells with secretion of tumor-specific antibodies. The binding of tumor-specific antibodies to tumors can lead to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) mechanisms of tumor cell death.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0371">As used herein, the term &#x201c;immune-resistant tumor cell&#x201d; refers to a tumor cell that reduces or evades anti-tumor cell immune activity. Some studies indicate that the expression of STn (a known TACA) on tumor cell surfaces or secreted into the tumor cell microenvironment can promote tumor cell evasion of anti-tumor immune activity. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tumor cell microenvironment&#x201d; refers to any area adjacent to or surrounding a tumor cell. Such areas include, but are not limited to areas between tumor cells, between tumor and non-tumor cells, surrounding fluids and surrounding components of the extracellular matrix.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0372">Sialylated mucins comprising STn were demonstrated by Ogata et al to reduce NK cell targeting of tumor cells (Ogata, S. et al., 1992. Canc. Res. 52:4741-6, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). This study found that the presence of ovine, bovine and porcine submaxillary mucin (OSM, BSM and PSM, respectively) led to nearly one hundred percent inhibition of cytotoxicity (see Table 2 of Ogata et al). Further studies by Jandus et al, demonstrate that some tumor cells can evade NK destruction due to the expression of sialoglycan ligands that can interact with NK cell siglec receptors, leading to NK inhibition (Jandus, C. et al., 2014, JCI. pii: 65899, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p><p id="p-0378" num="0373">Studies by Toda et al., demonstrate that STn may bind CD22 receptors on B cells, leading to decreased signal transduction and reduced B cell activation (Toda, M. et al., 2008. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 372(1):45-50, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Dendritic cells (DCs) can affect adaptive immune activity by modulating T cell activity. Studies by Carrascal et al found that STn expression by bladder cancer cells induced tolerance in DCs, reducing their ability to induce anti-tumor cell immune activity in T cells (Carrascal, M A et al., 2014. Mol Oncol. pii: S1574-7891(14)00047-7, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). These studies revealed that DCs coming into contact with STn-positive bladder cancer cells displayed a tolorigenic expression profile with low expression of CD80, CD86, IL-12 and TNF-&#x3b1;. Further, DCs were found to modulate regulatory T cells such that the T cells had low expression of IFN&#x3b3; and high expression of FoxP3. Other studies by van Vliet and others, indicate that DC surface expression of macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) can lead to targeting of those cells to tumor tissues (van Vliet, S J., 2007. Amsterdam: Vrije Universiteit. p1-232 and van Vliet, S J. et al., 2008. J Immunol. 181(5):3148-55, Nollau, P. et al., 2013. J Histochem Cytochem. 61(3):199-205, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). DCs arriving at tissues due to MGL interactions may influence T helper (Th) cells in one of three ways. DCs can induce T cell tolerance, T cell immune activity or downregulation of effector T cells. MGL has been shown to bind to both AcSTn and GcSTn and the affinity has been analyzed in depth (Mortezai, N. et al., 2013. Glycobiology. 23(7):844-52, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Interestingly, MUC1 expression on tumors has been shown to lead to T cell tolerance, protecting tumor cells from immune eradication.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0374">In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies (including, but not limited to anti-STn antibodies) of the present invention may be used to treat subjects comprising one or more tumor cells expressing one or more TACAs. In some cases, glycan-interacting antibodies (including, but not limited to anti-STn antibodies) of the invention may be used to increase anti-tumor cell immune activity toward tumor cells expressing STn. Such antibodies may increase the adaptive immune response and/or the innate immune response toward immune-resistant tumor cells. Some glycan-interacting antibodies may be used to increase NK anti-tumor cell activity. Such glycan-interacting antibodies may, in some cases, block the interaction between glycan receptors expressed on NK cells and STn glycans on cancer cells or in surrounding tissues.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0375">In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies (including, but not limited to anti-STn antibodies) of the invention may be used to increase B cell anti-tumor cell activity. Such antibodies may reduce the interaction between CD22 receptors on B cells and STn glycans on cancer cells or in surrounding tissues. A study by Sjoberg et al. demonstrates that 9-O-acetylation of &#x3b1;2,6-linked sialic acids on glycoproteins also reduced interaction between B cell CD22 receptors and such glycoproteins (Sjoberg, E. R. et al. 1994. JCB. 126(2): 549-562). Another study by Shi et al. reveals that higher levels of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid residues on murine erythroleukemia cells makes these cells more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis (Shi, W-X. et al., 1996. J of Biol Chem. 271(49): 31526-32, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In some embodiments, anti-STn antibodies of the invention are capable of selectively binding non-9-O-acetylated STn, reducing overall STn binding, but reducing tumor cell growth and/or proliferation. (e.g. through increased B cell anti-tumor activity and increased complement-mediated tumor cell destruction). In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies (including, but not limited to anti-STn antibodies) of the invention may be used to increase DC anti-tumor activity. Such antibodies may be used to reduce DC tolerance to tumor cells. Reduced DC tolerance may comprise increasing DC expression of CD80, CD86, IL-12 and/or TNF-&#x3b1;. In some cases, DC anti-tumor cell activity may comprise promotion of T cell anti-tumor cell activity. Such antibodies may prevent binding between DC MGL and glycans expressed on or around cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0376">A study by Ibrahim et al. suggests that high levels of anti-STn antibodies along with endocrine therapy may increase overall survival and time to progression (TTP) in women with metastatic breast cancer (Ibrahim, N.

CSCs are distinguished from terminally differentiated cells by their capacity to self-renew and give rise to non-CSC, differentiated progeny (Gupta et al., Nature medicine, 2009, 15, 1010-1012). These properties are akin to those of normal stem cells. Such distinctions between normal stem cells and CSCs have important implications for therapy.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0383">An increasing number of cell-surface biomarkers have been identified that purport to differentiate CSCs from their non-CSC counterparts (Medema et al., Nature cell biology, 2013, 15, 338-344; Zoller, Cancer, 2011, 11, 254-267). These may include, but are not limited to CD44, CD133, CD117, and aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1). Although some of these derive from studies of mouse tumors and human cell lines, others have been validated using primary human tumor samples. One of these, the membrane-spanning CD44 glycoprotein, or hyaluronan receptor, which is a well-known constituent of a variety of tumor types, has also more recently found acceptance as a bona fide CSC marker in human cancers, and in fact is the one most frequently observed (Lobo et al., 2007, 23, 675-699).</p><p id="p-0389" num="0384">CD44 exists in several variant isoforms generated by alternative splicing events occurring among the 20 exons and 19 introns of the full-length CD44 gene (Williams et al, Experimental biology and medicine, 2013, 238, 324-338). Growing experimental evidence points to the supporting role of CD44 and its variants in contributing to the innate metastatic and drug resistant phenotype of CSCs (Negi et al., Journal of drug targeting, 2012, 20, 561-573), in part due to modulation of intracellular signal transduction pathways (Williams et al, Experimental biology and medicine, 2013, 238, 324-338). Additionally, patients with triple negative breast cancer, along with several other cancer types, that display high levels of CD44 cells are known to have a poor prognosis and higher mortality (Negi et al., Journal of drug targeting, 2012, 20, 561-573). These observations support the notion that targeting CD44 offers a means of treating cancer through inhibition or elimination of CSCs, in addition to mature cancer cells. Indeed, numerous approaches to targeting CD44 have been attempted experimentally with varying degrees of success. These comprise a wide range of technologies that include the use of conjugated and unconjugated antibodies, nano-carrier drug systems, and hyaluronan-conjugated drugs (Negi et al., Journal of drug targeting, 2012, 20, 561-573). In several instances, however, toxic effects were observed in in vivo studies; these untoward side effects may be attributable to the widespread occurrence of CD44 and variants on the membranes of most vertebrate cells (Naor et al., Seminars in cancer biology, 2008, 18, 260-267), in addition to its presence on the surface of the targeted CSCs and mature tumor cells. Targeting CD44 protein, which is a constituent of normal human stem cells (Williams et al, Experimental biology and medicine, 2013, 238, 324-338), can also harm normal stem cell function (Leth-Larsen et al., Molecular medicine, 2012, 18, 1109-1121). Although a large body of research points to the desirability of targeting CD44 protein on CSCs, as well as on mature tumor cells, the intrinsic problem with this approach remains the present difficulty in designing inhibitors that will spare normal tissue as well as normal stem cells.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0385">Another well-known tumor antigen with implications to CSC biology is the epithelial mucin MUC1, a membrane tethered glycoprotein that is differentially expressed at high levels on the majority of adenocarcinomas but at low levels or not at all on normal epithelial cells. MUC1 has recently been identified as a CSC biomarker on a variety of neoplasias including breast (Engelmann et al., Cancer research, 2008, 68, 2419-2426), and pancreatic cancers, where its expression is correlated with high metastasis and poor prognosis. As a constituent of CSCs, MUC1 has been shown to function in cell adhesion, proliferation, survival, and signaling (Engelmann et al., Cancer research, 2008, 68, 2419-2426) and may also be co-expressed with CD44 (Leth-Larsen et al., Molecular medicine, 2012, 18, 1109-1121). Immunotherapeutic approaches for targeting MUC1 in cancer are being pursued using vaccines as well as other approaches, but primarily in the context of mature cancer cell therapy (Julien et al., Biomolecules, 2012, 2, 435-466; Acres et al., Expert review of vaccines, 2005, 4, 493-502).</p><p id="p-0391" num="0386">Cancer stem cells have been hypothesized to be generated through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition (Gupta et al., Nature medicine, 2009, 15, 1010-1012), and/or reversely the mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) transition that occurs at the site of metastasis (Leth-Larsen et al., Molecular medicine, 2012, 18, 1109-1121) (also called CSCs plasticity where non-CSCs can give rise to CSCs). This discovery further underscores the need to eliminate both CSCs and non-CSCs in a cancerous tissue or tumor cell population.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0387">Recent studies with enriched CSC populations has revealed that these cells, unlike the bulk of the tumor, are relatively quiescent and are preferentially resistant to many types of current therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation (Leth-Larsen et al., Molecular medicine, 2012, 18, 1109-1121). Thus current therapeutic strategies target non-CSC components of the tumor, leaving CSCs largely unaffected only to re-emerge after appropriate cues to reform recurrent primary tumors at the initial site or to disseminate to distant sites, colonize, and create metastatic disease, the major cause of cancer mortality.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0388">Current understanding of the properties of cancer stem cells clearly emphasized the need not only to target the bulk of cells present in tumors, as is current practice, but also the CSC compartment in order to potentially effect complete cures.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0389">As discussed above, strategies that have been developed based on tumor (including CSCs) associated biomarkers face a challenge that most cancer biomarkers are also present in normal cells including normal stem cells. A therapy that targets a protein biomarker to eliminate CSCs, may also target normal stem cells, causing elimination of normal cells.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="2">Tumor-Specific Glycans in CSCs</heading><p id="p-0395" num="0390">Aberrant forms of glycosylation, including appearance of the Thomsen-nouveau (Tn) antigen (GalNAc&#x2014;O-Ser/Thr), have been described in numerous human cancers, identifying glycans as an entirely novel class of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens suitable for specific tumor targeting (Rabu et al., Future oncology, 2012, 8, 943-960). The formation of the sialyl derivative of Tn (STn) is mediated by the sialyl transferase ST6GalNAc I which adds sialic acid in an &#x3b1;2,6 linkage to the Tn antigen. The sialylation of Tn prevents further sugar additions, thus truncating further glycan extensions (Schultz et al., Cancer metastasis reviews, 2012, 31, 501-518).</p><p id="p-0396" num="0391">While the presence of STn in normal adult human tissues is rare, STn occurs in various human cancers, including ovarian, bladder, breast, cervical, colon, and lung cancer, among others (Ferreira et al., Molecular oncology, 2013, 7, 719-731; Kinney et al., Cancer, 1997, 80, 2240-2249). Further, the presence of STn in tumors is associated with metastatic disease, poor prognosis, and reduced overall survival (Ferreira et al., Molecular oncology, 2013, 7, 719-731; Kinney et al., Cancer, 1997, 80, 2240-2249); therefore, STn is considered a highly attractive target for cancer detection and therapy. There are two distinct forms of sialic acid&#x2014;Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc&#x2014;located at the terminal position of STn. The Neu5Ac-sialylated form is predominant in humans since humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc due to an inactive CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) gene. However, consumption of Neu5Gc-rich foods leads to foreign Neu5Gc incorporation into human cells, especially in carcinomas. Previous studies have shown that solid tumors take up and express the Neu5Gc form of sialic acid (Inoue et al., Glycobiology, 2010, 20, 752-762; Malykh et al., Biochimie, 2001, 83, 623-634; Padler-Karavani et al., Cancer research, 2011, 71, 3352-3363). mAbs that bind to both glyco-isoforms of STn [Neu5Ac-STn (AcSTn) and Neu5Gc-STn (GcSTn)] that are potential cancer targets are designated as pan-STn antibodies.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0392">STn accumulation is associated with specific somatic mutations observed repeatedly in solid tumors and with the inactivation of the gene that encodes the molecular chaperone Core 1 Beta3-Galactosyltransferase-Specific Molecular Chaperone (COSMC), which is required for the formation of active T-synthase (Ju et al., Nature, 2005, 437, 125). T-synthase competes with ST6GalNAc I for the GalNAc substrate and therefore when inactivated by mutation results in elevated STn synthesis. Additionally, STn accumulation can also result from increased expression of ST6GalNAc I, which is often observed (Brockhausen et al., Biological chemistry, 2001, 382, 219-232; Ikehara et al., Glycobiology, 1999, 9, 1213-1224). De novo expression of STn can modulate carcinoma cells, change the malignant phenotype, and lead to more aggressive cell behaviors (Pinho et al., Cancer letters, 2007, 249, 157-170). As such, STn is not only an interesting cancer biomarker and therapeutic target, but interfering with STn function offers the intriguing potential to have significant functional, anti-metastatic therapeutic benefits.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0393">Although it is well-known that glycosylation of cellular glycoproteins is altered in cancer, it appears that aberrant glycosylation is selective with respect to both the glycoprotein and glycan in question. In fact, in human tumor CSCs only CD44 and MUC1 are major carriers of the STn antigen (Cazet et al., Breast cancer research: BCR, 2010, 12,204; Julien et al., Glycobiology, 2006, 16, 54-64), immediately suggesting a selective approach for targeting not only mature tumor cells but also CSCs. Whereas MUC1 is a normal surface constituent of some epithelial cells where it serves a barrier function. Tumor-associated MUC1 is characterized by hypoglycosylation and increased sialylation on CSCs in the same fashion as observed in mature cancer cells, with STn appearing as a specific marker for both CSCs and mature tumor cells (Curry et al., Journal of surgical oncology, 2013, 107, 713-722). The aberrant oligosaccharide profile of MUC1 gives rise to the expression of neomarkers such as sialyl-Lea (used in the CA19-9 test), sialyl-Le&#x2032;, and sialyl-Tn (TAG-72), as well as the cryptic epitopes such as Tn in cancer cells (e.g., CSCs). In addition, because of underglycosylation, the peptide core of the mucin becomes exposed such that epitopes within the core (not accessible within normal tissue-derived MUC1) may serve as potential antigens.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0394">Clinical approaches targeting STn have thus far consisted solely of STn vaccines. The most advanced clinical candidate is Theratope, a therapeutic vaccine consisting of STn coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. In in vivo mouse studies Theratope immunization induced a potent antibody response that was shown to mediate a delay in the growth of injected STn-expressing mammary carcinoma cells (Julien et al., British journal of cancer, 2009, 100, 1746-1751). However, Theratope failed to meet its primary endpoint in a phase III clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer. A leading hypothesis for why the Theratope trial missed its primary endpoint is that the patient population was not evaluated for STn expression prior to enrollment. Since STn expression in breast cancer is highly heterogeneous between patients, ranging from 25%-80% depending on the study and detection method, lack of ability to correlate STn expression with response may have masked any benefit from Theratope. Importantly, a subset of patients receiving hormonal therapy showed a significant 7.5 month increase in median overall survival when treated with Theratope compared to hormone therapy alone (Ibrahim et al., Journal of clinical oncology: official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2004, 22, 2547; and Miles et al., The oncologist, 2011, 16, 1092-1100), validating the therapeutic potential of targeting STn in particular patient populations. Additionally, since the immune response often varies considerably between vaccinated patients, vaccine approaches lack the ability to control or modulate antibody titer, resulting in wide ranges of therapeutic antibody exposure among patients. Nonetheless, Theratope was well tolerated with minimal toxicity, demonstrating the safety of targeting STn for cancer therapy.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0395">The growing understanding of the molecular basis of STn expression in cancer cells strongly suggests that cells that express STn on any cell surface protein will also express STn on many (if not all) other 0-glycosylated cell surface proteins, rendering it an excellent widely-distributed cancer-associated therapeutic target. Thus, STn positive cancer cell populations may be enriched for CSCs. In addition, recent data demonstrate that abrogation of STn expression renders cancers less aggressive with significant reductions in metastatic behavior (Gill et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2013, 110, E3152-3161).</p><heading id="h-0046" level="2">Anti-STn Antibodies Targeting CSCs as Cancer Treatment</heading><p id="p-0401" num="0396">Several anti-STn antibodies have been described in the field, but some demonstrate low specificity towards the STn antigen or sialylated isoforms. For example, the commercial B72.3 anti-STn antibody has been shown to bind not only to STn but also to the Tn antigen (Bapat, S. A. (2010) Human ovarian cancer stem cells. Reproduction 140, 33-41). The availability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting STn, engineered to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), or conjugated with a cytotoxic payload [e.g. antibody drug conjugate (ADC)], offers the potential of a significant therapeutic benefit for cancer patients with STn-expressing tumors. In addition, such antibodies would also allow for the development of a companion diagnostic to pre-select patients most likely to respond to therapy.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0397">STn is often present on one or more of CSC surface antigens, and together they serve to promote the stemness and chemoresistance properties associated with CSCs. Thus, anti-STn antibodies offer a CSC-associated cancer targeting agent with the potential not only to directly kill CSCs via direct engagement and/or ADCC, but also offer a unique opportunity to bind to a wide array of cell-surface proteins and interfere with their associated functions essential for CSC viability, self-renewal, and replication.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0398">As discuss herein, the rationale and advantages of targeting STn on CSCs may include: (1) many tumor-specific truncated glycoproteins carry STn in cancer; (2) STn is a unique glycan target expressed preferentially on CD44, MUC1, and potentially other important cell-surface markers, on both CSCs and mature tumor cells, irrespective of proliferation status, allowing for targeting of both of these tumor components by a single therapeutic agent; (3) STn is also a component of CA-125, a biomarker of ovarian cancer and others; (4) STn is a component of the ovarian CSC marker CD44. Therefore, the use of pan-STn murine mAbs, targeting an epitope that encompasses both the Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc forms of sialic acid linked to Tn, will bind to and kill or impair the function of CSCs and, by virtue of the common epitope, non-CSC tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0399">In some embodiments, the present invention provides anti-pan STn mAb(s) for specific elimination of human CSCs as well as mature tumor cells. In one aspect of the present invention, the anti-STn antibody will target the validated STn glycan itself&#x2014;not a particular glycopeptide or carrier protein, which should offer the broad potential of binding to CD44, MUC1, or other STn-glycosylated markers on both CSC and non-CSC tumor populations.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0400">Given the exceptional specificity in targeting tumor-associated STn, the present invention may spare normal tissues, including normal adult stem cells, thereby allowing for an excellent therapeutic window.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0401">In accordance with the present invention, provided herein is a unique immunotherapeutic solution aimed at eradicating human neoplasias by eliminating both cancer stem cells (CSCs) and mature cancer cells contained within cancerous tissues and/or tumor cell populations. The elimination is specifically conferred through targeting cell-surface sialylated Tn antigen (STn) structures that are uniquely present in cancerous tissues and/or tumor cell populations, including such structures associated with cancer stem cells.</p><heading id="h-0047" level="2">Colorectal Cancer</heading><p id="p-0407" num="0402">Colorectal cancer (CRC) has the 4<sup>th </sup>largest incidence, and is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Currently, 20% of patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and roughly 50% of patients with CRC will eventually develop metastases. For those diagnosed with metastatic disease, the 5-year survival rate is 13.1%. In patients with metastatic colon cancer (mCRC), there is precedence for use of therapeutic antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (e.g., cetuximab and panitumumab) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibodies (e.g. bevacizumab and ramucirumab).</p><p id="p-0408" num="0403">Expression of STn is reported to be present in 83.4% of CRC patient samples and is correlated with increased malignancy and poor prognosis. STn antigen is present in adult normal colonocytes but is detectable only after removal of 0-acetyl groups by saponification, a process that does not occur naturally in vivo (Julien et al., Biomolecules, 2012, 2, 435-466). Thus, STn may be used as a therapeutic target for treating CRC.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0404">In some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies of the present disclosure may be used to treat CRC and/or mCRC. In some cases, such glycan-interacting antibodies are anti-STn antibodies, including, but not limited to any of those described herein. Glycan-interacting antibodies used to treat CRC and/or mCRC may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent (e.g., MMAE and MMAF). Glycan-interacting antibodies may be used in combination with other therapies such as therapies with a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and/or irinotecan) and/or with a therapeutic antibody (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab and/or ramucirumab). In some cases, glycan-interacting antibodies may be used to treat colorectal cancers that are resistant to one or more other therapeutic treatments.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0405">According to some embodiments, glycan-interacting antibodies used to treat colorectal cancer may be administered at a dose of from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. For example, antibodies may be administered at doses of from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, from about 1 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 2.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg.</p><heading id="h-0048" level="2">Ovarian Cancer</heading><p id="p-0411" num="0406">In some embodiments, methods of the present disclosure include methods of treating ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the leading gynecological cancer effecting women in the U.S. During 2013. It is estimated that 22,240 women will be diagnosed with and 14,030 will die of this disease, making it the fifth leading cause of female-related cancer deaths and the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. (Siegel et al., Cancer statistics, 2013. CA: a cancer journal for clinicians 63, 11-30). This high mortality can be ascribed to non-symptomatic onset, late-stage initial diagnosis, aggressiveness of this type of cancer, and a general lack of therapeutically targetable genetic changes. The current standard of care is tumor debulking followed by taxane and platinum based chemotherapy. While this initial treatment results in &#x2dc;70% of patients achieving an initial complete clinical response, a majority of these patients will unfortunately relapse with chemoresistant disease (Foster et al., Cancer letters, 2013, 338, 147-157; and McCann et al., PloS one, 2011, 6, e28077). In part, recurrent disease has been attributable, as with other cancer types, to the presence of CSCs within the total tumor population. Indeed, ovarian CSCs have been identified and shown to be resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy (Burgos-Ojeda et al., Cancer letters, 2012, 322, 1-7). Thus, again as the case with other forms of cancer, eliminating CSCs along with mature cells in the cancerous tissues and/or tumor cell population offers the best hope to manage recurrent disease and ideally effect cures.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0407">In some embodiments of the present invention, methods are provided for treating ovarian cancer using anti-STn antibodies. Methods include administering anti-STn antibodies to subjects having ovarian cancer or suspected of having ovarian cancer. In some embodiments, ovarian CSCs may be targeted for ovarian cancer treatment, including, but not limited to those present in cancerous tissues and/or tumor cell populations. Although CD133 is the most widely studied of putative ovarian CSC markers, it is recognized that CD44, a known carrier of STn as discussed above, is associated with ovarian cancer and is included in the set of markers that identify ovarian CSCs (Zhang et al., Cancer research, 2008, 68, 4311-4320; Foster et al., Cancer letters, 2013, 338, 147-157; and Zoller, Cancer, 2011, 11, 254-267). Further, STn is expressed on the well-known ovarian cancer biomarker CA-125 (MUC16), as well as on MUC1, where the levels of these STn-associated mucins in serum have been used recently as further differentiators of cancerous versus benign ovarian disease. Elevated serum levels of STn occur in &#x2dc;50% of ovarian cancer patients and correlate with a lower 5-year survival rate (Kobayashi et al., Journal of clinical oncology: official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 1991, 9, 983-987; Kobayashi et al., Journal of clinical oncology: official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 1992, 10, 95-101; and Chen et al., Journal of proteome research, 2013, 12, 1408-1418). Finally, Vathipadiekal et al. in a study of differential gene expression between human primary ovarian carcinoma CSCs and non-CSC populations found that the expression of STn-generating sialyl transferase ST6GalNAc I did not differ among cells from the two compartments.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0408">In some embodiments, administering anti-STn antibodies to a subject having ovarian cancer or suspected of having ovarian cancer, according to the methods described herein, leads to the reduction of STn-positive cells in such subjects and/or the reduction of STn-positive cells in one or more ovarian cancerous tissues or tumor cell populations present in such subjects. In some embodiments, the reduction may include a decrease in STn-positive cells of from about 10% to about greater than 90% (for example, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90%).</p><p id="p-0414" num="0409">In some embodiments, the present invention provides antibodies for targeting CSCs to prevent control or cure cancer related to CSCs.

Such chemotherapy treatments may include treatment with olaparib, carboplatin, and/or paclitaxel. Methods of targeting chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer stem cells may take advantage of changes in STn expression in ovarian cancer stem cells occurring after chemotherapy treatment. In some cases, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer stem cells express STn before and/or after chemotherapy treatment. In some cases, cell surface STn expression in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer stem cells may be increased following chemotherapy treatment. After chemotherapy treatments with olaparib, carboplatin, and/or paclitaxel, some ovarian cancer stem cells may proliferate resulting in a population of STn-expressing cancer cells that are olaparib-, carboplatin-, and/or paclitaxel-resistant. In some embodiments, anti-STn antibodies may be used to target olaparib-, carboplatin-, and/or paclitaxel-resistant cells. In some cases, these resistant cells are cancer stem cells.

As used herein, a &#x201c;capture antibody&#x201d; is an antibody that binds an analyte in a way that it may be detected. Capture antibodies may be associated with surfaces or other carriers. Detection antibodies are antibodies that facilitate observation of the presence or absence of an analyte. In some embodiments, both capture antibody and detection antibody bind to STn. According to such embodiments, the capture antibody and the detection antibody may be derived from different species. This may allow for the use of secondary antibodies that recognize only the detection antibody and are not influenced by the presence of the capture antibody. In some embodiments, the capture antibody may bind to STn and the detection antibody may bind to a protein or carrier of the bound STn. Capture antibodies and detection antibodies used for STn detection in samples may be selected from commercially available anti-STn antibodies as well as any of the anti-STn antibodies presented herein.</p><heading id="h-0053" level="2">STn Expression-Modified Cells</heading><p id="p-0443" num="0438">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides modified cells having altered STn levels. Such cells may be used for various purposes (e.g., experimental, therapeutic, antibody testing etc.). In some cases, methods of the present disclosure include methods of enhancing the expression of ST6GalNAc I in one or more cells or tissues. This may result in the generation of one or more cells having increased expression of cellular STn (e.g., surface-expressed STn). Expression of ST6GalNAc I may be enhanced, for example, by introducing one or more vectors carrying a ST6GalNAc I expression construct. Such expression constructs may be designed with the natural ST6GalNAc I promoter or with a promoter to enhance gene expression. Promoters configured for enhancement of gene expression may have constitutively or overly active promoter elements. In some cases, promoters may be configured for inducible gene expression. Such promoters may become active or have elevated activity when contacted with factors that activate inducible elements of the promoter. STn expression constructs may include hST6GalNAc I pRc-CMV as described in Julien, S. et al., 2001. Glycoconj J, 18: 883-93, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, expression constructs may encode other factors involved in STn synthesis and/or expression. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, T-synthase, and Core 1 Beta3-Galactosyltransferase-Specific Molecular Chaperone (COSMC). In some embodiments, cells with minimal STn expression are converted to STn-expressing cells. Such cells may include, but are not limited to, SKOV3 cells, BRCA1 mutant cells, and non-mutant BRCA1 cells.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0439">Also provided are modified cells having decreased STn expression relative to unmodified cells. Accordingly, methods of the present disclosure include methods of repressing STn expression. Such methods may include reducing ST6GalNAc I expression.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;bioavailability&#x201d; refers to the systemic availability of a given amount of glycan-interacting antibodies administered to a mammal. Bioavailability can be assessed by measuring the area under the curve (AUC) or the maximum serum or plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of the unchanged form of a compound following administration of the compound to a mammal. AUC is a determination of the area under the curve plotting the serum or plasma concentration of a compound along the ordinate (Y-axis) against time along the abscissa (X-axis). Generally, the AUC for a particular compound can be calculated using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art and as described in G. S. Banker, Modern Pharmaceutics, Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, v. 72, Marcel Dekker, New York, Inc., 1996, herein incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, the AUC is calculated using the linear trapezoidal method with linear/linear interpolation. AUC may be expressed in units of time multiplied by concentration (i.e., unit of time*unit of mass/unit of volume). For example, the AUC may be expressed in units of days*&#x3bc;g/ml. The terminal elimination phase of each concentration versus time curve may be identified using one or more final concentration values observed. Terminal elimination phase slope may be determined using log linear regression on unweighted concentration data.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0442">The C<sub>max </sub>value is the maximum concentration of the compound achieved in the serum or plasma of a subject following administration.

For example, intramuscular injection to a mammalian subject is performed using an aqueous composition comprising one or more glycan-interacting antibody and a transfection reagent, and retention of the composition is determined by measuring the level of glycan-interacting antibodies present in the muscle cells.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0518">Certain aspects of the invention are directed to methods of providing compositions to target tissues of mammalian subjects, by contacting the target tissues (containing one or more target cells) with compositions under conditions such that the compositions are substantially retained in the target tissue. Compositions contain an effective amount of glycan-interacting antibodies such that the effect of interest is produced in at least one target cell. Compositions generally contain cell penetration agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, although &#x201c;naked&#x201d; glycan-interacting antibodies (such as glycan-interacting antibodies without cell penetration agents or other agents) are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0519">In some embodiments, compositions include a plurality of different glycan-interacting antibodies, where one or more than one of the glycan-interacting antibodies targets a glycan of interest. Optionally, compositions also contain cell penetration agents to assist in the intracellular delivery of compositions. A determination is made of the composition dose required to target glycans of interest in a substantial percentage of cells contained within a predetermined volume of the target tissue (generally, without targeting glycans in tissue adjacent to the predetermined volume, or distally to target tissues). Subsequent to this determination, the determined dose may be introduced directly into the tissue of the mammalian subject.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0520">In one embodiment, the invention provides for glycan-interacting antibodies to be delivered in more than one injection or by split dose injections.</p><heading id="h-0073" level="2">Pulmonary Administration</heading><p id="p-0526" num="0521">Pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in formulations suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity.

Combining glycan-interacting antibody treatment with such cancer therapeutics may provide beneficial therapeutic properties, e.g. synergistic anti-tumor activity, and may be used for the treatment of cancer. In some cases, such methods may be used to target cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy, antibody therapy and/or cell cycle inhibitor treatment. Methods of targeting drug-resistant cancer cells may take advantage of changes in STn expression in cancer cells occurring after chemotherapy, antibody therapy and/or cell cycle inhibitor treatment. In some cases, drug-resistant cancer cells express STn before and/or after treatment. In some cases, cell surface STn expression in drug-resistant cancer cells may be increased following treatment. After treatments, some cancer cells may proliferate resulting in a population of STn-expressing cancer cells that are resistant to the cancer therapeutic(s) used. In some cases, drug-resistant cancer cells are cancer stem cells.</p><p id="p-0541" num="0536">Accordingly, methods of the invention may include methods of administering an anti-STn antibody to a subject to target STn-expressing cancer cells present after administration of one or more cancer therapeutic. Such anti-STn antibodies may include a variable domain with an amino acid sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-12. Subjects and/or cancerous tissues in subjects treated with anti-STn antibodies may experience a reduction in STn-positive cells. In some embodiments, the reduction may include a decrease in STn-positive cells of from about 10% to about greater than 90% (for example, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90%).</p><p id="p-0542" num="0537">In some embodiments, chemotherapeutic agents used in combination with anti-STn antibodies may include, but are not limited to, taxanes (e.g. paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinum-based agents (e.g. cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g. irinotecan), nucleotide analogs (e.g. 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine), kinase inhibitors [e.g. ponatinib (ICLUSIG&#xae;) and sorafenib (NEXAVAR&#xae;)], and PARP inhibitors [e.g. olaparib (LYNPARZA&#x2122;)]. Chemotherapeutic agents may cause cell death or prevent cell growth through mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, inhibiting microtubule function, enzymatic function, or DNA synthesis.</p><p id="p-0543" num="0538">In some embodiments, therapeutic antibodies used in combination with anti-STn antibodies may include antibodies that target cancer cell surface receptors. Such surface receptors may be involved in cell signaling pathways important for cell proliferation and/or migration. In some cases, the surface receptor may be an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), or a human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER). Antibodies targeting these receptors or associated factors may inhibit cancer cell growth and/or migration. Exemplary anti-EGFR antibodies include cetuximab (ERBITUX) and panitumumab (VECTIBIX). Exemplary anti-VEGF antibodies include bevacizumab (AVASTIN&#xae;) and ramucirumab (CYRAMZA&#xae;). Exemplary anti-HER2 antibodies include trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN&#xae;).

Cell cycle inhibitors may include, but are not limited to, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, checkpoint kinase inhibitors, Polo-like kinase (PLK) inhibitors, and Aurora kinase inhibitors. As used herein, the term &#x201c;cell cycle inhibitor&#x201d; refers to any agent that slows or halts cell cycle progression. Cell cycle inhibitors may induce cell cycle arrest at different stages, and may lead to cell death and/or growth inhibition.</p><p id="p-0545" num="0540">In some embodiments, cell cycle inhibitors may be CDK inhibitors. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a group of serine/threonine kinases. CDKs and their cyclin partners are key regulatory enzymes that drive cell cycle transitions. Among them, CDK4 and CDK6 are key drivers of the transition from GO or G1 phase into S phase. CDK4 and CDK6 (referred to herein as CDK4/6) are close homologs that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. CDK4/6 forms a complex with cyclin D and phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Rb phosphorylation attenuates its suppression of E2F transcription factors, which leads to transcription of genes encoding proteins necessary for DNA replication. This may allow cell entry into S phase. Progression through S phase is controlled by cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes. Transition from G2 to M phase is regulated by CDK1 through interactions with cyclin partners, cyclin A2 and cyclin B. Therapeutics targeting CDKs (generally or specific CDKs) may impede cell cycle progression and prevent cell proliferation. See Otto and Sicinski, Nat Rev Cancer. 2017; 17(2):93-115; and Asghar et al., <i>Nat Rev Drug Discov. </i>2015; 14(2): 130-146; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0546" num="0541">In some cases, CDK inhibitors may be selective CDK4/6 inhibitors. Due to the role of CDK4/6 in G1 to S transition, inhibition of CDK4/6 causes cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Exemplary CDK4/6 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, palbociclib (Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Eli Lilly). Palbociclib (PD-0332991, IBRANCE&#xae;) is an approved drug for the treatment of advanced (metastatic) breast cancer (Finn et al., <i>Breast Cancer Res. </i>2009; 11(5):R77; Rocca et al., <i>Expert Opin Pharmacother. </i>2014; 15(3):407-20; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,936,612; 7,863,278; 7,208,489; and 7,456,168, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Palbociclib may be prepared and characterized according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,345,171, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Similarly, ribociclib (LEE011) also selectively inhibits CDK4/6 with high potency. Ribociclib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of ribociclib may be prepared according to the methods detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,685,980 and 9,193,732, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Abemaciclib (LY-2835219) inhibits not only CDK4 and CDK6 but also several other kinases including PIM1 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,855,211, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Early activity of abemaciclib was reported in lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma patients (Shapiro et al., ASCO Meeting abstracts 2013; 31:2500).</p><p id="p-0547" num="0542">In some cases, CDK inhibitors may be pan-CDK inhibitors. Such inhibitors may block several CDKs and lead to cell cycle arrest at different stages, such as G1 arrest, G2 arrest, and/or G2/M arrest. Exemplary pan-CDK inhibitors include, but are not limited to, flavopiridol (alvocidib), dinaciclib (MK-7965), R-roscovitine, AT7519, milciclib, TG02, CYC065 and RGB-286638. For example, pan-CDK inhibitors may be semi-synthetic flavopiridol (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,727) or analogs of flavopiridol (e.g., see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,733,920 and 5,849,733, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). As another example, pan-CDK inhibitors may be dinaciclib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as disclosed in in U.S. Pat. No. 7,119,200, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0548" num="0543">In some embodiments, cell cycle inhibitors used in combination with glycan-interacting antibodies may be checkpoint kinase inhibitors. Inhibition of checkpoint kinases, for example CHK1, CHK2, or WEE1, may compromise cell cycle checkpoints (e.g., S checkpoint, G2/M checkpoint or the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint), allowing for cell cycle progression even in the presence of DNA damage. This can trigger cell death during mitosis via a mechanism known as &#x201c;mitotic catastrophe.&#x201d; Exemplary checkpoint kinase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, MK-8776, prexasertib (LY2606368), AZD1775, GDC-0575, and those described in Visconti et al. <i>J Exp Clin Cancer Res. </i>2016; 35:153, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0549" num="0544">In some embodiments, cell cycle inhibitors may be Polo-like kinase (PLK) inhibitors. Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are regulatory serine/threonine kinases of the cell cycle. PLK1 is the most characterized member of PLK family and it is a crucial mitotic protein kinase that is involved in many regulatory events such as G2/M transition, spindle assembly maturation, chromosome separation, and mitotic exit. Exemplary PLK1 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, rigosertib (ON 01910.Na), volasertib (BI 6727), BI 2536, HMN-176, TKM-080301, NMS-P937, DAP-81, Cyclopalinl, ZK-Thiazolidinone (TAL), SBE13, COM-36, LFM-A13, scytonemin, wortmannin, and GSK461364A (Kumar and Kim, Biomed Res Int. 2015; 2015:705745, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p><p id="p-0550" num="0545">In some embodiments, cell cycle inhibitors may be Aurora kinase inhibitors. Aurora kinases include a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that are important for faithful transition through mitosis. Aurora A plays a critical role in various mitotic events including centrosome maturation, chromosomal alignment, spindle assembly, meiotic maturation, and cytokinesis. Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex and is involved in chromosome condensation and orientation as well as proper execution of cytokinesis. Exemplary Aurora kinase inhibitors include, barasertib (AZD1152), alisertib (MLN8237), danusertib (PHA-739358), ENMD-2076, AT9283, PF-03814735, and AMG 900 (Bavetsias and Linardopoulos, Front Oncol. 2015; 5: 278, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p><heading id="h-0078" level="2">Dosage</heading><p id="p-0551" num="0546">The present disclosure encompasses delivery of glycan-interacting antibodies for any of therapeutic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic or imaging by any appropriate route taking into consideration likely advances in the sciences of drug delivery.

16.6 M ethanolamine and 284.1 ml of distilled water. The solution is brought to a final pH of 9.0 with HCl. The solution is filtered using a 0.2 &#x3bc;M nitrocellulose membrane. The epoxy buffer solution as well as 1 L of distilled water are pre-warmed to 50&#xb0; C. Glass slides are arranged in a slide holder and quickly submerged in a staining tub with the warmed epoxy blocking buffer. Slides are incubated in the epoxy blocking buffer for 1 hour at 50&#xb0; C. with periodic shaking to deactivate epoxy binding sites. Next, slides are rinsed and blocked with PBS with 1% OVA at 25&#xb0; C. for one hour. Serum samples with polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) or purified monoclonal antibodies (1 ug/mL), are diluted in PBS with 1% OVA and added to the glycan array for one hour at 25&#xb0; C. After extensive washing, binding of antibodies are detected by incubating glycan microarray slides with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) for one hour. Slides are then washed extensively, dried and scanned with a Genepix 4000B scanner (Laser at 100%; gain at 350; 10 &#x3bc;m pixels). Raw data from scanned images are extracted using the Genepix software and analysis of raw data is carried out. Antibodies are considered to be highly specific for AcSTn and GcSTn if they demonstrate binding to both molecules, but not to Tn or any other glycans on the array.</p><p id="p-0577" num="0571">Based on array analysis, antibodies are classified according to array glycan binding profile. Antibodies are classified as &#x201c;Group 1&#x201d; antibodies, capable of binding AcSTn and GcSTn, if they bind to glycans 5, 6, 23 and 24. Such antibodies are referred to as Pan-STn antibodies due to their ability to associate with a wider range of STn structures and the portion of STn indicated by the largest ellipse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Antibodies are classified as &#x201c;Group 2&#x201d; antibodies, capable of binding STn as well as some related structures that include an O-linkage to serine or threonine, if they bind to glycans 5, 6, 23, 24, 27 and 31. These antibodies are thought to associate with the portion of STn indicated by the largest ellipse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Some Group 2 antibodies preferably bind to structures with AcSTn over structures with GcSTn. Antibodies are classified as &#x201c;Group 3&#x201d; antibodies (capable of binding STn, but may also bind a broader set of related structures) if they bind glycans 5, 6, 23, 24, 17, 3, 19, 37, 27 and 31. Unlike Group 2 antibodies, Group 3 antibodies do not require that such structures have an O-linkage to serine or threonine. Group 3 antibodies are thought to associate with the portion of STn indicated by the largest ellipse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. Finally, antibodies are &#x201c;Group 4&#x201d; antibodies, capable of binding to both AcSTn and GcSTn as well as the un-sialylated Tn antigen (therefore having broader specificity) if they bind to glycans 5, 6, 23, 24 and 47.

Optical density values obtained from periodate-treated wells were subtracted from non-periodate treated wells to obtain a periodate-sensitive STn binding curve and corresponding EC<sub>50 </sub>values.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0587">Glycan array analysis was carried out as described previously and antibodies were assigned array glycan binding profiles based on these results.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0588">Results from flow cytometry, ELISA, and glycan array analysis are presented in Table 8.</p><p id="p-0598" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Antibody characterization results</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Array</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>MDA-MB-231-</entry><entry/><entry>glycan</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>STn cell binding </entry><entry>BSM ELISA</entry><entry>binding </entry></row><row><entry>Clone ID</entry><entry>[EC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)]</entry><entry>[EC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)]</entry><entry>profile</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>hSIA101</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>4.2</entry><entry>Group 1</entry></row><row><entry>hSIA102</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>Not Determined</entry><entry>Group 4</entry></row><row><entry>hSIA103</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>1.8</entry><entry>Group 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0599" num="0589">All antibodies tested demonstrated binding to cell- and BSM-associated STn.

Parental cells were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, lx Pen/Strep and 45 &#x3bc;g/mL gentamycin. STn positive cells were grown in the same media except with the addition of 1 mg/mL G418 for antibiotic selection. Cells were seeded separately (4,000 cells/well for parental cells or 2,000/well for STn positive cells) in 96-well plates using proper media described above. Cells were grown overnight. After 16-20 hours, cells were treated with varying concentrations of test antibodies in triplicate (50 nM to 0.012 nM) for 72 hours. Then, cells were analyzed using an ADC CELLTITER-GLO&#xae; luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.) to determine the amount of ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells. The assay uses a single reagent that is added directly to the cultured cells in serum-supplemented medium. The reagent lyses the cells and generates a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. Luminescent signals were analyzed and used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for each antibody used based on the concentration required to kill STn positive cells at half-maximal levels (see Table 9).</p><p id="p-0601" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 9</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>IC<sub>50 </sub>values for humanized ADC antibodies</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>IC<sub>50 </sub></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Humanized Antibody</entry><entry>(nM)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>hSIA103</entry><entry>1.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>hSIA102</entry><entry>2.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>hSIA101</entry><entry>5.2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0602" num="0591">All antibodies tested demonstrated IC<sub>50 </sub>values in the single nanomolar range indicating a strong capability for each to kill STn expressing cells.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0592">Similar studies were carried out using OVCAR3 cells in culture.

STn Assays</heading><p id="p-0604" num="0593">ELISA assays are developed to identify and quantitate STn levels in subject samples. Bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), which is heavily sialylated, is used to generate standard curves and to aid in assay optimization. In initial assays, commercially available mouse anti-STn antibodies [e.g., antibody 3F1 (SBH Sciences, Natick, Mass.), antibody B72.3 (see Colcher, D. et al., 1981. PNAS. 78(5): 3199-203), and antibody CC49 (see Muraro, R. et al., 1988. Cancer Res. 48: 4588-96)] are used to coat assay plates and capture BSM in samples (buffered solutions or serum samples with added BSM) being tested. Humanized anti-STn antibodies (e.g., hSIA101, hSIA102, and hSIA103) are used to detect captured BSM. Antibodies used for capture and detection are tested by two methods. One is by testing for pair matching in sandwich ELISA assays. The second is by flow cytometry for competitive binding by using fluorescent antibody labels and alternating the order of exposure to STn-expressing cells. Antibody pairs that do not bind competitively are used for further assay development.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0594">Further assays utilize anti-STn antibodies as capture antibodies, bound to assay plates, and species-specific detection antibodies to detect bound proteins. For example, human anti-STn mAb can be utilized as both the coating and detection mAb if the detection mAb is directly labeled (e.g. Alexa-488, HRP etc.) For example, murine anti-STn mAb can be utilized as both the coating and detection mAb if the detection mAb is directly labeled (e.g Alexa-488, HRP etc.) Detection of STn in mouse samples (e.g., collected from xenograft model studies described herein) and in human samples (e.g., serum samples obtained as described herein) are assessed with both murine and human detection antibodies.</p><heading id="h-0095" level="1">Example 8.

Five micrograms per milliliter (&#x3bc;g/ml) solutions of capture antibody were used to coat the surface of an ELISA assay plate overnight. Plates were washed and blocked before being treated with a dilution series of bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) ranging from 0 nM to 6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>nM. BSM bound to the assay surface was detected using 3 &#x3bc;g/ml detection antibody.

Animals were treated with humanized anti-STn ADCs (1 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg), an isotype ADC (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg), Paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) or vehicle alone. ADCs were administrated intravenously once per week for four weeks. Paclitaxel was administrated intraperitoneally once per week for three weeks. Tumor volume and body weight were measured on the days indicated in Table 12. The humanized ADCs significantly reduced tumor volumes compared to vehicle and isotype ADC control (see Table 12), while had little effects on gross body weight. This data suggests that the anti-STn ADCs are not toxic in vivo and are effective in reducing serous ovarian xenograft volumes. At the end of the study, tumor tissues were collected and analyzed using immunohistochemistry for expression of STn. Tumors tissues from mice treated with anti-STn ADCs showed reduced STn expression in comparison to other treatments.</p><p id="p-0617" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table

STn Expression in Patient CRC Samples</heading><p id="p-0618" num="0604">Primary patient CRC samples were probed by flow cytometry with hSIA101 and two commercial antibodies B72.3 and CC49. All 10 samples tested were STn positive. The results are presented in Table 13. In the table, % STn is expressed as % of viable CD45&#x2212;/CD34&#x2212; population. STn expression was often more robustly identified with hSIA101 than the commercial antibodies. Expression ranged from 3-47% positive, with a metastatic sample demonstrating the highest percent positive cells.

Given preliminary results with mouse and humanized anti-STn MMAE ADCs, experiments are carried out to identify optimal toxin/linkers for an anti-STn ADC for colorectal cancer. The resistance of 8 CRC lines (COL0205, LS174T, RKO, HT-29, LS180, and SW403) as well as STn expression-modified cell lines [COL0205 STn knockdown, LS174T STn knockdown, RKO STn+(over expressing ST6GalNAc I), and HT-29 STn+(over expressing ST6GalNAc I)] with various levels of STn expression is examined with a panel of 10 common ADC toxins including auristatins (MMAE and MMAF), Maytansines (DM4 and DM1), pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers (Talirine and Tesirine) and topoisomerase inhibitors (SN-38 and DXd) and other natural agents (Duocarmycin and Amanitin). Sensitivity of the CRCs is compared to standard of care (irinotecan, also known as CPT-11) and vehicle alone to obtain half maximal inhibitory (cytotoxic) concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>). To accomplish this, unconjugated toxins are tested in CRC cell lines with varying levels of endogenous STn expression as well as derivatives of those cells lines in which STn levels are either increased or depleted.</p><p id="p-0621" num="0606">Knockdown of STn expression in COL0205 and LS174T cells is performed with ST6GalNAc I-directed Silencer siRNA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) using methods described in the literature (e.g., Gao et al., Nat Med. 2015 November; 21(11):1318-25). In contrast, RKO and HT-29 cells (expressing little to no detectable levels of STn) are transduced with lentiviral vectors delivering ST6GalNAc I expression constructs, to obtain clonal populations expressing elevated levels of STn. The engineered cells are monitored for STn expression on cell surfaces by flow cytometric and Western blot analyses and ST6GalNac I mRNA levels are monitored utilizing qRT-PCR.

The gross findings observed were considered incidental, of the nature commonly observed in this strain and age of Cynomolgus monkeys, and/or were of similar incidence in control and treated animals and, therefore, were considered unrelated to antibody administration. No body weight loss or deaths occurred among study animals and no gross pathologic changes were observed across all organs assessed. Histopathological changes were limited to the bone marrow, which is an effect associated with MMAE. Minimal to mild decreased cellularity and mild decrease in myeloid to erythroid ratio were observed. Changes in hematology parameters (i.e., modest neutropenia) were consistent with other MMAE antibody drug conjugates and not considered target related. Finally, all clinical chemistry results remained normal throughout the study.</p><heading id="h-0108" level="1">Example 21.

Tissue Cross-Reactivity Studies</heading><p id="p-0645" num="0627">Tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted to assess the binding profile (both on- and potential off-target binding) to human and relevant species used in nonclinical safety testing. Humanized anti-STn antibodies were examined for binding to a panel of normal human, rat, mouse, and cynomolgus monkey tissues. The study was conducted on 10 normal frozen tissue sections at 1-3 &#x3bc;g/ml: heart, brain, kidney, stomach, lung, small intestines, colon, liver, pancreas, spleen and bone marrow. The positive control was a human pancreatic neoplasm that contained STn positive cancer cells and the negative control was normal stromal cells contained within the same specimen. Staining across all normal tissues was restricted to the cytoplasm. Additional analyses were conducted without primary antibody or using isotype control IgG as negative controls.</p><p id="p-0646" num="0628">Among the three tested antibodies, hSIA101 has the lowest cross-reactivity with normal human tissues. Moderate binding activity was seen with tissues of heart vessels, stomach epithelial cells, small intestine epithelial cells and spleen vessels.

Comparison Between Anti-STn Antibody Treatment and Cisplatin Treatment in an Ovarian PDX Tumor Model</heading><p id="p-0649" num="0630">Anti-STn ADC candidates were compared with standard of care (SOC) therapies in a xenograft tumor model using human patient-derived ovarian cancer tumors from two different patients. Patient samples were previously confirmed to express STn by immunohistochemical staining and tumors from one of the patients not previously treated with chemotherapy (chemo-na&#xef;ve) and those from a patient previously treated with chemotherapy were implanted in athymic nude immune-deficient mice. Mice with successful tumor growth were selected and administered antibodies (5 mg/kg dose) by weekly IV injection; cisplatin (3 mg/kg dose) by weekly intraperitoneal injection (limited to 3 doses); or vehicle control. Antibodies administered included hSIA101, hSIA101-ADC (conjugated with MMAE), or IgG isotype control conjugated with MMAE (isotype-ADC). Mice with chemo-na&#xef;ve tumors received antibody treatments for 4 weeks, while mice with chemo-resistant tumors received antibody treatments for 6 weeks. Tumor volumes in mice treated with hSIA101-ADC or isotype-ADC were monitored for 4-5 weeks after the end of treatment to assess tumor regression.</p><p id="p-0650" num="0631">Cisplatin-sensitive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, top panel) and cisplatin-resistant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, bottom panel) tumor volumes were measured over time. hSIA101-ADC treatment yielded the most effective reduction in tumor volume in comparison to other treatments. Tumors generated with cisplatin-resistant cells were significantly reduced by treatment with hSIA101-ADC treatment in comparison to cisplatin treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, bottom panel). Accordingly, hSIA101-ADC treatment may be used to effectively treat cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant tumors. Interestingly, 75% of chemo-na&#xef;ve mice treated with hSIA101-ADC were completely tumor free four weeks after the end of treatment, while greater than 50% tumor regression was observed in 75% of mice with chemo-resistant tumors 5 weeks after the end of hSIA101-ADC treatment.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230001007A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
