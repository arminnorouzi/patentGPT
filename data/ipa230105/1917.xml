The embodiment of the disclosure is not limited to the numbers, shapes, size ratios, and positional relationships of the constituent elements in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">First, the overall configuration of a vehicle control system according to the embodiment of the disclosure is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A vehicle control system <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is mounted on a target vehicle M (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The vehicle control system <b>1</b> includes a locator unit <b>11</b> that detects the position of the target vehicle M (target vehicle position), a camera unit <b>21</b> that acquires forward traveling environment information, and a vehicle control unit <b>22</b> that controls the vehicle. Throughout the present specification and the drawings, elements having substantially the same function and configuration are denoted with the same numerals to avoid any redundant description.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The locator unit <b>11</b> estimates a target vehicle position on a road map, and acquires road map data around the target vehicle position. The camera unit <b>21</b> acquires traveling environment information ahead of the target vehicle M, and recognizes, for example, right and left lane lines of a traveling lane, a road shape, the presence or absence of a preceding vehicle, and a traffic light. For example, the camera unit <b>21</b> obtains a road curvature at the center between the lane lines, a distance from the preceding vehicle, and a relative speed to the preceding vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The locator unit <b>11</b> includes a map locator calculator <b>12</b> and a high-accuracy road map database (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, abbreviated as &#x201c;road map DB&#x201d;) <b>16</b> serving as a storage. The map locator calculator <b>12</b>, a forward traveling environment recognizer <b>21</b><i>d </i>described later, and the vehicle control unit <b>22</b> are each implemented by a known microcomputer including a CPU, a RAM, and a ROM and peripheral devices around the microcomputer. The ROM prestores programs to be executed by the CPU and fixed data such as base maps.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver <b>13</b>, an autonomous traveling sensor <b>14</b>, and a destination information input device <b>15</b> are coupled to an input side of the map locator calculator <b>12</b>. The GNSS receiver <b>13</b> receives positioning signals from a plurality of positioning satellites. The autonomous traveling sensor <b>14</b> enables autonomous traveling in an environment in which positioning signals cannot effectively be received due to low reception sensibility from GNSS satellites as in a case where the vehicle is traveling in a tunnel. The autonomous traveling sensor <b>14</b> includes a vehicle speed sensor, a gyro sensor, and a longitudinal acceleration sensor. The map locator calculator <b>12</b> obtains a moving distance and an azimuth based on, for example, a speed of the target vehicle M (target vehicle speed) detected by the vehicle speed sensor, an angular velocity detected by the gyro sensor, and a longitudinal acceleration detected by the longitudinal acceleration sensor, and performs localization based on the obtained moving distance and the obtained azimuth.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the destination information input device <b>15</b> is a terminal device to be operated by a person in the vehicle, such as a driver or any other occupant.
