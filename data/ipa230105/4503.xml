For instance, the signal redriver may be applied in a peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) bus. However, the signal redriver currently applied in the PCIe bus does not have a SLEEP mode with extremely low power consumption. In order to save power, the entire signal redriver may be turned off according to the related art. If the signal redriver is turned off directly, a terminal resistor of the signal redriver may not comply with a PCIe specification. Besides, after the entire signal redriver is turned off, a start-up time required for turning on the signal redriver may be overly long. The overly long start-up time may lead to connection failure of a PCIe device or PCIe disconnection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the related art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

The signal redriver <b>130</b> is coupled between the transmitting device <b>110</b> and the receiving device <b>120</b>. For example, a high-speed receiving end R<b>1</b> of the signal redriver <b>130</b> is coupled to the high-speed transmitting end S<b>1</b> of the transmitting device <b>110</b>, and a high-speed transmitting end S<b>2</b> of the signal redriver <b>130</b> is coupled to the high-speed receiving end R<b>2</b> of the receiving device <b>120</b>. According to a design requirement, the signal redriver <b>130</b> may be provided in the form of a circuit board or a cable, which is not limited in the embodiment. For example, in some embodiments, the high-speed receiving end R<b>2</b> of the receiving device <b>120</b> may be coupled to the high-speed transmitting end S<b>1</b> of the transmitting device <b>110</b> through a cable, and the signal redriver <b>130</b> may be configured in this cable.
