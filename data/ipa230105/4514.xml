A BMS is, in general, a system of devices configured to control, monitor, and manage equipment in or around a building or building area. A BMS can include, for example, a HVAC system, a security system, a lighting system, a fire alerting system, any other system that is capable of managing building functions or devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In brief overview, the BMS described herein provides a system architecture that facilitates automatic equipment discovery and equipment model distribution. Equipment discovery can occur on multiple levels of the BMS across multiple different communications busses (e.g., a system bus, zone buses, a sensor/actuator bus, etc.) and across multiple different communications protocols. In some embodiments, equipment discovery is accomplished using active node tables, which provide status information for devices connected to each communications bus. For example, each communications bus can be monitored for new devices by monitoring the corresponding active node table for new nodes. When a new device is detected, the BMS can begin interacting with the new device (e.g., sending control signals, using data from the device) without user interaction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some devices in the BMS present themselves to the network using equipment models. An equipment model defines equipment object attributes, view definitions, schedules, trends, and the associated BACnet value objects (e.g., analog value, binary value, multistate value, etc.) that are used for integration with other systems. Some devices in the BMS store their own equipment models. Other devices in the BMS have equipment models stored externally (e.g., within other devices). For example, a zone coordinator can store the equipment model for a bypass damper. In some embodiments, the zone coordinator automatically creates the equipment model for the bypass damper and/or other devices on the zone bus. Other zone coordinators can also create equipment models for devices connected to their zone busses. The equipment model for a device can be created automatically based on the types of data points exposed by the device on the zone bus, device type, and/or other device attributes. Several examples of automatic equipment discovery and equipment model distribution are discussed in greater detail below.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Building and HVAC System</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary building and HVAC system in which the systems and methods of the present invention can be implemented are shown, according to an exemplary embodiment.

A BMS is, in general, a system of devices configured to control, monitor, and manage equipment in or around a building or building area. A BMS can include, for example, a HVAC system, a security system, a lighting system, a fire alerting system, any other system that is capable of managing building functions or devices, or any combination thereof. BMS <b>300</b> can be used to monitor and control the devices of HVAC system <b>100</b> and/or airside system <b>200</b> (e.g., HVAC equipment) as well as other types of BMS devices (e.g., lighting equipment, security equipment, etc.).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In brief overview, BMS <b>300</b> provides a system architecture that facilitates automatic equipment discovery and equipment model distribution. Equipment discovery can occur on multiple levels of BMS <b>300</b> across multiple different communications busses (e.g., a system bus <b>354</b>, zone buses <b>356</b>-<b>360</b> and <b>364</b>, sensor/actuator bus <b>366</b>, etc.) and across multiple different communications protocols. In some embodiments, equipment discovery is accomplished using active node tables, which provide status information for devices connected to each communications bus. For example, each communications bus can be monitored for new devices by monitoring the corresponding active node table for new nodes. When a new device is detected, BMS <b>300</b> can begin interacting with the new device (e.g., sending control signals, using data from the device) without user interaction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some devices in BMS <b>300</b> present themselves to the network using equipment models. An equipment model defines equipment object attributes, view definitions, schedules, trends, and the associated BACnet value objects (e.g., analog value, binary value, multistate value, etc.) that are used for integration with other systems. An equipment model for a device can include a collection of point objects that provide information about the device (e.g., device name, network address, model number, device type, etc.) and store present values of variables or parameters used by the device. For example, the equipment model can include point objects (e.g., standard BACnet point objects) that store the values of input variables accepted by the device (e.g., setpoint, control parameters, etc.), output variables provided by the device (e.g., temperature measurement, feedback signal, etc.), configuration parameters used by the device (e.g., operating mode, actuator stroke length, damper position, tuning parameters, etc.). The point objects in the equipment model can be mapped to variables or parameters stored within the device to expose those variables or parameters to external systems or devices.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some devices in BMS <b>300</b> store their own equipment models.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, zone coordinator <b>402</b> is shown as a Verasys COBP engine (VCE) connected with a COBP zoning system via a zone bus <b>430</b>. The COBP zoning system is shown to include a COBP RTU <b>502</b>, a bypass damper <b>504</b>, and a zone controller <b>506</b>. However, zone coordinator <b>402</b> can also function as a Verasys VAV engine (VVE) if connected with a VVE zoning system via zone bus <b>430</b>. For example, COBP RTU <b>502</b> can be replaced with a VAV RTU and bypass damper <b>504</b> can be removed to allow zone coordinator <b>402</b> to function as a VVE. A single model of zone coordinator <b>402</b> can be configured to handle multiple different types of zoning systems (e.g., a VAV zoning system, a COBP zoning system, etc.).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Zone coordinator <b>402</b> is shown to include a system bus datalink <b>514</b>, a zone bus datalink <b>510</b>, and a processing circuit <b>518</b>.

System bus datalink <b>514</b> is shown to include an active node table <b>516</b>. Active node table <b>516</b> provides status information for the devices connected to system bus <b>354</b>. For example, active node table <b>516</b> can indicate which MSTP devices are participating in the token ring used to exchange information via system bus <b>354</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Similarly, zone bus datalink <b>510</b> can be used to communicate with COBP RTU <b>502</b>, bypass damper <b>504</b>, zone controller <b>506</b>, and/or any other devices connected to zone bus <b>430</b>. Zone bus datalink <b>510</b> is shown to include an active node table <b>512</b>. Active node table <b>512</b> provides status information for the devices connected to zone bus <b>430</b>. For example, active node table <b>512</b> can indicate which MSTP devices are participating in the token ring used to exchange information via zone bus <b>430</b>. In some embodiments, active node table <b>512</b> is a table in the form of an array of bytes. The location of each byte in active node table <b>512</b> may represent the token ring participation status of a particular node or device connected to zone bus <b>430</b>. Devices connected to zone bus <b>430</b> can be identified by MAC address (or any other device identifier) in active node table <b>512</b>. Advantageously, active node table <b>512</b> can list the MAC addresses of the devices connected to zone bus <b>430</b> without requiring the devices to be placed in discovery mode.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, active node table <b>512</b> includes a change counter attribute.

Other objects or devices interested in the status of active node table <b>512</b> can subscribe to a change of value (COV) of the change counter attribute. When the change counter attribute is incremented, zone bus datalink <b>510</b> can report the COV to any object or device that has subscribed to the COV. For example, detector object <b>522</b> can subscribe to the COV of the change counter attribute and can be automatically notified of the COV when a change to active node table <b>512</b> occurs. In response to receiving the COV notification, detector object <b>522</b> can read active node table <b>512</b>.

In some embodiments, detector object <b>522</b> maintains a device list <b>524</b> that system manager <b>302</b> uses to construct a device tree. Detector object <b>522</b> can generate the device list using information from active node table <b>512</b>.

In some embodiments, zone bus device list <b>524</b> specifies whether system manager <b>302</b> should talk directly to each connected zone bus device, or whether system manager <b>302</b> should communicate with zone coordinator <b>402</b> to interact with the zone bus device. In some embodiments, zone bus device list <b>524</b> specifies that system manager <b>302</b> should communicate directly with devices that store their own equipment model, but should communicate with zone coordinator <b>402</b> to interact with devices having equipment models stored within zone coordinator <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, zone bus device list <b>524</b> stores detailed information for devices that have equipment models stored within zone coordinator <b>402</b>. For example, zone bus device list <b>524</b> can store a user name, description, MAC address, online/offline status, number of active critical alarms, an equipment view version, a top level equipment model, a view definition, and/or model attributes for one or more connected zone bus devices.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Zone bus device list <b>524</b> can specify the network address of each connected zone bus device. In some embodiments, the zone bus device list stores a null network address (e.g., network address=0) for a connected zone bus device if the equipment model for the zone bus device is stored within zone coordinator <b>402</b>. However, if the zone bus device stores its own equipment model, the actual network address of the zone bus device can be provided in zone bus device list <b>524</b>. System manager <b>302</b> can read zone bus device list <b>524</b> and use the network address obtained from zone bus device list <b>524</b> to communicate directly with connected zone bus devices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Detector object <b>522</b> can communicate with connected zoning system devices in response to a determination that a change to active node table <b>512</b> has occurred (e.g., a COV notification from zone bus datalink <b>510</b>).

Detector object <b>522</b> can also read model attributes from other zoning system devices, which can be connected to zone coordinator <b>402</b> via a wired or wireless communications link. For example, detector object <b>522</b> can read model attributes from a Zigbee coordinator device, a wireless zone controller, or any other zoning system device.

For example, when zone coordinator <b>402</b> receives an update to a time zone parameter or unit set parameter, zone coordinator equipment object <b>552</b> can pass the updated values to each of the zone bus devices. In some embodiments, zone coordinator equipment object <b>552</b> receives an updated value for the RTU type attribute of COBP RTU <b>502</b>. The updated value can be received from a user or read from the model attributes of COBP RTU <b>502</b>.

For example, group object <b>540</b> can receive an occupancy command or occupancy data (e.g., from logic objects <b>538</b>) and can distribute the occupancy command or occupancy data to the various zone controllers connected to zone bus <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Logic objects <b>538</b> can interact with the collection of zones and the zoning system. Logic objects <b>538</b> can retrieve the zone list from group object <b>540</b> and perform logic on the collection. Each logic object <b>538</b> can have different functionality. For example, logic objects <b>538</b> can be configured to perform zone control (e.g. zoning system balancing, mode selection, shutdown determination, system mode determination, etc.), reset control (e.g., discharge air temperature setpoint reset, duct pressure setpoint reset, etc.), occupancy determination, data processing (e.g., data tagging, outlier detection, etc.), fault detection, or other logic-based functions.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, logic objects <b>538</b> are configured to perform weighted voting for the zones listed by group object <b>540</b>. Different building zones can have different conditions (e.g., different air temperatures, different setpoints, etc.) and therefore may require different control actions to be performed. For example, one building zone may require heating, whereas another building zone may require cooling. If multiple building zones are served by a single RTU, zone coordinator <b>402</b> can determine whether the RTU should operate in a heating mode (e.g., providing warm air) or a cooling mode (e.g., providing chilled air) to serve the connected building zones. Zone coordinator <b>402</b> can determine which control action to provide based on votes provided by each zone controller.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Each zone's vote can have an associated weight (e.g., from zero to three) that reflects the zone's importance. For example if a zone has a weight of three, it can vote three times, whereas a zone with a weight of one can only vote one time. A weight of zero may indicate that the zone does not vote. Zone controller equipment model <b>580</b> can include the weight associated with the zone controlled by zone controller <b>506</b>. Other zone controller equipment models stored within zone coordinator <b>402</b> can include weights for other zones managed by zone coordinator <b>402</b> (e.g., if multiple zone controllers are connected to zone bus <b>430</b>). A user can modify the zone weights through system manager <b>302</b>. Zone coordinator <b>402</b> can use the weights and the votes provided by each zone controller to determine how to best operate the RTU that serves the building zones.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Automatic Equipment Discovery and Equipment Model Distribution</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a flowchart of a process <b>600</b> for automatically discovering and interacting with equipment in a building management system is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment.
