Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a &#x201c;processing system&#x201d; that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, in one or more example aspects, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">While aspects and implementations are described in this application by illustration to some examples, those skilled in the art will understand that additional implementations and use cases may come about in many different arrangements and scenarios. Innovations described herein may be implemented across many differing platform types, devices, systems, shapes, sizes, and packaging arrangements. For example, implementations and/or uses may come about via integrated chip implementations and other non-module-component based devices (e.g., end-user devices, vehicles, communication devices, computing devices, industrial equipment, retail/purchasing devices, medical devices, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled devices, etc.). While some examples may or may not be specifically directed to use cases or applications, a wide assortment of applicability of described innovations may occur. Implementations may range a spectrum from chip-level or modular components to non-modular, non-chip-level implementations and further to aggregate, distributed, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) devices or systems incorporating one or more aspects of the described innovations. In some practical settings, devices incorporating described aspects and features may also include additional components and features for implementation and practice of claimed and described aspect. For example, transmission and reception of wireless signals necessarily includes a number of components for analog and digital purposes (e.g., hardware components including antenna, RF-chains, power amplifiers, modulators, buffer, processor(s), interleaver, adders/summers, etc.). It is intended that innovations described herein may be practiced in a wide variety of devices, chip-level components, systems, distributed arrangements, aggregated or disaggregated components, end-user devices, etc. of varying sizes, shapes, and constitution.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In wireless communications, a waveform may refer to the signal that is mixed with information before being radiated across an air-interface. In some examples, the waveform may include a multiple carrier waveform. Multiple carrier waveforms may be implemented via orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another example of a waveform that may be applied to a transmission is a single carrier (SC) waveform. Single carrier waveforms may be used for downlink transmissions and/or uplink transmissions. Compared to multiple carrier waveforms (e.g., OFDM waveforms), SC waveforms may be associated with a relatively lower Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). A lower PAPR associated with a transmission may provide better power efficiency, which may improve link budget and provide better coverage. Additionally, SC waveforms may provide increased flexibility in implementation compared to multiple carrier waveforms. When operating in higher frequency bands with wide channel bandwidth, the performing of the FFT operations may not be resource friendly.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a wireless communication environment, a set of resources may be allocated for UL transmissions and/or DL transmissions between a UE and a base station. For some deployment environments of the UE, the allocated resources may result in interference at the UE. The UE may use demodulation reference signals (DMRSs) to measure channel conditions and to help demodulate the channel. For example, the UE may use DMRS for a DL control channel to estimate the propagation channel experienced by the DL control channel. The UE may use the resultant information to help demodulate the DL control channel (e.g., use the measured channel conditions to perform equalization on the DL control channel) and to subsequently decode downlink control information. The configuration (or placement) of the DMRS may be semi-static (e.g., based on RRC signaling) and enable the UE to perform channel estimations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, intra-symbol multiplexing of reference signals and a channel may be performed when using SC waveforms. For example, DMRS may be multiplexed with a channel in the time-domain of an SC waveform. Intra-symbol multiplexing may be useful, for example, when a data transmission has a limited number of symbols (e.g., PBCH), or when a control channel or a data channel spans a small number of symbols (e.g., with a small number of payloads). In addition, intra-band multiplexing using reference signals may be useful to provide multiple opportunities to receive the reference signal to determine the effects of time-varying channels (e.g., channels for which conditions may change over time), to improve frequency tracking loops (FTL), to improve phase noise compensation, etc. However, using symbol-level multiplexing may result in non-trivial overhead, for example, between a transmitting device and a receiving device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, DMRS may be front-loaded within a slot. For example, in a slot that includes 14 symbols, the second symbol or the third symbol may be allocated to DMRS. However, in such examples, the DMRS may be allocated to one symbol, which limits tracking time-varying characteristics on the channel.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Aspects disclosed herein provide techniques for facilitating intra-symbol multiplexing between DMRS and other signals of an SC waveform. For example, disclosed technique utilizes a time-domain DMRS pattern that indicates a starting location and a duration of the DMRS of a symbol. The time-domain DMRS pattern may enable a network to control overhead, for example, with respect to the DMRS. The time-domain DMRS pattern may additionally or alternatively enable the network to apply an applicable configuration based on a target use case. For example, if channel conditions are good, then the network may utilize a time-domain DMRS pattern in which resources allocated to DMRS are reduced compared to scenarios in which channel conditions are poor or less than good. In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate allocating less than all of the resources of a symbol to DMRS (e.g., the DMRS may be allocated to a portion of the resources of the symbol). In some examples, based on the time-domain DMRS pattern, the DMRS may be repeated across symbols.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate time-varying DMRS locations. For example, different symbols may include different starting points for the respective DMRS. In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate time-varying DMRS densities. For example, different symbols may include DMRS portions that start at the same location, but are associated with different durations. In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate multiplexing DMRS and another reference signal in a same symbol. In some examples, it may be beneficial to multiplex the DMRS with another reference signal. For example, the DMRS may be multiplexed with PTRS to improve phase noise compensation (e.g., to reduce the impact of phase noise).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b> including base stations <b>102</b> and <b>180</b> and UEs <b>104</b>.

Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz).

The physical broadcast channel (PBCH), which carries a master information block (MIB), may be logically grouped with the PSS and SSS to form a synchronization signal (SS)/PBCH block (also referred to as SS block (SSB)). The MIB provides a number of RBs in the system bandwidth and a system frame number (SFN). The physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) carries user data, broadcast system information not transmitted through the PBCH such as system information blocks (SIBs), and paging messages.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, some of the REs carry DM-RS (indicated as R for one particular configuration, but other DM-RS configurations are possible) for channel estimation at the base station.

The PUSCH DM-RS may be transmitted in the first one or two symbols of the PUSCH. The PUCCH DM-RS may be transmitted in different configurations depending on whether short or long PUCCHs are transmitted and depending on the particular PUCCH format used.

The coded and modulated symbols may then be split into parallel streams. Each stream may then be mapped to an OFDM subcarrier, multiplexed with a reference signal (e.g., pilot) in the time and/or frequency domain, and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams.

In some examples, the waveform may include a multiple carrier waveform. Multiple carrier waveforms may be implemented via orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Examples of multiple carrier waveforms include cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM (CP-OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM). Applying CP-OFDM may be beneficial for high throughput scenarios, while applying DFT-s-OFDM may be beneficial for power limited scenarios or when limited to a single stream transmission. That is, CP-OFDM may provide improved throughputs and capacity, while DFT-s-OFDM may provide improved coverage.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">OFDM can facilitate transferring large numbers of modulation symbols simultaneously by multiplexing large numbers of subcarriers. These subcarriers may be tightly packed to achieve high spectrum efficiency. Each subcarrier may accommodate one modulation symbol within the duration of one time-domain OFDM symbol. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation may be used to generate the time-domain OFDM symbol from a combination of the modulated subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Another example of a waveform that may be applied to a transmission is a single carrier (SC) waveform. SC waveforms include DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, for which a pulse-shaping filter is set to zero to shape the transmission, and QAM waveforms. QAM waveforms may be implemented via a pulse-shaping filter at a transmitting device and the pulse-shaping filter may be implemented in the time-domain.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Single carrier waveforms may be used for downlink transmissions and/or uplink transmissions. Compared to multiple carrier waveforms (e.g., OFDM waveforms), SC waveforms may be associated with a relatively lower Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). A lower PAPR associated with a transmission may provide better power efficiency, which may improve link budget and provide better coverage. Additionally, SC waveforms may provide increased flexibility in implementation compared to multiple carrier waveforms. For example, with SC waveforms, transmission and reception may be performed via an FFT operation. When operating in higher frequency bands with wide channel bandwidth, the performing of the FFT operations may not be resource friendly. For example, as the bandwidth increases, the quantity of FFT operations also increases, which may result in increased resource utilization (e.g., processing power), for example, at the receiving device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In a wireless communication environment, a set of resources may be allocated for UL transmissions and/or DL transmissions between a UE and a base station. For some deployment environments of the UE, the allocated resources may result in interference at the UE. The UE may use demodulation reference signals (DMRSs) to measure channel conditions and to help demodulate the channel. For example, the UE may use DMRS for a DL control channel to estimate the propagation channel experienced by the DL control channel. The UE may use the resultant information to help demodulate the DL control channel (e.g., use the measured channel conditions to perform equalization on the DL control channel) and to subsequently decode downlink control information. The configuration (or placement) of the DMRS may be semi-static (e.g., based on RRC signaling) and enable the UE to perform channel estimations.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">In some examples, intra-symbol multiplexing of reference signals and a channel may be performed when using SC waveforms. For example, DMRS may be multiplexed with a channel in the time-domain of an SC waveform. In such examples, time-division multiplexing may be performed so that the DMRS and the channel are included in a same symbol of the SC waveform. Examples of the channel include a traffic channel, a control channel (e.g., PDCCH or PUCCH), or a data channel (e.g., PDSCH or PUSCH).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">Intra-symbol multiplexing may be useful, for example, when a data transmission has a limited number of symbols (e.g., PBCH), or when a control channel or a data channel spans a small number of symbols (e.g., with a small number of payloads). In addition, intra-band multiplexing using reference signals may be useful to provide multiple opportunities to receive the reference signal to determine the effects of time-varying channels (e.g., channels for which conditions may change over time), to improve frequency tracking loops (FTL), to improve phase noise compensation, etc. However, using symbol-level multiplexing may result in non-trivial overhead, for example, between a transmitting device and a receiving device.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In some examples, DMRS may be front-loaded within a slot. For example, in a slot that includes 14 symbols, the second symbol or the third symbol may be allocated to DMRS. However, in such examples, the DMRS may be allocated to one symbol, which limits tracking time-varying characteristics on the channel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Aspects disclosed herein provide techniques for facilitating intra-symbol multiplexing between DMRS and other signals of an SC waveform. For example, disclosed technique utilizes a time-domain DMRS pattern that indicates a starting location and a duration of the DMRS of a symbol. The time-domain DMRS pattern may enable a network to control overhead, for example, with respect to the DMRS. The time-domain DMRS pattern may additionally or alternatively enable the network to apply an applicable configuration based on a target use case. For example, if channel conditions are good, then the network may utilize a time-domain DMRS pattern in which resources allocated to DMRS are reduced compared to scenarios in which channel conditions are poor or less than good. In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate allocating less than all of the resources of a symbol to DMRS (e.g., the DMRS may be allocated to a portion of the resources of the symbol). In some examples, based on the time-domain DMRS pattern, the DMRS may be repeated across symbols.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate time-varying DMRS locations. For example, different symbols may include different starting points for the respective DMRS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of intra-symbol multiplexing of DMRS and data utilizing time-varying DMRS locations.

Using a same DMRS starting location and different densities may enable better overhead control for the DMRS compared to the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref>.

For example, the duration associated with the first symbol DMRS portion <b>506</b> (e.g., the second duration <b>522</b>) may be longer than the duration associated with the second symbol DMRS portion <b>514</b> (e.g., the fifth duration <b>532</b>).

Thus, in some examples, channel condition estimates using the second symbol DMRS portion <b>514</b> may be not be as robust as the channel conditions estimates using the first symbol DMRS portion <b>506</b>. However, the example techniques of utilizing time-varying DMRS densities, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, may provide improved overhead control for DMRS. Additionally, the receiving device may still use the second symbol DMRS portion <b>514</b> to improve the channel conditions estimated using the samples of the first symbol DMRS portion <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">In some examples, the transmitting device may determine whether to use time-varying DMRS locations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref>, or to use time-varying DMRS densities, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, based on the channel conditions. For example, when channel conditions are poor, the transmitting device may determine to use repetitions of the DMRS. In some such examples, the transmitting device may determine to use time-varying DMRS locations as the repetition and the different starting locations may increase the likelihood of the receiving device receiving the DMRS and may improve the channel conditions estimations performed by the receiving device.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">In examples in which the channel conditions are good, the transmitting device may determine to reduce resources allocated to DMRS. In some such examples, the transmitting device may determine to use time-varying DMRS densities as the reduced resources allocated to DMRS in subsequent symbols allows for the transmitting device to allocate more resources of a symbol to other signals, such as data or control information, thereby improving throughput, capacity, and/or spectral efficiency.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C, and <b>5</b></figref>, intra-symbol multiplexing may be used to include DMRS and data within a same symbol of a single carrier waveform. That is, the DMRS may not span the full duration of the symbol. In some examples, it may be beneficial to multiplex the DMRS with another reference signal. For example, the DMRS may be multiplexed with PTRS to improve phase noise compensation (e.g., to reduce the impact of phase noise).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">A wireless channel may introduce frequency impairments, such as a Doppler shift. However, an additional source of frequency impairment may be introduced, for example, due to components at the transmitting device and/or the receiving device. For example, an oscillator may introduce phase noise at the transmitting device and/or the receiving device. Phase noise may introduce common phase error or other phase noise errors into a transmitted signal (e.g., by a transmitting device), which degrades demodulation performance (e.g., at a receiving device). A PTRS may enable a receiving device to track phase noise. Additionally, PTRS may be useful when operating at higher frequencies (e.g., FR2, FR4, etc.) as the oscillators become a bottle neck for performance based on the phase noise that the oscillator introduces. The PTRS may use used to track phase noise and to suppress such phase noise, especially at higher frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">PTRS may be inserted into a symbol (e.g., an OFDM symbol) in the form of one or more groups of PTRS resources. A group of PTRS resources (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;chunk&#x201d; or a &#x201c;burst&#x201d;) may refer to a quantity of samples that are inserted into a PTRS-containing symbol. Similar to the DMRS, the PTRS resources may be derived from a sequence, such as a Zadoff-Chu sequence, a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) sequence, an m-sequence, etc. A group of PTRS resources may include a particular quantity of samples (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;chunk size&#x201d; or a &#x201c;burst size&#x201d;), such as two samples or four samples. Additionally, a PTRS-containing symbol may support a particular quantity of groups of PTRS resources (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;number of chunks per symbol&#x201d; or a &#x201c;number of bursts per symbol&#x201d;), such as two groups of PTRS resources, four groups of PTRS resources, or eight groups of PTRS resources.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example <b>600</b> of intra-symbol multiplexing of DMRS and PTRS for a single carrier waveform, as presented herein.

For example, the transmitting device may identify and configure a time-domain DMRS pattern for a receiving device. The transmitting device may also identify and configure a PTRS pattern for the receiving device. When transmitting a single carrier waveform to the receiving device, the transmitting device may identify a potential collision between the DMRS and the PTRS based on the time-domain DMRS pattern and the PTRS pattern. Additionally, the receiving device may identify a potential collision between DMRS and PTRS based on the configured time-domain DMRS pattern and the configured PTRS pattern. Additionally, or alternatively, in some examples, when the receiving device receives a single-carrier waveform including an intra-symbol multiplexing between DMRS and PTRS, one or more DMRS resources may overlap with one or more PTRS resources, for example, due to the delay-spread of the channel.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">In some examples in which the PTRS collides with (or may potentially collide with) DMRS, the DMRS may puncture the PTRS. In such examples, the DMRS may be prioritized over the PTRS. In some examples, the DMRS may puncture the PTRS at a sample-level or a resource element-level. For example, the colliding (or potentially colliding) time-domain samples or resource elements may not be used for PTRS. In such examples, time-domain samples or resources of PTRS that are not colliding with DMRS may still be included in the symbol.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">In some examples, the DMRS may puncture the PTRS at a group-level or a &#x201c;chunk-level.&#x201d; For example, when the PTRS collides with (or may potentially collide with) DMRS, the PTRS may be excluded from the symbol. In examples in which the potential collision is identified, the resources allocated for the PTRS may be re-allocated. For example, the transmitting device may re-allocate the resources allocated to the group of PTRS resources to data and the receiving device may monitor for data at the resources initially allocated to the group of PTRS resources. In examples in which the collision is identified by the receiving device after transmission, the receiving device may discard the samples received at the resources allocated to the group of PTRS resources.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">In some examples in which the PTRS collides with (or may potentially collide with) DMRS, the PTRS may puncture the DMRS.

For example, disclosed technique utilizes a time-domain DMRS pattern that indicates a starting location and a duration of the DMRS of a symbol. The time-domain DMRS pattern may enable a network to control overhead, for example, with respect to the DMRS. The time-domain DMRS pattern may additionally or alternatively enable the network to apply an applicable configuration based on a target use case. For example, if channel conditions are good, then the network may utilize a time-domain DMRS pattern in which resources allocated to DMRS are reduced compared to scenarios in which channel conditions are poor or less than good. In some examples, the time-domain DMRS pattern may facilitate allocating less than all of the resources of a symbol to DMRS (e.g., the DMRS may be allocated to a portion of the resources of the symbol). In some examples, based on the time-domain DMRS pattern, the DMRS may be repeated across symbols.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0245">It is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of blocks in the processes/flowcharts disclosed is an illustration of example approaches.
