Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In JP-A-2018-72024 (Document 1), there is disclosed a robot having a gripping device provided with a pressure sensor as an industrial robot used in a manufacturing line or the like. The pressure sensor is a sensor for outputting pressure as an electric signal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gripping device is provided with a pair of gripping sections which are openable and closable, and the pressure sensor provided to the gripping sections. When a gripping target article is gripped by the gripping sections, the pressure sensor makes contact with the gripping target article to thereby deform, and thus, a voltage signal is output from the pressure sensor. A control device of the robot controls gripping force of the gripping device based on the voltage signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This pressure sensor has a first electrode, a second electrode, and an intermediate layer as a piezoelectric body which is disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, and generates electricity due to a deformation. Between each of the electrodes and the intermediate layer, there is caused a change in capacitance, and thus, the electricity is generated. By detecting an amount of the generation of the electricity and presence or absence of the generation of the electricity, the pressure sensor functions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the pressure sensor described in Document <b>1</b>, the electricity is generated when the intermediate layer deforms, but in order to generate the electricity, it is necessary for the intermediate layer to be pressurized along a direction connecting the first electrode and the second electrode to each other. Therefore, it is possible for the present pressure sensor to detect gripping force received when, for example, the gripping sections grip the gripping target article.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, even when the gripping target article slips with respect to the gripping sections, the gripping force hardly changes. Therefore, it is difficult for the pressure sensor described in Document <b>1</b> to detect the fact that the gripping target article has slipped with respect to the gripping sections.</p><heading

As described above, since the kinetic frictional force is weaker than the static frictional force, the region B is lower than the peak P. Therefore, when the region B is detected after the detection of the peak P, it is possible to determine that the slippage has occurred between the object W and the elastic body <b>2</b>. In other words, it is possible for the piezoelectric sensor <b>1</b> to detect the kinetic frictional force corresponding to the region B based on the existence of the peak P and the region B, and then detect presence or absence of the slippage based thereon.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram extracting one of the three output waveforms shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. When determining presence or absence of the slippage, the determination section <b>497</b> provided to the detector <b>494</b> first detects the peak P. The peak P takes a local maximum value, and can therefore be identified based on, for example, presence or absence of the local maximum value. Then, the determination section <b>497</b> sets an allowable range TL based on the height of the peak P. The allowable range TL is, for example, preferably set to a range no lower than 20% and lower than 100% of the height of the peak P, and more preferably set to a range no lower than 40% and lower than 100%. Then, it is possible for the determination section <b>497</b> to determine the presence or absence of the slippage based on the time TM in which the region B continuously falls within the allowable range TL. The time TM is arbitrarily set in accordance with a type of the object W, a size of the elastic body <b>2</b>, a level of a noise, and so on, and is preferably no shorter than 0.1 second, and is more preferably no shorter than 0.5 second as an example. It should be noted that the process of the determination is not limited to the above.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In such a manner as described hereinabove, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of the slippage.

In this case, it is possible to detect the static frictional force and the kinetic frictional force generated between the floor surface and the elastic body <b>2</b>, and thus, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of the slippage based thereon.

The deformation of the piezoelectric element <b>41</b> means a change in shape of the piezoelectric element <b>41</b> from when the elastic body <b>2</b> does not deform.
