In particular, the present disclosure relates to a lockset that uses exterior to interior communication without cables.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing electronic locksets include wires to electrically connect their exterior and interior assemblies. The wires are used to send electrical signals between the exterior and interior assemblies. For example, the exterior assembly may include a user interface (e.g., a keypad, etc.) for inputting an authentication code, which is communicated to the interior assembly. If the interior assembly determines a valid authentication code was sent, then the interior assembly controls a motor to actuate a bolt between an extended position and a retracted position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One challenge with the installation of the electronic locksets is electrically connecting the interior and exterior assemblies. This is a challenge because the wires need to be manipulated through a bore hole of a door. In some situations, the wires may become pinched or otherwise damaged during the installation process. As a result, the communication between the exterior and interior assemblies may become unreliable, which can cause the electronic lockset to operate improperly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, this invention provides a lockset for securing a door with a bore hole. The lockset includes a latch assembly, an interior assembly, and an exterior assembly. The latch assembly includes a bolt movable between an extended position and a retracted position. The interior assembly is configured to electronically control movement of the bolt between the extended position and the retracted position. The exterior assembly includes a locking assembly configured to be mechanically coupled with the latch assembly. The interior assembly includes an interior wireless communication unit and the exterior assembly includes an exterior wireless communication unit that is configured to wirelessly communicate therebetween. In some embodiments, the exterior assembly includes a photovoltaic solar cell and the interior assembly includes a light source. The light source and the solar cell are configured for wirelessly communicating and for power transmission between the exterior and interior assemblies through a bore hole in the door.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The detailed description makes reference to the accompanying figures in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of an example electronic lockset system with wireless exterior to interior communication according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of an example exterior assembly of the lockset system according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of an example interior assembly of the lockset system according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> together are a simplified flowchart showing an example operation of the exterior assembly of the lockset system according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> together are a simplified flowchart showing an example operation of the interior assembly of the lockset system according to an embodiment of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded, cross-sectional view of an example electronic lockset system with wireless exterior to interior communication according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The figures and descriptions provided herein may have been simplified to illustrate aspects that are relevant for a clear understanding of the herein described devices, systems, and methods, while eliminating, for the purpose of clarity, other aspects that may be found in typical devices, systems, and methods.
