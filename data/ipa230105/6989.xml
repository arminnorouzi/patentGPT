The party providing the media content to the user, the content or media provider, may have a business relationship with other parties, or partners, to allow access to media content to particular users, typically because the user is a customer or has some other relationship with the partner. In these networks, the content or media provider and the partner collectively must identify the user and confirm that the user has rights to access the media content. These networks use a process called &#x201c;authentication&#x201d; to validate the identity of users seeking to access media content, such as subscription-based content with restricted access rights. For example, a content provider may operate a media network to enable public access to a repository of media objects. The content provider may be a broadcast entity, a television provider, an Internet service, or another type of media provider that offers the media objects, such as digital video content, to authenticated users. In addition to authenticating the user's identity, a content provider may also validate that the user has the specific rights, e.g., digital rights or valid subscription, to access the particular media object being requested. Confirming the user's rights to access the media object, or some collection of media objects, is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;authorization.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, for authentication in the digital television environment, standard authentication solutions have been widely used to authenticate users and unlock television media objects on a variety of different devices, platforms, and systems. Typically, the standard authentication solution assumes that the sources and platforms for delivering paid content, such as television media objects, are known in advance and do not change very often, and that a relatively small number of media providers and networks are intended for integration as partners into the authentication solution. However, standard solutions for authentication of digital media objects may not provide sufficient flexibility to engage different kinds of business partners and business arrangements that might be associated with providing access to media objects.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a first method is disclosed for authenticating users to access media content.

In other embodiments disclosed here, the partner integration server has access to an administrative repository that stores configuration information regarding the partners, for example, the partner's selection or availability criteria, workflows, authentication protocols, authentication or authorization Application Programming Interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) endpoints, language preferences, user interface elements, error code mappings, or subscription mappings to be used in connection with each partner. The partner integration server may access and use that configuration information to direct the system's interactions between the user or partner. In some embodiments, an administrative client allows the configuration and modification of the configuration information stored in the administrative repository for each partner. By including an additional layer between the user and the partner, comprising the partner integration server, administrative repository, and administrative client, partners can be flexibly added to the system or configured while the system is live, that is without requiring new or updated software to be distributed to the end user.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a media system <b>100</b>. As shown, media system <b>100</b> depicts modular functionality and includes a media repository <b>120</b> that stores a collection of media objects and a media server <b>122</b> that provides access to the media objects stored in media repository <b>122</b> via a network <b>124</b>. For example, a media access application or player may comprise software that enables a user to access the media objects stored in media repository <b>120</b>. For example, media repository <b>120</b> may be owned and operated by a media provider (not shown) that seeks to monetize access to the media objects, for example, by offering subscription or pay-per-view services to users to enable users to access the media objects. Accordingly, the media access application may perform authentication and authorization of the users to enable access to media repository <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The media provider may control rights to distribute media content using media server <b>122</b> and media repository <b>120</b>. The media provider may be a content creator, i.e., an entity that makes the media content, for example, a television or movie production company or, for example, a band or an author. In other embodiments the media provider may have rights to distribute content created by other individuals or entities, for example a television network or other media services company. In some embodiments the media provider is a sports league or association and provides media content related to its sporting events. The media content provided using media server <b>122</b> may be any type of media. For example, the media content may be audio, video, text, graphics, pictures, virtual reality, augmented reality or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the media content is of a live event, i.e., audio of a speech or audio and video of a concert. In other embodiments, the media content is not live and instead is pre-recorded. In some embodiments, the media content is audio/video of a sporting event, provided live, as the sporting event is occurring, or recorded from an earlier sporting event.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, when the media access application and media system <b>100</b> support the involvement of third parties, such as partners of the media provider that wish to sponsor or enable users to access media system <b>100</b>, the media access application may perform partner authentication to validate that a user has an account or is registered with a partner. Accordingly, the partner authentication may include, or may represent a component of, a standard authentication solution that is capable of authenticating users for access to the media objects stored in media repository <b>120</b>. For example, the standard partner authentication may rely upon various types of information and algorithms to implement an authentication process for users, including user-provided information.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this manner, when users have a business relationship, such as a registered account, with a partner, the partner authentication may enable authentication of users via the partner. However, because the standard partner authentication is incorporated into the media access application, such as by compilation in one example, any change to the partners or the partner relationship may result in malfunction of the media access application until the partner changes have been updated in the code used to generate the media access application, such as by developing a new software version of the media access application, which is not desirable. Furthermore, the interface between the standard partner authentication and the partners may be limited to certain given authentication standards, and may not support the actual authentication already used by the partner and the partner systems, which is also not desirable.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b> is shown that incorporates media network authentication with partner onboarding, as disclosed herein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, media server <b>122</b> and media repository <b>120</b> represent the same elements as described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b> includes a media access client <b>202</b> that is enabled for media network authentication with partner integration, as disclosed herein. Specifically, media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b> includes a partner integration server <b>206</b> that may be accessed by media access client <b>202</b> using a software development kit (&#x201c;SDK&#x201d;) <b>204</b> used to implement media access client <b>202</b>. SDK <b>204</b> may support various operations for partner integration to enable media access client <b>202</b> to access partner integration server <b>206</b>, for example over network <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an administrative client <b>212</b> that may enable an administrator <b>208</b> to access partner integration server <b>206</b>, with direct access depicted. It will be understood that administrative client <b>212</b> may also access partner integration server <b>206</b> using a network, such as networks <b>222</b> or <b>224</b>, for example. For example, administrative client <b>212</b> may represent a plurality of web pages provided by partner integration server <b>206</b> that can be used to access admin repository <b>220</b>. Administrator <b>208</b> may be provided functionality by using administrative client <b>212</b> to perform partner onboarding without having to re-compile or change the compiled code of media access client <b>202</b>, which is substantially different from how media system <b>100</b> was described being accessed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, using standard authentication software. Specifically, administrative client <b>212</b> and partner integration server <b>206</b> may use an admin repository <b>220</b> as a data store for configuring authentication processes. For example, admin repository <b>220</b> may be a database that records various authentication information that is indexed to individual users <b>106</b> and to individual partners <b>210</b>. In various implementations, admin repository <b>220</b> may be integrated with partner integration server <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> are up to N number of partners <b>210</b> having access to partner integration server <b>206</b>, where N is any desired number. Each of partners <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> may represent, or may include, a partner system, such as a server executing code or software, that performs authentication of users <b>202</b>, and that is integrated with partner integration server <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each partner <b>210</b> is shown having a partner protocol <b>214</b> that may be unique to the respective partner <b>210</b>. For example, partner protocol <b>214</b>-<b>1</b> may be unique to or uniquely associated with a partner <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> (labelled as PARTNER1), partner protocol <b>214</b>-<b>2</b> may be unique to or uniquely associated with a partner <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> (labelled as PARTNER2), and partner protocol <b>214</b>-<b>3</b> may be unique to or uniquely associated with a partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> (labelled as PARTNER3). Each partner <b>210</b> may be configured with a customized arrangement to authenticate user <b>106</b> to access the media objects in media repository <b>120</b>, such as based on a commercial relationship between user <b>106</b> and partner <b>210</b> that is external to media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>. The commercial relationship between user <b>106</b> and partner <b>210</b> may be for certain services, or may represent a membership for an account) by user <b>106</b> with partner <b>210</b>. Accordingly, partner <b>210</b> may represent various different kinds of business entities and is not limited to any specific examples presented herein for descriptive purposes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, partner <b>210</b> may operate a network or may be a network provider, such as an Internet provider (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Thus, the network services offered by partner <b>210</b> may be associated with a particular location, region, state, nation, or marketplace. Specifically, when partner <b>210</b> is a wireless network provider in a given area (such as serviced by network <b>222</b> or a portion thereof), user <b>106</b> may be a subscriber of partner <b>210</b> for wireless network services, such as cellular telephone and associated digital communication services, such that network requests issued by user <b>106</b> using media access client <b>202</b> are processed through partner <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, partner <b>210</b> may be associated with a franchise chain of retail locations, such as hotels, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, or particular retail stores, having wireless networks accessible by users <b>106</b>. Thus, when partner <b>210</b> is associated with a network, and users <b>106</b> access partner integration server <b>206</b> via the network, partner <b>210</b> may provide network information from the network to enable partner integration server <b>206</b> to identify partner <b>210</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b>, without any direct network connections in media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>. As shown, partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> may represent a type of partner that does not operate a network and that does not have any direct functionality in media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>. Instead, partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> may have some kind of relationship with user <b>106</b>, such as having provided user <b>106</b> with an offer code to enable user <b>106</b> to access media repository <b>120</b>. Thus, partner integration server <b>206</b> may be enabled to support partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> without performing authentication of user <b>106</b> with partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b>. For example, partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> may be identified for user <b>106</b> based on user input of an identifier associated with partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> (the offer code) or explicit user selection of partner <b>210</b>-<b>3</b>, for example, from a list of potential partner options.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, partners <b>210</b> may access partner integration server <b>206</b> using partner protocol <b>214</b> via network <b>224</b>. As shown, partner integration server <b>206</b> may incorporate protocol translation <b>216</b> that may be enabled to translate or map various information provided using partner protocol <b>214</b> into information that is used or standardized by partner integration server <b>206</b>. Furthermore, administrative client <b>212</b> may be enabled to allow administrator <b>208</b> to setup protocol translation <b>216</b> that is specific to a given partner protocol <b>214</b> to support onboarding of associated partner <b>210</b>. For example, error code values returned by partner protocol <b>214</b> may be translated or mapped by protocol translation <b>216</b> into an standard error code value that is internally used by partner integration server <b>206</b>. In this manner, partner integration server <b>206</b> may support any kind of partner <b>210</b> having any kind of partner protocol <b>214</b> for authentication purposes, without being dependent on a given implementation of either partner integration server <b>206</b> or media access client <b>202</b>, which is desirable for maintenance and operation of media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may represent various types of wireless or wired or combination wired/wireless networks. As noted previously, when media access client <b>202</b> is executed on a mobile device (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) by user <b>106</b>, user <b>106</b> may have an account for wireless services to use the mobile device on network <b>222</b>. In various embodiments, networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may include or provide access to a public network, such as the Internet. In some embodiments, networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may represent the same network. Networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may include, for example, a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;) or wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;). Networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may support various types of connections to various devices, as desired. Networks <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> may be, for example, packet switched networks, such as Ethernet, and may use, for example, the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (&#x201c;TCP/IP&#x201d;) suite of communication protocols.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> is shown that incorporates media network authentication with partner onboarding, as disclosed herein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, various like numbered elements represent the same elements as described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> may represent a special case of media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> in particular embodiments. Instead of network <b>222</b> representing a front end client access network as in media network <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>, in media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>, media access client <b>202</b> is a member (or a subscriber) of network <b>232</b>, which is associated with a corresponding network provider <b>230</b> that represents partner <b>210</b>. Specifically, in media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>, partners <b>210</b> are represented by network providers <b>230</b> who operate a respective network <b>232</b>, as described previously. Accordingly, various functionality described herein for partners <b>210</b> may be equivalent or substantially equivalent for network providers <b>230</b>, in particular with respect to access and use of partner integration server <b>206</b>. Thus, a network provider <b>230</b>-<b>1</b> may be associated with a network <b>232</b>-<b>1</b>, a network provider <b>230</b>-<b>2</b> may be associated with a network <b>232</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on, up to a network provider <b>230</b>-N being associated with a network <b>232</b>-N. Furthermore, in media network <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>, media access client <b>202</b> may access partner integration server <b>206</b> and media repository <b>120</b>/media server <b>122</b> via networks <b>232</b> and <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, networks <b>232</b> may represent various types of wireless or wired or combination wired/wireless networks.

In some implementations, partner integration server <b>206</b> may enable authentication of users <b>106</b> directly with partner <b>210</b>, without partner integration server <b>206</b> first authenticating user <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, in media network <b>200</b>, partner integration server <b>206</b> may authenticate user <b>106</b> who operates media access client <b>202</b> for accessing specific media content, such as certain collections of media content. The media content that user <b>106</b> is authorized to access may be based on the relationship (not shown) of user <b>106</b> with partner <b>210</b>, such as based on an offer for a particular subscription to the media content in media repository <b>120</b>. For example, certain partner relationships with partner <b>210</b> may authorize user <b>106</b> to access audio content, while other partner relationships with partner <b>210</b> may authorize user <b>106</b> to access video content, image content, virtual reality content, or augmented reality content. Other types of partner relationships with partner <b>210</b> may authorize user <b>106</b> for various types of subscriptions or offers to content or media objects, including coupons, discounts, per-view access, access periods of time, among others.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In media network <b>200</b>, partner integration server <b>206</b> and partners <b>210</b> may comprise software executing under an operating system (OS) on a computing platform commonly termed a &#x201c;server&#x201d; (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), which may be a physical server or a virtual server, such as a virtual OS executing on a virtual machine.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Partner Onboarding</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In media network <b>200</b>, one advantage of partner integration server <b>206</b> in media network <b>200</b> is the ability to onboard new partners, which refers to the introduction or addition of new partners <b>210</b> to operate with partner integration server <b>206</b>, without modifying source code (i.e., software) associated with either partner integration server <b>206</b> or media access client <b>202</b>. As disclosed herein, onboarding of new partners may occur after a partner entity associated with partner <b>210</b> has executed an agreement with the media provider of media network <b>200</b>, such as governing the terms of access to media server <b>122</b>/media repository <b>120</b> that partner <b>210</b> may offer to subscribers of partner <b>210</b>, thereby enabling the subscribers to become users <b>106</b>. As disclosed herein, partner onboarding may represent an automated technical solution to implement the contract or agreement between the media provider of media network <b>200</b> and the partner entity associated with partner <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To enable the addition of new partners <b>210</b> without modification of underlying source code of partner integration server <b>206</b> or media access client <b>202</b>, partner integration server <b>206</b> may specify a set of standards, embodied by software development kit (SDK) <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, that can used by media access client <b>202</b> to access partner integration server <b>206</b>. Thus, SDK <b>204</b> may represent a set of Application Programming Interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) functions that media access client <b>202</b> may use to perform authentication methods for user <b>106</b> with partner <b>210</b>, as described in further detail herein. The API functions used for SDK <b>204</b> may provide a programmatic interface in the form of defined functions or procedures that may represent an abstraction of an underlying software implementation of the functions and procedures. Thus, the API functions used for SDK <b>204</b> may result in exposure of a selected collection of actions or functions to media access client <b>202</b> that are used by partner integration server <b>206</b>. SDK <b>204</b> may also include the structure and content of the function calls exchanged between media access client <b>202</b> and partner integration server <b>206</b>, such as in the form of a protocol (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, during an onboarding process, administrator <b>208</b> may operate administrative client <b>212</b>, for example, to configure protocol translation <b>216</b> to operate with partner protocol <b>214</b>. In this manner, access to partner integration server <b>206</b> is not limited to a particular protocol, such as an authentication standard, such that a partner protocol <b>214</b> that may already be implemented by partner <b>210</b> may be used without modification, and thus, without disruption of existing technology used by partner <b>210</b>, which is desirable. It is noted that administrator <b>208</b> may be associated with partner integration server <b>206</b>, or administrator <b>208</b> may be associated with partner <b>210</b> and may be given access rights by partner integration server <b>206</b> to use administrative client <b>212</b>, such as using a remote network connection.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in media network <b>200</b>, administrative client <b>212</b> may be used by administrator <b>208</b> to onboard a new partner <b>210</b> for operation with partner integration server <b>206</b>. The administrative services enabled by administrative client <b>212</b> may allow for adding and managing partners <b>210</b> for use with media network <b>200</b>. The administrative services may be provided in the form of a web application that administrator <b>208</b> can use. In some embodiments, the web application comprising administrative client <b>212</b> may comprise a series of user interface screens, as part of a graphical user interface, for viewing and entering data associated with the partners. The administrative services enabled by administrative client <b>212</b> may allow for partners <b>210</b> to be added or deleted. When a partner <b>210</b> is added, partner integration server <b>206</b> may create an electronic record for partner <b>210</b>, such as in admin repository <b>220</b>. The electronic record may include, as described below, configuration data for partner <b>210</b>. The electronic record may be stored at admin repository <b>212</b>, for example, in a database, flat file, or other electronic file and associated with or indexed to partner <b>210</b>. Various types of databases may be used with admin repository, including relational databases (e.g., an SQL database) and non-relational (e.g., a NoSQL database).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments of media network <b>200</b>, filtration criteria for identifying partner <b>210</b> may be configured and stored in the configuration data for partner <b>210</b>. The filtration criteria may include any information included in requests received from a user device, for example, information included in hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) headers of such requests. In various embodiments, partners <b>210</b> may be associated with, for example, particular media access platforms, media providers, user locations, carrier networks, network addresses, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or ranges of IP addresses, types of devices, user affiliations, or other characteristics of user <b>106</b> or a device associated with user <b>106</b>. IP addresses are unique strings of numbers separated by periods that identify each computer or device connected to an IP network, such as the Internet. Current protocol versions for IP addresses include IPv4 (a 32-bit address scheme) and IPv6 (a 128-bit address scheme). A range of IP addresses for which partner <b>210</b> may be accessible over a public network may also be designated in the filtration criteria. User location information may include country, state, or metropolitan statistical area identifiers derived or obtained from IP address-based geolocation databases or providers, commonly termed geo or geolocation. User location information may also include, for example, latitude-longitude coordinates derived or obtained from global positioning satellite (GPS) information. User affiliations may include, for example, a user's membership in an organization or enrollment in or subscription to the services of business or other organization. Carrier networks are proprietary networks belonging to telecommunications companies. Carrier networks may be designated with combinations of mobile country codes (MCC) and mobile network code (MNC).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">An association between user characteristics or user device characteristics and partners <b>210</b> may allow partners <b>210</b> to be filtered or selected in appropriate circumstances to identify a suitable partner <b>210</b>. For example, partner <b>210</b> may be operational in particular countries, and accordingly, partner integration server <b>206</b> may be configured to match user <b>106</b> with partner <b>210</b> when the initial information from user <b>106</b> indicates the matching countries.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Combinations of filtration criteria are also possible, for example, a partner may be associated with a particular country and carrier network. Filtering mechanisms include combinations of geolocation, carrier network and device information filters, for example, using the following combined search terms: {&#x201c;US&#x201d;, &#x201c;Digicel&#x201d;, &#x201c;Samsung Android 10.3.2&#x201d;}. The carrier network may include a carrier name and a mobile country code and a mobile network code. Combinations of geolocation and IP address may also be used, for example, using the following combined search terms: {&#x201c;US&#x201d;, &#x201c;255.255.255.0&#x201d; }.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The filtration criteria may include groups of various characteristics, for example, geo groups, carrier groups, device groups, or IP address groups. In this context, groups are collections of potential filtering criteria, for example, a collection or group of countries, a collection or group of carriers, a collection or group of device types, or a collection or group of IP addresses or IP address ranges. For example, certain geographic regions (e.g., the countries) where partner <b>210</b> operates may be designated in the filtration criteria using geo groups. A carrier group may also be designated in the filtration criteria, for example, using a name and a mobile country code and a mobile network code for one or more carriers. Certain devices that users <b>106</b> may use to operate media access client <b>202</b> and that are supported by partner <b>210</b>, such as particular brands or models of mobile phones, may also be designated in the filtration criteria.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As noted above, in media network <b>200</b>, certain subscription offers from partner <b>210</b> may also be configured and stored in the configuration data for partner <b>210</b>. The subscription offers from partner <b>210</b> may be mapped to or associated with the subscriptions offered by media network <b>200</b>, and the mapping may also be stored in the configuration data for each individual partner <b>210</b>. In this manner, each partner <b>210</b> may be given wide flexibility in offering customized and tailored media subscriptions to users <b>106</b>. An expiration date for the subscription offers or for the mapping may also be configured and stored in the configuration data for partner <b>210</b>. In various embodiments, an expiration date is a date after which the subscription or mapping is no longer valid.

In still other embodiments, certain subscriptions may be associated with media objects featuring a particular actor or actress, media objects for games of a particular type, media objects associated with particular sports or sports leagues, media objects associated with particular teams or groupings of teams. In further embodiments, the subscriptions may be associated with a genre of media objects (e.g., comedies, dramas, or classical music), or a time period associated with media objects.

Specifically, three partner types are described below in further detail below, a SESSION PARTNER, a TRANSACTION PARTNER, and a DISCOUNT PARTNER. In general any of these three partner types may use any of the authentication protocols discussed below. The partners vary in terms of the user's <b>106</b> persistence with the system and whether the partner integration server <b>206</b> associates the user <b>106</b> with an account. For the SESSION PARTNER, user <b>106</b> follows a two-step process every time they access the system, first logging in with the partner and then checking for subscriptions. A user account for partner integration server <b>206</b> not required. For the TRANSACTION PARTNER, an account is associated with the user at partner integration server <b>206</b>. After the user logs into the partner <b>210</b> the first time, logins are no longer required on subsequent accesses, because sufficient information about the user is stored in the partner integration layer, i.e., the partner integration server <b>206</b> and admin repository <b>210</b>. For the DISCOUNT PARTNER, the login process is similar to that of the SESSION PARTNER, and the user <b>106</b> is entitled to purchase a subscription or access media objects after successfully logging in through the partner <b>210</b>. More detailed and specific protocol examples indicative of different partner types are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C</figref>.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">User Authentication by Partners</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In various embodiments, media network <b>200</b> and partner integration server <b>206</b> support user authentication. A variety of authentication protocols may be supported by media network <b>200</b>, such that different authentication protocols may be used by different partners <b>210</b>, allowing media network <b>200</b> to be operated with the different protocols. Thus, media network <b>200</b> may operate with authentication protocols selected by or chosen by partner <b>210</b>, instead of defining only specific authentication protocols that are operable with media network <b>200</b> and partner integration server <b>206</b>. Authentication protocols that may be supported include, for example, a login with a name and a password, a token-based authentication (such as OAuth or OAuth 2.0 or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or SAML 2.0 authentication), and a two-factor authentication (2FA), among other possible authentication protocols.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In other embodiments of media network <b>200</b>, certain partners <b>210</b> may not utilize user authentication in certain instances. In such cases, media network <b>200</b> and partner integration server <b>206</b> may be operable with no authentication of user <b>106</b>. Instead, partner <b>210</b>, chosen by the filtering criteria by partner integration server <b>206</b>, may enable user <b>106</b> to access media server <b>122</b> without authentication of the user's identity, such as with transaction partner authentication <b>601</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a basic login authentication protocol, user <b>106</b> may provide a user identifier and a password. The user identifier may be an email address for user <b>106</b> or another identifier assigned to or chosen by user <b>106</b>. The password is a text string, known by user <b>106</b> and partner <b>210</b>, associated with the user identifier. In an authentication process using the basic login authentication protocol, user <b>106</b> may be queried by media access client <b>202</b>, for example, for the user identifier and password. Media access client <b>202</b> may send the user identifier and password to partner integration server <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, the user identifier and password may be sent using encryption, such using hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). Partner integration server <b>206</b> server may pass identifying information for user <b>106</b> to partner <b>210</b> through a method specified during partner onboarding (e.g., a particular HTTP/S request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a particular universal resource locator (URL)), which are also known as API endpoints. Partner <b>210</b> may process the user identifier and password, and may provide one of two responses, either a success response or an error response, back to partner integration server <b>206</b>. Partner <b>210</b> may use a database or flat file or other records to determine whether the password provided by user <b>106</b> matches a stored password associated with the user identifier. The success response indicates that user <b>106</b> was successfully authenticated by partner <b>210</b> because the password provided matched the stored password for the user identifier. The error response indicates that the authentication was not successful for user <b>106</b> and may include an error code that indicates the nature of the failure or error in authentication at partner <b>210</b>. If user <b>106</b> is successfully authenticated, partner integration server <b>206</b> may then query partner <b>210</b> to determine whether user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled to a valid subscription. If user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled to a valid subscription, partner <b>210</b> may return a subscription token to partner integration server <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a token-based authentication protocol, a user's account information may be used by an external service without exposing the password. An example of a token-based authentication is the Open Authorization (OAuth) protocol, such as promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) OAuth Working Group. In token-based authentication, the process is similar to a basic login in that the user is queried for a user identifier and a password, such as by media access client <b>202</b>. The user's user identifier and password may be sent to partner integration server <b>206</b>, and then sent by partner integration server <b>206</b> to a first endpoint designated for partner <b>210</b> during the onboarding process. For example, a particular URI, with a particular HTTP/S request method may be specified as the first endpoint using administrative client <b>212</b>. A response from the first endpoint, as specified for partner <b>210</b>, may provide an authorization code back to partner integration server <b>206</b>. In other embodiments, when using OAuth or other token based approaches such as SAML, user <b>106</b> may be connected directly to a login service that is hosted by partner <b>210</b>, such that user <b>106</b> actually logs in directly with partner <b>210</b>. The authorization code may then be provided to a second endpoint designated for partner <b>210</b> during the onboarding process. After receiving an authorization code that is confirmed, the second endpoint may provide a response to partner integration server <b>206</b> that includes an access token to partner integration server <b>206</b>. With a valid access token in place, partner integration server <b>206</b> may query partner <b>210</b> whether user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled with a valid subscription. When user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled, partner <b>210</b> may return a subscription token to partner integration server <b>206</b>, which can be forwarded to media access client <b>202</b> to enable user <b>106</b> to access media server <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a two-factor authentication (2FA) protocol, user <b>106</b> is authenticated based on a combination of two factors, for example, including both a first factor based on a device that user <b>106</b> user possesses (e.g., a mobile phone or a smartcard) and a second factor that is known to user <b>106</b> (e.g., an access token or a password). In a simple example of 2FA, user <b>106</b> can access media server <b>122</b> by receiving an access token sent to the user's personal phone number, usually in the form of a short-message service (SMS) message to a mobile phone of user <b>106</b>. In this case, physical possession of the mobile phone when the access token is received is a second factor completely independent of a password known to user <b>106</b>, and so, provides enhanced security for both media network <b>200</b> and user <b>106</b>. When a smartcard is used, a corresponding physical device (i.e., the smartcard) is inserted into a reader. Then, a numeric value, such as an identifier, associated with the smartcard is matched with personal information for user <b>106</b>, such as a personal identification number (PIN). When using 2FA during onboarding, partner <b>210</b> may select a third-party provider, for example Authy Inc. (authy.com), or may specify endpoints for a partner-selected provider. In some embodiments, the 2FA provider may be able to automatically detect the country code and phone number of user <b>106</b> when user <b>106</b> accesses the login query. When specifying a non-standard provider of 2FA, the API endpoints of the non-standard provider (e.g., a universal resource locator (URL), a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) method), are provided to administrative client <b>212</b>. In this manner, the non-standard provider can send the 2FA access token to the user's phone number and verify the one-time password provided by the user. When the 2FA endpoint returns a success response, the 2FA access token was correctly received and user <b>106</b> is successfully authenticated. When the 2FA endpoint returns an error response, the authentication was not successful and may include an error code that indicates the nature of the failure or error in authentication at partner <b>210</b>. When user <b>106</b> is successfully authenticated, partner integration server <b>206</b> will then query partner <b>210</b> whether user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled with a valid subscription. When user <b>106</b> is authorized or entitled with a valid subscription, partner <b>210</b> will return a subscription token to partner integration server <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">During partner onboarding, the authentication protocol for use by partner integration server <b>206</b> with a particular partner <b>210</b> may be specified, whether basic login, token-based authentication, 2FA, no login, or some other form of authentication. Along with specification of the selected authentication protocol, the endpoints associated with the selected authentication protocol may also be provided to partner integration server <b>206</b>, such as using administrative client <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition to basic login, token-based authentication, 2FA, no login, as described above, additional forms of authentication that may be used include Security Assertion Markup 2.0 Language (SAML 2.0) and biometric authentication, such as with a biometric device that is included with the mobile device of user <b>106</b> that executes media access client <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a block diagram showing selected elements of an embodiment of a server <b>300</b> is illustrated.
