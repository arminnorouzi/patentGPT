For tracking or visualizing single biomolecules in the cytoplasm, the fluorescent emitters need to be very bright. Indeed, the spatio-temporal resolution is directly linked to the number of collected photons. Recently, dye-loaded polymer nanoparticles have achieved very high brightness through the encapsulation of a large amount of fluorescent dye in nanoparticles (Reisch, A.; Klymchenko, A. S. Fluorescent Polymer Nanoparticles Based on Dyes: Seeking Brighter Tools for Bioimaging. <i>Small </i>2016, 12 (15), 1968-1992.). Several new strategies, such as fluorescent organic dots with aggregation-induced emission<sup>1 </sup>or use of salts of fluorophores with hydrophobic bulky counterions<sup>2</sup>, had been used to overcome aggregation-caused quenching of the fluorophores encapsulated at very high concentrations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in order to be used in biological environments, single-molecule imaging requires not only high brightness of nanoparticles, but also small probe sizes and an absence of non-specific interactions with biological environments.<sup>3 </sup>Firstly, in order to increase localization precision, the particle diameter needs to be of the order of the size of the biomolecule (e.g. protein) it is intended to label. Secondly, the size and the surface coating of nanoparticles play a crucial role in defining their intracellular behavior and their influence on the behavior of the labeled biomolecules should be limited.<sup>4,5 </sup>Diffusion of nanoparticles in biological environments, such as in cells, can be limited due to structural restrictions and macromolecular crowding effects inside cells.<sup>6 </sup>Etoc. et al. determined that particles of &#x2264;50 nm can have Brownian diffusion in the cytosol.<sup>4 </sup>The inventors also showed in the past that the limit core size, for which the NPs can reach almost all parts of the cytosol, is around 23 nm.<sup>5 </sup>At the same time, the surface chemistry also has a major effect on the behavior of nanoparticles in biological systems<sup>7 </sup>and can affect the diffusion and the motion of NPs in the cytosol.<sup>4 </sup>One reason for this is that the surface chemistry will determine interactions with proteins. In particular, the adsorption of proteins leading to the formation of a protein corona affects all aspects of NP behavior from the cellular uptake to their degradation,<sup>8 </sup>and as long as there are strong interactions between proteins and the NP surface, nanoparticles are not able to freely move in the cytosol.<sup>4 </sup>Therefore, the control of the surface properties to reduce (suppress) protein adsorption is essential.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Till now, introducing polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the best known strategy for suppressing protein adsorption on nanoparticles.<sup>9 </sup>However, PEGylation is not fully adapted to produce nanoparticles having a size similar to that of biomolecules (e.g. protein), since the PEG chains needed for efficiently suppressing interactions with proteins also significantly increase the particle diameter by several nanometers and often by around 10 nm.<sup>10,11 </sup></p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, WO 2018/044688 described a water-dispersible fluorescent particle comprising a mixture of one or more hydrophobic polymers, which are encapsulated in one or more amphiphilic polymers. Said amphiphilic polymers are block copolymers comprising at least one hydrophobic segment and at least one hydrophilic segment, such as PS-b-PEG.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative is the use of zwitterionic (ZI) groups, mimicking the outer surface of the cell membrane.<sup>12 </sup>The mechanism of suppression of protein adsorption in the case of zwitterions is linked to their very hydrophilic nature and the fact that they contain their own counterion,<sup>11,12 </sup>rather than on steric repulsion as in the case of PEG. Therefore, unlike PEG coatings, zwitterionic coatings can be very thin, limiting the increase of particle diameter. Several approaches have been developed to implement zwitterionic, especially carboxybetaine, sulfobetaine and phosphorylcholine, groups on NP surfaces. However, most of zwitterionic nanoparticles developed in the past are inorganic nanoparticles as quantum dots (QDs),<sup>13 </sup>silica NPs,<sup>11 </sup>or Au NPs.<sup>14 </sup></p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Till now, in the case of polymeric nanoparticles, zwitterionic polymeric particles are mainly obtained from block copolymers bearing a zwitterionic block and a hydrophobic block.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The shortcoming of this approach is that the diameters of these NPs are not satisfactory, which limits their use in in vivo environments. By the way, their synthesis process is often very complex.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, in order to improve in vitro or in vivo detection or tracking of a target biological molecule, it is necessary to provide new families of zwitterionic polymeric nanoparticles having high brightness and controllable smaller size and limited protein surface interactions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to satisfy these requirements, the Inventors of the present invention developed novel luminescent zwitterionic nanoparticles, based on specially designed random hydrophobic polymers, bearing apolar, charged, zwitterionic and reactive groups for bioconjugation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Contrary to block zwitterionic copolymers known in prior art wherein the zwitterionic block and the hydrophobic block are separated and localized on two ends of the polymer chain, the zwitterionic copolymers forming the nanoparticles of the present invention have both negatively charged groups and zwitterionic groups which are randomly arranged on the polymeric backbone chain among the hydrophobic pendant groups of the copolymer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Against all odds, it is surprising to observe that this random arrangement of a small amount of zwitterionic groups and negatively charged groups can on the same time further reduce nanoparticle's size and efficiently prevent protein adsorption on nanoparticle's surface while maintaining a high luminescence brightness.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The nanoparticles of the present invention can have a diameter as small as 7-20 nm, that is particularly suitable for being monitored directly at the single particle level in the cytoplasm of living and fixed cells and tissues.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first aspect of the present invention is to provide a zwitterionic luminescent polymeric nanoparticle, said nanoparticle comprising at least one luminescent dye and at least one random copolymer, said random copolymer comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">from 0.5 to 20 mol % of repeating units having a pendant group which is a negatively charged group chosen from phosphonate, sulfonate and carboxylate,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">from 3 to 30 mol %, in particular from 5 to 20 mol %, more particularly from 7 to 17 mol %, of repeating units having a pendant group which is a zwitterionic group,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">from 0 to 5 mol % of repeating units having a pendant group which is a reactive group which is suitable to be functionalized by a natural or synthetic biologically interesting molecule,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">from 60 to 95 mol % of repeating units having a pendant group, which is a hydrophobic group.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Without being bound by any theory, the nanoparticles of the invention probably have a hydrophobic core made up predominantly of the hydrophobic part of the copolymers and of the dye salt. The excellent resistance to protein adsorption and the high mobility of the particles in the cytosol, on the other hand, suggest a very hydrophilic surface with a high density of zwitterionic groups. Thus, the nanoparticles of the invention are supposed to have a core-shell structure with the hydrophobic parts of the amphiphilic polymers predominantly concentrated in the core, responsible for encapsulation of luminescent dyes, and the charged and zwitterionic parts abundant in the shell, responsible for controlling the interactions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">For a given particle-core size, the nanoparticles of the invention make it possible to reduce by a factor of 2 the total size of nanoparticles with respect to that of PEGylated nanoparticles based on the same major monomer. This is due to the smaller size of the particle shell in the case of zwitterionic particles compared to their PEGylated counterparts. The brightness of the particles depends on the number of dyes encapsulated in their core and hence, for a given total size, on the ratio of core to the total particle diameter (core and shell). In consequence, for the same total particle diameter, the brightness of the particles of invention, which have nearly 2-fold larger core diameter because of very thin shell, can be increased by nearly 8-fold. High loading (&#x3e;20 wt %) and quantum yields of the present particles (&#x3e;30%) have been confirmed. That means the nanoparticles of the invention are ultra-bright compared to non-zwitterionic nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Thus, the nanoparticles of the present invention combined, on the one hand, efficient dye encapsulation and high quantum yields, resulting in high particle brightness, and on the other hand, excellent stability and resistance to protein adsorption.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a simplified chemical structure of methacrylate-based copolymers bearing sulfonate and zwitterionic (ZI) group, the dye (R18) and its counterion (F5-TPB) used for preparation of zwitterionic luminescent dye-loaded NPs through nanoprecipitation.

In all cases, diffuse staining of cytosolic structures was virtually absent. This confirms the efficient and stable encapsulation of the dyes within the NPs and the absence of dye leaching. Maximum projections of the fluorescence intensities over 60s gave a general idea of the overall distribution of the particles throughout the cytosol: In the absence of ZI groups, most of the particles remained stuck at the injection point and the few particles in the cytosol had a low mobility, indicating strong interactions of the particles with the cellular constituents. On the other hand, particles bearing 10% ZI groups distributed, in general, well throughout the cytosol. PMMA-based ZI-bearing NPs showed a distribution all over the cytosol and a high mobility, even though there is sometime a &#x201c;projection&#x201d; on the nucleus close to the injection point. PEMA-ZI particles showed a homogeneous distribution and high mobility for practically all NPs. This was also observed for PPMA-ZI particles, though here a certain part of the particles remained close to the injection point. In the case of PBMA-based particles, they were more localized at the injection point than particles based on other tested polymers. These results confirmed that 10% ZI groups are sufficient to strongly reduce interactions of the particles with cellular constituents and enable spreading throughout the cytosol. However, these results also confirm that the particle size also has a major influence on intracellular particle diffusion, and only particles below a critical core size of around 23 nm can spread throughout the cytosol due to steric hindrance by cellular structures.<sup>6 </sup>Here, the PBMA particles had sizes clearly above this threshold, leading to their immobilization. Part of the PPMA particles were also above this threshold, resulting in immobilization of part of the particles.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">2.4 Single Particle Tracking</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0184">The high brightness of the particles of the invention enabled monitoring the mobility and diffusion behavior of the NPs at the single particle level and so to better understand the influence of the ZI groups and the type of polymer used on the intracellular behavior of our NPs. An example of a cytoplasmic trajectory of a PEMA-based ZI-bearing NP is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. Plotting the mean square displacement (MSD) vs lag time for these NPs showed a linear increase up to about 10 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>with an exponent a of 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). This indicates normal or Brownian diffusion of these particles in the cytosol, which is described, in two dimensions, as MSD=4D&#x394;t<sup>0 </sup>with D, the diffusion coefficient and a=1.<sup>16 </sup>The diffusion coefficients of individual NPs were then extracted from the corresponding MSD curves. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows that for PEMA-ZI NPs the distribution of the diffusion coefficients is centered around 1 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, with a mean D of 0.80 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, in good agreement with values obtained for QDs of similar size.<sup>4 </sup>The distribution shows only a small fraction of NPs with diffusion coefficients below 0.2 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

PPMA-ZI NPs, on the other hand, showed a clearly lower mean diffusion coefficient of 0.25 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This is probably due to their larger size leading to a restricted cytoplasmic diffusion, as already indicated by their stronger clustering around the injection point. As PMMA-SO<sub>3</sub>H 1% NPs without ZI groups remained clustered around the injection point, and hence it was not possible to characterize their diffusion behavior. However, we could show earlier that simple adsorption of Tween 80 (T80), a PEGylated surfactant, on such nanoparticles strongly reduces their interaction with proteins and permits their diffusion in the cytosol,<sup>5,15 </sup>Interestingly, the mean diffusion coefficient of these NPs was with 0.2 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>three to four fold lower than those of the PMMA and PEMA ZI NPs, even though their core sizes were very close (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). One reason for this is certainly the fact that the addition of the PEGylated surfactant increases the NP size by &#x3e;5 nm. The large difference in diffusion coefficients further indicates that the ZI groups are more effective in reducing non-specific interactions with intracellular biomolecules and structures than the adsorbed PEG shell.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 2: Preparation of Zwitterionic Fluorescent Nanoparticles for Specific Interactions with Biological Molecules</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0185">In the present example fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) bearing zwitterionic groups have been designed to prevent non-specific interactions and bearing targeting groups to introduce specific interactions with biomolecules. In order to introduce specific interactions, antibodies were used, more specifically cetuximab, which is an antibody against the HER2 receptor. To achieve conjugation of the antibodies to the nanoparticles, it has been relied on copper-free cycloaddition click chemistry between an azide group and a strained alkyne, dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO). On the one side, zwitterionic brightly fluorescent nanoparticles with azide groups on their surface have been assembled, through nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic co-polymer bearing zwitterionic, charged, and azide groups, together with a hydrophobic dye-salt.

For this an ethyl methacrylate based polymer, bearing carboxylate and sulfobetaine groups, was synthesized through radical polymerization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). In this polymer we then introduced azide groups through reaction with a trifunctional molecule bearing an azide group, an amino group for coupling with COOH groups on the polymer, and a protected carboxylic acid group (Asp(OtBu)-N3, derived from aspartic acid). After deprotection of the carboxylate, a hydrophobic polymer combining ZI groups, COOH groups for the nanoparticle size control during nanoprecipitation, and azide reactive groups (e.g. 10 mol % zwitterionic groups, 5 mol % COOH, 3-5 mol % N3) was obtained (Formula Ia-1 above).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0200">This polymer was then used to assemble dye-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) through nanoprecipitation: Acetonitrile solutions (containing 10% methanol) of the polymer and 10-30 wt % (relative to the polymer) of the dye salt R18/F5-TPB were quickly added to a 9-fold excess of phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, followed by further dilution. This resulted in the formation of NPs with sizes between 15 and 18 nm, which increased slightly with dye loading as detailed in the following Table 2. These NPs showed a bright fluorescence with fluorescence quantum yields around 32%. Based on the size and the loading of the particles, the number of fluorophores can be estimated to be 100, 250 and 500 fluorophores per nanoparticles for 10, 20, and 30 wt % loading, respectively.
