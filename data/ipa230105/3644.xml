119 the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086585 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 1, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">(a) Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a tomographic imaging system for a transparent material composite thin film, more particularly, to the tomographic imaging system capable of improving quality of a tomographic image by reducing a surface reflection signal of the transparent material composite thin film and increasing a focal depth.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">(b) Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a type of optical three-dimensional image technology, is an imaging technology that non-destructively acquires a tomographic structure image of a specimen with high resolution using an interferometer of non-coherent light. Typically, OCT forms a focus inside a sample to be analyzed using a lens, and acquires reflection/scattering signals before and after a focal plane to obtain a tomographic image.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to precisely analyze a tomographic structure of a specimen, it is important to acquire high-resolution images across all image depths. However, when a lens is typically used, a section forming a focus is very short, resulting in a difference in image quality for each image depth. In particular, in an actual use environment, a height may be different every time the specimen is positioned, and when applied to an automated system accompanying a stage, a difference in a specimen height due to vibrations may additionally occur, and therefore, it is important to maintain the image level according to the depth direction position of the sample.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, since the thin film specimen has a flat surface, a reflected signal at a surface boundary is very large compared to the signal scattered inside the thin film when acquiring the OCT image, which may exceed a dynamic range of a photodetector, so a surface state and an internal structure of the specimen are difficult to analyze simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the disclosure, and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a tomographic imaging system for a transparent material composite thin film having advantages of improving quality of a tomographic image by reducing a surface reflection signal of the transparent material composite thin film and increasing a focal depth when acquiring an optical coherence tomography (OCT) image.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a tomographic imaging system for a transparent material composite thin film including: a light source, a light irradiation unit that irradiates light from the light source to a transparent material composite thin film sample and a reference mirror and acquires an interference signal between light reflected and scattered from the sample and light reflected from the reference mirror; a light measuring unit that measures the interference signal acquired by the light irradiation unit; a light transmission unit that transmits the light output from the light source to the light irradiation unit and transmits the interference signal of the light transmitted from the light irradiation unit to the light measuring unit; and a signal processing apparatus that controls to convert the interference signal of the sample detected by the light measuring unit, output the converted interference signal as a tomographic image, and monitor the interference signal acquired by the light irradiation unit to modulate intensity and a polarization state of the light input to the light irradiation unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The light source may include a sweep source laser, a supercontinuum laser, or a super luminescent diode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The light transmission unit may include a wave guide including an optical fiber.

In addition, the adaptive illuminance controller <b>240</b> may derive an appropriately irradiated light condition for reducing surface reflection by acquiring a surface reflection signal of a local area over a short time before scanning a specimen by the beam scanner <b>260</b>.

A polarization difference between the reflected light transmitted in the reverse direction from the reference lens <b>220</b> and the reflected and scattered light transmitted in the reverse direction from the sample lens <b>210</b> may be appropriately controlled by the adaptive illuminance controller <b>240</b>. For example, when the polarization difference between the light transmitted from the sample lens <b>210</b> and the reference lens <b>220</b> is controlled to be 90&#xb0;, control is made so that, due to the nature of light interfering with only the same polarization component, the light reflected from the sample <b>212</b> and the light reflected from the reference mirror <b>222</b> hardly interfere vertically with each other, and only the scattered light whose polarization has changed inside the sample <b>212</b> interferes, so the surface reflection may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The light transmission unit <b>400</b> transmits the light output from the light source <b>100</b> to the light irradiation unit <b>200</b>, and transmits the interference signal of the light reflected and scattered from the reference mirror <b>222</b> and the sample <b>212</b> to the light measuring unit <b>300</b>, and the light measuring unit <b>300</b> measures an interference signal of light acquired from the light irradiation unit <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light measuring unit <b>300</b> includes a light splitter <b>310</b>, a spectrometer <b>320</b>, and a photodetector <b>330</b>.
