The mirror was first invented by a German chemist in 1835 and employed silvered glass to create a reflective surface by the deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of silver nitrate. Today, mirrors are commonly made of a plate of transparent glass, with a thin reflective layer on the back. However, the plain design of current mirrors do not incorporate special effects.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, there is a long-felt need for a mirror that provides a reflection but also special effects in the form of floating particles within an inner chamber comprising a liquid.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to aspects illustrated herein, there is provided a rotating mirror assembly, comprising a mirror including a front surface and a rear surface, a front cover engaged with the front surface, a fluidly sealed cavity formed between the front cover and the mirror, a rim operatively arranged to clamp the mirror and the front cover together, and a wall bracket comprising an aperture, the mirror arranged to rotatably engage the aperture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the rotating mirror assembly further comprises a seal arranged between the front surface and the cover.

In some embodiments, the seal is arranged between the lip and the front surface. In some embodiments, the rim comprises a crimped C-channel rim. In some embodiments, the mirror further comprises a through-bore extending to the cavity, the through-bore operatively arranged to allow the cavity to be filled with fluid. In some embodiments, the rotating mirror assembly further comprises a plug operatively arranged to engage the through-bore to fluidly seal the fluid within the cavity. In some embodiments, the rotating mirror assembly further comprises fluid arranged in the cavity. In some embodiments, the rotating mirror assembly further comprises a plurality of particles arranged in the fluid. In some embodiments, the aperture is key-hole shaped.

Furthermore, as used herein, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; is intended to mean a grammatical conjunction used to indicate that one or more of the elements or conditions recited may be included or occur. For example, a device comprising a first element, a second element and/or a third element, is intended to be construed as any one of the following structural arrangements: a device comprising a first element; a device comprising a second element; a device comprising a third element; a device comprising a first element and a second element; a device comprising a first element and a third element; a device comprising a first element, a second element and a third element; or, a device comprising a second element and a third element.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Moreover, as used herein, the phrases &#x201c;comprises at least one of&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising at least one of&#x201d; in combination with a system or element is intended to mean that the system or element includes one or more of the elements listed after the phrase. For example, a device comprising at least one of: a first element; a second element; and, a third element, is intended to be construed as any one of the following structural arrangements: a device comprising a first element; a device comprising a second element; a device comprising a third element; a device comprising a first element and a second element; a device comprising a first element and a third element; a device comprising a first element, a second element and a third element; or, a device comprising a second element and a third element. A similar interpretation is intended when the phrase &#x201c;used in at least one of:&#x201d; is used herein. Furthermore, as used herein, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; is intended to mean a grammatical conjunction used to indicate that one or more of the elements or conditions recited may be included or occur. For example, a device comprising a first element, a second element and/or a third element, is intended to be construed as any one of the following structural arrangements: a device comprising a first element; a device comprising a second element; a device comprising a third element; a device comprising a first element and a second element; a device comprising a first element and a third element; a device comprising a first element, a second element and a third element; or, a device comprising a second element and a third element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By &#x201c;non-rotatably connected&#x201d; elements, it is meant that: the elements are connected so that whenever one of the elements rotate, all the elements rotate; and, relative rotation between the elements is not possible.

Cavity <b>80</b> is formed between front cover <b>10</b>, mirror <b>30</b>, and C-channel rim <b>20</b> and is sealed to hold liquid <b>400</b> therein. Front cover <b>10</b> comprises meniscus portion <b>14</b>, meniscus portion edge <b>16</b>, and lip <b>18</b>. Meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> is operatively arranged to engage front surface <b>34</b> of mirror <b>30</b>. Meniscus portion <b>14</b> extends from meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> in a radially inward direction and away from mirror <b>30</b>. Lip <b>18</b> extends from meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> in a radially outward direction and away from mirror <b>30</b>. Lip <b>18</b> is arranged to contact an inner surface of C-channel rim <b>20</b>. Seal <b>70</b> is arranged axially between front surface <b>34</b> and lip <b>18</b>. C-channel rim <b>20</b> is arranged to clamp rear surface <b>31</b> of mirror <b>30</b>, seal <b>70</b>, and the front surface of lip <b>18</b> together. In some embodiments, seal <b>70</b> comprises silicone or silicone gel. Seal <b>70</b> is arranged about the entire inner surface of lip <b>18</b> and arranged circularly about the entire outer edge of front surface <b>34</b> of mirror <b>30</b>. Seal <b>70</b> acts as a secondary seal between front cover <b>10</b> and mirror <b>30</b>, with the primary seal being formed by the engagement of meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> and front surface <b>34</b>. The abutment of meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> and front surface <b>34</b> also serves as a stop to prevent seal <b>70</b> from entering cavity <b>80</b>. It should be appreciated that meniscus portion edge <b>16</b> is an outer surface of front cover <b>10</b> and is the contacting surface that engages front surface <b>34</b> of mirror <b>30</b> when C-channel rim <b>20</b> is engaged to front cover <b>10</b> and mirror <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, to assemble mirror assembly <b>100</b>, rear surface <b>31</b> of mirror <b>30</b> is placed on top of a first flange of C-channel rim <b>20</b> with the second flange of C-channel rim <b>20</b> being generally perpendicular to the first flange (i.e., uncrimped). Then seal <b>70</b> is arranged on top of front surface <b>34</b> and front cover <b>10</b> is arranged on top of front surface <b>34</b> and seal <b>70</b>.
