id="p-0001" num="0000">Potential impending disaster information is received for a potential impending disaster including an event impact value for an extent of the potential impending disaster, a response value for a relief effort for the potential impending disaster, and a donation impact value for effectiveness of the response value. A detection is made, using an artificial intelligence engine, of the response value, of the donation impact value, and of at least one redirection trigger from the potential impending disaster information. Upon the detection of the at least one redirection trigger, a redirection mode is configured. Data is received for a transaction between a customer and a merchant. A determination is made from information from the transaction of a donation amount and a location associated with the transaction. When configured to operate in the redirection mode, generating signals to cause accrual of: at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction, and any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters. After the donation amount and the location associated with the transaction are determined, data fields derived from the transaction are received that include: first data for the transaction defined using a first merchant account, and second, different data for the same transaction defined using a second merchant account. Information is transmitted to facilitate a donation of the donation amount to a charity.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

The card issuer is generally a financial institution, a financial institution in association with a credit card company, or another entity that has a financial institution arm. &#x201c;Financial cards&#x201d; may generally refer to credit cards, debit cards, INTERACT&#x2032;&#x2033; cards, stored value cards, and so on.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">&#x201c;Cardholders&#x201d; may refer to the individuals or businesses to whom the financial cards are issued. &#x201c;Loyalty&#x201d; may be used in the broad sense to also extend to &#x201c;rewards&#x201d;; therefore a &#x201c;loyalty program&#x201d; may also extend to a &#x201c;reward program&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Customer acquisition systems may play an increasingly important role for business. Customer loyalty programs can contribute to the loyalty of existing customers, but also can play a role in acquiring new customers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The businesses of the various card issuers may vary significantly. Financial cards are generally issued by or issued in cooperation with financial institutions. For example: (1) financial institutions (including a financial institution associated with a source of benefits) issue financial cards directly to customers; and (2) a co-branded financial card including for example the brand of the financial institution and the brand of a source of benefits.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Financial institutions are often interested in partnering with other entities, such as sources of benefits, to make the benefits associated with their financial card competitive. This may be in order to retain and attract their customers, but also in order to compete for transaction share as cardholders generally carry more than one financial card in their wallet. Transaction share in turn affects the revenue realized by the financial institution. Accordingly, financial institutions tend to measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts in connection with financial cards by analyzing incremental transactions involving their financial card.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, financial institutions are generally interested in sharing profit/risk with other parties in connection with their financial card related activities. This is evidenced in the popularity of co-branded cards. Generally speaking, however, card issuers are only interested in providing access to their customer base to outside parties if there is significant financial reward, and if this access does not conflict with their own interests and/or present any risk to the customer base.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Merchants provide benefits to their customers for reasons that are not dissimilar to the factors that motivate financial institutions. Merchants are interested in attracting and maintaining customers. The cost of acquisition of a new customer for many merchants is quite high. While merchants are interested in acquiring new customers efficiently, they are often also willing to provide relatively significant benefits in exchange for a new customer relationship from an outside source.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Merchants and financial institutions often collaborate in the context of co-branded financial cards. Examples include airline/credit cards, oil company financial cards, or retail chain financial cards. From a merchant perspective, these collaborative arrangements are generally available to large national chains and are not generally available to regional chains or small businesses, even though from a customer acquisition or benefits perspective such regional chains or small businesses might be of interest to a financial institution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The costs associated with deploying and marketing a co-branded card requires economies of scale that effectively exclude many regional or small business co-branded financial card arrangements. From the perspective of a financial institution, the benefits associated with the co-branded financial cards are generally limited to the type of benefits made available by a merchant or a relatively small group of associated partners. This exposes the financial institution to competition to other co-branded financial cards, especially if the merchant associated with the competing card is more popular or makes better benefits available. Also, relationships with merchants become difficult or cumbersome to replace (especially over time) thereby resulting in loss of bargaining power in the hands of the financial institution and thereby possible erosion of benefits. This contributes risk to the financial institution's card issuing operation, and also generally results in financial institutions entering into multiple co-branding relationships, which in turn adds to the associated costs.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Known loyalty programs may lack flexibility in the manner in which transactions triggering the accrual of benefits to cardholders must occur. The benefit that a merchant participating in a loyalty program is willing to provide will depend on a particular merchant and their business objectives at a particular time, and in some cases on the special demographic attributes of the cardholders, or a particular subset of cardholders. Known systems may not enable merchants to suitably reflect these changing objectives in the manner in which benefits are accrued to cardholders in connection with financial transactions. By way of example, there is a need for systems and methods to analyze data to detect trends indicative of a potential impending disaster, where those systems and methods include customers conducting transactions with merchants incented by obligatory merchant-defined donations, and where those systems and methods include automatic redirection of the obligatory merchant-defined donations, upon detection of the trends indicative of the potential impending disaster, to an entity that will take preventative measures to prevent the occurrence of the potential impending disaster.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system for changing operation modes for a loyalty program. The system includes: at least one memory; and at least one processor. The at least one processor is configured to: receive potential impending disaster information for a potential impending disaster including a plurality of scores each being selected from the group consisting of (i) an event impact value representing a relative metric for an extent of the potential impending disaster; (ii) a response value representing a currency amount to remedy or for a relief effort for the potential impending disaster; and (iii) a donation impact value representing a metric for effectiveness of the response value. The at least one processor is further configured to detect at least one redirection trigger from the potential impending disaster information, where the detection makes use of at least one of a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, machine learning, predictive analytics, and prediction modeling to analyze the impact value, the response value, and the donation impact value. Upon the detection of the at least one redirection trigger, the at least one processor is further configured to configure operation of a redirection mode, receive or access data associated with a transaction between a customer and a merchant, and determine from at least one of customer information and merchant information in the data associated with the transaction, a donation amount and a location associated with the transaction. When configured to operate in the redirection mode, the at least one processor is further configured to generate signals to cause accrual of: (i) at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; and (ii) any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters. The at least one processor is further optionally configured to transmit a message to a logical address associated with the customer indicating that the system is operating in the redirection mode. In accordance with an optional feature of the one aspect of the present disclosure, a blockchain implementation is used to track a merchant-defined donation event to a preventative measure event. To do so, after the donation amount and the location associated with the transaction are determined, the at least one processor is further configured to receive data fields derived from the transaction that include: (i) first data for the transaction defined using a first merchant account; and (ii) second, different data for the same transaction defined using a second merchant account. The at least one processor is further configured to create a first block from the first data for the transaction defined using the first merchant account, add the first block to a first blockchain that uses the first merchant account to track transactions, create a second block from the second data for the transaction defined using the second merchant account without including the first data for the transaction defined using the first merchant account, add the second block to a second, separate blockchain that uses the second merchant account to track transactions, wherein the first and second blockchains each track different transaction data fields, and validate the transaction between the merchant and the customer by: (i) receiving a Globally Unique IDentifer (GUID) for the transaction; (ii) using the GUID to identify indices in the first and second blockchains; (ii) retrieving encrypted blocks from the first and second blockchains of the identified indices; (iv) verifying a hash associated with the encrypted blocks; and (v) decrypting at least one of the encrypted blocks using a private key.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements or steps. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments generally described herein.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The extent to which merchants are willing to provide benefits, incentives, and rewards to cardholders in the context of a loyalty program is enhanced if means are provided to enable merchants to verify the commercial benefit derived by the merchants, and means are provided to tailor the benefits to particular cardholders based on cardholder preferences, spending habits, and the like. Benefits to cardholders may be increased, with resulting benefits to card issuers, if the merchants are given in accordance with embodiments described herein the tools to measure and monitor the effectiveness and incremental cost of their activities involving benefits to cardholders. There is a need for a method, system and computer program that enable merchants to monitor and verify the commercial benefit that they are deriving from benefits being provided to cardholders who are members of the loyalty program, thereby encouraging the merchants to increase the level of benefits that they provide.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the present disclosure refers to cardholders and card issuers, it should be understood that in some embodiments, aspects of the present disclosure can be applied when there are no actual cards. For example, in mobile device payment mechanisms may utilize physical or soft tokens which link or identity a &#x201c;cardholder&#x201d; with an account or profile at a &#x201c;card issuer&#x201d; without the actual use of a physical card. Similarly, online or telephone payments may be processed using MasterCard's MasterPass&#x2122;, Paypal&#x2122;, Google Wallet&#x2122; or any other online payment system can handle transactions involving a &#x201c;cardholder&#x201d; without the use of a card.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Description of Incentive Redirection Implementations</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Systems and methods described herein may recommend incentives for merchants based on data mining and analysis of cardholder or member data collected by card issuers, for example. Systems and methods described herein may provide incentive performance indicators for merchants to help prevent a potential impending disaster by making merchant-defined donations to entities and/or efforts that will alter or change a trend towards the potential impending disaster. Both merchants and their customers have particular interests in trends that point to or otherwise indicate an impending potential disaster. As disclosed herein, the merchants provide incentives to their customers to conduct transactions with them in return for the merchant making a donation to an entity and/or effort that will alter or change a trend towards the potential impending disaster. To assist in identifying a trend towards the potential impending disaster, implementations make use of neural networks for artificial intelligence engines, machine learning, predictive analytics, and/or prediction modeling to analyze historical and real-time data in order to identify trends and potential concerns in an identified community while providing recommended initiatives to remedy those concerns. This enables various actions, each of which involve customers transacting with merchants who make donations to a fund that takes preventative measures to prevent the potential impending disaster before the potential impending disaster actually occurs. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, data analysis performed upon viral immunology reports from healthcare providers, which analysis may be performed by neural network artificial intelligence engines, machine learning, predictive analytics, and/or prediction modeling, may identify trends and potential concerns as to an identified community in one or more designated geographic regions, which trends and potential concerns may provide an indication of a potential impending viral outbreak epidemic and/or a potential impending viral pandemic. Upon the analytical detection of such indications of the identified trends and potential concerns, a redirection configuration of the incentives disclosed herein may be instigated. The incentives redirection configuration will be such that customers, wishing to prevent the actual occurrence of the outbreak epidemic and/or pandemic, are incented to conduct transactions with merchants to thereby trigger redirection of obligatory merchant-defined donations towards funds, foundations, and entities that will take preventative measures to prevent the actual occurrence of the epidemic or pandemic. These preventative measures may include, but are not limited to, the manufacture, purchase, and distribution of: (i) non-valved, multi-layer cloth masks, to prevent virus transmission; (ii) antiviral drugs for treating viral infections; (iii) respiratory ventilators for respiratory therapy hospitals; (iv) temporary hospitals to provide emergency medical care; (v) viral testing equipment to find infection-causing viruses; (vi) antiviral vaccination experimentation, discovery, distribution, and related supplies; (vii) plexiglass barriers; (viii) antiviral hand sanitation liquids; (ix) antiviral gloves; (x) quarantine accommodations; (xi) telemedicine and telepharmacy installations and related equipment; (xii) public service media announcements, and (xiii) etc.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Systems and methods described herein may provide systems and methods for providing alerts for a loyalty program provided by a loyalty system. The method may involve receiving (via a computer hardware input interface) transaction data comprising one or more cardholder attributes from cardholder data collected by one or more card issuers, identifying a merchant, identifying (via an alert engine provided by a persistent store) one or more events or trends by applying rules to the transaction data, and generating an alert notification for the merchant based on the one or more events or trends.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The cardholder attributes may include demographics, and the trends may be based on the demographics. The trend triggering the alert may relate to a slow period for the merchant (e.g. a time of day, a day of week), a gap in demographics for the merchant, a high spending threshold, a high number of visits threshold, and so on.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The alert may include a recommended incentive linked to the trend or event.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Systems and methods of embodiments described herein may enable creation or generation of incentives for a loyalty program provided by a loyalty system, wherein the loyalty program provides the incentives to cardholders (e.g. customers, members) in connection with transactions between the cardholders and one or more merchants associated with the loyalty system.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Systems and methods described herein may provide a merchant interface for management of incentive programs, for review of incentive performance indicators, and for managing alerts based on trends and events. Systems and methods described herein may provide dynamic and iterative incentive planning tools and workflows to obtain decision support in building incentives, such as recommendations of incentives, alerts, target cardholders, and the associated transactions. Systems and methods described herein may enable monitoring of the impact of incentives, in order to calibrate incentive attributes. Systems and methods described herein may provide incentive segmenting criteria and allows the user to modify the criteria and immediately and see a refresh of the various components of the &#x201c;impact&#x201d; display segments.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Systems and methods described herein may provide effective incentive performance discovery. Systems and methods described herein may identify incentive performance indicators, enable selection of attributes to filter the incentive performance indicators, switch the views of the incentive performance indicators based on the selection to discover trends in performance. The discovered trends may enable a merchant to modify incentive attributes and receive recommendations. The trends may trigger generation of alert notifications for merchants.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Systems and methods described herein may dynamically update data related to incentive performance in real time.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Systems and methods described herein may recommend incentives for merchants using a recommendation engine to assist a merchant in designing and offering incentives. A merchant may specify a &#x201c;reward objective&#x201d; and recommendations may be tailored based on the objective. The recommendations may also be based on data regarding different merchants, the number of customers that they have, average spend, purchasing history, demographics, and the like. An analytics engine may compare the merchant profile to performance of a particular type of incentive, consider geographic and demographic trends and so on. The recommendation engine may make more granular incentive recommendations on this basis.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A recommendation engine may generate reward recommendations based on data relating to merchants. For example, the recommendation engine may suggest the most relevant/effective rewards for a business or customer based on sales patterns, historical reward performance/redemptions, cardholder demographics/interests, and so on.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Systems and methods described herein may suggest a relevant incentive objective, and based on the objective may suggest or recommend a particular segment of customers or cardholders to target. Optionally further suggestions for particular incentive attributes for targeting that segment based on performance of that attribute may be provided. Systems and methods described herein may consider interests of the targeted segment in that attribute (e.g. an interest profile may be determined up front and/or through customer feedback through the platform).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Systems and methods described herein may match redemptions to incentives. This may reduce the overhead associated with the platform.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">A recommendation engine may also generate alert. Each alert may be associated with a trigger defining a business rule or threshold that identifies events and trends in the marketplace. A recommendation engine may mine the system data to determine whether a trigger is met to generate the associated alert. The business rules and thresholds for alert triggers may be default values or may be user configurable. In some embodiments, alerts may be generated by an alert engine separate from the recommendation engine.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Alerts generated by the recommendation engine may be specific to the merchant's particular context. In some cases, use of collected data may be restricted, such as between competitors in the same geographic area. The recommendation engine can gather these cardholder insights or attributes in one geographic area and allow them to be used in another geographic area.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Systems and methods described herein may enable discovery of relationships between revenue, transactions, merchant, and cardholders. These relationships may be referred to collectively as trends.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Systems and methods described herein may provide an interface for cardholders to manage their incentives, preferences, and attributes. Systems and methods described herein may provide a cardholder interface displaying functional tiles representing incentives in various combinations. There may be dynamic variance of tile size based on different dimensions of incentive relevance to the particular cardholder. Systems and methods described herein may perform a balancing between wanting to show relevant offers, and also offering the chance to cardholders to see new incentives that they may not have selected before so they can expand their understanding of what they consider to be of interest to them. The selections may result in an update to the interest profile for the cardholder. Previously redeemed incentives may also be displayed. This may serve as a reminder to the cardholder and may be engaging as this information demonstrates the relevance of the platform to the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Systems and methods described herein may provide donations as an incentive or as part of incentive to an organization selected by the cardholder, merchant, card issuer, and the like. The pooled results of multiple incentives may provide community donations or &#x201c;social network fundraising&#x201d;. The tile interface may be updated in real time and may track where members of a cardholders social network are transacting, the types of incentives they are receiving, and, optionally, the community donation impact that results. This may provide strong motivation to other members of the same group to mimic the behavior of members of their social network. The tile interface may update in real-time to display the impact of a group, including based on different selected time periods.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Systems and methods described herein may include a semantic layer that analyzes feedback/comments received from cardholders automatically, and uses this information to automatically update recommendation engine functions and incentive performance information. A cascading interest analysis may be used to obtain active feedback by generating a list of related interests for selection by the cardholder. Systems and methods described herein may automatically update the incentive interest profile for the cardholder based on the selected interests. A semantic engine may be used to generate related interest labels.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The framework for an example loyalty system will now be described. A loyalty program may be linked to one or more card issuers, where financial and/or loyalty cards are provided to members of the loyalty program, referred to as cardholders. The loyalty card may refer to a physical card with an electronic device thereon, an electronic account associated with a member, and the like. The loyalty system is operable to enable the creation, implementation and management of one or more loyalty programs that provide benefits to members of the loyalty programs (e.g. cardholders) in connection with transactions between the members and one or more merchants associated with the loyalty system. One or more card issuers may register on the loyalty system. The operator of the loyalty system, the one or more card issuers, and the merchants may establish the rules for accrual and processing of benefits or incentives from the merchants to cardholders associated with the one or more card issuers in connection with transactions between the cardholders and the merchants with the loyalty system. One or more merchant acquirers register on the loyalty system associated with the one or more card issuers. Cardholders are registered as members of the loyalty program. Incentives may be defined by rules to accrue and process the benefits of cardholders in connection with the transactions between the cardholders and the merchants by operation of the loyalty system.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The loyalty system may increase transactions for the merchant by way of incentives, and may enable card issuers and merchants to share the risk and costs associated with directing loyalty programs to cardholders. The loyalty system may connect to systems associated with the card issuers and one or more associated merchant acquirers. On this basis, merchants may direct the loyalty programs or aspects thereof to specific cardholders based on BIN ranges, and based on geographic, transaction histories, demographics, and/or time based parameters.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">A loyalty program may be linked to one or more card issuers, and thereby to their cardholders, by operation of a loyalty program platform or loyalty engine or loyalty system. Merchants associated with the loyalty system are provided with tools to customize one or more loyalty programs made available to cardholders or members of the loyalty program platform (customers and potential customers of the merchants).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The operator of the loyalty program platform may establish the rules regarding the accrual of benefits from merchants to the card issuers and/or cardholders, and establish a contractual relationship with the one or more card issuers, such contracts incorporating the rules applicable within the loyalty system in connection with the card issuers (as well as their cardholders). These rules include, for example, the term of the agreement, accrual periods, geographic area of operation (if applicable) and most importantly the particulars of the benefits or incentives (including per transaction benefits, convertibility of benefits, accrual periods, timing of obligation regarding realization of benefits etc.) accrued to cardholders and/or card issuers. These rules may be reinforced in the arrangements entered into between the operator of the loyalty system and the various merchants so as to define the terms under which benefits will be made available to cardholders and/or card issuers.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The operator of the loyalty system may establish independently the rules under which the merchant shall accrue benefits for cardholders and/or card issuers, generally independently of card issuer but in conformity with the arrangements entered between the operator of the loyalty system and the card issuer. The operator of the loyalty system may manage the aforesaid relationships, and provide access to a technology infrastructure that enables card issuers and merchants to focus on using the tools of the loyalty system to enhance their business, rather than spending extensive resources on administrative issues.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Typically, the merchants may agree to conform to commitments that they make to members that are displayed in a benefits area of a website associated with the members who are cardholders, and linked to the loyalty system. These commitments are generally made by merchants in connection with the customization of their loyalty programs by operation of the loyalty engine.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The merchant acquirer registers on the loyalty system, if the merchant acquirer is not already registered. The cardholders are registered as members on the loyalty system. This occurs in part as a result of promotion of the loyalty system to the cardholders by the card issuer, or by the merchant. In addition to the card issuer, in most cases there is also a &#x201c;merchant acquirer&#x201d;, who is an entity that contracts with a merchant to process financial card transaction information, and that may receive unique data not received by the card issuer.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The loyalty system applies the aforementioned rules as they apply to each cardholder who is a member so as to process the applicable benefits or incentives based on applicable transactions entered into by the cardholder that are linked to the loyalty system, i.e. a qualifying transaction between a cardholder and a merchant, as determined by the aforesaid rules for the incentives. By application of such rules, the loyalty system processes the agreed to benefits for the cardholder and/or the card issuer. The processed incentive may be referred to as redemption.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some loyalty programs, merchants may be required to pay a set monthly or periodic fee to participate in or otherwise be associated with the loyalty program. While loyalty programs may offer benefits such as improved customer loyalty/retention, increase in customer spending/number of transactions/traffic, data associated with customers and their shopping habits, etc., the extent to which a loyalty program will provide these benefits a merchant (if at all) are generally unknown or unpredictable with any degree or reliability. Therefore, merchants may be hesitant or unwilling to invest in or pay for establishing or joining a membership based on periodic or upfront costs.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some examples, system(s) associated with the loyalty program and transaction processing may be linked, combined, or otherwise interact so that payment for membership in or services provided by the loyalty program can be accrued on a transaction by transaction basis. In this manner, merchants may only incur a cost for participation in a loyalty program when a transaction is actually conducted. Loyalty programs utilizing this system may choose to forgo monthly or periodic membership fees for merchant. In some examples, this may reduce risk or uncertainty for merchants by only charging loyalty program fees when customer transactions (i.e. purchases) actually occur.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a loyalty system <b>26</b> interconnected with a card issuer system <b>38</b> and a merchant system <b>40</b> by way of a communication network <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As depicted, loyalty system <b>26</b> is implemented using a computing device and one or more data storage devices <b>33</b> configured with database(s) or file system(s), or using multiple computing devices or groups of computing devices distributed over a wide geographic area and connected via a network (e.g., network <b>10</b>).

The merchant system <b>40</b> may design and implement loyalty programs and incentives using merchant interface <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some examples, merchant access to the different tools, analytics and other features may be associated with different loyalty program membership costs. In some examples, these features may be bundled or grouped into different membership levels. Irrespective of the membership structure, in some examples, merchant access to different features may trigger different incremental transaction fees based on the accessible features or the degree of loyalty program membership.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may be operable with any financial card or mobile payment device that permits tracking of transaction information through card processing systems. Financial cards such as credit cards, debit cards, INTERACT&#x2032;&#x2033; cards, stored value cards, or mobile payment device (collectively referred to as &#x201c;financial cards&#x201d; for convenience) may be designated by a BIN number range.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The BIN range identifies the financial card type and the issuing financial institution (e.g. card issuers). Card issuers typically market card types to certain segments of the population based upon demographic data such as credit scores, income, age, location, and anticipated card use. Consequently, the BIN range may also represent a market or demographic segment of cardholders. For example, co-branded business travel cards may be marketed towards persons and organizations that typically utilize the specialized features of a travel card, such as points for travel and/or specialized services (e.g. travel insurance, lost baggage coverage) to facilitate needs and wants of persons who travel regularly. Another card, such as a TOYS R us&#x2122; card, for example, may be provided to young families. Each financial card therefore may be used to target particular consumer needs.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The unique BIN range associated with each financial card may enable the use of a particular financial card to be identified within the loyalty system <b>26</b> (below). This in turn enables merchants to target particular groups of members based on demographic data extrapolated from the financial card that they are using (by operation of the BIN range associated with their card), or more particularly demographic data associated with a sub-set of cardholders using a particular financial card, possibly as communicated by the card issuer. As will be described herein, loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend incentives tailored to segments of customers, where the recommendation may be based on BIN range and other attributes of customers, such as spending habits, interests, needs, wants, preferred or associated charities, social habits, etc.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend incentives based on the particular financial card(s) held by a customer, including, e.g., available credit for the card(s), and transaction costs of the card(s). For example, loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend incentives based on the BIN range of the financial card(s), as detailed below.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Embodiment described herein may utilize the BIN range of co-branded cards to develop additional transactions and associated incentives to selected groups of card holders and promote the use of certain financial cards for the transactions for the benefit of: cardholders, merchants, financial card issuers and merchant acquirers.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In accordance with the embodiments described herein, a card issuer system <b>38</b> and thereby one or more of its cardholders, are linked to the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The loyalty programs provided by this loyalty system <b>26</b> may run in parallel with other loyalty and rewards programs. In accordance with embodiments described herein, costs of implementation may be very low for card issuer system <b>38</b> as it may interface with loyalty system <b>26</b> to access loyalty engine <b>30</b>, etc. The loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable, via network <b>10</b> for example, to engage in real time data communications with a card issuer system <b>38</b> and/or a merchant system <b>40</b>. Accordingly, seamless data flows between these systems can be established in order to enable the capture of financial transactions data reflective completed transaction, and cardholder data, and to also enable the accrual of benefits or incentives based on data provided to the loyalty system <b>26</b> by each of the card issuer system <b>38</b> and the merchant acquirer system <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">For example, transaction data and cardholder data may be transmitted to loyalty system <b>26</b> from one or other of card issuer system <b>38</b> or merchant acquirer system <b>40</b> by way of secured transmission channels established in network <b>10</b>. Such secured transmission channels may be established using conventional transmission protocols such as SFTP, HTTPS, or the like, which may implement conventional encryption techniques. Data may be transferred in a variety of formats, including for example, comma-delimited text (CSV) files, SQL data files, JSON data files, or the like.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Transaction data and cardholder data may be transmitted to loyalty system <b>26</b> from time to time, e.g., as new transactions are conducted or as new cards are issued. Data may be transmitted accordingly to a predetermined schedule, e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc. Data may also be transmitted whenever a set of data reaches a pre-determined size, e.g., whenever a certain number of new transactions have been conducted.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Table I below provides a summary of an example data format of the transaction data received by loyalty system <b>26</b>, in accordance with one example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example Transaction Data Format</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Data Field</entry><entry>Contents</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>CardholderID</entry><entry>Identifier unique to the cardholder</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>conducting the transaction (assigned</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>by card issuer)</entry></row><row><entry>CardNumber</entry><entry>Card number, or a subset of the card</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>number digits</entry></row><row><entry>TransactioniD</entry><entry>Identifier unique to the transaction</entry></row><row><entry>MerchantiD</entry><entry>Identifier unique to the merchant</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>conducting the transaction</entry></row><row><entry>CardType</entry><entry>Identifier unique to the type of card</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>used for the transaction (e.g., credit,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>debit)</entry></row><row><entry>AuthenticationTimeDate</entry><entry>Time and date the transaction was</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>authenticated</entry></row><row><entry>TransactionTimeDate</entry><entry>Time and date the transaction was</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>initiated</entry></row><row><entry>CurrencyiD</entry><entry>Identifier unique to the currency of the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>transaction</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">Table II below provides a summary of an example data format of the cardholder data received by loyalty system <b>26</b>, in accordance with one example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE II</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example Cardholder Data Format </entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="175pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Data Field </entry><entry>Contents</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>CardholderID </entry><entry>Identifier unique to the cardholder (assigned by card issuer) </entry></row><row><entry>CardNumber </entry><entry>Card number, or a subset of the card number digits </entry></row><row><entry>Name </entry><entry>Cardholder's name </entry></row><row><entry>DOB </entry><entry>Cardholder's date of birth </entry></row><row><entry>Gender </entry><entry>Cardholder's gender </entry></row><row><entry>CardStatus </entry><entry>Status of cardholder's card (active or inactive) </entry></row><row><entry>Address </entry><entry>Cardholder's address</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">Once transaction data and cardholder data have been received, the loyal system <b>26</b> processes the data to identify new transactions and new cardholders, based on the TransactioniD and the CardholderiD, respectively. Data corresponding to new transactions and new cardholders are then stored as new data records in database <b>32</b>. Database <b>32</b> may also be updated to reflect any changes in information for cardholders such as, for example, changes in contact details.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150">Loyalty system <b>26</b> is not only a loyalty system used by merchants but also becomes a secondary loyalty system for the card issuer for its cardholders. Loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to provide system tools for the card issuer to receive payments from the merchants in connection with transactions between the merchants and the cardholders of the card issuer who are registered with the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The card issuer may receive payment from the merchants indirectly through interchange fees collected by a merchant acquirer from the merchants at the time a transaction is processed on a financial card. In this particular embodiment the card issuer can receive payments and/or points from loyalty system merchants for transactions made by cardholders.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">The card issuer may propose to encourage a specific demographic (as defined by a BIN range) to join the loyalty program by tailoring benefits and incentives to the specific segment of cardholders. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend incentives based on attributes of the segment of cardholders. The merchants in the loyalty system <b>26</b> may agree to provide additional payments to the card issuer in the form of points or cash for transactions between merchants and cardholders of a selected BIN range (e.g. targeted segment) that have registered their financial card with the loyalty system <b>26</b> or opted in to the applicable loyalty program. By operation of the loyalty system <b>26</b>, merchants may have the ability to vary the amount or the percentage of the transaction accrued and paid to the card issuer, or some other aspect of the benefit provided. The payment may be in the form of cash or redeemable points. The loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to calculate the amount accrued to be paid to the card issuer for each cardholder who is a member by each merchant. The reporting facility provides visibility to the card issuer and the merchant in regard to the amounts accrued and subsequently paid at the end of the measurement period.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">The amounts transferred to the card issuer may be re-distributed by the card issuer to the cardholders in the form of extra points for transactions completed or the card issuer may retain a percentage of the amount transferred, for example, as an administration fee. In other words, the amounts transferred can then be accrued and distributed in accordance with the card issuers own rules therefor.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">In some circumstances the card issuer and the merchants of the loyalty system <b>26</b> may choose to offer special offers/prizes (e.g. incentives) through the merchants and the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The card issue or merchant, through the loyalty system <b>26</b>, may configure the conditions under which this occurs. Typically, the incentives are associated with conditional transactions with merchants (e.g. the purchase of a particular good or service is required in order to receive the special offer or prize). This encourages cardholders to conduct transactions with merchants. When a registered cardholder enters into such a transaction with a merchant in connection with the loyalty system <b>26</b>, an amount owed by the card issuer to the merchant is recorded. At the end of the reporting period the system aggregates the amounts owed to merchants by the card issuer and settlement is made and then reimbursement funds are distributed to the respective merchants.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may result in more transactions on the particular registered financial card of the card issuer, more individuals/businesses owning and using a financial card with a particular BIN range(s) and distribution of the cost of incentives provided to the customer by the card issuer and the merchant within the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The amounts owed the merchants or to cardholder/card issuer are tracked within the loyalty system <b>26</b> for the accounting period. Further, loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend incentives particularly tailored to targeted segments of cardholders and potentially cardholders to further increase particular transactions. The recommended incentives and associated transactions are likely to be of interest to the targeted segment based on data mining and correlations of cardholder (and potential customer and cardholder) attributes.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0155">The end result may be the accrual of benefits and incentives to the benefits account <b>34</b>, which is then disbursed on a periodic basis to the applicable card issuers.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0156">The operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> may enter into a contract with a financial institution that has a plurality of co-branded cards and seek new customer base potential through the financial institution's co-branded card partners that have an interest in increasing transactions on their co-branded card by attracting merchants. In this case, it may be a business limitation that products and services associated with the loyalty program for the most part will not compete with the co-branded partners business, i.e. that the businesses involved be complementary. The financial institution contacts and motivates its customer base (cardholders) to join the loyalty program and thereby provide the loyalty system <b>26</b> with a stream of new members. As stated earlier, the members joining the loyalty system <b>26</b> through this referral source are associated with their co-branded card(s) within the loyalty system <b>26</b>, each co-branded card being identified by different BIN number ranges and thereby historical demographics, credit score ranges and preferences associated with the particular card. Cardholders may individually join the loyalty program and register their card.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">The loyalty system <b>26</b> may use the BIN number range and any associated demographic and credit score, along with geography and any customer preferences (e.g. cardholder attributes) to recommend special offers for loyalty programs of merchants to the individual cardholders (for example: unique product/service offerings to specifically tailored to customers). The loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable when a member with a co-branded card that is within a suitable BIN number range enters into a transaction with a merchant to record the applicable transaction information as cardholder attributes, aggregate the transaction information, and supply measured results to both the merchant and the card issuer.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">Typically there is comity of interest between the merchants and the card issuers, in that merchants will be willing to provide the greatest incentives to the cardholders that the card issuers are most interested in providing incentives to. Accordingly, from a card issuer perspective, loyalty system <b>26</b> provides an efficient mechanism for maximizing benefits being provided to their preferred customers by having them register with a loyalty program where merchants, in the interest of promoting their own products/services, will automatically provide optimal benefits to these preferred customers.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">For example, a new member, joining through a co-branded card reference, transacts with the registered financial card, and in the embodiment where the merchant and/or the co-branded issuer supply the additional benefit (which, typically being supplied through the normal co-branded card channels, consists of points, discounts or cash back). The amount paid by the merchant is usually based upon on one or more of the following: (1) the amount of the transaction; (2) the value of the transaction; and/or (3) the value of the transaction less an amount that was set as a pre-condition.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">The card issuers may benefit financially from the transactions involving their financial cards in numerous ways: (1) cardholders carrying credit card balances; (2) maintaining customers using the incentives and selling other products/services to such customers; (3) acquiring new customers for such products/services using incentives; (4) financial incentives provided to financial institutions in exchange for promotional access to their customers; (5) interchange fees associated with transactions involving the financial cards; (6) yearly card fees; (7) transaction fees charged to the cardholder (if applicable); (8) currency exchange fees; (9) fees payable to the card issuer by merchants (generally tied to BIN ranges); (10) augmentation of card issuers loyalty program (reduction of costs associated with card issuers loyalty program, i.e. replacement of card issuer paid benefits with merchant paid benefits; and (11) revenue from merchant acquirer for additional transactions involving the merchant and the merchant acquirer; (12) customer tailored incentives through recommendation engine.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">The merchant acquirer may receive the benefits of: (1) additional merchants who join their processing system to increase their access to a BIN range of cardholders; (2) additional revenue from merchants (participation fees); (3) increased revenue from additional merchant transactions; (4) ability to differentiate over other merchant acquirers based on the ability to provide access to the loyalty system. Merchant system <b>40</b> may also refer to a merchant acquirer system <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">Loyalty system <b>26</b> provides for a linkage of a data between the merchant systems <b>40</b> and card issuers systems <b>38</b>, and thereby their cardholders, facilitated through the loyalty system <b>26</b> technology that enables a card issuer to include its cardholders in a secondary loyalty system that supplements any card issuer point system. Although only one card issuer system <b>38</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for simplicity, there may be multiple card issuer systems <b>38</b> connected to loyalty system <b>26</b>. Although only one merchant system <b>40</b> (or merchant acquirer system <b>40</b>) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for simplicity, there may be multiple merchant systems <b>40</b> connected to loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0163">Loyalty and customer acquisition programs may be required to continually acquire new members, preferably at a low cost, e.g. through organic growth or through a partnership with various customer sources, including card issuers. Card issuer system <b>38</b> may retain cardholder databases of transaction information and other cardholder benefits, which may include data from other loyalty program operators and with participating merchants. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may access the cardholder databases to detect cardholder attributes in order to recommend incentives.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">In the card transaction process, the card issuer generally has access to the following transaction information: (1) cardholder name; (2) card number; (3) date of transaction; (4) merchant ID; (5) amount of purchase; and (6) BIN number. Other information may also be accessible such as demographic, geographic, and credit score information relating the cardholder. This information may be stored in cardholder databases and accessed by loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">Some financial institutions have both card issuing and merchant acquiring business lines and loyalty system <b>26</b> may enable the two lines to work together for common benefit. The merchant acquirers may have access to following additional information that may not be generally available to the card issuer: (1) the time of the transaction; (2) the terminal ID (within a merchant system); and (3) the fee rates charged the merchant based upon the financial card and how the financial card is used (e.g. internet transaction vs. verified signature). Loyalty system <b>26</b> may access this information (e.g. cardholder attributes) to recommend incentives.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">Loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to link the card issuer, the cardholder, the merchant acquirer and the merchants such that the loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to match time of day data (or other common variables) of a transaction with other information provided by the card issuer to the loyalty system <b>26</b>. This functionality allows merchants to offer time of day or otherwise tailored special offers (e.g. incentives) to specific cardholders who are members of the loyalty system.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0167">Loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to match the terminal ID information obtained from the merchant processor with the transaction information obtained from the card issuer. This allows a merchant and/or a card issuer to tailor benefits to specific geographic locations, and enables loyalty system <b>26</b> to recommend incentives for specific geographic locations and other cardholder attributes.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">Loyalty system <b>26</b> enables each of the merchants, members and card issuers to track the accrual of benefits by means of financial card transactions that in connection with the loyalty system <b>26</b> result in the accrual of loyalty benefits (e.g. incentives).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">Loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to store the data items mentioned above (and other similar data items) to database <b>32</b> and apply same against transactions between participating members and participating merchants. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may use the data items to recommend incentives and corresponding transactions. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may also use the data items to identify events or trends and to provide alert notifications of the identified events or trends to participating merchant.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The following provides an example transaction process. A cardholder who is a member transacts with a merchant using their financial card. The merchant transaction data is then usually settled by the merchant acquirer. The member transaction data (e.g. cardholder attributes) is then preferably transmitted to the loyalty system <b>26</b>. This member transaction data usually includes the data items described above. This data is then stored to database <b>32</b>. The rules defined for the cardholder within the loyalty system are then applied to the merchant transaction data to recommend incentives, or to identify event or trends, as detailed below.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">As stated earlier, an agreement is entered into between the card issuer and the operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> on behalf of the merchants. The agreement may extend to one or more accounting periods. The agreement generally establishes the expected relationship and flow of funds between the financial institution and the merchants based on anticipated transactions, as well as the additional incentives that will be provided to the cardholders for transactions linked to the loyalty system <b>26</b> and who will be the party covering the costs of such additional incentives and how. The agreement generally covers group of financial cards, identified by a BIN range. Also as stated earlier, cardholders are encouraged by the card issuer to join the loyalty program for additional cash rewards, points and/or special offers.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">Prior to the beginning of an accounting period, and after cardholders have registered their particular financial card with the loyalty system, the agreement between the cardholder and the loyalty system <b>26</b> may be implemented by the merchants who set the offers and incentives that will be made to cardholders of certain BIN ranges (these are examples of the merchant rules).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">When a cardholder transacts with one of merchants under the applicable loyalty program, the loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to review the benefits applicable to the BIN number and either <b>1</b>) accrue the points/cash discount (less the administration amount paid to the card issuer) to the cardholder from the transaction, by reflecting such accrual in the benefits account for the cardholder. The cardholder is notified of the award of points, and the card issuer is notified of the accrual set aside by the loyalty system <b>26</b> to be paid by the merchant at the end of the accounting period. These amounts are separate from the amounts paid to the card issuer through the interchange system, unless a special rate for the loyalty system <b>26</b> has been established and applied by the merchant acquirer.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">The loyalty system <b>26</b> accrues the points/special cash back awards for each cardholder and what is owed the card issuer by the merchant. Merchants generally pay cash or cash in lieu of points as a reward to the card issuer. Different incentives/rewards can apply to different BIN ranges by a single merchant or by a group of merchants.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">In summary, the merchant rules applicable for a specific accrual period are applied so as to update the benefit account <b>34</b> for the particular cardholder, for example. Generally speaking, the loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to, after an accrual period has come to an end, to verify the accrued amounts in the benefit accounts <b>34</b>. These can then be accessed and displayed by members or cardholders.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">After an accrual period is closed, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may then permit members to access the loyalty system <b>26</b> to engage in a number of transactions in connection with their accrued benefits such as redemption, conversion of fees to points etc.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">A particular process for conversion of fees to points will be described as an illustrative example with reference to the point conversion utility <b>54</b>. The point conversion utility <b>54</b> enables enhancement of a card issuer's existing loyalty programs based upon points or cash back cardholder benefits created by cardholder use in connection with a loyalty program and provided by incentives offered to cardholder. The point conversion utility <b>54</b> may allow the card issuer to reward their cardholders in the same format as under their existing cardholder program. These points and rewards are examples of incentives.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">For instance, some existing financial cards have points or cash reward systems or a combination of both to promote financial card use. The cardholder may accumulate points and cash rewards for later use. The loyalty system <b>26</b> allows for the card issuer to take all or a portion of existing fees developed from financial card use and apply them to cardholder points or cash. Alternatively, the loyalty system <b>26</b> could be utilized by card issuer to create an additional source of revenue from the merchant fees by not converting all of the collected fees and giving the benefit to the financial card holders.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">The fee and point information may be transferred to the card issuer at &#x201c;X&#x201d; days after the end of an accumulation period. The information is later integrated by existing financial card issuer software to consolidate the point and/or fees that are passed on to the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0180">The conversion from points to fees is accommodated by comparing the transaction data of identified cardholders against rule-sets created and maintained by the card issuer. The rule-sets may, for example, contain the following information regarding transaction data: 1. Transaction Amount 2. Transaction Date 3. Transaction Time 4. Merchant ID 5. Card Holder ID 6.

A system administrator of the operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> may access certain reports in connection with merchant activity in connection with particular BIN ranges. Similar processes and system implementations may be used to generate other reports of information accessible to card issuers, merchants, members or merchant acquirers. The loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to generate reports for card issuers to track the use and monitor the results of financial card use with identified merchants.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">For instance a card issuer may wish to view the status of conversion of points to fees. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may allow for a System Administrator to log in and generate reports regarding the amount of fees that have been converted to points to monitor the effectiveness of the applicable loyalty program.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0190">As an illustrative and non-limiting example, the System Administrator enters the following parameters for report generation on behalf of the card issuer: 1) Start Date 2) End Date 3) BIN Number 4) Financial Institution ID 5) Merchant ID 6) Transaction Time 7) Transaction Terminal ID 8) Report Type. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may return the data associated with the transaction(s) to monitor the points and fees collected and converted to allow the card issuer to view data regarding the status of the system.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">A card issuer may want to know which merchants are supporting a particular financial card to judge the effectiveness of the business relationship between the merchant and the cardholders. By examining the transaction information the card issuer can judge the effectiveness of having particular merchants within the loyalty system, based on collected merchant fees. A cardholder may elect to charge the merchant additional fee amounts as the merchant receives strong support from the cardholders of a particular card issuer.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">The described reporting functionality can also be used to track the data necessary to integrate the data of points and fees held within the loyalty system <b>26</b> for a given time period. A card issuer may elect to view the information to keep current information regarding benefits that are due to the cardholders.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">By examining the data of accumulated points and fees a card issuer may elect to alter the conversion rules to give more benefits to the cardholders and thereby create more demand for a financial card use at a particular merchant(s). This type of reporting can also be used to prove the value to the merchants and cardholders derived from card use at an identified merchant(s).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0194">Merchants may generally view only the information regarding the transactions that were made with identified cardholders. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may allow for a System Administrator to see the following information: 1) Time range of transactions 2) Date range of transactions 3) BIN Range of transactions 4) Summary amounts of transactions.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0195">The loyalty system <b>26</b> may generally restrict the information that the merchant can view by providing summary data only. The summary data protects the cardholders from direct exposure of private cardholder information, while allowing the merchant to view the status of the program. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may use summary data to recommend incentives or raw data.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">For instance a merchant may wish to know how certain cards identified by BIN number are contributing to his sales. By comparing this information with historical reports and current internal customer payment methods a merchant can judge which financial card types are providing the most benefit for his organization.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0197">An example process for customizing loyalty programs involving cardholders will now be described, and specifically a system administrator for the operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> may adjust the parameters associated with reward generation and change incentives (based on e.g. recommended incentives) in connection with specific members.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0198">The cardholder benefits processing utility <b>30</b> may be further configured for processing financial transactions (or transaction utility (not shown) that is operable to conduct electronic transactions between loyalty system <b>26</b> and the card issuer system <b>38</b>) possibly also between the loyalty system <b>26</b> and the merchant acquirer system <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0199">The cost of acquiring new customers is generally quite high, and this is a cost that merchants tend to monitor very closely. Particularly if a merchant's relationship with card issuers by operation of loyalty system <b>26</b> permits the merchant to acquire a new customer through the card issuer, merchants will generally be willing to provide to the cardholder and/or to the card issuer relatively significant incentives in consideration of obtaining the new customer. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may enable a merchant to target incentives to particular sub-groups of cardholders, depending on their interest (e.g. cardholder attributes) to merchant.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0200">For example, a cardholder whose BIN number is associated with the program may go to a merchant who is also associated with the program. Within the loyalty system <b>26</b>, the cardholder may be given a code to be presented at the merchant's location that reflects a discount offer (e.g. incentive). Upon payment, the cardholder receives a discount on monies owed. The cardholder in the above example is also given an additional item (e.g. a further incentive) from the merchant's inventory as recognition for the cardholder being a member of the applicable loyalty program.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0201">After the cardholder transaction has been completed, the transaction data is relayed to the loyalty system <b>26</b> and the cardholder benefits processing utility <b>34</b> is operable to automatically offer prize entries as a follow up to the cardholders purchase (e.g. a further incentive), based on the loyalty program rules defined by the merchant.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0202">After the cardholder transaction has been completed the transaction data may be relayed to the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The loyalty system <b>26</b> defines in accordance with a particular loyalty program a set of rules to complement existing points programs by processing the transaction data (e.g. identified merchant, amount of transaction, date of transaction, time of transaction) to convert the transaction into points in connection with the applicable card issuers BIN range point program and based upon parameters set by each participating merchant. For instance, the system <b>26</b> may convert transaction incentives or prizes within the loyalty program to points provided through the card issuer to the cardholder based on a pre-determined formula (usually based on an arrangement between the card issuer and the merchants, facilitated by the operator of the loyalty system). The loyalty system <b>26</b> would for example convert a $100.00 spent by a cardholder under a loyalty program into 100 points if the transaction was completed between the hours of 00:00:00 and 12:00:00 Monday through Friday and 50 points at any other time for the particular card used at a particular merchant.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0203">The cardholder in the above example visits a merchant participating in the loyalty system <b>26</b>. The cardholder chooses to use the financial card that is registered with the loyalty system <b>26</b> over other financial cards, and completes a transaction. The loyalty system <b>26</b> identifies the merchant, the date, the amount and optionally the time of day and the terminal ID and also establishes any accrued benefits including points, prizes or discounted offers. The card issuer in this case receives additional revenue from increased card use as the cardholder chooses the registered card issuers' card over another financial card.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0204">The loyalty system <b>26</b> allows for the existing point programs operated by the card issuer to be identified and supported within the loyalty system <b>26</b>. This occurs when, after conversion of incentives (for example) into points, the card issuer then applies additional incentives through its own point system thereby creating an enhanced points program.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0205">It is possible that the card issuer would charge the operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> (or the merchants themselves) for access to BIN ranges of cardholders, and other attributes of cardholders. The charges could depend on the efforts expended by the card issuer to encourage cardholders to enroll in the loyalty program. Or, the card issuer may elect to charge differing amounts for loyalty system <b>26</b> access depending on the demographics and other attributes of particular cardholders.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0206">A card issuer increases its revenue by offering incentives to consumers to use a particular financial card with a greater number of merchants. Merchants associated with the loyalty system <b>26</b> provide incremental incentives to cardholders in certain BIN ranges. This way the card issuer and the loyalty system <b>26</b> cooperate to bring more business to the common group.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0207">The card issuers may elect to charge the cardholders an annual fee to carry a financial card that is associated with a particular BIN range, and thereby also eligible for certain richer benefits in connection with a loyalty program. The additional annual fees represent an important source of additional revenue to the card issuer.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0208">As previously stated, a merchant belonging to the loyalty system <b>26</b> may choose to offer rewards/incentives based upon time of day and date. The incentives may also be based on a particular good or service. The merchant's merchant acquirer provides selected information relating to particular BIN ranges, transactions, dates and times (e.g. attributes). The loyalty system <b>26</b> identifies the merchant, the time of day and the date and applies differential incentives either through the loyalty system <b>26</b> or in the form of differential points transferred to the card issuer for the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0209">The merchant through the loyalty system <b>26</b> contracts with the merchant acquirer for anticipated additional transactions from a particular set of BIN numbers. The merchant acquirer is rewarded for the service in the form of a transaction fee or monthly fee through the loyalty system. The merchant may pay a differential rate for an access to a particular BIN as the cardholders to a particular BIN may offer a greater opportunity for transactions.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0210">A merchant acquirer may realize additional revenues due to differing transaction fees associated with differing BIN number acceptance as a form of payment by a participating merchant. The merchant acquirer may elect to charge differing transaction fees for acceptance of cards within certain BIN range of a participating card issuer.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0211">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide an opportunity for merchants, and for card issuers if they are willing, to efficiently operate and maintain their own loyalty program that provides the ability to share customers through cross-promotion between card issuers and merchants, and also cross-promotion between merchants involving cardholders who become members. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may enable card issuers and merchants to obtain direct customer feedback and to perceive measured results regarding customer transactions at each merchant, including bases on analysis of BIN number ranges by operation of the loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0212">The card issuers may be provided with an economic interest to motivate the cardholders to become members of the loyalty system <b>26</b> and to transact with merchants in order for the cardholders who are members to obtain benefits from the merchants (or from the card issuer based on an arrangement with the merchants). Recommended incentives tailored to a target segment may be a mechanism to increase transactions by cardholders. Again, customers of a co-branded card for example may be identified within the loyalty system <b>26</b> by means of their financial card BIN range number through the registration process, thereby enabling subsequent transactions involving particular cardholders and particular merchants to be tracked and measured results to be proven to card issuers and merchants alike.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0213">Benefits or incentives may be accrued on behalf of members (including members who are cardholders) in a number of ways. The benefits themselves can vary. For example, pre-set benefit application or payment rates are associated with particular transactions associated with the loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0214">Within the loyalty system <b>26</b>, merchants may be motivated to develop new and innovative loyalty programs (through the use of recommended incentives) that will automatically be accessible to cardholders. This saves the card issuer the time and resources generally required to devise new loyalty programs and enter into associated arrangements with their partners, often separately for each program.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0215">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may generate financial transactions and/or customers for financial institutions or merchants, or both.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0216">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide flexibility in the arrangements made by the merchants, or in fact in some bases between the merchants and the card issuers, as it relates to the benefits provided to cardholders who become members. These arrangements can define the pre-determined benefits associated with particular transactions, e.g. a per transaction benefit to the cardholder or in fact to the card issuer. As such, loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide a potential source of new revenue for the card issuer to the extent that not all of the benefits earmarked for cardholders' transactions is actually passed on to the cardholders.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0217">It may be open to the card issuer to also provide benefits or incentives to cardholders in connection with transactions associated with the loyalty system. For example, card issuers may want to enhance incentives available from merchants in connection with specific transactions with incentives that they are themselves providing because for example the impact of client retention of a preferred customer who is a golfer might be enhanced if an incentive from the card issuer is provided specifically in connection with a transaction that brings happiness to the golfer, i.e. golf. The loyalty system <b>26</b> can assist with incentives may recommending incentives for target segment. Alternatively, the card issuer could &#x201c;top up&#x201d; benefits provided by merchants, thereby enhancing the merchant's relationship with the cardholder who is a member, if the merchant is a customer of the card issuer or a related entity of the card issuer.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218">Consequently, the loyalty system <b>26</b>, at little or no additional cost, can be used to generate additional new business for the card issuer.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may effectively permit some merchants who would otherwise not be able to enter into co-branded card type arrangements (e.g. because of startup costs or because of the merchant is a regional retailer where the merchant might not otherwise be attractive to a large financial institution) to provide loyalty programs. Accordingly, loyalty system <b>26</b> may allow regional merchants to compete better against national chains that may have more resources to dedicate to building loyalty programs.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0220">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide a loyalty program with a low cost way to acquire customers and pay for them over future transactions. It may also provide the co-branded partner the ability to expand transactions on the current card base, both from the initial referrals and subsequent transactions resulting from cross promotional offers within the loyalty system <b>26</b> among other merchants.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0221">A financial card can be moved to the front of the wallet to be used for more transactions, where the cardholder is motivated to use the card based on incentives that are recommended for the particular cardholder based on associated attributes.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0222">Cardholders of selected co-branded financial cards may become members where the co-branded partners' service or product is not really competitive with the loyalty system merchants. Accordingly, use of co-branded cards in connection with the described loyalty system <b>26</b> may protect transaction market share for both the card issuer and co-branded partners' market share.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0223">The card issuer, the co-branded partner and the merchants of the loyalty program may increase their customer transactions through sharing customers.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0224">Flexibility may be provided to card issuers and merchants to devise, implement, and then measure the effectiveness of, various cross-promotional initiatives, can dramatically increase the returns on investment of card issuers and merchants alike, in connection with their customer retention and customer acquisition activities. Further, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may facilitate this process by providing recommended incentives for various loyalty programs.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0225">Other modifications and extensions may be made to loyalty system <b>26</b>. For example, various security methods and technologies for restricting access to resources of the loyalty system <b>26</b> to those authorized to do so by the operator of the loyalty system <b>26</b> may be used. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may use various existing and future technologies to process transaction data by operation of the transaction utility <b>38</b>. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide various tools and interfaces for interacting with the loyalty system. The system <b>26</b> may also allow for robust reporting which may include comparative reports of member affinity or of transaction history with participating merchants. In other words, member transaction history may be different for differing groups of members based on member affinity.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0226">As noted, loyalty system <b>26</b> may be interconnected with card issuer system <b>38</b>. Card issuer system <b>32</b> may be configured with various computing applications, such as a points/rewards program <b>64</b>, cardholder registration <b>68</b>, card issuer reporting tool <b>66</b>, and a data storage device with cardholder and transaction data <b>70</b>. The points/rewards program <b>64</b> may manage loyalty programs offered by card issuer system <b>38</b> independently or in conjunction with loyalty system <b>26</b>. Existing loyalty data tool <b>58</b> may interact with points/rewards program <b>64</b> regarding loyalty programs offered by card issuer system <b>38</b>. The points/rewards program <b>64</b> may populate cardholder and transaction data <b>70</b> based on data collected from loyalty programs. Cardholder registration <b>68</b> may enable cardholders to register for financial cards with card issuer. Cardholder registration <b>68</b> may populate cardholder and transaction data <b>70</b> based on data collected from registration. The card issuer reporting tool <b>66</b> may generate reports based on cardholder and transaction data <b>70</b> and data maintained by loyalty system <b>26</b> as part of database <b>32</b>. Database <b>32</b> may maintain a copy of cardholder and transaction data <b>70</b>, or may contain separate data.

Loyalty program module <b>22</b> may be used to create and manage various loyalty programs for card issuer system <b>38</b> and may interact with points/rewards program <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0227">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may also be interconnected with a merchant system <b>40</b>. Merchant system <b>40</b> may be configured with various computing applications, such as merchant reporting tool <b>66</b> for generating reports regarding loyalty programs and for displaying interfaces received from merchant interface <b>52</b> to create, customize, and manage loyalty programs and incentives. A computing application may correspond to hardware and software modules comprising computer executable instructions to configure physical hardware to perform various functions and discernible results. A computing application may be a computer software or hardware application designed to help the user to perform specific functions, and may include an application plug-in, a widget, instant messaging application, mobile device application, e-mail application, online telephony application, java application, web page, or web object residing, executing, running or rendered on the merchant system <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0228">Merchant system <b>40</b> is operable to authenticate merchants (using a login, unique identifier, and password for example) prior to providing access to applications and loyalty system <b>40</b>.

Examples of such events and trends are described below.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0242">To generate recommended incentives and alert notifications, recommendation engine <b>60</b> stores a set of rules which are applied to data stored in database <b>32</b>, including for example, customer data and transaction data. Each rule defines the criteria to be satisfied for generating the particular incentive or alert notification. Each rule is stored in association with an indicator of a pre-defined incentive or alert notification to be provided when the rule's criteria are met.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0243">In some embodiments, rule criteria can be defined when an incentive is created. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, criteria can be received via a user interface to trigger generation of a reward when a cardholder of a specified demographic spends more than X amount or visits more than Y times in the past Z time period. Other incentive triggers may be predefined by the system and may be enabled or disabled by an administrator.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0244">In some embodiments, each of the rules may be defined as a database query. For example, when database <b>32</b> is an SQL database, each of the rules may be defined as an SQL query.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0245">In other embodiments, each of the rules may be defined as a business rule suitable for processing using a conventional business rule management system with a rules engine, such as JBoss Drools&#x2122;, ILOG JRules&#x2122;, FICO Blaze Advisor&#x2122;, or the like.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0246">In some embodiments, rules may be processed using conventional artificial intelligence techniques. For example, recommendation engine <b>32</b> may include a rules engine that implements a conventional artificial neural network or fuzzy logic to determine when the criteria of rules are met.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">Reference will now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, which illustrate an example system for providing charitable incentives.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts loyalty system <b>26</b> interconnected with the card issuer system <b>38</b>, the merchant system <b>40</b>, and a charity system <b>80</b> by way of the communication network <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0249">Having regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the loyalty system <b>26</b> (and in particular charity utility <b>76</b>) may interact with a charity system <b>80</b> to provide charitable incentives. For example, an incentive may result in a donation to a charity from the merchant, card issuer, card holder, and so on. Charity system <b>80</b> may include a data storage device with donor data <b>88</b>. Charity system <b>80</b> may include a loyalty interface for generating interfaces populated with data from loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0250">For example, a correlation may be made between donor data and benefits accounts <b>34</b><i>a </i>or cardholder data <b>70</b> to determine whether any donors are also cardholders.

The donors are associated with attributes, such as the example attributes described herein in relation to cardholders.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0255">Charity system <b>80</b> or charity utility <b>76</b> is operable to determine which donors are cardholders and which are not. Charity system <b>80</b> or charity utility <b>76</b> are operable to invite those donors which are not cardholders to participate in a loyalty program offering incentives that include donations to the charity. These may be recommended incentives based on their past donations.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0256">At <b>114</b>, charity system <b>80</b> or charity utility <b>76</b> is operable to identify a merchant and an anticipated transaction between the merchant and at least one donor. This may occur prior to <b>112</b> or after in different embodiments. The charity system <b>80</b> may contact a merchant upon detecting that a subset of donors are also customers, potential customers, or cardholders to arrange for an incentive provided by merchant that includes a donation to the charity. The anticipated transaction may identify a good or service of interest to the donors based on the attributes.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0257">At <b>116</b>, charity system <b>80</b> or charity utility <b>76</b> is operable to generate a recommended incentive based on the charity, the attributes, the merchant, and the transaction. The incentive defines a benefit provided by the merchant to the charity upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the merchant and one or more donors. In this way, a donor is motivated to transact with the merchant using a cardholder by the card issuer due to the donation provided to their preferred charity. The charity system <b>80</b> or charity utility <b>76</b> may contact donors encouraging them to register for a card associated with a card issuer and transact with a merchant, as this may result in an increase in donations to the charity. The card issuer and the merchant may have access to a new set of potential customers via charity system <b>80</b>. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may consider the buying patterns of donors to recommend incentives with a donation component. This also allows merchants to see what customers are also donors and tailor incentives accordingly. An alert as described above may also be generated at <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">The charity system <b>80</b> may be used to manage events and the attendee list may also receive the recommended incentive. This may increase transactions for both merchants and card issuers, as well as increase donations if there is an additional incentive offered by merchant or card issuers. The merchant, charity or card issuer may set a donation rate which may be a fixed or proportional amount.

Each profile category (or persona) defines a grouping of customers who share particular attributes such as behavioural and/or motivation attributes. Customer profile <b>602</b> analyzes data for each customer to determine the customers attributes and to classify the customer into one or more profile categories. This data may include the cardholder data and transaction data discussed above. This data may also include other forms of data, such as, e.g., customer activity data and survey data, as detailed below. Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives targeting customers classified into a particular profile categories.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0261">By way of example only, the pre-defined profile categories may include a &#x201c;Gamer&#x201d; category of customers who are motivated by prize entries to purchase goods and/or services. The pre-defined profile categories may also include a &#x201c;Giver&#x201d; category of customers who are motivated by charitable donations/promotions and charitable/philanthropic activities to purchase goods and/or services. The pre-defined profile categories may also include a &#x201c;Discounter&#x201d; category of customers who are motivated by sales/discounts to purchase goods and/or services.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0262">Other categories may be defined to reflect shared preferences or habits of a group customers. For example, the pre-defined profile categories may include a &#x201c;Outdoor Lover&#x201d; category of customers who tend to purchase goods and services relating to outdoor activities. Similarly, the pre-defined profile categories may include a &#x201c;Car Lover&#x201d; category of customers who tend to purchase goods and services relating to cars. Other examples of pre-defined categories of customers may include a &#x201c;High-end Shopper&#x201d; category of customers who tend to purchase high-end goods and services and/or visit high-end stores; a &#x201c;Home Maker&#x201d; category of customers who tend to purchase goods and services relating to care and management of their homes; a &#x201c;Can Shop in Regular Business Hours&#x201d; category of customers who are able to purchase goods and services and/or visit stores during regular business (e.g., daytime) hours; and so on.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0263">As will be appreciated, the categories described herein are examples only. Customer profiler <b>602</b> may be configured to classify customers according to these example categories or any other categories that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The profile categories may be manually defined by an operator. In some embodiments, at least some of the profile categories may be automatically defined by customer profiler <b>602</b> in manners detailed below.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0264">As noted, each customer may be classified according to a single category or multiple categories. In particular, customer profiler <b>602</b> may be configured to classify a customer into a single best-fit category. Customer profiler <b>602</b> may also be configured to classify a customer into multiple categories when the customer has attributes spanning those multiple categories.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0265">In some embodiments, customer profiler <b>602</b> may calculate a set of affinity scores, each proportional to a degree of affinity of a particular customer with a particular profile category. The score may, for example, reflect the degree to which a particular customer exhibits the attributes associated with the particular profile category.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0266">For example, customer profiler <b>602</b> may determine that a particular customer has a strong affinity for the Gamer category, but only a moderate affinity for the Discounter category. In such circumstances, customer profiler <b>602</b> may assign a score of 100 to reflect the customers strong affinity for the Gamer category, and a score of 60 to reflect the customers moderate affinity for the Discounter category. In an embodiment, customer profile <b>602</b> may calculate a particular customers affinity scores as a percentage, with the scores for that customer totaling 100%. For example, customer profile <b>602</b> may determine a customers scores to be 70% Gamer, 20% Discounter, and 10% Giver.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0267">Customer profiler <b>602</b> may determine a particular customers attributes and classify the customer into one or more profile categories by analyzing any combination of the following factors:</p><p id="p-0271" num="0268">(1) Location(s) of a customer, as reflected, e.g., in the customers home address, work address, and/or location(s) of customers purchases;</p><p id="p-0272" num="0269">(2) Customers purchase preferences (e.g., preferred merchants, products/services, charities, interests), which may be automatically inferred by customer profiler <b>602</b>, or entered by the customer into loyalty system <b>26</b> or another interconnected system (e.g., an interconnected social networking platform);</p><p id="p-0273" num="0270">(3) Customers age, gender, and other demographic attributes;</p><p id="p-0274" num="0271">(4) Customers residence status (e.g., whether customer owns, rents, or lives with a relative, monthly rent/mortgage payments, etc.);</p><p id="p-0275" num="0272">(5) Customers monthly income;</p><p id="p-0276" num="0273">(6) Customers employment status (e.g., full-time, part-time, retired, self-employed, etc.);</p><p id="p-0277" num="0274">(7) Customers employer and position;</p><p id="p-0278" num="0275">(8) Customers credit data (e.g., total credit limit, total balances, credit rating);</p><p id="p-0279" num="0276">(9) Customers level of education;</p><p id="p-0280" num="0277">(10) Customers financial card co-applicant information;</p><p id="p-0281" num="0278">(11) BIN range of financial cards held by the customer;</p><p id="p-0282" num="0279">(12) Past purchases (e.g., purchase types, whether purchases were online or offline, time of day of purchases, purchases by Standard Industry Code (SIC), purchases by Merchant Category Code (MCC), purchases by Universal Product Code (UPC));</p><p id="p-0283" num="0280">(13) Past visits to particular merchants' stores;</p><p id="p-0284" num="0281">(14) Past spending levels;</p><p id="p-0285" num="0282">(15) Past incentives redeemed by the customer;</p><p id="p-0286" num="0283">(16) Elasticity of demand of the customer (including by product type);</p><p id="p-0287" num="0284">(17) Manner in which customer became enrolled in the loyalty program (e.g., through a particular recruitment campaign or charity campaign); and</p><p id="p-0288" num="0285">(18) Online interactions with loyalty system <b>26</b> or interconnected systems, e.g., by way of cardholder interfaces <b>62</b> detailed below (including duration of visit, page views, number of links visited, number of mouse clicks, average duration between visits, incentives viewed/searched, etc.), or by way of e-mails sent by loyalty system <b>26</b> (including whether the e-mails were received, viewed, clicked-through, opted-out, etc.), or by way of social networking platforms (e.g., likes, shares, reviews, etc.).</p><p id="p-0289" num="0286">So, for example, a customer who routinely redeems incentives that provide donations to charities may be classified into the Giver category. Similarly, a customer who enrolled into the loyalty program at a charity event may also be classified into the Giver category. A customer who routinely redeems incentives that provide a chance to win prizes, or routinely clicks on e-mail links related to such incentives may be classified into the Gamer category.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0287">As will be appreciated, some of the factors listed above relate to stated preferences or intentions of customer, while other factors listed above relate to observed actions or behaviours of customers. In some embodiments, when classifying customers into profile categories, factors relating to observed actions or behaviors may be given greater consideration (e.g., assigned more weight) than factors relating to stated preferences or intensions.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0288">Classifying customers into profile categories allows recommendation engine <b>60</b> to recommend incentives to target customers based on the classified profile categories. For example, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend an incentive to target all customers in a particular category. Incentives that target customers in a particular category may be selected or created in manners detailed herein to appeal to customers based on the attributes associated with that category. Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may, for example, recommend incentives involving games of skill or chance to customers in the Gamer category, or incentives that provide donations to a charity to customers in the Giver category.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0289">Further, classifying customers into profile categories allows recommendation engine to tailor incentives targeting particular customers based on the activity of other customers in the same category. For example, product preferences of customers in a particular category may be determined from purchases of other customers in the same category. Similarly, product preferences of customers in a particular category may also be determined from feedback of other customers in the same category, which may be received by way of surveys or reviews as detailed below.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0290">So, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives relating to a particular product to customers in a particular profile category upon determining that the product is preferred by customers in that category. Similarly, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives relating to particular brands, services, locations, restaurants, etc., based on preferences determined for a particular profile category.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0291">Recommending incentives to target customers by profile category may impose a lower computational burden compared to recommending incentives to target each customer individually. In this way, computational efficiency of recommending incentives may be improved.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0292">As will be appreciated, a customers attributes, including behavioural and motivation attributes, may change over time. As such, customer profiler <b>602</b> may analyze new data (e.g., data relating to new transactions conducted by the customer or new activity of the customer) as such data becomes available to re-classify the customer into different profile categories if necessary. Upon discovery of a new customer, customer profiler <b>602</b> may analyze available historic data (e.g., historic transaction data or cardholder data, including data from a financial card application) to classify that customer into initial profile categories, and then update these initial categories upon receipt of new data. In an embodiment, a customers profile categories may be updated in real-time or near real-time as new data is received.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0293">As noted, customer profiler <b>602</b> may be configured to automatically define profile categories. In particular, customer profiler <b>602</b> may be configured to discover groups of customers based on shared attributes and to define profile categories using conventional clustering techniques.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0294">The manner of automatically defining profile categories in accordance with an embodiment is further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, which depicts a three-dimensional scatter plot of customers based on their attributes.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0295">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, each axis corresponds to a customer attribute, e.g., a behavioural/motivation attribute, and each point represent a customer. The location of a point along each axis represents a degree to which the represented customer exhibits the attribute represented by that axis. For example, the x-axis may represent a customer attribute of being motivated by savings (e.g., discounts) to conduct transactions. The y-axis may represent a customer attribute of being motivated to conduct transactions by winning a game or a prize (through contests, lotteries, etc.). The z-axis may represent a customer attribute of being motivated to conduct transactions in order to support charities or other philanthropic causes. Of course, the axes could also represent other customer attributes.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0296">The size of each point (or bubble) may be proportional to the economic importance of the represented customer. For example, the size of the point may be proportional to the number of transactions conducted by that customer or the amount of spending of that customer. Transactions/spending may be aggregated over all merchants, particular types of merchants, merchants belonging to particular profile categories as detailed below, or merchants that within a pre-defined geographic span (e.g., partial or full ZIP code, neighborhood, city).</p><p id="p-0300" num="0297">Transactions/spending may also be aggregated over a pre-defined time period (e.g., a week, a month, a year, etc.). Transactions/spending may also be aggregated on the basis of whether the transactions/spending are online or offline.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0298">Once the location (or coordinates) of customers along within the three-dimensional space have been determined, groups (or clusters) of customers may be discovered using a conventional clustering techniques, such as, e.g., k-means clustering techniques, density-based clustering techniques, distribution-based clustering techniques. Groups of customers may also be manually defined by an operator, e.g., upon visual inspection of a graph such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, and customer profiler <b>602</b> may be configured to receive operating input indicating manually-defined groups.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0299">Optionally, the clustering technique may be adapted to take into account attributes of particular customers, e.g., as reflected by the size of each point (or bubble) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>. The clustering technique may, for example, assign a weight to each customer that is proportional to the size of each point/bubble, and may group customers taking into account these weights.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0300">Customer profiler <b>602</b> may automatically define a profile category for each group of customers, and may automatically assign an identifier or name to each profile category so defined. Customer profiler <b>602</b> may also assign a user-selected identifier or name to each profile category.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0301">Customer profiler <b>602</b> may store a record of each profile category, e.g., in database <b>32</b>. A profile category may be described in this record as a region of three-dimensional (3D) space with respect to the axes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>. For example, a profile category may be described as a region having the shape of a sphere with a defined center and a defined radius. A profile category may also be described as another region of 3D space having a different geometric shape, or an arbitrary shape.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0302">Once a profile category has been defined, additional customers may be automatically classified into the category if the point associated for that customer falls within the described region of 3D space.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0303">Profile categories may overlap in the 3D space such that a point associated with a customer may fall within multiple profile categories.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0304">Although three dimensions are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, in which customers are plotted according to three attributes, grouping customers and defining profile categories as described herein may be applied to any number of attributes. So, customers may be plotted and grouped based on a fewer or greater number of attributes. Similarly, profile categories may be described as a region of space having any number of dimensions.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0305">When a profile category is described as a region of space having a defined center, the affinity of a particular customer for a particular profile category may be determined by customer profiler <b>602</b> as being proportional to the distance of the point representing a customer to the defined center.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0306">In an embodiment, customer profiler <b>602</b> tracks the movement of each point representing a customer overtime, with such movement indicating shifts in the customers attributes. In response to detecting such shifts, customer profiler <b>602</b> may re-classify a customer into different categories. Customer profile <b>602</b> may also predict a future transition of a customer into one or more categories based on a trajectory of the point representing that customer.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0307">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend particular incentives to customers who have recently transitioned to a new profile category, or are predicted to transition to a new profile category. For example, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives targeting customers in a particular profile category to include customers who are predicted to transition to that particular profile category.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0308">In an embodiment, customer profiler <b>602</b> tracks changes in groupings or clusters over time. For example, the above-noted clustering techniques may be re-applied periodically to update the defined profile categories based on new data. Such updating may cause some profile categories to be removed. Such updating may also cause some profile categories to be merged with other profile categories. Further, the boundaries of clusters may also grow or shrink over time, and the records of the defined profile categories may be automatically updated to reflect such changes.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Merchant Profile Categories</heading><p id="p-0312" num="0309">Merchant profiler <b>604</b> classifies merchants according to one or more merchant profile categories based on the merchant's attributes.

There may also be a &#x201c;Popular&#x201d; category of merchants who are particularly popular compared other merchants offering similar product/services; popularity may be measured, e.g., by sales volume, sales revenue amounts, customer traffic, or the like. There may also be a &#x201c;Deep Discounter&#x201d; category of merchants who tend to offer particularly large discounts or incentives. There may also be a &#x201c;Community Minded&#x201d; category of merchants who tend to offer incentives benefiting (e.g., providing donations) to charitable causes.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0311">As will be appreciated, the merchant categories described herein are examples only. Merchant profiler <b>604</b> may be configured to classify merchants according to these example categories or any other categories that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Matches may also be made on the basis of correlating customer demographics, location, BIN ranges, etc. For example, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may match the &#x201c;Deep Discounter&#x201d; merchant profile category to the &#x201c;Discounter&#x201d; customer profile category on the basis of mutual affinity of merchants and customers in those categories for discounts. Similarly, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may match the &#x201c;Community Minded&#x201d; merchant profile category to the &#x201c;Giver&#x201d; customer profile category on the basis of mutual affinity of merchants and customers in those categories for supporting charitable causes.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0331">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives based on such matches, e.g., by recommending an incentive to all merchants in a particular merchant category to be offered to all customers in a particular customer category. In this way, merchants may be connected to new customers. Further, recommended incentives may be better tailored the merchant's customers and potential customers.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0332">In other embodiments, other parties associated with of loyalty system <b>26</b> may also be classified into profile categories in similar manners. For example, charities may also be classified according to profile categories, and incentives may be generated such that donations are provided to charities classified into particular categories. Further, merchants and customers may express preferences to provide donations to charities in particular categories.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0333">In an embodiment, feedback provided by customers (in the form of surveys or ratings, further detailed below) may be processed by recommendation engine <b>60</b> to determine customer sentiment, e.g., sentiment towards particular products, services, merchants, stores, locations, etc. For example, customer sentiment may be determined as any one of happy, neutral, angry, excited, disappointed, or the like. In some embodiments, customer sentiment may be assessed based on feedback received from all customers, or assessed back on feedback received from customers in particular customer profile categories.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0334">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives based on the determined customer sentiment. For example, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives for particular products/services/merchants expected to cause customers in a particular profile category to feel happy or excited. Similarly, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may avoid recommending incentives for particular products/services/merchants expected to cause customers in a particular profile to feel angry or disappointed.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0335">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may also avoid recommending incentives for particular product/services/merchants based on negative customer feedback, e.g., if the feedback indicates that the product/services/merchants is unsatisfactory, or below average, or otherwise negative.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Real-Time Monitoring</heading><p id="p-0339" num="0336">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> monitors customer shopping activity in real-time, e.g., whether customers are inside, proximate to, or en route to particular merchants' stores. Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may also monitor when customers are visiting particular merchants' websites, or when customers are browsing particular products/services on those websites. Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may also monitor the particular products/services being searched for by customers (e.g., using keywords in online search engines).</p><p id="p-0340" num="0337">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> enables recommendation engine <b>60</b> to recommend incentives to merchants in response to monitored activity. For example, in response to detecting that a customer is visiting a particular merchant's website, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may generate an incentive for a product/service offered by that merchant, an incentive for another merchant offering complementary products/services, or an incentive for a competing merchant. Similarly, in response to detecting that a customer is browsing or searching for a particular product/service, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may generate an incentive for that product/service or a similar product/service, including a product/service offered by a competitor.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0338">In an embodiment, real-time monitor <b>606</b> may monitor customer shopping activity based on a current location detected for particular customers. A particular customers current location may be detected by processing GPS coordinates reported to real-time monitor <b>606</b> from an electronic device associated with a particular customer. Such a device may, for example, be a GPS navigation device, a smart phone, a smart watch, a wearable computing device such as Google Glass, or the like. A particular customers current location may also be detected by way of signals transmitted by electronic devices associated with the customer. Such signals may, for example, be signals transmitted by the devices in response to radio-frequency (RF) signals sent from sensors installed in at merchants' stores, or signals sent by devices connecting to a wireless access point provided at merchants' store. Such RF signals may for example be RFID signals, Bluetooth&#x2122; signals, or the like. In one specific embodiment, the RF signals may be iBeacon&#x2122; signals.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0339">Current locations of particular customers may also be determined using conventional facial recognition techniques, as applied to images of customers captured using cameras at merchants' stores (e.g., security cameras). Images from other cameras may also be used, e.g., cameras in parking lots or other areas through which customers are expected to travel when visiting merchants' stores.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0340">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may process the captured images to determine customer characteristics, e.g., brands of clothing worn by the customer, or charitable causes favored the customer based on the presence of emblems or symbols worn by supporters of particular causes (e.g., yellow wristbands for cancer awareness, pink ribbons for breast cancer research, etc.).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0341">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may track a customers location over time to determine the customers travel trajectory or travel route, and thereby determine that the customer is en route to a particular merchant's store. Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may also determine that a customer is en route to a particular merchant's store based on destination information inputted into a customers GPS navigation device or mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0342">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may also predict that a customer is en route to a particular merchant's store by assessing the customers detected location and/or travel route relative to travel routes taken by the customer in the past. Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may also take into account the current time of day relative to the time of day of past travel. For example, real-time monitor <b>606</b> may determine from the past travel data that when a particular customer is on a given road at a given time, that customer is likely to be headed towards a particular destination (e.g., a particular store). On this basis, real-time monitor <b>606</b> may predict when the customer is en route to that destination (store). Data reflective of past travel of customers may be stored, for example, in database <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0343">In an embodiment, real-time monitor <b>606</b> may monitor a customers web activity to determine when a customer visits particular merchants' websites. Data relating to such web activity may be received by real-time monitor <b>606</b> from the websites, e.g., when a particular customer logs in, or when arrival of the customer is detected using a cookie stored by the customers browser. Data relating to such web activity may also be received by real-time monitor <b>606</b> from customized monitoring software, e.g., in the form of browser plugins.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0344">Customer activity, as monitored by real-time monitor <b>606</b>, may be used by recommendation engine <b>60</b> to generate incentives in real time to particular customers. For example, incentives may be offered to particular customers who are proximate to a particular store to incentivize them to enter that store. Incentives may be offered to particular customers who are already in a particular store to incentivize them to make purchases. Any such incentives may be customized for the particular customer, and the particular merchant, in any of the manners disclosed herein. So, for example, incentives may be customized based on the customers demographics, transaction history, persona, the time of day, and any preferences specified by the customer or the merchant.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0345">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may generate incentives that are time-limited, e.g., with a timer that counts down when a customer arrives at a particular store or surfs to a particular website. Similarly, incentives may be limited to a current browser session.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0346">Generated incentives may be presented to the merchant for approval, or may be automatically offered to customers.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0347">Customer activity, as monitored by real-time monitor <b>606</b>, may also be used to customize each customers shopping experience. For example, real-time monitor <b>606</b> may detect when a particular customer arrives a particular store. Upon detecting the arrival of the customer, the transaction history or activity history for that customer may be retrieved (e.g., from database <b>32</b>) and analyzed by loyalty system <b>26</b> to provide a customized greeting to the customer. The customized greeting may, for example, welcome the customers first visit to the store, acknowledge the customer as a regular visitor, acknowledge a particular number of visits within a certain time frame (e.g., 10th visit in a calendar year), welcome the customer back to the store after an absence exceeding a pre-defined duration, or the like.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0348">The customized greeting may be delivered electronically by loyalty system <b>26</b> to the customer, e.g., to the customers smart phone. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may also prompt the merchant's personnel on site to deliver the customized greeting to customer.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0349">Real-time monitor <b>606</b> may store monitored customer shopping activity in database <b>32</b> to provide an activity history for further processing (e.g., by customer profiler <b>602</b> to determine the customers persona, or by loyalty engine <b>60</b> to generate incentives and alerts).</p><p id="p-0353" num="0350">In an embodiment, real-time monitor <b>606</b> monitors a customers activity only upon verifying that the customer has granted permission for his/her activity to be monitored, e.g., by opting in to receiving real-time incentives based on such monitoring.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0351">Conveniently, real-time monitor <b>606</b> allows customer shopping activity to be monitored separately from transaction activity, and to generate and store an activity history separate from the customers transaction history. So, a customers activity (e.g., entering a particular store) may be detected and stored for future use even if the customer does not conduct any transaction (e.g., does not make a purchase).</p><p id="p-0355" num="0352">In an embodiment, loyalty system <b>26</b> may be adapted to allow merchants to access data relating to real-time activity as monitored by real-time monitor <b>606</b>. For example, merchants may access such day by way of a merchant dashboard as further described below. By accessing such data, merchants may monitor when particular customers are inside, proximate to, or en route to particular merchants' stores.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0353">In some embodiments, loyalty system <b>26</b> allows merchants to monitor customer shopping activity based on the customers' personas. For example, loyalty system <b>26</b> may allow merchants to monitor when customers having particular personas are inside, proximate to, or en route to particular merchants' stores. For example, loyalty system <b>26</b> may inform a merchant that five Garners are currently in the merchant's store. The merchant may then be prompted by loyalty system <b>26</b> to offer an incentive specifically targeting Garners. In an embodiment, loyalty system <b>26</b> allows merchants to monitor customers' activity based on the customers personas, without revealing the customers identities. In this way, customer privacy may be protected.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0354">In some embodiments, loyalty system <b>26</b> allows merchants to view historic customer activity based on customers' personas. For example, merchants may view customer activity by persona type to determine transaction volume, spending, etc. by persona type. Such customer activity may be further broken down by time periods (e.g., time of day, time of week, seasonally, etc.). For example, loyalty system <b>26</b> may inform a merchant that on weekend days 80% of its customers are Discounters, and that on weekdays 60% of its customers are Garners.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0355">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may recommend incentives to target customers by persona type that are expected to be in the merchant's store, or to attract customers by persona type that otherwise are not expected to be in the merchant's store. For example, upon determining that only 5% of its customers on weekend days are Givers, recommendation engine <b>60</b> may generate an incentive tailored to attract Givers to come to the merchant's store on a weekend day.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Care Mobs</heading><p id="p-0359" num="0356">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may generate incentives offering discounts and/or donations that are provided only if the number of customers who respond to the incentive exceeds a pre-defined threshold. For example, the discount or donation may be provided only if the number of customers who appear at a particular location exceeds the threshold, e.g., as determined by real-time monitor <b>606</b>. Alternatively, the discount or donation may be provided only if the number of customers who conduct particular transactions exceeds a pre-defined threshold, as determined by processing transaction data. In some cases, the discount or donation may be provided only if the customers, individually or collectively, conduct transactions having a spending amount exceeding a pre-defined threshold. In some cases, the discount or donation may be provided only if a required number of customers respond to the incentive within a specified time period.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0357">Providing incentives that require a minimum number of customers to respond may improve the response rate, as customers may wish to be part of a group of like-minded customers. Further, such incentives may cause customer to encourage others (e.g., friends or social networking contacts) to respond to the incentive, thereby creating a beneficial viral effect.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0358">In one example application, recommendation engine <b>60</b> generates incentives that target customers having an interest in supporting charities or other philanthropic causes, for which donations are provided to the cause(s) only if the number of customers who respond to the incentive exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Responding customers may be collectively referred to as a &#x201c;care mob&#x201d;. In some cases, incentivizing formation of such &#x201c;care mobs&#x201d; may improve the amount of donations for supported causes.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0359">Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may identify customers having an interest in supporting charities or other philanthropic causes on the basis of the customers activity on social networking platforms (e.g., liking a page for a charitable cause), or the activity of the customers friends on such platforms. Such interest may also be determined on the basis of the customers classification into a particular customer profile category (e.g., a Giver persona).</p><p id="p-0363" num="0360">Such interest may also be explicitly expressed by customers. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>A</figref> depicts an example screen of a user interface displayable on the customers mobile device. As depicted, this user interface allows a customer to specify interest in supporting particular causes. A customer may specify interest in one or more causes.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0361">The user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>A</figref> also allows a customer to select, for each cause, whether or not electronic notification should be provided when an incentive is being offered to the customer that benefits that cause. Such notification may be provided to the customer in the form of a pop-up notification displayed on the users mobile device, an e-mail, an SMS message, or the like. Further, a customer may select the proportional split of donations across the multiple causes. As will be appreciated, this split selection may be used by loyalty system <b>26</b> to determine the relative preference or degree of support of the customer for various causes.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0362"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>B</figref> depicts an example screen of a user interface that shows the incentives that have been offered in association with a particular charity. Incentives may be ordered chronologically. The user interface allows each of the incentives to be selected by a customer; the user interface may present further information regarding a selected incentive in response to such selection.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0363"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>C</figref> depicts an example screen of an e-mail providing further information regarding a particular incentive. The depicted incentive offers a 20% donation of a customers purchase to a particular charity. However, the donation is only made if the number of customers who respond to the incentive within a specified time period (between 5 &#x3bc;m to 11 pm on August 11) is greater than a specified threshold (25 customers). As depicted, the customer is encouraged to spread notice of the incentive to others (e.g., by way of social networking platforms).</p><p id="p-0367" num="0364">Incentives may also be presented to customers based on geographic proximity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>D</figref>. In particular, incentives may be presented on a map showing the location of the customer and the location where incentives are being offered. Optionally, this map may also show the locations of other customers to whom incentives have been offered. Thus, for example, this map may indicate that a large number of customers are nearby and that a &#x201c;care mob&#x201d; is forming. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may be configured to provide locations of customers only upon requesting and receiving permission to do so. A customer may select an incentive shown on this map to receive further information regarding the incentive, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0365">In some embodiments, the value of the incentive, e.g., the percentage of a customers purchase to be donated to a charity may be dynamically set by loyalty system <b>26</b> based on the number of customers who respond to the incentive (i.e., the size of the &#x201c;care mob&#x201d;). For example, the value of the incentive may be increased when certain thresholds of participation are met: e.g., 5% when 5 customers respond to the incentive, 10% when 20 customers respond to the incentive, 20% when 50 customers respond to the incentive, and so on.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">E-Statements</heading><p id="p-0369" num="0366">In some embodiments, loyalty system <b>26</b> may include or be interconnected with a system for generating financial card statements. In such embodiments, incentives may be presented in in financial card statements.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0367">Incentives provided by loyalty system <b>26</b> may be included in online financial card statements (which may be referred to as &#x201c;e-statements&#x201d;) accessible by cardholders through a website (e.g., operated by a card issuer). Incentives may also be included in offline statements sent to cardholders in paper form. As will be appreciated, incentives included in offline statements are generally selected incentives offered for a time period that accommodates any mailing delays.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0368"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> shows an example online statement, generated in accordance with an example embodiment. As shown, the left side of the statement include a list of transactions, consistent with a conventional statement. However, as shown, the statement also includes on its right side incentives targeting the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0369">Incentives included in a financial card statement may be selected or generated to target the cardholder in any of the manners described herein. So, in an embodiment, the incentives included in a financial card statement are incentives selected or generated to target the customer profile categories determined for the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0370">In some embodiments, incentives may be presented in association with a transaction listed in the statement. Incentives may be presented in association with each transaction listed in the statement. In the statement, incentives may be presented proximate to (e.g., immediately adjacent to) associated transactions.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0371">Incentives presented in association with a particular transaction may be select on the basis of a relationship between the incentive and that transaction. For example, the incentive may be an incentive offered by a merchant involved in the associated transaction. The incentive may also be an inventive offered by a complementary merchant. For example, if the transaction relates to a travel agency, the incentive may be offered for a merchant that sells luggage. Similarly, if the transaction relates to a merchant that sells business attire, the incentive may be offered for a tailor shop or a haberdashery store. The incentive may also be an incentive offered by a competing merchant.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0372">The incentive may also be an incentive offered for a product that is similar or related to the product of the associated the transaction. For example, the incentive may be offered for a competitors product.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0373">The statement may also provide information regarding whether any discounts or donations were provided for a particular transaction listed in the statement. For example, the statement may indicate how the donation was used. The statement may also indicate the total donation amount generated by the merchant with whom the transaction was conducted, or the total donation amount generated by all merchants, or the relative ranking of merchants based on donation amounts generated. The statement may also highlight transactions that generated donations for causes that the cardholder has expressed interest in supporting (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>A</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Transaction Processing</heading><p id="p-0377" num="0374">Reference will now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, which provides a schematic diagram of aspects of an example system <b>300</b> for processing a transaction.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0375">The system <b>300</b> can include a transaction initiating device <b>310</b> such as, for example, a point-of-service terminal, a computer, a mobile device, a cash register, an automated teller machine, or any other wired or wireless device suitable for generating and/or communicating transaction data to a transaction processing system <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0376">The transaction processing system <b>350</b> can be any combination of systems, servers, computers, or other devices for processing a transaction.

The merchants could have the ability to review aggregated analytic data about members spending at their store(s) based on member demographics, time and/or purchase amounts.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0390">Tier 2: Merchants/merchant brands automatically have access to all customers associated with a card issuer (e.g. all MasterCard cardholders) unless the cardholders opt out of the program. Analytic data available for tier 2 could include cardholder information (e.g. new customer, existing customer, reintroduced customer after a period of inactivity), and basic customer demographics (e.g. age, gender, postal/zip code).</p><p id="p-0394" num="0391">Tier 3: Merchants have all the tier 2 functionality and data access as well as the ability to generate rewards/incentives/discounts for certain cardholder profiles.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0392">Other additional features which could be grouped or enabled separately can include:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0393">advanced reward functionality which can suggest rewards/offers based on data analysis of the merchant's customers and/or historical data;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0394">feedback tool which generates surveys for electronic delivery to customers using default program-generated questions;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0395">advanced feedback tool which allows merchants to select or create custom survey questions;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0396">advanced data analytics which provides merchants with additional customer and transaction information, and/or analytics which can identify slow and busy times, valuable vs. infrequent customers, unhappy customers for rescuing, etc.; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0397">timely/proximal rewards&#x2014;in some examples, rewards may be generated only when members are within a certain distance of the merchant, or during a certain time period identified by the merchant.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0396" num="0398">In some example embodiments, the loyalty system <b>26</b> and/or transaction processing system <b>350</b> can charge an incremental fee based on the a profile group of the customers the merchant can target with rewards/offers/incentives/etc. in the loyalty system. For example, if the merchant wishes to target a specific customer profile group, the merchant may be provided access to generate rewards for those customers and can incur an incremental transaction fee any time a customer in the profile group completes a transaction with the merchant. This fee may apply to any customer in the profile group irrespective of whether a reward was actually offered to the specific customer involved in the transaction.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0399">For example, if a merchant wishes to have the ability to generate offers to any member with a &#x201c;gold&#x201d; credit card, the merchant would opt-in to this option in the loyalty system <b>26</b>. Once enabled, any transaction with the merchant involving a &#x201c;gold&#x201d; member would trigger an incremental fee. In another example, a merchant wishing to access any member with a &#x201c;platinum&#x201d; credit card would opt-in to this option, and any transaction involving &#x201c;platinum&#x201d; member would trigger an incremental fee. This fee may be the same or different than the incremental fee for the &#x201c;gold&#x201d; credit card. In some examples, a member who has a &#x201c;platinum&#x201d; and a &#x201c;gold&#x201d; credit card associated with their account may still trigger a &#x201c;platinum&#x201d; incremental fee even when paying with their &#x201c;gold&#x201d; card.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0400">In some examples, the incremental fees may be capped such that they may not exceed a pre-defined threshold for a given time period (e.g., one month, one year, etc.).</p><p id="p-0399" num="0401">In some examples, transaction processing system <b>350</b> may identify transactions conducted by new customers, and an incremental fee may be charged to merchants for such customers. Transaction processing system <b>350</b> and/or loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide the merchant with information regarding how many new customers conducted transactions at the business, how much money those new customers spent, and what motivated those new customers to conduct those transactions (e.g., whether the new customers were motivated particular incentives).</p><p id="p-0400" num="0402">While the above example illustrates a simple profile grouping based on members having certain type of credit cards, profile groups can be based on any one or combination of factors such as average spend, BIN range (which can identify credit card type, issuer, etc.), credit score, household income, etc.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0403">In some examples, customer profile groupings may be the customer profile categories (personas) described above. For example, a merchant may have the ability to generate offers to any member classified as a Gamer.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0404">In some examples, factors such as average spends may be customized to certain merchant categories to be more relevant to the merchant. For example, if the merchant is a restaurant, it may be more relevant for the merchant to be able to target a customer profile group based on the group's average spend at restaurants.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0405">In some examples, customers may fall within multiple groupings. For example, in the scenario above, a customer having multiple credit cards may fall within a &#x201c;gold&#x201d; profile grouping and a &#x201c;platinum&#x201d; profile grouping.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0406">In some examples, a merchant may subscribe to multiple profile groupings.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0407">In some examples, customer analytics may only be provided for the members who fall within the profile group(s) that the merchant opts into.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0408">In some examples, loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide subscription recommendations to merchants. For example, a merchant who operates a golf course may be matched to a grouping of customers on the basis that past transactions of those customers show that they typically spend $75 per transaction at golf courses. In some examples, loyalty system <b>26</b> provides subscription recommendations on the basis of classification of merchants into particular merchant profile categories, and classification of customers into particular customer profile categories as described above. As noted, a particular merchant profile category may be matched a particular customer profile category. So, loyalty system <b>26</b> may recommend that a merchant in that particular merchant profile category subscribe to the matched customer profile category.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0409">Reference will now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> which provides a flowchart diagram of an example method <b>400</b> for processing a transaction.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0410">At <b>310</b>, one or more processors at the transaction processing system can be configured to receive transaction data. The transaction data can correspond to a transaction for processing between a customer and a merchant via the transaction processing system <b>350</b>. In some examples, the transaction data can be generated at a transaction initiating device <b>310</b>. The transaction initiating device <b>310</b> may receive as one or more input(s) or otherwise customer information such as a customer identifier, account number or customer payment information such as credit/debit card number, an expiry date, security code(s), or any other information required to conduct a transaction with the customer. In some examples, the customer information can include a transaction token or other identifier which can be linked back to the customer by the system. In some embodiments, this transaction token or other identifier can be a single-use token, a time-limited token, or any other temporary or dynamically generated token. In some examples, customer information can include information regarding a mobile device associated with the customer. In some examples, the mobile device associated with the customer can generate transaction tokens, or provide other customer information such as identifiers or location information.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0411">In some examples, the transaction initiating device <b>310</b> may be configured to generate or receive (for example, as a manual input, via a merchant system, or otherwise) transaction information such as a transaction amount, transaction type (e.g. purchase/return), transaction time/date, information regarding the goods/services purchased, etc.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0412">In some examples, the transaction initiating device <b>310</b> may be configured to store, generate or receive merchant information such as a merchant identification (MID) code.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0413">The transaction initiating device <b>310</b>, upon receipt of a request to initiate a transaction, can generate signals for transferring transaction data to the transaction processing system <b>350</b>. The transaction data can include customer information, transaction information, and merchant information. For example, a non-limiting example of transaction data can include a transaction amount, a time/date, an MID, a customer card number, a card expiry date, and a card security code.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0414">Upon receipt of the transaction data, one or more processors in the transaction processing system <b>350</b> can be configured to authenticate or clear the transaction. For example, the payment processor <b>330</b> or other component perform do secure checks or verify the validity of the transaction request, and the card issuer system <b>38</b> or other component can verify the funds or credit available to the account associated with the customer from which the transaction funds are being requested.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0415">After, or concurrently with the clearing and validation of the transaction, one or more processors at the transaction processing system <b>350</b> may be configured to access merchant and/or customer data. In some examples, accessing the data can include sending a request to the loyalty system <b>26</b>, merchant system <b>40</b>, data storage device(s) <b>32</b>, the card issuer system <b>38</b>, the transaction initiating device <b>310</b>, or any other device or system which has access to this information; and receiving a response or other message including the requested data. In some examples, the merchant and/or customer data may be stored within the transaction processing system <b>350</b> such as in the acquiring bank system <b>320</b>, the card issuer system <b>38</b>, data storage device(s) <b>32</b>, or otherwise, and can be accessed without any external requests. The merchant and customer data can be stored or accessible at different systems. For example, the merchant data may be stored at the acquiring bank system, and the customer information may be stored at the card issuer system.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0416">In some examples, the merchant data can include the loyalty package/group of features/data, or individual features/data to which the merchant subscribes. In some examples, the merchant data can include a donation rate (percentage of total transaction or flat fee per transaction) to which the merchant has agreed.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0417">The customer data can include, for example, a profile grouping to which the customer belongs. In some examples, the customer and/or merchant data can include information regarding whether the transaction was triggered by a reward/incentive/discount in the loyalty program. In some examples rewards/incentives/discounts may cause additional charitable donations to be made (e.g. merchant doubles charity donations for purchases over $100).</p><p id="p-0416" num="0418">Transaction processing system <b>350</b> may be configured to pay donation amounts to donees upon processing each transaction. Alternatively, transaction processing system <b>350</b> may be configured to aggregate charitable donations over pre-defined time periods and to pay the aggregated amounts to donees at the end of those time periods (e.g., at the end of each month).</p><p id="p-0417" num="0419">Upon accessing the merchant and/or customer data, one or more processors in the transaction processing system <b>350</b> can be configured to determine loyalty program interchange fee(s) for the transaction based on the merchant and/or customer data. This loyalty program interchange fee may be in addition or otherwise combined with any other interchange fees associated with the transaction. The determination of the loyalty interchange fee may occur after or concurrently with the clearing and verification of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0420">The loyalty program interchange fee(s) can be flat fees, tiered fees (e.g. different flat fees for different transaction ranges) or percentages of the transaction (e.g. basis points) deducted from the funds that would otherwise be transferred to the merchant's account as part of the clearing of the transaction. For example, a merchant who has signed up for tier 2 of the loyalty program may have an interchange fee of X basis points, and an additional Y basis points if the transaction involved a customer who falls within a profile grouping to which the merchant subscribes. Z basis points may be additionally deducted for an agreed charitable donation.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0421">The determination of the interchange fee for loyalty program tier or individual feature/data access can involve matching the program tier or feature/data access with an associated interchange fee.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0422">The determination of the interchange fee for customer groupings can include determining whether the merchant subscribes (i.e. can generate rewards targeting, or can access analytics pertaining) to a particular customer profile grouping, and then a determination of whether the customer account in associated with a customer falling within that grouping.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0423">The determination of the interchange fee for customer donations can include a base donation rate or flat fee associated with the merchant.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0424">In some examples, the determination of the various loyalty interchange fees may be cumulative. In some examples, the loyalty interchange fees may be increased when the transaction is matched to an offered reward/offer/discount/etc. provided to the customer by the merchant via the loyalty program. In one example, the interchange fee may be doubled or increased by N basis points when the transaction is matched to an offered reward. In another example, a matched reward may be for a double donation which would double the portion of the loyalty interchange fee associated with a charitable donation.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0425">At <b>440</b>, one or more processors at the transaction processing system <b>350</b> can be configured to generate signals for accruing the loyalty interchange fee. In some examples, this can include deducting a portion of all of the loyalty interchange fee from the balance of funds to be accrued to the merchant's account.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0426">Merchant system <b>40</b> is operable to display various interfaces to interact with loyalty system <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0427"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example screen of a merchant dashboard <b>200</b>. The merchant dashboard <b>200</b> displays various reports in a tile configuration to give the merchant a snapshot of various features and functionalities. Dashboard <b>200</b> and other interfaces described herein may be presented as one or more web pages. As such loyalty system <b>26</b> may include a conventional HTTP server application (e.g., Apache HTTP Server, nginx, Microsoft IIS, or the like) adapting loyal system <b>26</b> to present dashboard <b>200</b> and other interfaces to users operating web-enabled computing devices.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0428">The AT A GLANCE panel (1) offers a graphical bar-chart providing a comparison of published and redeemed rewards (which may be referred to as incentives). Alongside the graph are the numerical values associated with each item. Clicking anywhere in the tile displays a detailed summary of the rewards, or an incentive list.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0429">The DURATION DROP DOWN control (2) provides the merchant with options for adjusting the time period during which the displayed information pertains. For example, the time period may be &#x201c;last 30 days&#x201d;. When the merchant selects an option, the page updates to reflect that time period. If a merchant has only been on the program for 2 days their default will be &#x201c;last 7 days&#x201d;, until the loyalty system <b>26</b> has more data available.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0430">The REVENUE &#x26; GIVING panel (3) offers 4 dynamic data fields, for the selected time-period. These include: Reward Revenue; Average per Transaction amount; Program Revenue shows total transactions (including reward related transactions); and Sent to Charity. As will be explained herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, loyalty system <b>26</b> may provide additional functionality relating to charities and donations. For example, an incentive may provide that a merchant may make a donation to a charity for each transaction during a particular time period. This may incent customers to transact with the merchant for that time period if they are interested in supporting a particular charity. The charity may be in the same geographic area as the merchant and customer which may increase community support. A summary of the total amount provided to a charity for the time period may be shown as part of dashboard <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0431">There are trending indicators that indicate how this data is currently performing in relation to the previously selected time period, i.e. last 30 days in this wireframe. For example, an up arrow indicates the current figures are higher than previous corresponding time-period and a down arrow indicates the current figures are lower than previous corresponding time-period.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0432">Clicking anywhere in the tile may trigger the display of a Trends Performance page.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0433">The FEEDBACK panel (4) offers aggregated feedback corresponding to feedback from customers, i.e. Loved it, Liked it, Disliked it, and Hated it. Clicking anywhere in the tile may trigger the display of a Merchant Reviews List page.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0434">The ALERTS panel (5) offers the most recent alerts. An alert may be associated with a trigger defining a business rule or threshold. An alert engine may mine and process the system data to determine whether a trigger is met and generates the associated alert. The triggers may relate to trends. The business rules and thresholds for alert triggers may be default values or may be user configurable. Accordingly, the ALERTS panel (5) may display triggered alerts. Alerts provide a notification to a user of system (e.g. a merchant) regarding data analytics, observed trends, events, and so on. The alert notification may include one or more suggested objectives for an incentive, one or more suggested incentives, trends, and other information regarding customers and transactions.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0435">For example, trend alerts may be generated to identify time ranges or days of the week when the merchant is historically not busy (e.g. by analyzing data for the merchant or data averages from other similar businesses and merchants). The alert may include suggested incentives targeting the time ranges or days of the week when the merchant is historically not busy.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0436">Alerts may be generated to notify the merchant of an occurrence of an event, such as negative feedback received via reviews, social media platforms, and so on. An alert for negative feedback or other event may or may not include a reward suggestion.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0437">Trend alerts may be generated to notify the merchant of a customer who has achieved a high spending threshold. The high spending threshold may relate to a single visit or may aggregate spending from multiple visits for a predefined or infinite period of time. An alert for negative feedback may or may not include a reward suggestion.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0438">Trend alerts may be generated to notify the merchant of a customer who has achieved a high number of visits threshold. The high number of visits threshold may be compared to an aggregated number of visits over a predefined or infinite period of time.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0439">Trend alerts may also be generated to notify the merchant of a particular customer who has not visited the merchant's store within a pre-defined time period, signaling that the merchant may be at risk of losing that customer. Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may automatically recommend an incentive to that merchant targeting the customer designed to prevent the loss of that customer.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0440">Trend alerts may also be generated to notify the merchant of special occasions for a particular customer (e.g., a birthday). Recommendation engine <b>60</b> may automatically recommend an incentive to that merchant targeting the customer designed to acknowledge the special occasion (e.g., an incentive for a high-end restaurant).</p><p id="p-0439" num="0441">In some example embodiments, trend alerts and/or incentives may be generated based on data aggregated for a particular customer profile category (persona).</p><p id="p-0440" num="0442">In some example embodiments, trend alerts and/or incentives may be generated and provided to merchants classified into a particular merchant profile category.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0443">In some example embodiments, data for generating trend alerts and/or incentives can be continually monitored so as to encompass new transaction data and/or feedback as it is received in real time or otherwise, and to potentially generate a new trend alert and/or incentive as soon as new transaction data and/or feedback data is received.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0444">In some examples, data for generating trend alerts and/or incentives can be continually monitored as time passes to provide timely time-based alerts and/or incentives. This continual monitoring can include continually updating trends and statistics based on defined time periods such as 30-day trends, seasonal trends, weekly trends, hourly trends, day of the week trends, time of day trends, etc. In some examples, continual time monitoring can generate an alert when a particular customer or group of customers has not made a transaction in the last X days.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0445">Similar to the criteria received for incentive generation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, in some embodiments, criteria for generating trend alerts may be received via a user interface or otherwise to define one or more triggers. Other triggers may be predefined by the system and may be enabled or disabled by an administrator.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0446">These are non-limiting examples and other alerts may be triggered and generated by system.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0447">The panel may only display a few alerts of all available alerts. For example, 3/10 is an indicator of the number of alerts shown in the tile vs. total alerts. Clicking one of the alerts displays may trigger the display of an alert page. Clicking the title bar may trigger the display of a Manage Alert List. If no Alerts are available, a &#x201c;no alerts&#x201d; message displays in the tile.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0448">The TOP PERFORMING REWARDS panel (6) is a mini list-control module of the Manage Rewards page. The list shows the top 5 most redeemed rewards in the selected timeframe (in this image: 30 days). This enables the merchant to view successful rewards (e.g. incentives). The successful rewards may be used by loyalty system <b>26</b> to recommend rewards and incentives to tailor and customize a loyalty program for the merchant. Clicking one of the rewards may trigger the display of a corresponding Reward Details page. Clicking the Top Performing Rewards title bar displays Rewards List page, for example. If no Active Rewards are available, a button to &#x2018;create a reward&#x2019; displays.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0449">The CUSTOMERS panel (7) provides a pie-chart view of new vs returning customers. There are three numerical values represented here: new, returning, and total number of customers. There is a trending indicator next to total customers that describes if there has been an increase or decrease in customers during the selected time period. Clicking anywhere in the tile may trigger the display of a Trends Demographics page.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0450">The LOCATION DROP DOWN: item (8) at the top, in this example, gives a default selection of All Locations. Selecting a particular location displays reviews for that location only. A merchant may have stores in multiple locations. When the merchant has only one location, the location drop-down may not be shown. The Location selection persists on the Dashboard <b>200</b>, even if another Location is selected on a different page (i.e. Trends Performance) Locations may be sorted by the street address.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0451">Accordingly, the dashboard <b>200</b> provides a summary report of data collected and managed by loyalty system <b>26</b>. The merchant reporting tool <b>66</b> may be used to provide data to loyalty system <b>26</b> and received data from loyalty system <b>26</b>. The dashboard <b>200</b> enables a merchant to easily and effectively review aspects and results of one or more loyalty programs. This a non-limiting example and other configurations and controls may be provided by dashboard <b>200</b>. A merchant may tailor and customize dashboard.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0452"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example interface for creating incentives for one or more loyalty programs. An incentive may be referred to herein as a reward or a benefit. The example interface provides four example types of incentives that may be created: (a) Alerts (e.g. recommended incentives based on data analysis, trends based on thresholds, trends based on events), (b) Custom; (c) Event-Driven, and (d) Create From Sample. The example interface asks the user the question &#x201c;What Type of Reward Would You Like to Create?&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0451" num="0453">Selecting &#x201c;CUSTOM&#x201d; displays an objectives screen for selecting an objective for the custom incentive.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0454"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example interface for choosing an objective for the custom incentive. The example interface provides three sample button items to select from to Choose an Objective for the Reward (e.g. Incentive):</p><p id="p-0453" num="0455">Item (1) Increase Spending Button.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0456">Item (2) Bring in New Customers Button.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0457">Item (3) Start from Scratch Button (e.g. a custom objective can be entered).</p><p id="p-0456" num="0458">For the custom objective a user may start creating a reward without any pre-selected fields.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0459"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate an example interface for targeting customers with the incentive. The interface displays a demographics screen to enable the user to target particular customers with their incentive. The demographics include particular attributes about customers.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0460">For example, the Demographics screen allows Merchants to target a reward to a specific group of cardholders, members, or customers. The population defined at this screen determines which Members are eligible to receive the reward in this example.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0461">The interface enables to merchant user to filter the population based on selected customer attributes. Filters are displayed and hidden depending on the chosen objective. In some examples, only relevant filters are displayed. The visual displays the default filter order.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0462">Item 1 illustrates a graph and descriptive text guide to assist the user in understanding what customer segment they should target. This is based on the objective chosen for the incentive. The graph may be a data visualization that displays the recommended target segment. In some examples, creating an objective from scratch may not have a graph and descriptive text. The example graph may illustrate the average monthly spending for customers, such as less than $10, between $10-$50, between $50-$100, and over $100. This may enable a merchant user to tailor the award based on the average spending of customers. For example, the merchant may want to target customers that spend between $50-$100 monthly with an incentive. Average monthly spending is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0463">Item 2 enables selection of a Customer Type filter to allow merchants to define/limit the general group of customers that will receive a specific incentive. Existing customers are Members that have previously purchased from the Merchant. Potential customers are Members that have never purchased from the Merchant but are in the Merchant's region(s). Customer type is another example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0464">Item 3 enables selection of a Gender filter to allow merchants to limit the reward recipients to the chosen gender(s). Gender is a further example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0465">Item 4 enables selection of a Age filter to allow merchants to limit the reward recipients to the chosen age groups. A business rule may implement the filtering mechanism. Age is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0466">Item 5 enables selection of a distance from store filter to allow merchants to limit reward recipients by the distance of their home address from a store location. The maximum distance from a location may be the region (State) it is located in. Distance from store is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0467">Item 6 enables selection of a Customer Experience Feedback Filter to allow merchants to limit reward recipients by how they rated their experience for a location or multiple locations. &#x201c;No Feedback&#x201d; indicates customers who have not left any feedback for that business. This may only be displayed if &#x201c;Existing&#x201d; customer type is selected and &#x201c;Potential&#x201d; is unselected, as potential customers may not have provided any feedback. Customer Feedback is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0468">Item 7 enables selection of an Average Monthly Spending filter to allow merchants to limit the reward recipients by their monthly average amount spent at the Merchant. This may only be displayed if &#x201c;Existing&#x201d; customer type is selected and &#x201c;Potential&#x201d; is unselected. Average Monthly Spending is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0469">Item 8 enables selection of a Customer visits filter to allow merchants to limit reward recipients by their number of visits. This allows targeting of customers based on how many times they have visited a business. This may only be displayed if &#x201c;Existing&#x201d; customer type is selected and &#x201c;Potential&#x201d; is unselected. Customer visits is an example customer or cardholder attribute.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0470">Item 9 enables selection of a Total spent filter to allow merchants to limit reward recipients by the total amount they have spent at one or more location.

This functionality may be conditional on the Merchant categories and sub-categories being able to match the Member preferred store categories.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0474">Business rules may govern the display of the summary pane. For example, if the summary pane fits on the screen, it may lock at the top when a user starts scrolling down so it has 10 px spacing between its top edge and the top of the screen. When a user scrolls all the way to the top, it relaxes so it does not cover the navigation. If the summary pane does not fit on the screen, it may lock to the bottom of the screen when a user starts scrolling so that there is 10 px spacing between the buttons below the pane and the bottom of the screen. It should never overlap the footer either.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0475"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref> illustrates further examples of demographics summary panes providing a summary view of demographics (e.g. attributes) of the targeted customers for a reward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref> further illustrates a settings summary pane providing a summary view of settings for a reward.

The default value in this example is Single (e.g. available for a single time). Any changes may be retained for the duration that the screen is displayed. Switching between Single and Repeating rewards displays the previously chosen values for each type.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0514">Item 1.2 provides an Active Date. The default value may be the current date. This sets the date that the reward will become active. Both single and repeating rewards types start at this date.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0515">Item 1.3 provides a Schedule Description, which may be a dynamic text string that displays the date and time the single reward will expire.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0516">Item 1.4 provides an Active Time. The default value may be the beginning of the current hour. This works in conjunction with the Active Date to set the date and time that the reward will be published to customers and becomes active. The time drop down gives times in 1 hour increments e.g. 1:00 am, 2:00 am . . . 11:00 &#x3bc;m, 12:00 pm. All dates and times may be based on the merchant's time zone.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0517">Item 1.5 provides an Active period. The default value for single and repeating rewards may be one week. This may be the amount of time (e.g. period of time) the reward is active. The text entry box will only allow entry of integers greater than 0. The values in the dropdown are: Day(s) and Week(s).</p><p id="p-0509" num="0518"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> illustrates an interface screen for customizing a reward schedule where the reward is a repeating reward (e.g. may be available multiple times). The example interface illustrates five example configurations.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0519">The repeating of an reward allows the Merchant to automatically set a reward to re-publish on a regular basis. Repeating creates a new reward that is almost identical to the original, the only difference would be the publish and expiration date. The first reward becomes active on the start date and all subsequent rewards occur after the first reward has expired. Repeating rewards may not overlap.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0520">Item 2 provides an Active Date. For repeating rewards the Final Activation date may be highlighted in the date picker for the Active Date.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0521">Item 2.1 sets a repeating occurrence schedule. The default value may be &#x201c;Every week&#x201d; when Repeating reward is selected. This determines how often a reward will repeat. This value is always greater than the Active Period value. Options that are less than the Active Period may be disabled.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0522">If the Merchant changes the Active Period value, the repeating occurrence schedule value may be re-set to an option that is equal to or greater than the Active Period value. Options include Every week; Every 2 weeks; Every Month; Every 3 months; Every 6 months.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0523">Item 2.2 provides a Weekly Repeats Text. This value automatically updates to match the day of the week that the merchant selects as their Active Date.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0524">For example, if 04/06/2012 is a Friday &#x201c;Every 2 weeks [selected] &#x2018;on Friday&#x2019;&#x201d;. This is calculated as &#x3c;same day of the week as the selected Active Date&#x3e;. When the merchant switches the &#x2018;Active date&#x2019; to the 7th, the text changes to &#x2018;on Saturday&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0516" num="0525">Item 2.3 provides a Final Activation Date. Default value may be 6 months from the current date. This sets the last day that the reward can be repeated. This does not include the Active period. For example, a reward could repeat on the Final Activation Date and would still be active for the duration of the Active period. The Final Activation Date may not be set to precede the Active Date. The Active Date may be highlighted in the Date picker for the Final Activation Date.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0526">Item 2.4 provides a Schedule Description, which may be a dynamic text string that displays repeating occurrence schedules and the count of rewards that will become active between the Active Date and the Final Activation Date.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0527"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> displays an interface screen fora preview of the custom incentive.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0528">The Review and Publish screen allows Merchants to preview the reward, and publish the reward to customers.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0529">Item 1 provides a reward preview button where selection changes the type of preview that is displayed in the preview area.

As another example, pressing the &#x2018;dismiss&#x2019; button may update the status of an alert. &#x2018;New&#x2019; and &#x2018;past&#x2019; are examples only and other statuses may be &#x2018;saved&#x2019;, &#x2018;flag&#x2019;, and so on, so merchants will be able to view alerts in detail while bookmarking them for later action.</p><p id="p-0588" num="0595">Loyalty system <b>26</b> is operable to identify trends (also referred to as alerts) using data analytic techniques and a rules engine defining rules for thresholds, events, and so on. An example event for alert notification includes customer feedback.</p><p id="p-0589" num="0596">An alert may also provide an automated suggested reward (event-driven rewards). Merchants may receive notifications about automated rewards that are sent out on their behalf based on system events (for example, event-driven one such as system recognition of a demographic gap) or a merchant-set schedule (for example, a repeated reward). The types of events that merchants will be able to create automated rewards (via e.g. rules managed by the rules engine) for include negative feedback related reward, frequent visits reward, spending threshold reward, and so on.</p><p id="p-0590" num="0597">The interface for alerts and rewards may provide a summary of the rewards sent and redeemed. When rewards are sent out on behalf of a merchant notification may be added to the interface as an alert, for example. The interface may show all rewards sent, with the most recent one at the top, for example. Rewards that are automatically sent may be indicated with an icon or other indicia to set them apart from other rewards.</p><p id="p-0591" num="0598">A merchant may receive negative feedback and a reward may be automatically sent to the provider of the feedback. There may be a verification mechanism to ensure that this is not manipulated by a customer to receive additional rewards or incentives based on false feedback.</p><p id="p-0592" num="0599">A merchant may click on the icon related to the feedback reward alert to view the details page and from there can create a Reward or Automated reward to respond. For example, a merchant may set up automated reward for &#x2018;negative feedback&#x2019; and when the merchant receives a new instance of negative feedback a reward is sent out on the merchant's behalf. There may be a &#x2018;history&#x2019; section where the merchant sees when and why a reward was sent on his behalf.</p><p id="p-0593" num="0600">There may be various interfaces to collect and display the various types of notifications or alerts, such as for each of the specific type of notification (e.g. automated rewards alerts, feedback alerts, system-identified trends for, gaps in demographics trend alerts, slow time trend alerts, and so on. Trends may be identified based on comparison data from the merchant over time, and compared with merchants in their region, or historical data for the same merchant, and so on.</p><p id="p-0594" num="0601">There may be a dedicated interface for trends alerts observed by the loyalty system <b>26</b> such as slow time and gap in demographics, negative feedback trends (e.g. x times of negative feedback received within timeframe y, or in a more generic way such as &#x2018;Change in review feedback rating&#x2019;). Loyalty system <b>26</b> calculates gender related alert algorithms based on male and female gender designations in order to trigger alerts about gaps in coverage of the market segment. This may ensure that only cardholders in the gender groups are factored into alerts. Cardholders within the group may not be accounted for as a distinct group in demographic alerts.</p><p id="p-0595" num="0602">There may also be an event alert interface, such as for customer feedback. Merchants may receive notifications when new customer feedback has been received. The loyalty system <b>26</b> may not discriminate between the nature of the feedback received (in other words, it may not count only &#x2018;hate&#x2019; responses or only &#x2018;love&#x2019; responses). Any time a new piece of feedback is received, a notification counter on the &#x2018;feedback&#x2019; module within the merchant dashboard may increase. In other embodiments, an alert may be generated for specific types of feedback (e.g. negative). The merchant can view the review and decide to send a reward to an individual or to create an event-driven (automated) reward.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0603">An alert may be triggered by the loyalty system <b>26</b> when the percentage of business customers of a particular gender is significantly different than the baseline of cardholders of that gender within the region. An alert may be triggered by the loyalty system <b>26</b> when the percentage of business customers of a particular gender is significantly different than the baseline of cardholders of these respective genders within the region. An alert may be triggered by the loyalty system <b>26</b> if the percentage of business customers of a particular gender and within a particular age range is significantly different than the baseline of cardholders in the region within both groups. An alert may be triggered if the percentage of business customers of a particular gender and within a particular age range is significantly different than the baseline of cardholders in the region within these respective gender groups.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0604">The interface may provide a merchant with a Gap in Demographics Alert and a view a graph representing the number of customers by age group and gender across a period of time so that the merchant can make a decision about creating a Gap in Demographics reward or incentive which may be provided as a recommendation. On the Alert Detail screen for a gap in Demographics alert, a merchant may be able to view a graph representing the number of customers for one store by age group and gender, The Y axis may represent the number of member customers for that merchant. The X axis may represent age by age buckets. For example, age may be grouped as: 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+. Each age group may display two different bar graphs rising vertically from the x axis, associated to gender. A key may be displayed that explains the bar graph that represents each gender bar. For example, one set of bar graphs represents the number of members who are women and are an age that falls within the respective age group range. A second set of bar graphs represents the number of members who are men AND are an age that falls within the respective age group range. The graph pulls data from all member customers of the store who are currently active and have an activation date earlier than an overall time period (e.g. 3 months ago). A gap in demographics may be defined using a rule to trigger generation of an alert. If the percentage of a merchant's customers of a particular gender is significantly different than the baseline of members of that gender within the region, then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may issue an alert to the merchant. If the percentage of a merchant's customers within a particular age range is significantly different than the baseline of members within that age range within the region, then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may issue an alert to the merchant. If the percentage of a merchant's customers within a particular age range AND gender is significantly different than the baseline of members within that age range AND gender within the region, then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may issue an alert to the merchant. These are examples only.</p><p id="p-0598" num="0605">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may use a Chi-square test to test to identify gaps, such as whether the observed percentage of a merchant's customers within a particular group is consistent with the known percentage of customers within that particular group in the region. Let O1 refer to Observed value (# of merchant's customers within a particular group), E1 refer to Expected value (% of customers in region within particular group*merchants total customers), O2 refer to the Merchant total number minus O1, where E2 may equal the Merchant total number minus E1. The chi-square calculation may be based on the following:</p><p id="p-0599" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(O1&#x2212;E1){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2/E1+(O2&#x2212;E2){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2/E2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0600" num="0606">An example illustrative rule may provide that if chi-square is greater than 3.84 and O1 is less than E1 then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may identify Gap in Demographics and generate an alert. This is an example threshold value to indicate a significant difference. In order for chi-square test to be performed, two conditions may be met: merchant must have at least 25 customers AND O1 is less than E1. If merchant has 25 customers and one segment is 0, that segment may be also recognized as a gap.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0607">Demographic gap alerts may be sent out periodically (e.g. weekly) until the gap no longer exists, for example. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may count a member as a merchant's customer if that customer has transacted at that merchant in last 3 months.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0608">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may maintain transaction data from every member at each merchant: number of transactions, dollar spend. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may maintain demographic data for every member: age, gender, zip code. A member may be counted as active if there has been activity either on the account or if there has been a transaction in the last year, or other defined time period.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0609">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may continually identify the baseline demographic distributions for a region. For example, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may calculate a percentage in each age range (0-17, 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+), a percentage male or female, a percentage male or female in each age range (0-17, 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+), and so on. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may calculate demographic distribution for each merchant's customers. As another example, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may calculate a total number in each age range (0-17, 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+), a total number male or female, a total number male or female in each age range (0-17, 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+), a total number of merchant's customers, and so on.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0610">Loyalty system <b>26</b> may generate different types of trend alerts, such as a slow time of day or date of week alert. For a time of day alert, if the average dollar volume per hour for a particular hour of the day is below the overall average dollar volume per hour for all hours, then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may identify a slow time of day and generate an alert. As an illustrative example, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may calculate an overall average number of transactions per hour for all hours for the last 3 months (i.e. total number of transactions/total hours of operation in last 3 months). Loyalty system <b>26</b> may also calculate the average transaction dollar volume per hour that the merchant store is open for last 3 months. (total number of transactions for each 1 hour period across all days in the last 3 months/total number of days that merchant store was open at for that 1 hour period in last 3 months). For a day of the week alert, the loyalty system <b>26</b> may calculate an overall average number of transactions per day for all hours for the last 3 months. (i.e. total number of transactions/total days of operation in last 3 months), as an illustrative example. Loyalty system <b>26</b> may also calculate an average transaction dollar volume per day that the merchant store is open for last 3 months. (total number of transactions for each day of the week the merchant is open across all days in the last 3 months/total number of days that merchant store was open at for that specific day of the week in last 3 months). If the daily average differs from the overall average then the loyalty system <b>26</b> may generate an alert. Calculations may only include the hours within which the merchant store is open for business (i.e. if merchant store is open 9 AM-5 PM on Mondays through Fridays, 9 AM-8 PM on Saturdays, and 10 AM-4 PM on Sundays, only those hours should be used). If there are multiple slow times of day, identify the two with the biggest differences from the average.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0611">Alerts may be issued for each store or merchant periodically, such as once a week until the merchant has taken action or the underlying data has changed and a reported slow period is no longer a slow period.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0612"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> displays an interface screen with further example recommendations or alerts.

The graph may enable a user or loyalty system <b>26</b> to determine slow or off peak times. The chart may display the off peak current data with average data to benchmark different time intervals against the average. Off peak may be defined by a threshold or rule used to trigger the alert.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0614">The interface may provide a merchant view for an Off-Peak Alert, so that the merchant may be able to view a graph of average transactions per hour throughout the business hours of a particular day. This may enable a merchant to make a decision about creating an Off-Peak reward or incentive, or provide merchant with a recommendation. The slow day graph may show: the average dollar spend amount per business hour-of-day over the past overall time period, an average dollar spend amount per business hour, for all business hours over the past overall time period, and an indication where the average per hour-of-day is less than the overall average per day. For example, days of week may be replaced by hours of day. So: Sam-9 am, 9 am-10 am, etc. An Alert Detail screen for an alert may enable a merchant to view a graph representing the average transactions per hour across one day at one merchant store. The y axis may represent average number of transactions. The x axis may represent time of day. Data points for time of day on the x axis may be measured on an hourly basis. Average transactions may be generated using data from the past overall time period. Average transactions per hour that the merchant store is open in a day may be generated using total transactions data and business hour data over the past overall time period (e.g. three months). For example, a total transaction dollar volume for 8 AM/total number of days that merchant store was open at 8 AM in last 3 months.</p><p id="p-0609" num="0615">Business hours for each individual store may be pulled from information entered by the merchant when managing the merchant profile.

Identified Off-Peak hour segments may be highlighted on the graph.</p><p id="p-0610" num="0616">There may be different types of alerts for slow times trends. For example, there may be an alert for a Slow time of day triggered by a rule that indicates, for example, if the average dollar volume per hour for a particular hour of the day is below the overall average dollar volume per hour for all hours, then identify a slow time of day. There may be an alert for a slow day of week.

The potential impending disaster information can include a plurality of scores. Each score can be one or more of: (i) an event impact value representing a relative metric for an extent of the potential impending disaster; (ii) a response value representing a currency amount to remedy or for a relief effort for the potential impending disaster; and (iii) a donation impact value representing a metric for effectiveness of the response value.</p><p id="p-0777" num="0806">Implementations receive potential impending disaster information for a potential impending disaster. The potential impending disaster scores are used to detect at least one redirection trigger. Use of the scores is made by various analytical operations, including at least one of a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, machine learning, predictive analytics, and prediction modeling to analyze the impact value, the response value, and the donation impact value, and thereby derive the at least one redirection trigger from the potential impending disaster information. Upon the detection of the at least one redirection trigger a redirection mode is configured. The purpose of the detecting the need for the redirection mode, and thereafter triggering redirection mode, is to use merchant donations incented by transactions with customers, to fund a preventative operation mode change in a loyalty program. The funding of the preventative operation mode is predicted by the various analytical operations to have the effect of avoiding a potential impending disaster that would otherwise necessitate efforts to rescue, provide relief and to rebuild from the disaster.</p><p id="p-0778" num="0807">The various analytical operations use one of more of a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, machine learning, predictive analytics, and prediction modeling to analyze historical and real-time data in order to identify trends and potential concerns in an identified community while providing recommended initiatives to remedy those concerns. The predictive capabilities of the various analytical operations enables the funding of a preventative measure to be taken before an actual &#x2018;issue&#x2019; occurs. The funding is by way of merchant donations incented by transactions with customers, to fund a preventative operation.</p><p id="p-0779" num="0808">The potential impending disaster information for a potential impending disaster is used to detect a trend and/or concern that is a likely negative outcome. The detection that the negative outcome is likely triggers a preventative operation mode change in the loyalty program. Implementations of the loyalty program incent customers to conduct transactions with merchants, where the incentive is a merchant-defined donation to a customer-selected affinity entity, such as a favorite local community charity. Where there has been a triggering of a preventative operation mode change in the loyalty program, the merchant-defined donations are redirected to fund a preventative operation to avoid a potential impending disaster.</p><p id="p-0780" num="0809">The preventative operation mode change in the loyalty program, which is triggered to fund operations to avoid a potential impending disaster, thereby using the merchant-defined donations to prevent, delay, and/or minimize a negative outcome. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the negative outcome to be prevented, delayed, and/or minimized may be: (i) economic, such as hunger, homelessness, and/or poverty prevention; (ii) a social harm which is to be prevented by funding efforts such as crime prevention or academic failure; (iii) an industrial hazard which is to be prevented by funding efforts such as preventative maintenance against harm, breakdown, and/or accidents; (iv) a health or illness related outcome which is to be prevented by funding efforts such as preventative medicine addressing various pathologies, (v) etc.</p><p id="p-0781" num="0810">In some implementations, governance of the funding and direction of the preventative operations to avoid potential impending disasters can be by way of a fund and/or foundation under control of a trustee who has legally enforceable duties to each of: (i) chartable beneficiaries who are to receive benefits from the preventative operation fund and/or foundation; (ii) merchant benefactors who define transaction-amount based donations to the fund and/or foundation; and (iii) customers who are third party beneficiaries that direct the merchant-defined donations to the chartable beneficiaries. In such implementations, the trustee of the preventative operation fund and/or foundation make uses of legal and/or regulatory authority to direct the funds to an intended beneficiary. Such legal and regulatory authority may limit the trustee to funding an intended beneficiary only as to health, education, and/or welfare of the intended beneficiary. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, twelve (12) customers may want to assist in funding an education savings account whose account holder is an employee of a merchant frequented by the twelve (12) customers. The twelve (12) customers help the employee attend college by designating the education savings account as an chartable beneficiary and then conducting transactions on debit or credit accounts to make purchases from merchants who make merchant-defined donations to the education savings account as an incentive to the twelve (12) customers to conduct transactions with the merchants. In this case, governmental and/or trust instrument regulations permit the trustee to use the merchant-defined donations to fund the education savings account because (i) a social harm of academic failure is likely to be prevented by the employee's use of the funded education savings account for its intended academic purpose; and (ii) the intended beneficiary (e.g., the employee) will be directly benefited in the category of education as permitted a governing trust instrument. By way of further example, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/437,221, titled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Loyalty Programs&#x201d;, filed on Sep. 18, 2015, which has been incorporated herein by reference, incentives can be targeted at customers in various customer groups classified according to the customers' behavioural and/or motivation attributes.</p><p id="p-0782" num="0811">In yet other implementations, such legal and regulatory authority may limit the trustee to funding only governmentally recognized non-profit beneficiaries. In still other implementations, the roll of the trustee may be required to be a governmentally recognized financial institution such as a deposit insured bank.</p><p id="p-0783" num="0812">As previously disclosed herein, upon the detection of the at least one redirection trigger a redirection mode is configured. The purpose of the detecting the need for the redirection mode, and thereafter triggering redirection mode, is to use merchant donations incented by transactions with customers, to fund a preventative operation mode change in a loyalty program. In various implementations, data associated with a transaction between a customer and a merchant is received or accessed. A determination is made from at least one of customer information and merchant information in the data associated with the transaction, where the determination is a donation amount and a location associated with the transaction. When configured to operate in the redirection mode, signals are generated to cause accrual of: (i) at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; and (ii) any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters. In the case of the latter remaining portion of the donation amount, funds are redirected to fund a preventative operation mode change in the loyalty program. Thereafter, optionally, a message can be transmitted to a logical address associated with the customer in the transaction to indicate to the customer that the merchant-defined donation has been redirected for the purpose of preventing an impending potential disaster.</p><p id="p-0784" num="0813">As described herein or otherwise, loyalty programs and associated transactions can trigger donations to one or more charities. In some examples, these donations can be based on a flat fee, a percentage of a transaction amount, or any other donation associated with a transaction. In addition to or as an alternative to the base rate or amount, a larger donation may be triggered based on an incentive, promotion or reward associated with the transaction. For example, a reward may offer to a targeted customer a donation of 20% of his/her next transaction to a charity rather than a default donation rate of 3%.</p><p id="p-0785" num="0814">In some examples, by default, the charity(ies) to which the donation accrues may be associated with a payment account (e.g. a charity-branded credit card), may be associated with the loyalty system (e.g. a charity points program), may be selected by the consumer (e.g. loyalty system may provide options for donating amounts to one or more charities selected by the consumer), or may be selected or identified by any other mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0786" num="0815">In some example embodiments, any number of loyalty cards, programs or systems may be associated with a central loyalty program and/or with a transaction processing system which can generate signals for overriding or otherwise redirecting donation amounts to a particular preventative measure to avoid a negative outcome found to be impending by the analysis of data trends, where the donation amounts are redirected for the purpose of disaster avoidance. For example, causes of particular significance geographically or globally, such as a natural disaster avoidance, industrial accident avoidance, war avoidance, disease avoidance, drought avoidance, flooding avoidance, fire avoidance, or any relatively large scale distress avoidance or need for preventative assistance. For the purposes of this disclosure, any reference to potential impending disaster or any related term is meant to include any causes of particular significance which may lead to an effort to avoid a potential impending disaster determined to be needed by way of analysis of various sources of data trends. Similarly, for the purposes of this disclosure, reference to donations to avoid the need for disaster relief or any related term is meant to include any recovery, aid or anything having a beneficial effect in response to analysis of data trends indicative of a potential impending disaster, including, for example, funds through donations various efforts the service to avoid the need for recovery from a disaster by way of treatments, rescue, personnel, funding, food, water, funding, building, security, transportation, etc.</p><p id="p-0787" num="0816">In some example embodiments, all transactions associated with a member or merchant of a charitable loyalty program such as the examples described above may be subject to redirection.</p><p id="p-0788" num="0817">In some example embodiments, all transactions over a particular transaction processing system (e.g. MasterCard&#x2122; or Visa&#x2122;) which are associated with a member or merchant of a charitable rewards program may be subject to redirection.</p><p id="p-0789" num="0818"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref> shows aspects of an example method for triggering donations for a loyalty system.</p><p id="p-0790" num="0819">At <b>6210</b>, one or more processors in the loyalty system can be configured to detect a redirection trigger.

The redirection trigger can be precipitated by analysis of various data to example trends therein, for example, include receipt of an instruction, a data packet, an email, or any other message. In some examples, the redirection trigger can be detected when a particular variable is set or a condition is satisfied. Generally, a redirection trigger may be generated in response data trends indicative of some sort of potential impending disaster.

In some examples, the processor(s) may determine the location associated with a merchant based on obtained transaction or transaction initiating device information such as a merchant identifier or a device identifier associated with the merchant. In some examples, the processor(s) may determine the location associated with the customer based on obtained transaction or transaction initiating device information such as token or payment identifier associated with the customer, an IP address, GPS, A-GPS or other location data associated with a customer device, etc.</p><p id="p-0803" num="0832">For example, the processor(s) can determine a location by tracing or cross-referencing an identifier or token associated with a transaction, merchant or customer to a physical location, mailing address, region, geolocations, etc. In some examples, tracing or cross-referencing the identifier or token can include searching in one or more databases in the system such as payment processor databases, loyalty system databases, IP address lookup tables, cellular or other access point locations, and the like.</p><p id="p-0804" num="0833">In some examples, processor(s) on a mobile device running a loyalty or payment application, firmware or other code can be configured to transmit location information to the system as part of the payment process or loyalty program. For example, a mobile device involved in a transaction using a mobile device payment platform may include GPS or other location data, IP addresses, etc. as part of the transaction process or as part of the loyalty program. In other examples, the transaction initiating device or customer device may not explicitly provide any location information with the transaction data; however, the transaction system may be configured to determine a location associated with the transaction based on an IP address from which the transaction or other data was sent.</p><p id="p-0805" num="0834">In some embodiments, the location information can be obtained in real or near-real time as the transaction is being processed. For example, location information can be received from transaction data as it is being processed by the transaction processing system. In some embodiments, location information obtained directly from a transaction initiating device, a purchaser device, and/or merchant device can be obtained concurrently with or within a short time period of a transaction being initiated or completed. For example, processor(s) ata transaction initiating device, a purchaser device, and/or merchant device may obtain GPS or other location data as part of the loyalty program. In some examples, a loyalty and/or payment application operating on a purchaser device may record location information for the device when a transaction is initiated or completed, or within a short period of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0806" num="0835">While illustrated as occurring after block <b>6250</b>, in some examples, block <b>6255</b> can occur before or concurrently with block <b>6250</b>.</p><p id="p-0807" num="0836">At <b>6260</b>, when the system is operating in a redirection mode, the processor(s) can be configured to generate signals to cause at least a portion of the donation amount to be directed to or accrue in one or more redirection account.

A community score is a metric of the health and needs of that community, The lower the number the healthier the community. Community score changes overtime may be graphed and analyzed to give a trend score for a given community (the velocity of change). This trend score may be the tangent slope of the community scores graph. A trend score of less than 1 indicates that the community is improving, while a value greater than one may indicate a negative trend is occurring and the community is experiencing increased needs. Further, based on current data and historical trend data, the analysis can predict the future community and related trend scores (this is the anticipated velocity). Multiple scenarios may be analyzed to determine the anticipated velocity with and without potential triggers for the system to operate in redirection mode. From this analysis the system is able to determine the ideal recommendation and potential impending disaster notification(s)/information. Through thorough analysis of several data sources, the system can mitigate risks of falling into a Simpson's Paradox and mis-identifying trends and recommendations. The community score and trend score can be utilized to provide stakeholder transparency as it relates to investments in community initiatives that are intended to improve the welfare/wellbeing/quality of life in a community. Additionally, after the system has completed operating in redirection mode, an analysis of the community and trend scores can be completed to determine the impact of the redirection mode, this impact can be reported to system stakeholders.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0823" num="0866">At <b>6320</b>, the processor(s) can be configured to determine, based on the potential impending disaster notification(s)/information, whether the potential impending disaster notification will cause the system to operate in a redirection mode. In some examples, this determination can include determining whether information received and/or associated with the potential impending disaster meets one or more thresholds. For example, the processor(s) can determine that the potential impending disaster will trigger the system to operate in a redirection mode if the estimated number of people affected by the potential impending disaster exceeds a defined threshold. Other threshold factors can include whether the percentage of people affected within a defined geographic area exceeds a defined threshold, whether the GDP or average income of the affected population is below a defined threshold, whether the potential impending disaster is a specified type of potential impending disaster, whether the media coverage or social media trends indicate that the potential impending disaster is of particular importance or interest to the general public (e.g. Twitter&#x2122; trends/keywords, number of times/rate at which the potential impending disaster is searched in a search engine, number of time/rate at which the potential impending disaster is mentioned in news feeds, etc.). Any one or more of the above criteria or any other criteria can be used by the processor(s) to determine whether the potential impending disaster notification/information will trigger the system to operate in a redirection mode.</p><p id="p-0824" num="0867">In some examples, the determination of whether to switch into a redirection mode can be based on data trend analysis of one or more scores defining the scope of the crisis. For example, the scores may include an event impact value, a response value and a donation impact value determined, for example, on the information or factors described herein or otherwise. In some embodiments, if the score(s) satisfy one or more thresholds, a redirection may be triggered. In some examples, an event impact score can represent a relative metric for the extent of the potential impending disaster. A response value(s) can represent one or more dollar amounts that may be required to fund and take preventative measure against a potential impending disaster with a particular aspect of a preventive measure effort. Each response value may correspond to a donation impact value which may represent a metric for the effectiveness of the response value also referred to herein as &#x2018;preventive measure effort&#x2019;. In some examples, a potential impending disaster may have multiple response values based on the different aspects of a relief effort which can be included. For example, in a potential impending hurricane or earthquake, a response value which includes funding for the potential need for early responders and the potential need for professionals searching for survivors may have an associated impact value, while a response value which includes food and shelter may have another impact value.</p><p id="p-0825" num="0868">These scores can be based on the estimated number of people a location/region of the event, the type of event, an estimated number of people potentially affected by a potential impending disaster, the medical or economic effect on the potentially affected people, the criticalness of timely aid, the availability of resources of the local government(s), or any other event information or combination thereof. In some examples, the analysis of the scores can include information based on historical data from past disasters and redirection activities.</p><p id="p-0826" num="0869">In some examples, the determination of whether to switch into a redirection mode can be based on one or more inputs received from an administrative or other user with appropriate permissions. For example, input(s) can be received from a keyboard, mouse, touchscreen or other peripheral, or via a network connection as a signal or message. In some examples, the input(s) can be received via an application and/or a web or other remotely or locally-accessible user interface.

The specified user can be, for example, a person in charge of the loyalty system or payment system, a person affiliated with a specific charity, or a well-known philanthropist. In some examples, the specified user may be elected by the members of the loyalty program.</p><p id="p-0828" num="0871">In another example, instead of a single individual reviewing and making a decision to trigger operation in redirection mode based upon analysis of information pertaining to a potential impending disaster, the determination to trigger operation in redirection mode can be performed by a committee of two, three or more individuals such as those listed above.

For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref>, a redirection mode can be triggered for a potential impending regional flood such as the 2013 flooding in the Canadian Province Alberta. In such an example, the redirection parameters can be defined such that 100% of donation amounts associated with transactions occurring in Alberta are directed to an account associated with a preventive measure intended to prevent loss, damage, and harm for a potential impending disaster by way of funding a relief effort or an affiliated charity, while donation amounts occurring outside of Alberta, Canada are not redirected. In another example, the redirection parameters can establish that at least a portion of donation amounts associated with a transaction associated with a merchant or member resident in Alberta, Canada are redirection.</p><p id="p-0841" num="0884">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>B</figref> and the 1998 Ice Storm in Eastern Canada, in another example, the redirection parameters can establish that 100% of donation amounts associated with transactions occurring in Eastern Canada are directed to an account associated with the preventative measures relief effort.

These notifications can be sent to member financial institutions, merchants, cardholders, media, charities, donation recipients or any other relevant party(ies). In some examples, these notifications can be sent to email addresses for members in a redirection or disaster area, can be posted to their account portals, or via any other mechanism. The notifications can include information about the relief effort, donation goals, length of time, and other information about the redirection mode and/or relief effort.</p><p id="p-0847" num="0890">In some examples, the notification of merchants can include generating offers/rewards (or suggestions for offers/rewards) for promoting the relief effort. For example, a reward can offer an extra 10% of all transactions with a merchant will go towards the preventative measure relief effort. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, viral immunology reports from healthcare providers, upon analysis thereof, may provide an indication of a potential impending viral epidemic. In this case, customer transactions may trigger redirection of the merchant-defined donations towards the purchase and distribution of non-valved, multi-layer cloth masks, to prevent virus transmission, ventilators for respiratory therapy hospitals, viral testing equipment, etc.</p><p id="p-0848" num="0891">In some examples, the notification of customer/cardholder members can include an option to opt out of the redirection mode such that transactions associated with the opted out customer are directed to their non-redirection charities.</p><p id="p-0849" num="0892">In some examples, the notification of the customer/merchant members can include an option for the customer/merchant match any redirected donations associated with their transaction(s).</p><p id="p-0850" num="0893">In some examples, the notification can inform the recipients of the redirection donations. In some examples, the notifications can inform the charity(ies) who will lose donations as a result of the redirections.</p><p id="p-0851" num="0894">In some examples, the processor(s) can generate notifications at the time of a transaction. For example, when a transaction is initiated at a transaction initiating device (such as a point-of-sale terminal or a customer mobile device), the processor(s) upon detecting the transaction initiation process (such as a transaction authorization or request), can generate a notification to display at the transaction initiating device notifying the customer and/or merchant that the system is operating in a redirection mode. In some examples, the notification can indicate the nature of disaster and/or the associated relief effort. In some instances, the notification can allow for a real-time notification to a device proximate to a customer and/or merchant operator. In some instances, a real or near-real time notification provided by the system can create an emotional connection between the customer, the merchant and the particular transaction. This connection may not be possible or may be weaker if the notification were not provided at or shortly after the transaction has been completed.</p><p id="p-0852" num="0895">In some examples, the notification can indicate the donation raised by the transaction being processed.</p><p id="p-0853" num="0896">In some examples, the notification may include an option to top up or increase the amount of the donation by the merchant and/or the customer. If the processor(s) receive an input indicating that the merchant wishes to top-up the donation, the transaction amount can stay the same, and the processor(s) can redirect a larger portion of the transaction amount based on the top-up amount to the relief effort that otherwise would have accrued to the merchant.</p><p id="p-0854" num="0897">If the processor(s) receive an input indicating that the customer wishes to top-up the donation, the transaction amount can be increased by the amount of the top-up.</p><p id="p-0855" num="0898">In some examples, the notification may include an option to opt-out of the redirection process. If the processor(s) receive an input indicating that the merchant or the customer wishes to opt-out of the redirection, the processor(s) can determine that the transaction is not to be subject to redirection or may reverse an already completed redirection.</p><p id="p-0856" num="0899">While illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref> as occurring after entering the redirection mode, in some examples, the notifications can be sent in advance of commencement of the redirection mode. For example, the notification may indicate that relevant donations will be redirected starting next week.</p><p id="p-0857" num="0900">In some examples, the system can be configured to aggregate, track or otherwise monitor the total funds donated to the relief effort on an individual, regional, merchant or global basis. In some examples, the system can be configured to automatically stop operating in a redirection mode and/or to begin operating in a normal mode when the redirection parameters defining triggers for ending operation in the redirection mode. For example, in some embodiments, the system can be configured to end operation in the redirection mode when an aggregate donation amount exceeds a threshold defined by the redirection parameters. In some examples, the system can be configured to end operation in the redirection mode when a period of time has elapsed or a date has passed. In some examples, the system can be configured to end operation in the redirection mode when an aggregate donation threshold is reached or a defined time period or date has passed, whichever occurs first.</p><p id="p-0858" num="0901">In some examples, the system can be configured to end redirection of donation amounts for specific customers, merchants or regions based on redirection parameters for the specific customers, merchant or region. In this manner, maximum aggregate donation amounts or time periods may be defined on an individual, merchant, or regional basis. In some examples, this may avoid donation exhaustion for particular demographics.</p><p id="p-0859" num="0902">In addition to notifications regarding the commencement of the redirection mode, in some examples, the processor(s) can be configured to generate update notifications regarding the redirection mode. For example, the updates can include personalized messages which indicate to each particular customer or merchant how much their specific transactions/activities have contributed to the relief effort. In some examples, the updates can additionally or alternatively indicate how much their city, region, employer, customers, favourite merchants, etc. has contributed to the relief effort.</p><p id="p-0860" num="0903">In some examples, the system can be configured to associate donation or redirection amounts with the specific cause or event such that the funds in the associated account will only be released for the specific cause or event. In some examples, the system can be configured to release the funds on an as needed basis. If relief efforts are completed while there are still funds associated with the relief in the account, in some examples, the system can be configured to prevent the funds from being released. In some examples, the excess funds may be allocated to the national/regional or local charity accounts associated with the customer or merchant. In some examples, the excess funds may be allocated to a charity account related or in the region associated with the event or disaster.</p><p id="p-0861" num="0904"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b></figref> shows aspects of an example method for triggering donations for a loyalty system.</p><p id="p-0862" num="0905">At <b>6510</b>, one or more processors in the loyalty system can be configured to receive transaction data as described herein or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0863" num="0906">At <b>6520</b>, the processor(s) can be configured to identify a donation catchment area for the cardholder member. In some examples, the donation catchment area may be based on the community, city, province/state, country, region, etc. in which one or more addresses (e.g. residence, work) associated with the cardholder member falls. In some examples, the donation catchment may be based on a defined distance or travel time from address(es) associated with the cardholder member.</p><p id="p-0864" num="0907">In some examples, the donation catchment may be determined based on the charity member(s) which may receive donations on transactions involving the cardholder member. In some examples, the charity member(s) may be selected by the cardholder member, may be assigned by default, may be associated with a payment card/account involved in a transaction, may be associated with the transacting merchant, may be selected randomly or in a sequence, or in any other manner. In some such examples, the donation catchment area can be defined as an area which the charity member(s) services. In some examples, the catchment area parameters may be defined and stored in a profile associated with the charity.</p><p id="p-0865" num="0908">For example, a community-based charity such as a charity supporting a children's community sports team may have a catchment area for transactions which occur within the community and/or surrounding area.

In some examples, the catchment area parameters may be defined by country, continent, etc. In some examples, the catchment area parameters may specify that the catchment area is global and encompasses all transactions regardless of their locations.</p><p id="p-0868" num="0911">At <b>6530</b>, the processor(s) can be configured to determine whether a transaction associated with the transaction data falls within one or more donation catchment areas of one or more charities associated with the cardholder member. In some examples, this may include identifying merchant location information based on transaction data (e.g. MIDs) and merchant profile information, and comparing it with the catchment areas of the charities supported by the cardholder.</p><p id="p-0869" num="0912">In some examples, determining whether a transaction falls within a donation catchment area can be based on a transaction data field which indicates whether the payment transaction was an in-store transaction, a telephone transaction or a web transaction. In some examples, the processor(s) can be configured to determine that all web transactions fall outside of all donation catchment areas. In some examples, the processor(s) can be configured to determine that web transactions fall outside of all donation catchment areas except those with global catchments.</p><p id="p-0870" num="0913">At <b>6540</b>, the processor(s) can be configured to generate signals for accruing a donation amount to a defined account based on the transaction data.

In some embodiments, the transaction data can, at a minimum, include a transaction amount, a transaction date/time, a cardholder identifier and a merchant identifier. For example, a transaction may be for $50 with a merchant associated with identifier X at store Q on Jan. 1, 2015, at 10 am Eastern Standard Time with a customer associated with identifier A.</p><p id="p-0877" num="0920">At <b>6602</b>, the system may be configured to determine a donation rate for the transaction. In some examples, this may include retrieving a donation rate associated with the merchant identifier for the date/time of the transaction. In some examples, the donation rate may depend on other transaction data such as the location of the transaction, the type of transaction, etc. In some examples, the system may be configured to determine if an offer was redeemed that alters or is added to the donation rate.</p><p id="p-0878" num="0921">Based on the donation rate and the donation amount, at <b>6603</b>, the system may be configured to calculate the donation amount. In some examples, instead of a rate, the donation amount may be a defined amount independent of the transaction amount. In some examples, the donation amount may be tiered based on the transaction amount.</p><p id="p-0879" num="0922">At <b>6604</b>, the system can be configured to determine whether the transaction occurred within the catchment area of the customer and/or the merchant. In some examples, the transaction location may be determined based on a terminal ID associated with the transaction, and/or a transaction code (e.g. identifying a card swipe/tap, online purchase, phone order, etc.).</p><p id="p-0880" num="0923">If the transaction is determined to be local e.g. falls with the defined catchment area, the system can be configured to determine the one or more donation accounts associated with the customer support profile. In some examples, the customer support profile can identify one or more selected community charities/organizations/programs for receiving donation amounts and the ratio or proportion of donation amounts to split between the selected charities.</p><p id="p-0881" num="0924">In some examples, the customer support profile can identify one or more selected classes of charities/recipients. Classes may include but are not limited to healthcare, education, financial inclusion and community. When the profiles are configured to identify classes of recipients rather than specific recipients, the system can be configured to select one or more donation accounts falling with the selected class(es). In some examples, the charities falling within each class may be selected or defined by the merchant or a party in the payment processing system.</p><p id="p-0882" num="0925">If the transaction is determined to be non-local e.g. falls outside the defined catchment area or is an online transaction etc., the system can be configured to identify one or more national or regional community organizations for receiving the donation amounts. In some examples, if the transaction occurs outside a customers local area or online, tax laws of the jurisdiction may restrict donations crossing state/provincial/national borders. As such, the system can be configured to direct amounts to a national/international community organization for donation generated from a non-local transaction.</p><p id="p-0883" num="0926">In some examples, the system can be configured to select one or more candidate national community organizations based on one or more criteria. In some examples, the criteria may include: a preference associated with the customer profile (e.g. the customer previously indicated their preferred national community organization as part of their support profile, for example, the cardholder selected the American Red Cross); a preference associated with the merchant profile (e.g. the merchant selected the United Way of America); an affiliation of a community organization with the card brand (Visa, MC, Amex) used by the customer for the transaction (i.e. the MasterCard Foundation); an affiliation of a community organization with the bank or financial institution that issued the payment instrument used by the customer for the transaction (i.e. the JP Morgan Chase Bank Foundation); a community organization selected by the operator of the system; or a community organization selected by a sponsor of the system.</p><p id="p-0884" num="0927">At <b>6606</b>, the system can be configured to determine if a redirection mode is active and applies to the catchment area of the merchant. In some examples, this may include determining whether the system is operating in a redirection mode and/or determining whether the redirection parameters associated with the redirection areas correspond to the location of the merchant or transaction.</p><p id="p-0885" num="0928">At <b>6607</b>, if the redirection applies to the transaction, the system can be configured to determine the redirection account and rate of redirection based on the redirection parameters.</p><p id="p-0886" num="0929">At <b>6608</b>, the donation amount is split between the determined recipient organizations. For example, for a local transaction without redirection, the donation amount may be split according to the ratio selected by the customer in their support profile (e.g. $0.67 to the children's hospital, $0.33 to the SPCA).</p><p id="p-0887" num="0930">In another example, for a non-local transaction without redirection: 100% of the donation may allocated to the determined national community organization (e.g. $1.00 to the United Way of America).</p><p id="p-0888" num="0931">In another example, for a local transaction with redirection: the donation amount may be split according to the redirection rate and the remainder (if any) may be split according to the ratio selected by the customer in their support profile. For example, with a 50% redirection rate, $0.50 to the redirection account and $0.33 to the children's hospital, $0.17 to the SPCA.</p><p id="p-0889" num="0932">In another example, for non-local transaction with redirection: the donation may be split according to the redirection rate and the remainder (if any) may be allocated to the determined national community organization. For example, with a 50% redirection rate, $0.50 to the redirection cause and $0.50 to the United Way of America.</p><p id="p-0890" num="0933">At <b>6609</b>, the system can be configured to store donation data for each transaction. In some examples the donation data can include: a reference to the transaction, a reference to the merchant's defined donation, a reference to the customers community support profile, a reference to the redirection event (if applicable), and for each recipient community organization, a reference to the community organization and a donation amount allocated to this community organization.</p><p id="p-0891" num="0934">At <b>6610</b>, the system can be configured to generating signals to cause accrual of the determined donation portions to each of the redirection and donation accounts. In some examples, the accrual can be conducted in real time with the transaction, after a delay (e.g. after the transaction has cleared/settled) or in a batch (e.g. end of month).</p><p id="p-0892" num="0935">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to detect a trigger to no longer operate in a redirection mode and return to a default mode of operation. For example, during recordation and/or accrual of donation amounts, the system can calculate a total redirected amount and determine whether the total redirected amount exceeds the donation goal of a particular region or of the entire relief effort globally. In another example, the system may detect a trigger when a defined period of time has elapsed.</p><p id="p-0893" num="0936">In another example, the system may detect a trigger when donation fatigue has reached a particular threshold. In some embodiments, the system may monitor trending information to quantify donation fatigue. In another example, the system may detect a trigger when a donation rate falls, and/or a customer/merchant top-up rate falls below a certain threshold. In another example, the system may detect a trigger when an level of engagement with the loyalty system falls based on activities on the member platforms, sharing of links, messages, promotions for the loyalty program, etc.</p><p id="p-0894" num="0937">In another example, the system may detect a trigger when it receives data indicating that a potential impending disaster or disaster relief program has ended.</p><p id="p-0895" num="0938">In some embodiments, after detecting a trigger to no longer operate in a redirection mode, the system can be configured to obtain redirection evaluation data. This data may include the rates of donations in different areas, trend data during the redirection period, evaluations of the effectiveness of the relief effort, etc.</p><p id="p-0896" num="0939">In some examples, this historical/redirection evaluation data can be used to determine trigger and redirection parameters for future relief efforts.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Blockchain Implementations Unkind a Merchant-Defined Donation to a Preventive Measure</heading><p id="p-0897" num="0940">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>67</b>-<b>71</b></figref>, there are depicted various implementations referred to herein after as the &#x201c;Blockchain Implementations&#x201d;, and are described for a blockchain-based system that provides cryptographically secure tracking of each transaction between each merchant and each consumer by way of multiple synchronized transactional blockchains, where the consumer was incented to transact with the merchant by the merchant's offer to make a donation to a fund, foundation, or entity that will take a preventive measure to prevent a potential impending disaster. The entity can be a charity designated by the consumer. The blockchain-based system further provides cryptographically secure tracking of the donation by the merchant to the fund, foundation, or entity designated by the consumer by way of multiple synchronized transactional blockchains. The Blockchain Implementations can be combined with a system in a redirection mode whereby merchant-defined donations are made to take steps and enact measure to prevent a potential impending disaster. In such implementations, Blockchain Implementations are to track each merchant-defined donation event to the funding of each potential impending disaster prevention effort and/or entity. In such implementations, after the merchant-defined donation amount and the location associated with the transaction are determined, data fields are received data fields derived from the transaction that include: (i) first data for the transaction defined using a first merchant account; and (ii) second, different data for the same transaction defined using a second merchant account. A first block is created from the first data for the transaction defined using the first merchant account. The first block is added to a first blockchain that uses the first merchant account to track transactions. A second block is created from the second data for the transaction and is defined using the second merchant account without including the first data for the transaction defined using the first merchant account. The second block is added to a second, separate blockchain that uses the second merchant account to track transactions, wherein the first and second blockchains each track different transaction data fields. The transaction between the merchant and the customer is validated by: (i) receiving a Globally Unique IDentifer (GUID) for the transaction; (ii) and using the GUID to identify indices in the first and second blockchains; encrypted blocks are retrieved from the first and second blockchains of the identified indices; a hash associated with the encrypted blocks is verified, and at least one of the encrypted blocks is decrypted using a private key. Accordingly, the Blockchain Implementations can be used are to track each merchant-defined donation to the funding of each potential impending disaster prevention effort and/or entity as further disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/446,728, now Published as US Patent Application Publication No. 2019/0392489, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0898" num="0941">In general, blockchains can include sequences of individual blocks that each memorialize transactions (individual events). A single block accounts for a single transaction by an account holder for a purchase of goods and/or services from a merchant. In one implementation, a blockchain-based system employs sponsor-defined, sponsor-assigned, sponsor-managed privileges to tiers of users or individual users having associated digital wallets. The permissioning sponsor can assign a set of privileges (also referred to herein as permissions) appropriate to each user at the account level. The privileges can be packaged in bundles for participants to accomplish specific roles, so that different participants have differing permissions to transact and access data. These privileges are referred to herein as &#x201c;role-based privileges&#x201d; or &#x201c;role-based wallets.&#x201d; In specific implementations, only the sponsor or its designated administrator can add, modify, or delete privileges.</p><p id="p-0899" num="0942">In another implementation, the blockchain-based system includes customized role-based wallets which can generate transactions accompanied by transaction-related data. For instance, other aspects of each transaction can be included within these blockchains, both to carry critical information about a transaction as well as extensions to further safeguard and authenticate the transaction. As used herein, transaction authentication can refer to the process of determining whether a particular user and associated wallet or application is permitted to participate in a transaction.</p><p id="p-0900" num="0943"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref> depicts, as a high-level architectural overview, one implementation of a blockchain-based system that provides the features described herein. As shown, multiple digital wallets <b>6702</b> associated with different users having different roles can be used to perform the operations and transactions described herein (e.g., digitally signing data using a key). Each digital wallet <b>6702</b> can operate on a suitable user device, such as smartphone, tablet computer, desktop computer, laptop computer, smart watch, smart glasses, smart television, smart appliance, workstation, and/or other computing device. In some implementations, the digital wallets <b>6702</b> take the form of mobile applications, such as iPhone or Android wallet apps.</p><p id="p-0901" num="0944">To perform transactions, digital wallets <b>6702</b> can interface with a blockchain implementation <b>6706</b> that maintains the one or more blockchains or similar digital ledgers utilized in the present system. Blockchain implementation <b>6706</b> can include, for example, Hyperledger Fabric made available by the Hyperledger Project. Blockchain implementation <b>6706</b> executes on computing services platform <b>6710</b>, which can provide the necessary processing and storage functionality for blockchain implementation <b>6706</b>. Computing services platform <b>6710</b> can be provided by a cloud computing services vendor and can include a platform such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Compute. Cloud computing services platform <b>6710</b> can also include a private cloud implementation in which only certain parties have access to the network. Other types of computing platforms are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0902" num="0945">A suitable communications network can connect the devices on which the digital wallets <b>6702</b> operate with blockchain implementation <b>106</b> and computing services platform <b>6710</b>. Communication can be achieved over media such as standard telephone lines, LAN or WAN links (e.g., T1, T3, 56 kb, X.25), broadband connections (ISDN, Frame Relay, ATM), and wireless links (802.11 (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, GSM, CDMA, etc.), for example. In one implementation, the network carries TCP/IP protocol communications and HTTP/HTTPS requests made by a web browser, and the connections between devices and servers are communicated over such TCP/IP networks.</p><p id="p-0903" num="0946">Referring in further detail to role-based wallets, privileges can be differentiated not only by the permissions granted, but also the frequency of access to use and transact on the system and the authentications required to access and transact. In this manner, stronger forms of authentication (beyond a baseline digital signature) can be employed selectively for larger transactions and for those participants carrying larger balances or with less experience. This blockchain and wallet system can be configured to strengthen authentication and achieve segregation of roles or duties through the further implementation of multi-factor authentication, challenge questions, multiple signatures, extra keys and/or special smart contracts to generate a transaction. Such additional forms of authentication are useful as protections to make humans aware of the transactions, thereby preventing usurpation via theft or other means.</p><p id="p-0904" num="0947">This implementation can incorporate smart contracts and similar concepts which enable individual users to add pre-defined and/or custom contingencies to individual transactions, and can enhance the security and usability of the system for the benefit of all users. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, smart contracts can be used by merchants to define incentives. Restrictions and qualifications for the merchant's incentive can be components of the smart contract, such as an incentive where: (i) the account holder is offered a savings on future purchase from the merchant (i.e., the incentive has attributes such as the particulars for a certain percentage off the total transaction amount, such as in the form of a fifty percent (50%) off coupon, when certain conditions are met at the time when the account holder conducts a future transaction with the merchant); (ii) the account holder is offered an entry in a sweepstake contest (e.g., a prizing opportunity) having various rules and conditions; (iii) the account holder is offered the benefit of a contribution being made to the account holder's predetermined charity in a community where the merchant is located and where the account holder resides, where the incentive is triggered when the account holder conducts a future transaction with the merchant, and where the merchant's donation will be a merchant-designated percentage of the currency amount of the transaction (e.g., two percent (2%) of the transaction total will be donated by the merchant to a charity in the local community).</p><p id="p-0905" num="0948">In this manner, participants in the permissioned blockchain are granted access that is consistent not only with their individual expertise, but the role that they are playing for a given account. Pre-defining these privileges and roles allows transactions to proceed quickly and seamlessly. This approach moves away from the traditional blockchain paradigm of the egalitarian one-size-fits-all model to one that balances the benefit and risk of each users participation, which in turn maximizes the utility of the system and enhances trust.</p><p id="p-0906" num="0949">Wallet privileges can be defined using one or more techniques. For example, the users role can be governed by the client software (wallet) on the user device, or by a central database that manages specific user privilege. In another example, user identities can be grouped into tiers or roles. Some combination of these techniques can be used to enhance security and optimize system performance. These permissions at the user (client) level include tiered wallets and role-based wallets.</p><p id="p-0907" num="0950">Permissions can also incorporate geo-fencing, in which certain permissions are extended to local participants, for example, those consumers transacting with merchants in the same community, where the community is defined by a geographic area and/or by travel time as discussed elsewhere herein. Similarly, capturing the geographic location of the user and geo-fencing of the privileges can also be used as part of an authentication check. In further implementations, geographic information can be used to determine which policy, rules, or regulations should apply to the transaction between the consumer and the merchant, such as the date, time, and amount of the transaction being a condition of the merchant being obligated to make a donation to a charity of the consumer's choice.</p><p id="p-0908" num="0951">In some implementations, roles, tiers or permissions are transparent to the entire network, whereas, in other instances, only the sponsor and the user will know their respective statuses.</p><p id="p-0909" num="0952">Referring now in further detail to multiple-blockchain implementations, these implementations provide for multiple blockchains which form multiple archives conserving the integrity of different data fields from the superset of all transactions. Whereas, traditionally, blockchain technology has been focused on ensuring a financial component, such as bitcoin, is neither lost nor double-spent, the present system repurposes these safeguards to ensure the integrity of other transaction-related data including, but not limited to, verifying that a transaction was conducted by an account holder with a merchant on an account issued by an issuer to the account holder, the date, time and amount of the transaction, the obligation resulting from the transaction that the merchant will make a donation to a charity of the account holder's choice, and the completion of the donation by the merchant to the charity. The techniques implemented in this system allow for the record to be generated in a transparent and near real-time fashion.</p><p id="p-0910" num="0953">In certain implementations, blockchains can be linked by the common timestamps of the transactions so that all the data would be available if all the blockchains were available to the viewer. In other instances, the blockchains can be segregated from one another, enhancing privacy and anonymity. One such technique is to introduce noise into transaction timestamps in one of the blockchains to foil attempts to merge the data back together.</p><p id="p-0911" num="0954">The blockchain-based systems described herein can use standard elements, such as virtual wallets for each system user and peer to peer interactions, and can include some combination of role-based wallets, specialized validation techniques and tiered permissions to access data. The validation process can use a third-party computation to create blocks, and geographic coordinates associated with digital wallets and/or discrete products can be driven by multilateration techniques supported by GPS, GLONASS, Wi-Fi position, or active or passive elements attached to user devices and/or products themselves. In some instances, such location techniques can also be used to ensure that a transaction makes sense (e.g., by determining if a current geographic location of a digital wallet matches a location in a previous transaction or some other expected location). This can be particularly important at the point of entry into the system. The validation of external data points, such as geo-fencing, are difficult to enforce in a permissionless blockchain, but in implementations of the blockchain-based systems described herein, the system sponsor can adjudicate as part of the genesis process</p><p id="p-0912" num="0955">Generally, as described herein, validation refers to the process of determining the validity of data received for each transaction. Third-party validation can be performed by competing validators, such as the Satoshi method employed by Bitcoin; by trusted validators; by peer-to-peer protocols; or by the public agency sponsor and their designated contractor(s). Geometric information, for example, can be embedded directly into the blockchain (e.g., included in the notarized description of a transaction), or it can logically map onto a separate database or lookup table. System sponsors can host multiple blockchains instantiations to segregate viewing, lower complexity and enhance system performance.</p><p id="p-0913" num="0956">Other privileges associated with digital wallets can include limitations on frequency of access to use and transact on the system, requirements for authentications to access and transact on the system (e.g., require stronger forms of authentication for larger transactions and for those participants carrying larger balances or with less experience), ability to maintain a negative (short) balance, ability to enter into larger purchases and sales, ability to purchase on credit, and ability to transact outside market hours. In some implementations, location information (from GPS or other location techniques) is used in conjunction with a geo-fence to determine whether a transaction is permitted. In general, such information external to the blockchain (e.g., location, time, wallet balance, wallet age, etc.) is fundamentally qualitative. Accordingly, it should be noted that, so long as this information is used to defer transactions and does not cause a modification of the blockchain, possible states cannot be contradictory, where &#x201c;possible&#x201d; includes states that can only be reached by falsifying outside information.</p><p id="p-0914" num="0957"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref> depicts an example data transfer flow as seen at reference numerals <b>6802</b> through <b>6808</b> for data pertaining to a transaction between a merchant and an account holder for which the merchant agrees to make donation to a charity of the account holder's choice. The flow begins with the merchant, continues to the account holder, then to the charity, and the flow ends with an administer of the merchant donations. The administer, as used herein, is referred to as the Network of Giving Administrator. Each transaction is recorded in one or more blockchains.</p><p id="p-0915" num="0958">The transaction data flow begins at its creation shown at reference numeral <b>6802</b> in which a merchant uses its digital wallet to provide a description of the transaction and a genesis signature for the transaction. The transaction can include a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID). The merchant digitally signs the assignment of the GUID to the transaction. To avoid the introduction of falsified and/or erroneous data, this signing can be performed using, for example, unique private keys generated for each item or for regular time intervals (e.g., for each day).</p><p id="p-0916" num="0959">In some implementations, one or more notary computing systems can be used to verify the signing of the merchant's identity. To achieve this, the merchant can provide a reference to a block in which their approval of the transaction is granted and can provide the decrypted contents of that block. The notary (or notaries) has access to the public key information for the Merchant Public Key) and for the referenced cryptographic block. The public key can be applied to the Merchant Genesis Signature to verify that the merchant is who they claim to be. Likewise, the referenced block can be verified to have been notarized, and the associated public key can be applied to the provided unencrypted data to verify that the merchant is in fact able to decrypt the block contents. Other transaction-related data also can be added to one or more blockchains such as: (i) the percentage of the transaction amount that the merchant will donate to a local charity; (ii) data pertaining to account holder related demographics; and (iii) data referencing other blockchains that involve the merchant and/or the account holder.</p><p id="p-0917" num="0960">In the transaction data flow <b>6804</b>, transaction-related data moves from the merchant to the account holder using their respective digital wallets, resulting in an event in the blockchain. In the transaction data flow <b>6804</b>, the private cryptographic key of the merchant (Merchant Private Key) is used to digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction in the respective blockchain (i.e., transaction creation data flow <b>6802</b>) and the public cryptographic key of the account holder (Account Holder Public Key), and this information is stored as part of a new block added to the one or more blockchains. As shown, the merchant's public cryptographic key can further be used to determine the validity of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0918" num="0961">In one implementation, the data flow for the transaction incorporates validation by one or more notary parties. In this implementation, in transaction data flow <b>6804</b>, the merchant designates the account holder and by way of a cryptographic signature. To avoid unauthorized transaction events, the signing can be performed using a unique private key for the transaction. Each notary verifies that the transaction is valid and reviews any permissions associated with the transaction. If a request to make the transaction is denied, it may indicate the arrival of new information in the blockchain (or an error in or attempted circumvention of the system). The account holder can be notified of the denial. If, however, permissions permit the transaction, the notary can participate in finding a valid representation to add to the blockchain. Of note, the right of validation is a part of the transaction. Consequently, the result of a transaction is that the account holder acquires a right of validation for the transaction. In general, the merchant loses the right of validation, but may still be able to assess validity of the transaction due to other granted rights.</p><p id="p-0919" num="0962">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, and continuing in the same manner, data flow for the transaction is transferred by way of a notation that an obligation has arisen with the respect to a donation that is to made by the merchant to a charity of the account holder's choice. That is, in the transaction data flow <b>406</b>, the private cryptographic key of the account holder's designated charity (Charity Private Key) is used to digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction data flow <b>6804</b> in the respective blockchain and the public cryptographic key of the charity (Charity Public Key). Again, this information is stored as part of a new block added to the respective blockchains. The process continues in the same manner, in the transaction data flow <b>6808</b>, to transfer data pertaining to the transaction from the charity to an administration of donations by merchants to charities. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, the administrator is shown as being the Network Of Giving Administrator in transaction <b>6808</b>.</p><p id="p-0920" num="0963">In the transaction data flow <b>408</b>, the private cryptographic key of the Network Of Giving Administrator (Network Of Giving Administrator Private Key) is used to digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction in the respective blockchain (i.e., transaction data flow <b>406</b>) and the public cryptographic key of the charity (Charity Public Key), and this information is stored as part of a new block added to the one or more blockchains. As shown, the Network Of Giving Administrator's public cryptographic key can further be used to determine the validity of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0921" num="0964">Notarization, as generally used herein, refers to the process of entering validated transactions from authenticated users into a blockchain. Notarization can occur when one or more parties requests a particular transaction, and completes when a block describing the transaction is added to the blockchain ledger. Notary systems have two responsibilities: to verify that all requirements for a transaction are satisfied, and to perform the work necessary to notarize the addition of the transaction to the blockchain.</p><p id="p-0922" num="0965">Notaries can be implemented on secured servers. These servers can send notarization results to parties that are encrypted using public keys of the authorized parties. Any party can receive results of a query, but only the authorized party can decrypt them. To avoid a single point of failure, multiple independent secured servers can be used. These servers can all participate in the process of notarization, so that even if one server were exploited to validate non-compliant transactions, all other servers would be able to identify the conflict. Since various agencies require insight into aspects of the distribution and consumption mediated by the blockchain, those agencies should retain replicas of the relevant portions of the database, and should participate in notarization of transactions within their purview.</p><p id="p-0923" num="0966"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b></figref> depicts an example method for performing notarization of a blockchain for a transaction. In Step <b>6902</b>, the parties involved in the transaction (e.g., the merchant selling goods and/or services to an account holder) establish secure network connections with the same set of one or more notary computing systems, or notaries. Each party securely shares with the notary set the data in blocks, in unencrypted form, needed to validate the transaction (Step <b>6904</b>). The information can be shared by providing a reference to a block in the blockchain that contains the information. In some implementations, if any additional party is required to be able to view the transaction (e.g., the charity designated by the account holder, the Network of Giving Administrator), that party must also provide proof of presence.</p><p id="p-0924" num="0967">In Step <b>6906</b>, each notary validates the shared data by first verifying the notarizing hash on the referenced block (the hash created when the referenced block was added to the blockchain), and, then, by encrypting the data using the public key associated with that block. Each notary assesses the rights demonstrated by each party in the transaction and verifies that the rights grant permission to perform the requested transaction (Step <b>6908</b>). These rights can be defined by the privileges associated with each user's role-based wallet. Other actions (e.g., item genesis) might require verification of a cryptographic signature identifying a party.</p><p id="p-0925" num="0968">The data describing the transaction is encrypted using a public key shared by the parties in the transaction. In some implementations, the data describing the transaction includes references to blocks used to validate the transaction and/or any requirements for the transaction to proceed.</p><p id="p-0926" num="0969">The encrypted data and the public key together constitute a block. The transaction is complete when the blockchain, with the addition of the new block, has been cryptographically notarized (Step <b>6910</b>). The addition of a notarized block can then be propagated to all relevant notaries (Step <b>6912</b>). Advantageously, the notarization can be verified and other notaries can validate transactions without requiring that the contents of the notarized block be decrypted. An important consequence of this approach is that the data stored in the blockchain is fully encrypted. If a server participating in notarization were compromised, the only private data that would be exposed would be the data provided to validate new transactions.</p><p id="p-0927" num="0970">More generally, in the case where multiple parties need to be able to read the block, a key can be generated and shared by those parties. Alternatively, a copy of the block data can be encrypted using public keys provided by each party. The block would then consist of multiple copies of the data encrypted using a public key, as well as the public keys used for the encryption. By re-encrypting using any public key, any party could then verify that the other parties see the same information when they decrypt their copy of the data from the block.</p><p id="p-0928" num="0971">Public data can also be included in a particular block. For example, it might be desirable for a notary to be able to verify that a block establishing ownership of an item has not been used more than once to validate a change of ownership. In this case, the notary would need to be able to determine that an existing transaction block has referenced the ownership block, despite being unable to decrypt the existing transaction block. An alternative to public custody referencing is to have entire chains of custody be included in the encrypted data, which is subject to frequent auditing by an authorized party&#x2014;such as by the Network of Giving Administrator who may have audit responsibility to ensure that donations by merchants to account holder designated charities are made with one hundred percent (100%) pass through from the merchant to the charity.</p><p id="p-0929" num="0972">One method of referencing a block to validate a transaction is to provide the block index and the unencrypted block contents. The notary then verifies that the known public key yields the same encryption as is in the block specified by the index, and further verifies the hash on that block. However, this process does not require that the &#x201c;encryption&#x201d; process be lossless&#x2014;it could just be a hashing function with the property that strings yielding the hashed result are difficult to determine.</p><p id="p-0930" num="0973">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>, validation of a block in a blockchain tracking a transaction between a merchant and an account holder may verifying accuracy of the transaction, which can be accomplished in one implementation as follows. In Step <b>7002</b>, a record associated with the transaction is retrieved using the GUID for the transaction. Data pertaining to the transaction, including acknowledgement of the obligation by the merchant to make a specified type and kind of donation to a charity of the account holder's choosing, is validated up to the requested block in the blockchain (Step <b>7004</b>), and an evaluation is made to determine if there is any conflicting history (Step <b>7006</b>).</p><p id="p-0931" num="0974">Various techniques can be used to achieve the foregoing steps. For example, a participant in the blockchain can have a wallet that can include a table containing transaction-related data mapped to indices of blocks that demonstrate the veracity of the transaction. The participant in the blockchain then contacts any notary to request the indexed block, and on receiving the encrypted block (and any additional blocks used for the hashing), verifies the hash and decrypts the contents of their block using their private key. These steps are sufficient to verify the status of the transaction at the time the transaction-related date was obtained.</p><p id="p-0932" num="0975">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>, as part of notarizing the transaction, the results of the validation can then be encrypted using the public keys declared for the transaction and block, and the encrypted result returned (Step <b>7008</b>).</p><p id="p-0933" num="0976">In some implementations, as part of effecting the validation of a block, a party involved in a transaction should know the blockchain index associated with the transaction. For example, such parties can be responsible for maintaining a database mapping product identifiers with blocks. In order to reconstruct the history of a transaction, a user should then have the ability to decrypt each referenced prior transaction block (which is generally a subset of the total referenced blocks). Further, in order to validate an item, the user need only have permission to view any single blockchain block in the item's history.</p><p id="p-0934" num="0977">Advantageously, in addition to the blockchain capturing each transaction, the total number of units are conserved by blocking any transactions that double-count. This failsafe can be applied to additional units of account (e.g., number of units) in additional blockchains, such that no double counting occurs, nor are dollars or additional units lost. Each blockchain decrements and increments an equal amount for every block, and each blockchain conserves the total numbers of units of that unit of account. In some implementations, the accuracy of the number of units and the accounting of other tracked values within blockchains relies on auditing of the transactions by an authorized party.</p><p id="p-0935" num="0978">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>, there is depicted a system configured for making use of role-based wallets in which a netting system is employed prior to notarization. In one example of a blockchain-based system using role-based wallets, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>, the netting system tracks each transaction that results in a donation, where the transaction is conducted between a merchant and an account holder, and where the transaction was incented by the merchant offering to the account holder the merchant's commitment to make the donation to a charity of the account holder's choice.</p><p id="p-0936" num="0979">Each participant in the blockchain system has been issued a certificate by a certificate authority server <b>7102</b>. Each participant is issued a wallet which must be re-authenticated and re-set prior to connecting with an authentication server <b>7104</b>. These wallets, named after their associated participants, include a consumer (e.g., account holder) wallet <b>7102</b>, a merchant wallet <b>7104</b>, and a charity wallet <b>7106</b>. Each wallet can have settings which limit the type and kind of transaction that is permissible.</p><p id="p-0937" num="0980">Transactions occur on a peer-to-peer basis and are captured in near-real time in the blockchain <b>7120</b>, which effectively serves as a master blotter. At the end of the process seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>, a back-office nets out the blockchain <b>7120</b> and each merchant and/or charity receives an individual blotter and net positions for settlement of each donation that the merchant is obligated to make to each charity. Oversight of donations from merchants to charities designated by respective account holders can be performed by a Network of Giving Administrator seen at reference numeral <b>7102</b>-<b>7104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0938" num="0981">Social Smart Contract Reverse Crowdfunding with Feedback Loop</p><p id="p-0939" num="0982">In one implementation, a holder of an account issued by an issuing bank (e.g., a cardholder), or an agent or designate thereof, can set up a predetermined smart contract, such as a computer protocol, operated on the World Wide Web and intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Preferably, the smart contract will allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties such that the transactions are trackable and optionally irreversible. Also preferably, various cryptocurrencies, via blockchain protocols, can be implemented with the smart contract as a funding mechanism for donations to be made to a reverse crowdfunding platform.</p><p id="p-0940" num="0983">In one variation of this implementation, the smart contract facilitates the cardholder's direction to a merchant to make a merchant defined donation whenever the cardholder conducts a transaction with the merchant on the cardholder's account. The cardholder provides instructions to the merchant to make the merchant defined donation to the reverse crowdfunding platform via a blockchain mechanism that is targeted to a specific product or specific service. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the merchant defined donation can be a percentage of the total purchase amount of the transaction conducted by the cardholder with the merchant.</p><p id="p-0941" num="0984">The predetermined smart contract provides the terms and conditions for governance under which the merchant defined donation is funded to the reverse crowdfunding platform via the blockchain mechanism. Upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions that govern the predetermined smart contract, the sum total of one or more such merchant defined donation are paid out by the reverse crowdfunding platform so as to fund the targeted specific product or specific service according to the terms and conditions of the smart contract.</p><p id="p-0942" num="0985">Preferably, the specific product or specific service is particularized by an identifier so as to be globally unique, such as by being associated with a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID). By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the GUID can be a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) when the specific product is a motor vehicle, a social security number when the specific product or specific service is to be provided on behalf of a human being, a unique identifier for a particular DNA sequence when the specific product or specific service is to be provided on behalf of a life form&#x2014;whether or not alive, a serial number when the specific product has a unique serial number, a contract number for a specific service that is to be provided, a service order number when the specific service is to be provided on behalf of a person, entity, or thing, a unique number generated by a pseudo random number generator when the specific product or specific service is to be provided on behalf of a person, entity, or thing, etc.</p><p id="p-0943" num="0986">For the donations to be made to the reverse crowdfunding platform, the cardholder, or agent or designate thereof, proposes a request for a specific product or service that is to be funded by each of the donations made to the reverse crowdfunding platform by each such transaction that the cardholder, or other cardholders, conducts with merchants who have agreed to a make each such merchant defined donation. Once the predetermined smart contract and its funding reverse crowdfunding platform have been setup and published, a crowd of cardholders conduct transactions with respective merchants on their respective cardholder accounts, where each such merchant has agreed to make a merchant defined donation to the reverse crowdfunding platform via the blockchain mechanism that is targeted to a specific product or specific service. As such, the crowd of cardholders &#x2018;vote with their respective wallets&#x2019; for the good or benefit the charitable intent as defined by the smart contract. In some variations on this implementation, the reverse crowdfunding platform can receive a commission fee from funds raised for the specific product or specific service upon full satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the smart contract. Advantageously, when a cardholder, or agent or designate thereof, has a charitable intent for a specific product or specific service to be provided to a charity that is to be provided by operation of a reverse crowdfunded smart contract, without any obligation to the cardholder, when blockchain funding is collected (e.g., via a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin), without the sophistication of a complicated written contract, but rather via the moderation of a crowdfunding website administrator who provides a sufficient explanation of the charitable project, and without need for ID verification, the cardholder can remain anonymous. In various alternatives, the payout to the charity may not even be allowed until end of the charitable project as per the terms and conditions of the smart contract, which may provide for periodic measurements to stop any anonymous ill-intended cardholders from placing such charitable projects &#x201c;on-hold&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0944" num="0987">By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the smart contract may facilitate the funding for a specific product or service via transaction initiated merchant defined donations of: (i) the purchase of a motor vehicle identified by a VIN that will be used to deliver meals to elderly or shut-in people in a particular community in which the cardholder resides; (ii) the purchase of one (1) four (4) dimensional (4D) ultrasound machine, that is uniquely identified by a serial number, for the purpose of capturing full motion video of a pre-born human in utero, where the 4D ultrasound machine is to be installed and used in a women's reproductive healthcare facility in a particular community in which the cardholder resides; (iii) providing funding for the care, feeding, and adoption of an animal in a pound that would otherwise be euthanized, where the animal is uniquely identified by its unique DNA sequence or by some other code sequence such as a registration number embedded in a microchip of the registry for the particular brand of chip; (iv) providing funding for a healthcare procedure for a human uniquely identified by the human's unique social security number or other government issued code; (v) etc. In each such example, the crowdfunding allows a project or venture to be paid for by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people each of which are cardholders incented to conduct transactions with respective merchants who will make the merchant defined donation to the crowdfunded charity as defined by the terms and conditions of a predetermined smart contract.</p><p id="p-0945" num="0988">The crowdfunded charity, as provided by the smart contract, can employ a blockchain framework for funding via a cryptocurrency, such as &#x2018;Ethereum&#x2019; which implements a nearly Turing-complete language on its blockchain. Alternatively, the funding cryptocurrency can be &#x2018;Bitcoin&#x2019; which provides a Turing-incomplete Script language that allows the creation of various terms and conditions for custom smart contracts on top of Bitcoin, including, by way of example and not by way of limitation: (i) multi-signature accounts; (ii) payment channels; (iii) escrows; (iv) time locks; (v) atomic cross-chain trading that enables the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without using centralized intermediaries (e.g., exchanges) and can take place directly between blockchains of different cryptocurrencies or they can be conducted off-chain and thus away from the main blockchain; (vi) the use of an oracle serving as an agent that locates and verifies data associated with real-world occurrences of transactions between cardholders and merchants and then submits the verified data to a blockchain for use by a predetermined smart contract; (vii) a multi-party lottery with no operator by which parties can jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private to thereby assure security and integrity of communication or storage and thereby avoid eavesdroppers on the sender and receiver so as to protect participants' privacy from each other for use of cryptography in the particularized cryptocurrency model; (viii) etc.</p><p id="p-0946" num="0989">Advantageously, a blockchain-based smart contract will be visible to both cardholders and merchants as respective users of the blockchain&#x2014;thereby providing total passthrough in a documented chain of custody of each merchant defined donation to the funding and provision the specific product or service as designed and controlled by the terms and conditions of the predetermined smart contract.</p><p id="p-0947" num="0990">In yet another alternative to the foregoing implementations, a &#x2018;smart bond&#x201d; can be used instead of a smart contract, wherein the terms and conditions of the smart bond call for the use of a cryptocurrency blockchain, such a bitcoin blockchain, in which payment streams are fully automated so as to create a self-paying instrument to crowdfund the chartable product or service via the merchant defined donations of each cardholder transaction.</p><p id="p-0948" num="0991">In still another alternative of the foregoing implementations, a feedback loop is provided to each cardholder who is incentivized to conduct a transaction with a merchant who will make a merchant defined donation to the crowdfunded product or service. Upon placement, installation, and use of the uniquely identified product or service, the latter is enabled to produce data from the use thereof, which usage data is sent to a logical address associated with each such incentivized cardholder who conducted a transaction on their account with a merchant. Receipt of such usage data provides additional and on-going incentives to the cardholder via verifiable confirmations that are communicated, optionally in real or near-real time, to reinforce that the charitable intent of the reverse crowdfunded smart contact has been realized, is even now being realized, and will be realized going forward. Generation and transmission of the usage date can be by way of metering mechanisms coordinated with the use and operation of the unique identified product or service. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the specific product may be: (i) a motor vehicle identified by a VIN, where the motor vehicle transmits mileage and operation data to the cardholders' respective email addresses such that the transmitted data provides on-going documentation of the success of the reverse crowdfunding project in which each such cardholder was a participants; (ii) the specific product may be an Internet-Of-Things (IOT) enabled 4D ultrasound machine uniquely identified by a serial number, where the machine communicates pregnancy usage data, such as the transmission of all or part of a 4D ultrasound video, to each of the cardholders' respective email addresses. Upon viewing a rendering of the transmitted 4D video, the incentivized cardholders are able to rewarded with assurance and confidence that their pregnancy resource focused charitable intent has been, is, and will be realized by their participation in the network of giving as provided by implementations, and variations thereof, as disclosed herein; (v) etc.</p><p id="p-0949" num="0992">The embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both.
