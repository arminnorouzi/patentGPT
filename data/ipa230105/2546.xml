id="p-0004" num="0001">The present invention relates to a compound, a mixture, a curable resin composition, a cured product thereof, and a method for producing the compound. The present invention is suitably used for electrical and electronic components such as a semiconductor sealing material, a printed wiring substrate, and a build-up laminated board, lightweight high-strength materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics and glass fiber reinforced plastics, and 3D printing applications.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">In recent years, a wider range of and higher properties have been required for a laminated board on which electric and electronic components are mounted in view of the expansion of the field of use of the laminated board. The mainstream is to mount a semiconductor chip according to the related art on a metal lead frame, but a semiconductor chip with high processing capacity such as a central processing unit (hereinafter, referred to as CPU) is increasingly mounted on a laminated board made of polymer materials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">In particular, in the case of a semiconductor package (hereinafter, referred to as PKG) used in a smartphone or the like, a reduction in thickness of a PKG substrate is required in order to meet demands for a reduction in size, a reduction in thickness, and an increase in density. However, the PKG substrate with a reduced thickness has a low rigidity, and thus, defects such as large warpage occur due to the heating at the time of solder-mounting the PKG on a motherboard (PCB). In order to reduce warpage, a PKG substrate material having a high Tg equal to or higher than the solder mounting temperature is required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">In addition, in the fifth-generation communication system &#x201c;5G&#x201d;, which is currently being developed at an accelerated rate, it is expected that a further increase in capacity and high-speed communication will progress. The needs for a low dielectric loss tangent material are increasing more and more, and a dielectric loss tangent of 0.005 or less is required at least at 1 GHz.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Further, electronic devices have been developed in the field of automobiles, and precision electronic equipment may be disposed in the vicinity of an engine driving unit, and therefore, heat resistance and moisture resistance at a higher level are required. SiC semiconductors have begun to be used in electric trains, air conditioners, and the like, and extremely high heat resistance has been required for a sealing material of a semiconductor device, and thus, an epoxy resin sealing material according to the related art cannot be used.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">In view of such a background, a polymer material capable of achieving both heat resistance and low dielectric loss tangent properties has been studied. For example, Patent Literature 1 proposes a composition containing a maleimide resin and a propenyl group-containing phenol resin. However, on the other hand, a phenolic hydroxyl group which is not involved in a reaction remains during a curing reaction, and thus, it cannot be said that the electrical properties are sufficient. Patent Literature 2 discloses an allyl ether resin in which a hydroxyl group is substituted with an allyl group. However, it is shown that Claisen rearrangement occurs at 190&#xb0; C., and a phenolic hydroxyl group which does not contribute to a curing reaction is generated at 200&#xb0; C. that is a molding temperature of general substrates, and thus, electrical properties are not satisfied.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">In addition, in recent years, 3D printing has attracted attention as a technique of three-dimensional shaping, and this technique of 3D printing has begun to be applied in the fields such as aerospace, vehicles, and connectors of electronic components used for them, where reliability is required. In particular, photocurable and thermosetting resins have been studied in applications represented by stereo lithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP). Therefore, stability and accuracy of a shape are mainly required in a common method of transferring a shape from a mold, but in a 3D printing application, various properties such as heat resistance, mechanical properties, toughness, flame retardancy, and electrical properties are required, and development of materials thereof is advanced. In addition, in the case of being used for a structural member, a property change due to moisture absorption or the like is a problem. At present, an acrylate resin or an epoxy resin is applied in such applications, but a cured product either of them contains a large number of ester bonds, ether bonds, and hydroxyl groups, and thus the properties in moisture absorption are not sufficient.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: JP-A-H04-359911</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent Literature 2: WO 2016/002704</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a compound, a mixture, a curable resin composition, and a cured product thereof, which exhibit excellent heat resistance and electrical properties and have good curability, and a method for producing the compound.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011">That is, the present invention relates to the following items [1] to [12].</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">[1] A compound represented by the following formula (1).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="27.43mm" wi="65.70mm" file="US20230002547A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">(In the formula (1), X and Y each represent a different optional organic group.

Specifically, the compound represented by the formula (1) can be obtained by a method of subjecting the compound represented by the formula (4) to a dehydrohalogenation reaction in a solvent in the presence of a basic catalyst. Examples of the solvent used include, but are not limited to, water-insoluble solvents, for example, aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene, aliphatic solvents such as cyclohexane and n-hexane, ethers such as diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether, ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, and ketone solvents such as methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclopentanone, and two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. In addition to the water-insoluble solvents, an aprotic polar solvent may also be used in combination. Examples of the aprotic polar solvent include dimethylsulfone, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, N-methylpyrrolidone, and the like, and two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. When an aprotic polar solvent is used, it is preferable to use a solvent having a boiling point higher than that of the water-insoluble solvent used in combination. The catalyst is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include basic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and potassium carbonate. Since it is difficult to cause the dehydrohalogenation reaction to progress completely, the aprotic polar solvent may be used in an excessively large amount with respect to the substrate, or the dehydrohalogenation reaction may be repeatedly performed twice or three or more times. For example, a solution obtained by carrying out the dehydrohalogenation reaction of the compound represented by the formula (4) in the presence of a basic catalyst in an organic solvent may be washed with water and then returned to a reaction vessel again, and the reaction may be carried out again by adding a basic catalyst. In this way, the degree of progress of the dehydrohalogenation reaction can be increased. That is, the amount of residual halogen contained in the target compound can be reduced. The amount of residual halogen is preferably 1 to 10,000 ppm, more preferably 1 to 1,000 ppm, still more preferably 1 to 500 ppm, in the desired product. When the amount of residual halogen contained in the compound represented by the formula (1) is large, molecular vibration occurs when the compound is exposed to a high frequency, and in particular, electrical properties such as dielectric loss tangent are adversely affected. In addition, when the amount of residual halogen is large, the risk of causing defects such as metal corrosion and ion migration increases when the composition containing the compound of the present invention and the cured product thereof are exposed to an environmental test such as a high accelerated stress test (HAST). Therefore, it is preferable to have the above-described halogen content.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0055">A method for producing the compound represented by the formula (4) is not particularly limited, and for example, a compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure may be allowed to react with a bishalogenated methylaryl compound in the presence of an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, and active clay, or a compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure may be allowed to react with a bishydroxymethylaryl compound in the presence of an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, and activated clay. When sulfonic acid or the like is used as a catalyst, an extraction step may be performed after neutralization with an alkali metal such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In the extraction step, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene and xylene may be used alone, or a non-aromatic hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane or toluene may be used in combination. After the extraction, an organic layer is washed with water until the wastewater becomes neutral, and the solvent and the excess compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure are distilled off using an evaporator or the like, and whereby a compound having at least two or more 2-bromoethylbenzene structures in a desired molecule can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0056">Examples of the compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure include, but are not limited to, 2-bromoethylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2-methylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-3-methylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-4-methylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2,3-dimethylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2,4-dimethylbenzene, 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2,5-dimethylbenzene, and 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2,6-dimethylbenzene. When the number of carbon atoms is large, the solvent solubility is improved, but the heat resistance is lowered. Therefore, it is preferable that the 2-bromoethylbenzene structure is unsubstituted or substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, it is more preferable that the 2-bromoethylbenzene structure is unsubstituted or substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, and it is most preferable that the 2-bromoethylbenzene structure is unsubstituted or substituted with a methyl group.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0057">Examples of the bishalogenated methylaryl compound include o-xylylene difluoride, m-xylylene difluoride, p-xylylene difluoride, o-xylylene dichloride, m-xylylene dichloride, p-xylylene dichloride, o-xylylene dibromide, m-xylylene dibromide, p-xylylene dibromide, o-xylylene diiodide, m-xylylene diiodide, p-xylylene diiodide, 4,4&#x2032;-bisfluoromethylene biphenyl, 4,4&#x2032;-bischloromethylene biphenyl, 4,4&#x2032;-bisbromomethylene biphenyl, 4,4&#x2032;-bisiodomethylene biphenyl, 2,4-bisfluoromethylene biphenyl, 2,4-bischloromethylene biphenyl, 2,4-bisbromomethylene biphenyl, 2,4-bisiodomethylene biphenyl, 2,2&#x2032;-bisfluoromethylene biphenyl, 2,2&#x2032;-bischloromethylene biphenyl, 2,2&#x2032;-bisbromomethylene biphenyl, and 2,2&#x2032;-bisiodomethylene biphenyl, and from the viewpoint of the reactivity of raw materials during synthesis, chloride compounds, bromide compounds, and iodide compounds are preferred, and chloride compounds and bromide compounds are more preferred.

One of these may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The usage amount of the catalyst is generally 0.1 to 0.8 mol, and preferably 0.2 to 0.7 mol, based on 1 mol of the compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure to be used. If the usage amount of the catalyst is too large, the viscosity of the reaction solution may be too high and stirring may be difficult, and if the usage amount is too small, the progress of the reaction may be slow. The reaction may be carried out by selecting and using an organic solvent, such as hexane, cyclohexane, octane, toluene and xylene, as necessary, or may be carried out without any solvent. For example, after an acidic catalyst is added to a mixed solution of a compound having a 2-bromoethylbenzene structure, a halogenated methylaryl compound, and a solvent, water contained by the catalyst is removed from the system by azeotrope. Thereafter, the reaction is performed at 40 to 180&#xb0; C., preferably 50 to 170&#xb0; C. for 0.5 to 20 hours. After the end of the reaction, the acidic catalyst may be neutralized with an alkaline aqueous solution, but the process may proceed to a water washing step without neutralization. In the water washing step, a water-insoluble organic solvent is added to the oil layer, and water washing is repeated until the wastewater becomes neutral.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0060">The softening point of the compound represented by the formula (4) is preferably 80&#xb0; C. or lower, and more preferably 70&#xb0; C. or lower. When the softening point is 80&#xb0; C. or lower, the viscosity of the compound represented by the formula (1) decreases. Accordingly, it is easy to ensure the fluidity, and it is easy to achieve B-stage such as prepreg, in addition to preventing the impregnation property to glass cloth, carbon fibers, and the like from being impaired. When the amount of a dilution solvent is increased to reduce the viscosity, there is a possibility that a resin does not sufficiently adhere to a fibrous material in an impregnation step.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0061">A mixture of the present invention may contain a polymerization inhibitor. By containing a polymerization inhibitor, the storage stability can be improved and the reaction initiation temperature can be controlled. By controlling the reaction initiation temperature, the fluidity can be easily ensured, the impregnation property to glass cloth or the like is not impaired, and the B-stage such as the prepreg can be easily achieved. When the polymerization reaction progresses too much at the time of achieving the prepreg, defects such as difficulty in lamination in a lamination step are likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0062">Examples of the polymerization inhibitor that can be used include phenol-based polymerization inhibitors, sulfur-based polymerization inhibitors, phosphorus-based polymerization inhibitors, hindered amine-based polymerization inhibitors, nitroso-based polymerization inhibitors, and nitroxyl radical-based polymerization inhibitors. The polymerization inhibitor may be added when the compound represented by the formula (1) is synthesized, or may be added after the synthesis. In addition, one of the polymerization inhibitors may be added alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be added in combination.

The polyphenylene ether compound obtained by the redistribution reaction as described above has hydroxyl groups, derived from a phenolic compound contributing to curing, at both ends of the molecular chain, so that the polyphenylene ether compound is preferred from the viewpoint that higher heat resistance can be maintained, and in addition, a functional group can be introduced at both ends of a molecular chain even after the modification with a compound having an ethylene unsaturated double bond.

As a specific example of the curing accelerator that can be used, it is preferable to use a radical polymerization initiator for the purpose of promoting self-polymerization of a radically polymerizable curable resin such as an olefin compound or a maleimide resin, or radical polymerization with other components.

The addition amount of the radical polymerization initiator is preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by mass, and particularly preferably 0.01 to 3 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the curable resin composition. When the amount of the radical polymerization initiator used is large, the molecular weight does not sufficiently extend during the polymerization reaction.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0094">If necessary, a curing accelerator other than the radical polymerization initiator may be added or used in combination. Specific examples of the curing accelerator that can be used include: imidazoles such as 2-methylimidazole, 2-ethylimidazole, and 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole; tertiary amines such as 2-(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol and 1,8-diaza-bicyclo (5,4,0) undecene-7; phosphines such as triphenylphosphine; quaternary ammonium salts such as tetrabutylammonium salt, triisopropylmethylammonium salt, trimethyldecanylammonium salt, cetyltrimethylammonium salt, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide; quaternary phosphonium salts such as triphenylbenzylphosphonium salt, triphenylethylphosphonium salt, and tetrabutylphosphonium salt (the counter ions of the quaternary salts are not particularly specified, and examples thereof include halogen, organic acid ions, and hydroxide ions in which organic acid ions and hydroxide ions are particularly preferred.); and transition metal compounds (transition metal salts) such as zinc compounds, for example, tin octylates, zinc carboxylates (zinc 2-ethylhexanate, zinc stearate, zinc behenate, zinc mistylate) and zinc phosphate esters (zinc octyl phosphate, zinc stearyl phosphate, or the like). The blending amount of the curing accelerator is 0.01 to 5.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0095">The curable resin composition of the present invention may contain a phosphorus-containing compound as a flame retardation-imparting component.

When the content is 0.6 or more, the hygroscopicity and dielectric properties of the cured product may be adversely affected.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0096">A light stabilizer may be added to the curable resin composition of the present invention if necessary. As the light stabilizer, hindered amine-based light stabilizers, particularly HALS and the like are suitable.

Only one kind of HALS may be used, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0097">The curable resin composition of the present invention may be blended with a binder resin as necessary. Examples of the binder resin include, but are not limited to, butyral resins, acetal resins, acrylic resins, epoxy-nylon resins, NBR-phenol resins, epoxy-NBR resins, polyamide resins, polyimide resins, and silicone resins. The blending amount of the binder resin is preferably in a range that does not impair the flame retardancy and heat resistance of the cured product, and is preferably 0.05 to 50 parts by mass, and more preferably 0.05 to 20 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the resin component.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0098">Further, inorganic fillers may be added to the curable resin composition of the present invention if necessary. Examples of the inorganic fillers include powders of fused silica, crystalline silica, porous silica, alumina, zircon, calcium silicate, calcium carbonate, quartz powder, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, zirconia, aluminum nitride, graphite, forsterite, steatite, spinel, mullite, titania, talc, clay, iron oxide asbestos, and glass powder, or the above fillers formed into a spherical shape or a crushed shape. In particular, when a curable resin composition for encapsulating a semiconductor is obtained, the usage amount of the inorganic filler is generally within a range of 80 to 92 mass %, preferably 83 to 90 mass %, in the curable resin composition.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0099">The curable resin composition of the present invention may be blended with known additives if necessary. Specific examples of additives that can be used include surface treatment agents of fillers such as polybutadiene, modified products thereof, modified products of acrylonitrile copolymers, polyphenylene ether, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyimide, fluororesins, silicone gel, silicone oil and silane coupling agents, release agents, and colorants such as carbon black, phthalocyanine blue, and phthalocyanine green. The blending amount of these additives is preferably 1,000 parts by mass or less, and more preferably 700 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the curable resin composition. From the viewpoint of low water absorption and electrical properties, polybutadiene and modified products thereof, polyphenylene ether, polystyrene, polyethylene, fluororesins, and the like are preferred. From the viewpoint of electrical properties, adhesion, and low water absorption, polybutadiene and modified products thereof are preferred. Specific examples thereof include butadiene-based thermoplastic elastomers such as a styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR:RICON-100, RICON-181, RICON-184, all manufactured by Cray Valley) and an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer; and styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers such as a styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS), a hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer (SIS), a hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, and a hydrogenated styrene-(butadiene/isoprene)-styrene copolymer. One of these styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. Among these high molecular weight polymers, styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers such as a styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, a hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, and a hydrogenated styrene-(butadiene/isoprene)-styrene copolymer are preferred, and in particular, a styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, a hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer, a hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer, and a hydrogenated styrene-(butadiene/isoprene)-styrene copolymer are more preferred because they have higher heat resistance and are less likely to be oxidized and deteriorated. Specific examples thereof include SEPTON 1020, SEPTON 2002, SEPTON 2004F, SEPTON 2005, SEPTON 2006, SEPTON 2063, SEPTON 2104, SEPTON 4003, SEPTON 4044, SEPTON 4055, SEPTON 4077, SEPTON 4099, SEPTON 8004, SEPTON 8006, SEPTON 8007L, SEPTON HG252, SEPTON V9827, HYBRAR 7125 (hydrogenated), HYBRAR 7215F, and HYBRAR 7311F (all manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd.). In addition, the weight average molecular weight of the styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer is not particularly limited as long as it is 10,000 or more, but when it is too large, compatibility with a low molecular weight component having a weight average molecular weight of about 50 to 1,000 and an oligomer component having a weight average molecular weight of about 1,000 to 5,000 is deteriorated in addition to the polyphenylene ether compound, and it is difficult to ensure mixing and solvent stability. Therefore, the weight average molecular weight of the styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer is preferably about 10,000 to 300,000. In general, in the case of a compound, which contains a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, such as bismaleimide or polymaleimide, the polarity of the compound causes difficulty in ensuring compatibility with a low polarity compound such as a compound mainly composed of a hydrocarbon or a compound composed only of a hydrocarbon among the additives and the curable resin component. In contrast, the compound of the formula (1) itself is not a skeleton design in which a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen is actively introduced, and therefore, the compound of the formula (1) is excellent in compatibility with a material having low polarity and low dielectric properties or a compound composed only of a hydrocarbon.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0100">The curable resin composition of the present invention is obtained by uniformly mixing the above components at a predetermined ratio, and is preliminarily cured generally at 130 to 180&#xb0; C. within a range of 30 to 500 seconds, and further post-cured at 150 to 200&#xb0; C. for 2 to 15 hours, and whereby a curing reaction sufficiently proceeds, and the cured product of the present invention is obtained. It is also possible to perform the curing after the components of the curable resin composition are uniformly dispersed or dissolved in a solvent or the like, and the solvent is removed.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0101">The thus-obtained curable resin composition of the present invention has moisture resistance, heat resistance, and high adhesiveness.

Specifically, the curable resin composition is useful as a material for various electric and electronic components, such as an insulating material, a laminated board (a printed wiring board, a BGA substrate, a build-up substrate, or the like), a sealing material, and a resist.

The respective components may be mixed uniformly or prepolymerized. For example, the curable resin of the present invention is prepolymerized by being heated in the presence or absence of a catalyst or in the presence or absence of a solvent. Similarly, in addition to the curable resin of the present invention, a curing agent such as an epoxy resin, an amine compound, a maleimide-based compound, a cyanate ester compound, a phenol resin, and an acid anhydride compound, and other additives may be added to prepolymerize the resin. Mixing or prepolymerization of the respective components is performed using, for example, an extruder, a kneader, a roll, or the like in the absence of a solvent, and using, for example, a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer in the presence of a solvent.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0104">As a method of uniformly mixing, the components are kneaded and mixed at a temperature within a range of 50 to 100&#xb0; C. using an apparatus such as a kneader, a roll, or a planetary mixer to obtain a uniform resin composition. The obtained resin composition is pulverized and then molded into a cylindrical tablet shape by a molding machine such as a tablet machine, or into a granular powder or powder molded body, or these compositions are melted on a surface support and molded into a sheet shape having a thickness of 0.05 mm to 10 mm, thereby obtaining a curable resin composition molded body. The obtained molded body becomes a molded body having no stickiness at 0 to 20&#xb0; C., and the fluidity and the curability are hardly reduced even when the molded body is stored at &#x2212;25 to 0&#xb0; C. for one week or more. The obtained molded body can be molded into a cured product by a transfer molding machine or a compression molding machine.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0105">A varnish-like composition (hereinafter, simply referred to as varnish) can be obtained by adding an organic solvent to the curable resin composition of the present invention. If necessary, the curable resin composition of the present invention is dissolved in a solvent such as toluene, xylene, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and N-methylpyrrolidone to form a varnish, and a base material such as glass fibers, carbon fibers, polyester fibers, polyamide fibers, alumina fibers, and paper is impregnated with the varnish, followed by heating and drying to obtain a prepreg. The prepreg is subjected to hot press molding, so that a cured product of the curable resin composition of the present invention can be obtained. In this case, the solvent is used in an amount of generally 10 to 70 wt %, preferably 15 to 70 wt % in the mixture of the curable resin composition of the present invention and the solvent. In the case of a liquid composition, for example, a curable resin cured product containing carbon fibers can be obtained as it is by the RTM method.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0106">The curable resin composition of the present invention can also be used as a modifier for a film-type composition. Specifically, the curable composition can be used to improve flexibility or the like in the B-stage. Such a film-type resin composition is obtained as a sheet-shaped adhesive by applying the curable resin composition of the present invention as the curable resin composition varnish onto a release film, removing the solvent under heating, and then performing B-stage formation. This sheet-shaped adhesive can be used as an interlayer insulating layer in a multilayer substrate or the like.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0107">A prepreg can be obtained by heating and melting the curable resin composition of the present invention, reducing the viscosity of the composition, and impregnating reinforcing fibers such as glass fibers, carbon fibers, polyester fibers, polyamide fibers, and alumina fibers with the composition. Specific examples thereof include, but are not particularly limited to, glass fibers such as E glass cloth, D glass cloth, S glass cloth, Q glass cloth, spherical glass cloth, NE glass cloth, and T glass cloth; inorganic fibers other than glass; polyparaphenylene terephthalamide (Kevlar (registered trademark), manufactured by DuPont), wholly aromatic polyamide, and polyesters; and organic fibers such as polyparaphenylene benzoxazole, polyimide, and carbon fibers.

The above prepreg can also be obtained by impregnating reinforcing fibers with the varnish and performing heating and drying.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0108">The laminated board of the present embodiment includes one or more of the prepregs. The laminated board is not particularly limited as long as it includes one or more prepregs, and may include any other layer. A method for manufacturing the laminated board is not particularly limited, and a generally known method can be appropriately applied.

At this time, the heating temperature is not particularly limited, and is preferably 65 to 300&#xb0; C., and more preferably 120 to 270&#xb0; C. The pressure to be applied is not particularly limited, and is preferably 2.0 to 5.0 MPa, and more preferably 2.5 to 4.0 MPa since if the pressure is too high, it is difficult to adjust the solid content of the resin of the laminated board and the quality is not stable, and if the pressure is too low, the air bubbles occur and the adhesion between the laminates deteriorates. The laminated board of the present embodiment can be suitably used as a metal foil-clad laminated board to be described later by including a layer made of a metal foil.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0109">The prepreg is cut into a desired shape and laminated with a copper foil or the like as necessary, and then the curable resin composition is heated and cured while applying pressure to the laminate by a press molding method, an autoclave molding method, a sheet winding molding method, or the like, so that a laminated board for an electric and electronic device (printed wiring board) or a carbon fiber reinforced material can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0110">The cured product of the present invention can be used in various applications such as a molding material, an adhesive, a composite material, and a coating material.
