As is well known to those skilled in the art, the temperature in the refrigerating compartment is generally between 2&#xb0; C. and 10&#xb0; C., preferably between 4&#xb0; C. and 7&#xb0; C. The temperature in the freezing compartment generally ranges from &#x2212;22&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;14&#xb0; C. The temperature-variable compartment may be adjusted between &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. and 8&#xb0; C. at will. The best storage temperatures for different types of articles are not the same, and the suitable storage locations thereof are not the same, either. For example, fruit and vegetable foods are suitable to be stored in the refrigerating compartment, while meat foods are suitable to be stored in the freezing compartment. The door body <b>200</b> may be a refrigerating compartment door body for opening and closing the refrigerating compartment, a freezing compartment door body for opening and closing the freezing compartment, or a temperature-variable compartment door body for opening and closing the temperature-variable compartment.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A refrigeration system is configured to provide cooling energy to the storage compartment <b>110</b>. The refrigeration system may be a refrigeration cycle system composed of a compressor, a condenser, a throttling device, an evaporator, and the like, and may alternatively be a semiconductor refrigeration system. Since the refrigeration principle of the refrigerator <b>10</b> is well known to those skilled in the art, the descriptions thereof are omitted herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present embodiment provides a door body <b>200</b> for a refrigerator <b>10</b> and a refrigerator <b>10</b> with the same. The refrigerator <b>10</b> includes a cabinet <b>100</b> defining a storage compartment <b>110</b> with a compartment opening, and the door body <b>200</b> includes an inner door <b>210</b>, an outer door <b>220</b> and a storage box <b>230</b>. The inner door <b>210</b> is arranged at a position corresponding to the compartment opening on an outer side of the storage compartment <b>110</b>, and the inner door <b>210</b> is used to open and close the compartment opening. The outer door <b>220</b> is arranged at a side of the inner door <b>210</b> away from the storage compartment <b>110</b>. The storage box <b>230</b> is fixed to a side of the inner door <b>210</b> close to the storage compartment <b>110</b>, one end of the storage box <b>230</b> close to the outer door <b>220</b> has a storage opening, and an area of the inner door <b>210</b> corresponding to the storage opening is provided with an inner door opening <b>211</b>. This type of door body <b>200</b> enables a user to take and place the food in the storage box <b>230</b> by just opening the outer door <b>220</b>, which reduces the loss of the cooling energy, and the storage box <b>230</b> does not move with the outer door <b>220</b>, so that the cooling energy of the refrigerator <b>10</b> can still keep the food in the storage box <b>230</b> fresh, which improves the fresh-keeping effect on the food in the storage box <b>230</b> and reduces the energy consumption of the refrigerator <b>10</b> at the same time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At least one pin <b>250</b> may include a cylindrical body <b>251</b> and a clamping protrusion <b>255</b>. A first end <b>252</b> of the cylindrical body <b>251</b> is arranged at a corresponding pin hole <b>215</b>, and a second end <b>253</b> of the cylindrical body <b>251</b> is provided with a positioning part <b>254</b> extending along a circumferential direction of the cylindrical body <b>251</b>. The clamping protrusion <b>255</b> is arranged at a surface of the cylindrical body <b>251</b> located between the first end <b>252</b> and the positioning part <b>254</b>. Furthermore, two ends of the opening and closing member <b>240</b> are respectively provided with connecting holes <b>241</b> in areas opposite to corresponding pins <b>250</b>, and the connecting hole <b>241</b> is used to connect the cylindrical body <b>251</b> between the positioning part <b>254</b> and the clamping protrusion <b>255</b> of the corresponding pin <b>250</b>. Such arrangement makes the connection between the pin <b>250</b> and the opening and closing member <b>240</b> stronger, thereby making the structure of this type of door body <b>200</b> more stable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Hereto, those skilled in the art should realize that although multiple exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in detail herein, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, many other variations or modifications that conform to the principles of the present invention can still be directly determined or deduced from the contents disclosed in the present invention.
