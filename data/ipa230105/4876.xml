The counseling service is a counseling service that uses an instant messenger connected to an instant messaging server for providing an instant messaging service as a counseling medium, and a user may use the counseling service through a registered account or by subscribing to the instant messaging service. The counseling center server and the instant messaging server may be included in a counseling system for providing the counseling service, and a detailed configuration of the counseling system will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The instant messaging server according to an example embodiment may provide various types of accounts, such as a personal account, a corporate account, or a service account, to use the instant messaging service. The personal account may be an account for a general user, the corporate account may be an account for a specific company, and the service account may be an account for a specific service. The corporate account or the service account may be referred to as a channel.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The counseling service according to an example embodiment may be provided in the form of the counseling through a channel registered in the instant messaging service. Counseling through the channel may refer to the counseling conducted in a chatting manner between the channel and another account that requests the counseling on the channel. For example, the counseling service may be provided in a chatting manner using an instant messenger between a personal account (an individual account) of the first user corresponding to a general user and the channel of the second user corresponding to a specific company or a specific service provider. Hereinafter, the counseling center server may be briefly referred to as a server.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Operation <b>110</b> according to an example embodiment may include receiving the message of the first user regarding the counseling request through the chat room of the channel of the second user registered in the instant messaging service. The first user may correspond to a user who has a personal account, a corporate account, or a service account registered in the instant messaging service, and the second user may correspond to a user who has a corporate account or a service account registered in the instant messaging service.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an example embodiment, the first user may request the instant messaging server for the counseling through the channel of the second user using a terminal. As an example, the terminal or the first user may be input with a command from the first user for requesting the counseling from a website or application linked to the channel of the second user and transmit a signal for requesting the instant messaging server for the counseling through the channel of the second user. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the terminal of the first user responses to an input of the first user who selects (e.g., clicks) a button <b>211</b> for requesting the counseling on a website <b>210</b> linked to the channel of the second user to transmit a signal requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user to the instant messaging server. As another example, the terminal of the first user may request the counseling on the channel of the second user through an interface related to the channel of the second user provided in the instant messenger. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the terminal of the first user responses to an input of the first user who selects (e.g., clicks) a button <b>221</b> for requesting the counseling on an interface <b>220</b> related to the channel of the second user provided in the instant messenger to transmit a signal for requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user to the instant messaging server. In this case, the counseling request for the channel of the second user may be transmitted to the counseling center server through the instant messaging server.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The instant messaging server according to an example embodiment may create the chat room for the channel of the second user that the account of the first user participates in response to the input of the first user requesting the counseling on the channel of the second user. The chat room may correspond to a virtual chat space in which at least one account or channel participates. The chat room of the channel may correspond to a chat room in which the channel or an account linked to the channel participates. The chat room of the channel may be provided in a different type from the general chat room, and a corporate message including notification information or promotional information related to the company or the service may be transmitted through the chat room. In other words, the instant messaging server may create a chat room in which the first user's account and the second user's channel participate in response to the input of the first user requesting the counseling on the channel of the second user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to an example embodiment, the chat room of the channel may include a chat room for counseling. The chat room for counseling is a chat space for conducting the counseling between a counselor linked to the channel and a user who requested the counseling. The chat room for counseling may be connected to a counselor linked to the channel or to a chat bot linked to the channel.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The instant messaging server may provide a chat interface for counseling corresponding to the chat room for counseling to the terminal of the first user. The chat interface for counseling may correspond to a user interface for transmitting and receiving chat messages for counseling and displaying the transmitted and received messages.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an example embodiment, when the terminal of the first user who requested the counseling through the channel of the second user is not logged in to the instant messaging service, the instant messaging server may request the terminal of the first user to log in for the instant messaging service. For example, the instant messaging server may call an instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user and provide an interface for logging in to an account registered in the instant messaging service. The instant messaging server may provide a chat interface for counseling corresponding to the channel of the second user to the terminal of the first user logged in to the instant messaging service with the account of the first user. Hereinafter, description will be followed by assuming that the terminal of the first user is logged in with the account of the first user registered in the instant messaging service.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, when an input of the first user requesting the counseling is received from the website, the instant messaging server may provide a chat interface in the form of web chatting through the website. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the instant messaging server responses to a counseling request through a website <b>310</b> to provide a chat interface <b>311</b> for counseling corresponding to the second channel in the form of web chatting through the website <b>310</b>. Also, it is possible to provide a chat interface through an instant messenger application by calling the instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the instant messaging server responds to a counseling request through a website or a counseling request through a channel interface of the second user provided in the instant messenger so as to call the instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user and provide a chat interface <b>320</b> through the called instant messenger application.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to an example embodiment, the terminal of the first user logged in with the account of the first user may send a message of the first user regarding the counseling request to the chat room of the channel of the second user in which the account of the first user participates through the chat interface. The message transmitted to the chat room may be transmitted to the instant messaging server, and the instant messaging server may deliver the same to the counseling center server. In other words, operation <b>110</b> according to an example embodiment may include receiving the message of the first user from the instant messaging server.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to an example embodiment, operations of creating the chat room described above, requesting login, and providing the chat interface described above as being performed in the instant messaging server may be performed in the counseling center server. In this case, operation <b>110</b> according to an example embodiment may include receiving, by the counseling center server, the message of the first user directly from the terminal logged in with the account of the first user.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an example embodiment, the channel of the second user may be linked to the account of at least one counselor. The account of the counselor may correspond to an account registered in the instant messaging service or the counseling center server. The account of the counselor linked to the channel of the second user may conduct the counseling by transmitting and receiving a message to and from the account of the first user who requested the counseling for the channel through the chat room of the channel. The account of the counselor linked to the channel of the second user may correspond to an account to which access to the chat room of the channel is granted. The right to access the chat room of the channel may correspond to the right to transmit a message through the chat room of the channel using the channel and receive the message transmitted through the chat room of the channel. For example, a message transmitted through the chat room of the channel by an account of a counselor linked to the channel of the second user may be displayed as a message transmitted by the channel. In other words, the message transmitted through the chat room of the channel by the account of the counselor linked to the channel of the second user may be displayed as a message transmitted from the channel of the second user, not by the account of the counselor.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to an example embodiment, the right to access the chat room of the channel for the account of the counselor linked to the channel of the second user may be limited to a part of the chat room of the channel. As will be described in detail below, the account of the first counselor may have a right to access some of chat rooms of the second user's channel, and the account of the second counselor may have a right to access some other chat rooms of the second user's channel. When the account of the first counselor linked to the channel of the second user is not granted access to a first chat room of the channel, the account of the first counselor may not be allowed to transmit a message through the first chat room using the channel. On the other hand, reading the messages transmitted and received through the chat room of the channel may be allowed even to the account of the counselor who does not have access to the chat room.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Operation <b>120</b> according to an example embodiment may correspond to creating a first counseling ticket of the channel corresponding to the chat room based on the message input received in operation <b>110</b>. For example, the message received from the first user may be input through the chat interface for counseling provided in the terminal of the first user as described above, and may be received by the counseling center server through the instant messaging server.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to an example embodiment, a counseling ticket is a unit of counseling objectified in the server, and the counseling ticket may correspond to a session for the counseling between a specific user account and a specific channel. The counseling ticket may be created to correspond to the chat room of the channel, and the counseling between the user account and the channel through the chat room of the channel may be objectified as a counseling ticket to be stored in a server or a database accessible from the server. For example, the counseling ticket may include a chat log transmitted and received between a specific user account and a specific channel through the corresponding chat room.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first counseling ticket according to an example embodiment may be created when there is a message input of the account of the first user through the chat room of the channel of the second user created in response to the counseling request input from the first user. In other words, the first counseling ticket may be created as the first user who requested the counseling inputs a chat message in the chat room of the channel of the second user through the chat interface for counseling. Hereinafter, &#x2018;chat interface for counseling&#x2019; may be briefly referred to as &#x2018;chat interface&#x2019; or &#x2018;interface&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, a plurality of chat rooms for the channel may be created, and as a chat message is input to the plurality of chat rooms, a plurality of counseling tickets corresponding to each chat room may be created. According to an example embodiment, one or more counseling tickets may be created through the same chat room. For example, a first chat room of the channel including the account of the first user is created first, a counseling ticket may be created by a chat message first input through the first chat room, and after the counseling ticket ends, another counseling ticket may be created by an input of a chat message through the chat room.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to an example embodiment, the counseling ticket may correspond to any one of a plurality of states corresponding to the progress of the counseling. The state of the counseling ticket may be updated upon the occurrence of an event related to the counseling ticket that occurs in the course of the counseling. As an example, the counseling ticket may be changed from a first state to a second state as a first event related to the counseling ticket occurs, and may be changed from the second state to a third state as a second event related to the counseling ticket occurs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to an example embodiment, the state of the counseling ticket may include the waiting state and a progress state. The waiting state may correspond to a state that is changed as an allocation event related to a counseling ticket occurs, and the progress state may correspond to a state that is changed as a counseling connection event related to a counseling ticket occurs. An allocation event related to a counseling ticket may occur when the counseling ticket is allocated to an account of a specific counselor. The counseling connection event related to the counseling ticket may occur when the account of the counselor allocated with the counseling ticket accesses the chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket or transmits a message through the chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to an example embodiment, the state of the counseling ticket may include an unallocated state as a default state. The default state is an initial state of a counseling ticket that is set as an event for creating a counseling ticket occurs, and may correspond to a state before an event that changes the state of the counseling ticket occurs. The counseling ticket in the unallocated state may be changed to the waiting state as an allocation event occurs.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to an example embodiment, the state of the counseling ticket may further include an end state and/or a pending state. The state and state change of the counseling ticket will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Operation <b>130</b> according to an example embodiment may include acquiring the number of counseling tickets in the waiting state allocated to each of the accounts of a plurality of counselors linked to the channel based on a database in which information on counseling tickets of the channel is stored.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The database in which the information on the counseling ticket of the channel is stored according to an example embodiment is a storage space for storing the counseling ticket(s) previously created to correspond to the channel, and may be implemented in a memory within a server or a storage device accessible from a server.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to an example embodiment, the database may be configured to store information on the counseling ticket to correspond to each channel.

On the other hand, when a connection request with &#x2018;counseling ticket <b>10</b>&#x2019; is received from the terminal of counselor B, the state of &#x2018;counseling ticket <b>10</b>&#x2019; may not be updated to the progress state since the number of counseling tickets in the progress state allocated to the account of the counselor B corresponds to 3 or more. As will be described in detail below, &#x2018;counseling ticket <b>14</b>&#x2019; corresponding to the pending state may be included in a list of counseling tickets in the progress state. In other words, when counting the number of counseling tickets in the progress state, the counseling tickets in the pending state may be counted as counseling tickets in the progress state. When the state of the counseling ticket requested to be connected is not changed due to non-compliance with the condition regarding the number of counseling tickets, the server may notify the counselor who has requested the connection that the connection with the counseling ticket failed or the state of the counseling ticket has not been changed through the interface.

A state change condition for the state of the first counseling ticket to be changed to the end state may be satisfied by occurrence of an end event. In other words, the end state may correspond to a state that is changed by the occurrence of the end event of the counseling ticket. Counseling tickets in the unallocated state, waiting state, or progress state may be changed to the end state as the end event occurs. For example, the counseling ticket in the unallocated state, waiting state, or progress state may be updated to the end state by the occurrence of the end event, such as cases that a command is received from a user and/or a counselor requesting the end of the counseling and/or there is no response from a user for a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to an example embodiment, the state of the counseling ticket may further include the pending state. A state change condition for changing the state of the first counseling ticket to the pending state may be satisfied by the occurrence of a pending event. In other words, the pending state may correspond to a state that is changed as the pending event occurs in the progress state of the counseling ticket. A counseling ticket in the progress state may be changed to the pending state as the pending event occurs. For example, the counseling ticket in the progress state may be updated to the pending state by the occurrence of the pending event, such as a case when a command for requesting pending of the counseling is received from a counselor.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The pending state according to an example embodiment may be recognized as a detailed state of the progress state.
