The analyte sensor may be or may comprise an electrochemical sensor configured for insertion into a body tissue of a user, specifically an insertable or implantable electrochemical sensor for monitoring of the at least one analyte in the body tissue and/or in a body fluid within the body tissue. The method and devices according to this disclosure may be used for detecting at least one analyte present in one or both of a body tissue or a body fluid, in particular the method and devices are applied in the field of detecting one or more analytes such as glucose, lactate, triglycerides, cholesterol or other analytes, preferably metabolites, in body fluids such as blood or interstitial fluid or other body fluids, both in the field of professional diagnostics, in the field of hospital point of care, in the field of personal care and in the field of home monitoring. However, other fields of application are feasible.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of medical technology and diagnostics, a large number of devices and methods for detecting at least one analyte in a body fluid are known. The method and devices may be used for detecting at least one analyte present in one or both of a body tissue or a body fluid, in particular one or more analytes such as glucose, lactate, triglycerides, cholesterol or other analytes, preferably metabolites, in body fluids such as blood or interstitial fluid or other body fluids. Without restricting the scope of this disclosure, in the following, mainly reference is made to the determination of glucose by an electrochemical biosensor as an exemplary and preferred analyte.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical electrochemical biosensor comprises a biological recognition element, which can be an antibody, a DNA-string, a protein or more specifically an enzyme. These molecules specifically bind to or react with analyte molecules. The biological recognition element, here exemplary an enzyme, is in contact to a transducer, an element, which transforms the change in the biological recognition element in to a measurable signal. Typical electrochemical biosensor uses working electrode as a transducer. In the case of enzymatic electrodes, the charge (electrons) generated by the enzyme must be efficiently and/or quantitatively collected by the transducer. Depending on the used enzyme and the sensor construction, the charge transfer can be direct from the enzyme to the transducer, i.e., the working electrode, or redox mediated by, e.g., natural oxygen, redox-active polymers or other redox active substances. The here exemplary presented electrochemical sensor deploys the enzyme from the class of oxidoreductase, called glucose oxidase (GOx). GOx may use oxygen as an electron acceptor, reducing it to hydrogen peroxide. The latter is diffusing toward working electrode surface, which is polarized at a potential, sufficient for efficient oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the oxygen/hydrogen peroxide acts as redox mediator for electron transfer from the enzyme active center to the surface of the working electrode. Such scheme corresponds to an enzymatic biosensor of the first generation. In the second generation, other redox reagents are envisaged to replace oxygen. Such mediators may be either freely diffusing species, or bound in a polymer matrix or other way. Some examples of the redox active species are ferrocene and phenazine derivatives, quinones, ruthenium or osmium complexes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the field of continuous monitoring, typically, subcutaneous implantable electrochemical sensors are used. A typical subcutaneous continuous glucose sensor is based on an enzymatic oxidation of glucose, which is present in the interstitial fluid (ISF). Glucose concentration in the ISF of the skin is relatively high which may lead to the following problems.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">1. The oxidation kinetics of the enzyme may be limiting. Typically, enzymes have such characteristic as turnover number (TON), the maximum number of chemical conversions of molecules, e.g., glucose, per second that a single catalytic site will execute for a given enzyme concentration. It may not be possible for the enzyme to oxidize large amount of glucose such that the enzyme may be the limiting factor of the measuring chain and makes a quantitative measurement impossible.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">2. The lifetime under load may be limiting. The turnover number may also have a different meaning, the number of moles of substrate, e.g., glucose, that a mole of catalyst, here the enzyme, can convert before becoming, fully or partially, e.g., to one half of the initial activity, inactivated. Thus, under this high utilization the enzymatic electrode may rapidly lose activity.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">3. If the amount of enzyme is enough to oxidize a large amount of glucose, other factors may be limiting, such that a quantitative measurement is impossible. For instance, the kinetics of the electron transfer from the enzyme to the transducer may be the limiting factor.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">4. If the activity of the enzymatic electrodes may be adjusted such that the high concentration of glucose is efficiently oxidized and the electron transfer to the electrode is efficient, a local depletion of glucose may exist. Glucose may diffuse relatively slowly in the ISF such that the concentration of glucose in the region of the sensor where it is actively consumed, may be lower compared to the ISF such that a correct and quantitative measurement is not possible.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0010">5. An electrochemical continuous glucose sensor may comprise at least two electrodes, wherein onto one of the electrodes, here denoted as working electrode, the glucose detection by means of oxidation chain happens. A second electrode, denoted counter or auxiliary electrode, is used in order to complete the electrochemical process and to provide a counter reaction to compensate the charge flow. At the working electrode oxidizing processes occur and at the counter electrode reductive processes occur, wherein the amount of charge must be identical and the counterreaction may not be limiting. In the case, if the counter/auxiliary electrode is subcutaneous as well and is made of an electrochemically inactive substance, e.g., gold, the substance which is reduced at the counter electrode is typically the in ISF dissolved molecular oxygen. However, the amount of available dissolved oxygen is significantly less than that of glucose such that the counter reaction may be limiting and a quantitative measurement is thus impossible.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0011">A solution for the aforementioned problems may be using a so-called diffusion limiting layer. The layer may be applied to the working electrode as thin polymer film forming a membrane and may be configured for slowing down the diffusion of the glucose to the sensitive surface of the working electrode. Thus, the glucose concentration directly at the sensitive surface of the working electrode is less but proportional to the glucose concentration in the ISF. However, in order to allow for a correct quantitative measurement of the glucose concentration permeability of the membrane needs to be constant or known. The direct measurement of the membrane permeability in vivo is not possible or very challenging, in particular in case no other nominal values are known from which the permeability can be determined.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">Moreover, the permeability of the membrane may depend on several factors such as the material of the membrane, thickness of the membrane, temperature, swelling degree and others. In known methods, impact on temperature may be determined using an external temperature sensor which is placed on the skin. However, as the temperature is determined on the skin but not subcutaneous at a position of the sensor, reliability and accuracy of these methods may be limited.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">Several electrochemical methods are known for compensating membrane effects such as using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or potential pulse techniques. However, these methods may require complex electronics. Moreover, conducting of these additional measurements may result in driving the electrochemical system out of its steady-state, thus the correct measurement during this time and, maybe, some time after, is not possible. In addition, applying of the additional modulation potential may provoke side effects, such as unspecific oxidation of interference substances which may lead to a non-correct measurement values.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Furthermore, these methods are not always sufficiently specific towards membrane effects, and may be influenced by other parameters of the system, such as actual analyte concentration and thus actual signal level, e.g., DC current.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">U.S. Publication No. 2010/0213079 A1 describes a system for the measurement of analyte concentration which includes an electrochemical cell having a working electrode coated with a protein layer and a diffusion limiting barrier covering the protein layer, and a counter electrode; a voltage source which provides a voltage between the working electrode and the counter electrode when electrically connected by a conductive medium; and a computing system which measures the dynamic voltage output to the counter electrode within a time period prior to a response from the working electrode and method for use is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">WO 2019/115687 A1 describes a method for determining an information on an equivalent series resistance in a test strip.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">WO 2019/007842 A1 discloses a method for detecting in-vivo properties of a biosensor which is, in interoperation with an electronics unit, adapted for electrochemically determining at least one value of an analyte in a sample of a body fluid.

The reference electrode may have a stable and well-known electrode potential. The electrode potential of the reference electrode may preferably be highly stable. One of the electrodes may have several functionalities, as for instance, combined reference and counter electrode, which has both, the function of the reference and counter electrodes, which means it provides a reference potential and balances the current flow from the working electrode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">At least one of the measurement electrodes comprises at least one membrane element having the at least one membrane property.

The term specifically may refer, without limitation, to at least one element configured for controlling and/or limiting diffusion of the analyte to the electrode to which the membrane element is applied. Thus, the membrane element may be configured as diffusion limiting membrane. However, the membrane element may have even more functionalities, such as providing biocompatibility. The membrane element may have further functions such as blocking of leakage of components below the membrane element such as of the enzyme or other components comprised in any one of the at least two measurement electrodes.

The term &#x201c;permeability&#x201d; as used herein is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art and is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning. The term specifically may refer, without limitation, to a material parameter characterizing transmission properties of the membrane element, specifically passing of substances through the membrane element. Further specifically, permeability may refer to permeability for a specific analyte since molecules and ions of the analytes may have different sizes, shapes and charge. In an embodiment, the permeability refers to the permeability of the membrane for glucose.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">Permeability of the membrane element for certain compounds may be proportional to the membrane's swelling degree. The swelling degree may correspond to the degree of water uptake. The swelling degree of the membrane may depend on its hydrophilicity. The membrane's swelling degree may directly affect the amount and/or mobility and, thus, the permeability of the membrane for certain compounds. The conductivity of an electrolyte like water or bodily fluid, such as interstitial fluid is directly linked to so-called total dissolved solids whereby ions, such as H+, OH&#x2014;, Na+, K+, Cl&#x2014; and other have the most contribution. Therefore, also the conductivity of the membrane which has taken up water or bodily fluid such as interstitial fluid is directly linked to the total dissolved solids. The more charge carriers are present and the more mobile they are, the lower is the measured electrical resistance, by otherwise constant conditions, such as, e.g., cell geometry. Thus, the electrical resistance, or reversely, electric conductivity of the membrane element may depend on quantity and mobility of ions present in the membrane.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">The proposed method may comprise using at least one algorithm configured for determining permeability of the membrane element for a specific analyte, in particular glucose, by evaluating electrical resistance of the membrane element. The permeability of the membrane element for a specific analyte p<sub>Analyt </sub>may be determined by p<sub>Analyt</sub>=f*p, wherein p is the permeability determined via the electrical resistance of the membrane element and f is a conversion factor. The conversion factor may be determined in calibration experiments using known glucose values. The membrane property, in particular the permeability, may depend on different parameters such as temperature, composition of interstitial fluid, thickness of the membrane element, aging, swelling degree, mechanical stresses and the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">After insertion of the analyte sensor, the membrane element may swell. In ideal case, the swelling process may be rapid such that a determining of the concentration of the analyte is not influenced, or a swelling behavior may be pre-known such that changes in permeability can be considered and corrected. However, in non-ideal case, the swelling of the membrane element may lead to unknown changes in permeability.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">Composition of the interstitial fluid may vary from user to user. Components of the interstitial fluid may change permeability of the membrane element such that molecules and ions can ingress from the interstitial fluid into the membrane element. The molecules and ions can bind to certain functional groups of the polymer of the membrane element and can change permeability of the membrane element. Effects due to non-constant interstitial fluid can be temporal, i.e., binding of ingressed molecules and ions to functional groups of the polymer of the membrane element may be reversible. However, even in non-permanent changes diffusion of ingressed molecules and ions out of the membrane may last some time.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">Permeability of the membrane element may depend on temperature, as it directly influences the ions mobility within the membrane. The temperature at insertion site of the analyte sensor may not be constant such that in-operando monitoring of permeability may be performed. Intrinsic properties of the membrane element may change during storage of the analyte sensor. These changes may depend on storage conditions. For example, the membrane property may change faster at high temperatures. Such changes may lead to changes in permeability and may lead to non-reliable measurements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">Further, mechanical load may change permeability of the membrane. For example, if a user lays down to bed on a side where the inserted analyte sensor is arranged, skin of the user and the analyte sensor may be mechanically compressed which may result in decrease of the sensor signal.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">The partially or fully implanted analyte sensor may comprise at least one biocompatibility layer such as a thin layer of highly hydrophilic polymer. This layer may be applied independently on the presence of the diffusion limiting membrane and may influence the diffusion of the analyte, thus acting as kind of diffusion limiting membrane. For accurate measurements, this effect may be considered and the method according to this disclosure may be applied for compensation of biocompatible layers or other layers, which are not deliberately diffusion limiting layers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">The determining of the membrane property may comprise testing the membrane property.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the resistance of the electrolyte between the working electrode <b>116</b> and the reference electrode <b>120</b> may be given by an electric resistance R<sub>2 </sub>and the resistance of the electrolyte between the counter electrode <b>118</b> and the reference electrode <b>120</b> may be given by an electric resistance R<sub>1</sub>. The resistance R<sub>2 </sub>may further be dependent on properties of the membrane element <b>122</b> denoted with an arrow and reference number of the membrane element at the electric resistance R<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, the membrane element <b>122</b> may be applied to the working electrode <b>116</b>. The membrane element <b>122</b> may be configured for controlling and/or limiting diffusion of the analyte to the working electrode <b>116</b>. Thus, the membrane element <b>122</b> may be configured as diffusion limiting membrane. However, the membrane element <b>122</b> may have even more functionalities, such as providing biocompatibility. The membrane element <b>122</b> may have further functions such as blocking of leakage of components below the membrane element <b>122</b> such as of the enzyme or other components comprised in any one of the at least two measurement electrodes. The membrane element <b>122</b> may also be configured as a blocking membrane. The blocking may refer to preventing leakage of inner components of a sensitive layer of the working electrode <b>116</b> but not to the analyte. The membrane element <b>122</b> may be configured for maintaining of sensor integrity, by for instance keeping the enzyme or redox mediator from leaching, thus gradation of the whole sensor.

Permeability of the membrane element <b>122</b> for certain compounds may be proportional to the membrane's swelling degree. The swelling degree may correspond to the degree of water uptake. The swelling degree of the membrane <b>122</b> may depend on its hydrophilicity. The membrane's swelling degree may directly affect the amount and/or mobility and, thus, the permeability of the membrane for certain compounds. The conductivity of an electrolyte like water or bodily fluid, such as interstitial fluid is directly linked to so-called total dissolved solids whereby ions, such as H+, OH&#x2014;, Na+, K+, Cl&#x2014; and other have the most contribution. Therefore, also the conductivity of the membrane <b>122</b> which has taken up water or bodily fluid such as interstitial fluid also is directly linked to the total dissolved solids. The more charge carriers are present and the more mobile they are, the lower is the measured electrical resistance, by otherwise constant conditions, such as, e.g., cell geometry. Thus, the electrical resistance, or reversely, electric conductivity of the membrane element <b>122</b> may depend on quantity and mobility of ions present in the membrane. The analytical system <b>110</b> may be configured for using at least one algorithm configured for determining permeability of the membrane element <b>122</b> for a specific analyte, in particular glucose, by evaluating electrical resistance of the membrane element <b>122</b>. The permeability of the membrane element <b>122</b> for a specific analyte p<sub>Analyt </sub>may be determined by p<sub>Analyt</sub>=f*p, wherein p is the permeability determined via the electrical resistance of the membrane element <b>122</b> and f is a conversion factor. The conversion factor may be determined in calibration experiments using known glucose values.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0148">The membrane property, in particular the permeability, may depend on different parameters such as temperature, composition of interstitial fluid, thickness of the membrane element, aging, swelling degree, mechanical stresses and the like.

The analytical system <b>110</b> may be configured for in-operando monitoring of permeability, in particular continuously or in short time intervals. Also temperature monitoring is possible. The analytical system <b>110</b> may be configured for performing at least one failsafe step in order to enhance reliability of the determining of the analyte concentration.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0149">The analytical system <b>110</b> comprises at least one signal generator device (or &#x201c;signal generator&#x201d;) <b>124</b> configured for generating at least one fast-transient voltage signal. The signal generator device <b>124</b> is configured for applying the fast-transient voltage signal to the two measurement electrodes <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0150">The fast-transient voltage signal may be at least one arbitrary voltage signal applicable to the at least two measurement electrodes <b>114</b> having fast-transient signal flanks, in particular two very steep edges. The fast-transient voltage signal may comprise a square wave form and/or a sine wave form. The fast-transient voltage signal may comprise a non-continuous signal such as a pulse. Specifically, the fast-transient voltage signal may comprise a fast transition square wave. The pulse may have a transient change in the amplitude of the signal from a first value, also denoted baseline value, to a second value, followed by a return to the baseline value or at least approximately to the baseline value. The second value may be a higher or lower value than the baseline value. A pulse duration may be &#x2264;50 &#x3bc;s, preferably &#x2264;20 &#x3bc;s, more preferably &#x2264;10 &#x3bc;s. The duration of the single pulse must be sufficiently long to be able to record its propagation. The duration of the single pulse must be preferentially short, in order to not excite the system electrochemically. The fast-transient voltage signal may be applied during at least one test sequence, for example a time sequence. The fast-transient voltage signal may be applied repeatedly, in particular periodically. The time distance between the cycles must be sufficiently long in order to keep the system at its steady-state. The fast-transient voltage signal may comprise a repeatable cycle, wherein the repeatable cycle comprises at least one signal flank. The signal flank may be a transition of a signal amplitude from low to high signal value or from high to low signal value. The signal flank may be a rising signal flank or a falling signal flank. The signal flank of the fast-transient voltage signal may have a change in signal from the first value of the signal flank to the second value of the signal flank in a microsecond to nanosecond range. The signal flank of the fast-transient voltage signal may have a change in signal from the second value of the signal flank to the first value of the signal flank in a microsecond to nanosecond range. The terms first and second &#x201c;value&#x201d; may refer to regions or points of the fast-transient voltage signal, in particular signal amplitude. The first value may be the baseline value. The first value may be a local and/or overall minimum of the fast-transient voltage signal. The first value may be a first plateau of the fast-transient voltage signal. The first value may refer to a time point with no voltage is applied to the measurement electrodes. The first value may be a through or low value of the fast-transient voltage signal. The second value may be a local and/or overall maximum of the fast-transient voltage signal. The second point may be a second plateau of the fast-transient voltage signal, which may be reached during application of the fast-transient voltage signal. The second point may be a peak or high value of the fast-transient voltage signal. The fast-transient voltage signal may have a rising signal flank and a falling signal flank. The fast-transient voltage signal may have steep edges. Specifically, the fast transition square wave may have a change in signal from the first value of the signal flank to the second value of the signal flank below or equal 50 ns, preferably below or equal 20 ns. The change in signal from the first value of the signal flank to the second value of the signal flank may be even faster and may be only limited by electronics such as by an analog-to-digital-converter. The faster the flank and the sharper the transition to the plateau, the more resolution may be between the ohmic part of the system resistance and the capacitive part of the system capacitance. Without wishing to being bound by theory, the fast-transient voltage signal is so short, in particular ultrashort, that no faradaic currents are generated and that an electrochemical system of the analyte sensor <b>112</b> is not disturbed and brought out of equilibrium. The ultrashort voltage signal of the fast-transient voltage signal for determining the membrane property may allow that a measurement signal for determining the analyte concentration can be undisturbed determined.

Correspondingly, the data acquisition rate of the voltmeter V may be sufficiently high, in order to record the V<sub>meas,pulse </sub>possibly immediately after applying V<sub>gen,pulse</sub>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0179">The membrane resistance R<sub>mem </sub>may be calculated according to</p><p id="p-0163" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00005" num="00005"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>R</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>e</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>m</mi>   </mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>R</mi>    <mi>ref</mi>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>V</mi>       <mrow>        <mi>meas</mi>        <mo>,</mo>        <mtext>  </mtext>        <mi>pulse</mi>       </mrow>      </msub>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>V</mi>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>m</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>e</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>as</mi>        </mrow>        <mo>,</mo>        <mtext>  </mtext>        <mi>base</mi>       </mrow>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>V</mi>         <mrow>          <mi>gen</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mtext>  </mtext>          <mi>pulse</mi>         </mrow>        </msub>        <mo>-</mo>        <msub>         <mi>V</mi>         <mrow>          <mi>gen</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mtext>  </mtext>          <mi>base</mi>         </mrow>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mrow>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>V</mi>         <mrow>          <mi>meas</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mi>pulse</mi>         </mrow>        </msub>        <mo>-</mo>        <msub>         <mi>V</mi>         <mrow>          <mrow>           <mi>m</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>e</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>a</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>s</mi>          </mrow>          <mo>,</mo>          <mrow>           <mi>b</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>a</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>s</mi>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <mi>e</mi>          </mrow>         </mrow>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>.</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0164" num="0180">While exemplary embodiments have been disclosed hereinabove, the present invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.
