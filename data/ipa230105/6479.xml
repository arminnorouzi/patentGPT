Each of the plurality of power feed units includes one power transmission coil. In contrast, the inventors of the present application propose a power feed mat including a plurality of power transmission coils. The plurality of power transmission coils included in one power feed mat are configured to individually feed power to different movable bodies. The movable body can select one power transmission coil from among the plurality of power transmission coils included in the power feed mat and receive power feed from the selected power transmission coil.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A plurality of power transmission coils may simultaneously feed power to a plurality of movable bodies on a power feed mat. A power capacity of the power feed mat, however, is limited. Therefore, when all power transmission coils included in the power feed mat simultaneously feed power, total power fed by the power feed mat (that is, a total value of electric power consumed in power feed in the power feed mat) may exceed the power capacity of the power feed mat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure was made to solve the problem, and an object thereof is to appropriately restrict use of power transmission coils in a power feed mat including a plurality of power transmission coils that feed power to a movable body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A power feed system according to a first point of view of the present disclosure includes a power feed mat and a computer (which will also be referred to as a &#x201c;power feed computer&#x201d; below). The power feed mat includes a plurality of power transmission coils. The power feed mat is configured to feed power to at least one movable body on the power feed mat by using at least one of the plurality of power transmission coils. The power feed computer is configured to determine whether or not to permit power feed to a movable body that requests power feed. In this power feed system, when the power feed computer determines not to permit power feed, the power feed mat does not feed power to the movable body that requests power feed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the power feed system, the power feed computer determines whether or not to permit power feed to a movable body that requests power feed. Then, in the power feed system, when the power feed computer determines not to permit power feed, power is not fed to the movable body that requests power feed. Therefore, in the power feed system, the power feed computer can appropriately restrict use of the power transmission coils included in the power feed mat.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The power feed computer may be a stationary server or may be mounted on a mobile terminal. Examples of the movable body include an uninhabited movable body (an automated guided vehicle (AGV), a drone, and the like) and a vehicle (a car, a boat, and the like).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The power feed computer may determine whether or not the movable body that requests power feed falls under a subject movable body adapted to the power feed mat. When the movable body that requests power feed does not fall under the subject movable body, the power feed computer may determine not to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed. When the movable body that requests power feed falls under the subject movable body and the power feed mat is not feeding power, the power feed computer may determine to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed. When the movable body that requests power feed falls under the subject movable body and the power feed mat is feeding power to another movable body, the power feed computer may determine whether or not total feed power in the power feed mat exceeds a power capacity of the power feed mat if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body. When the total feed power does not exceed the power capacity even if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body, the power feed computer may determine to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed. When the total feed power exceeds the power capacity if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body, the power feed computer may determine whether or not to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed based on a priority of each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the configuration, when a movable body not adapted to the power feed mat requests power feed, power is not fed to the movable body that requests power feed. The subject movable body (the movable body adapted to the power feed mat) may be a movable body registered in the power feed computer. The power feed computer may determine whether or not the movable body that requests power feed falls under the subject movable body based on charging power (kW) requested by the movable body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the configuration, total feed power in the power feed mat (that is, a total value of electric power consumed in power feed in the power feed mat) exceeding the power capacity thereof (that is, an upper limit value of total feed power at or below which the power feed mat can normally feed power) is suppressed. In the power feed system, when total feed power in the power feed mat exceeds the power capacity thereof if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body, the power feed computer determines whether or not to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed based on the priority of each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body. In other words, when the movable body that requests power feed is higher in priority than another movable body, power feed to the movable body that requests power feed is permitted. According to the configuration, the movable body preferentially fed with power can be determined based on the priority of each movable body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The power feed computer may be configured to determine the priority of each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body based on at least one of a remaining amount of stored power, a target amount of stored power, presence of a task, a type of the task, time to start the task, and a profit from the task. The power feed computer may determine whether or not a movable body for delivery has a task based on whether or not it is carrying a load.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The power feed computer may be configured to determine the priority such that a movable body smaller in remaining amount of stored power is higher in priority. According to such a configuration, restriction of power feed to the movable body small in remaining amount of stored power is less likely. Thus, the movable body running out of power is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The remaining amount of stored power of the movable body can be expressed, for example, with a state of charge (SOC) of a power storage included in the movable body. The SOC is, for example, representation of a ratio within a range from 0 to 100%, of a current amount of stored power to an amount of stored power in a fully charged state.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The power feed computer may be configured to determine, when each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body is a movable body for delivery, the priority such that a movable body carrying a load is higher in priority than a movable body not carrying a load. According to such a configuration, restriction of power feed to a movable body carrying a load is less likely.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The power feed computer may be configured such that, when each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body has a task, the power feed computer evaluates the task for each movable body and determines the priority based on a result of evaluating the task. According to such a configuration, prioritized power feed to a movable body with a task that is evaluated as high in priority is facilitated. For example, by raising the priority of an emergency vehicle, prioritized power feed to the emergency vehicle is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The power feed computer may be configured to communicate with each of the plurality of movable bodies. Each of the plurality of movable bodies may include a power storage, a power reception coil that receives electric power from a power transmission coil included in the power feed mat, a charging circuit that charges the power storage with electric power received by the power reception coil, and a first controller that controls the charging circuit. The power feed computer may be configured to transmit a first permission signal to the movable body that requests power feed when the power feed computer determines to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed. The first controller may be configured to carry out control for starting charging of the power storage when alignment between the power reception coil of the movable body that requests power feed and any power transmission coil included in the power feed mat is completed and the movable body receives the first permission signal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the configuration, the power feed computer can restrict power feed to the movable body by not transmitting the first permission signal to the movable body (first controller).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the plurality of movable bodies may be an autonomous vehicle configured to travel with electric power stored in the power storage, without human intervention. Each of the plurality of movable bodies may be configured such that, when a corresponding movable body of the plurality of movable bodies arrives at the power feed mat, the corresponding movable body selects one power transmission coil from among the plurality of power transmission coils and aligns the selected power transmission coil and the power reception coil with each other.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the configuration, the autonomous vehicle can move to the power feed mat and receive power feed from the power transmission coil included in the power feed mat.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Any power feed system described above may further include a power supply circuit and a power control circuit. The power supply circuit may be configured to supply electric power to each of the plurality of power transmission coils. The power control circuit may be configured to receive supply of electric power from the power supply circuit and to switch between connection and disconnection between each of the plurality of power transmission coils and the power supply circuit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the power feed system, the power supply circuit can supply electric power to each of the plurality of power transmission coils included in the power feed mat. The power control circuit can switch between supply and non-supply of electric power from the power supply circuit to each power transmission coil.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The power control circuit and the power feed computer may be provided in the power feed mat. The power control circuit may be configured to selectively supply electric power to a power transmission coil designated by the power feed computer among the plurality of power transmission coils.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the configuration, as the power feed computer sends a control signal (specifically, a signal designating a power transmission coil that feeds electric power) to the power control circuit in the power feed mat, a movable body power feed to which is permitted (and a power transmission coil corresponding to that movable body) and a movable body power feed to which is not permitted (and a power transmission coil corresponding to that movable body) can be determined or changed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The power feed mat may include a second controller that controls the power control circuit. The power feed computer may be configured to communicate with the second controller. The power feed computer may be configured to transmit a second permission signal to the power feed mat when the power feed computer determines to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed. The second controller may be configured to carry out, when alignment between the movable body that requests power feed and any power transmission coil included in the power feed mat is completed and the power feed mat receives the second permission signal, control for starting power feed by a power transmission coil the alignment of which is completed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the configuration, the power feed computer can prevent power feed to the movable body by not transmitting the second permission signal to the power feed mat (second controller).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The power feed mat may be flexible to such an extent that the power feed mat can be rolled into a cylinder. Since such a power feed mat can be rolled into a cylinder, it can easily be carried.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The power feed mat may be formed by combination of a plurality of plate members. The power feed mat may be constructed as being disassemblable into the plurality of plate members. Each of the plurality of plate members may include at least one power transmission coil.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since the power feed mat is constructed as being disassemblable into a plurality of plate members, it can easily be carried.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The power feed mat may be constructed to be placed on a floor indoors. Such a power feed mat is suitable for charging of a small movable body (for example, an AGV or a robot) used indoors.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A power feed method according to a second point of view of the present disclosure includes first to third determination steps shown below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the first determination step, whether or not a movable body that requests a power feed mat to feed power falls under a subject movable body adapted to the power feed mat, the power feed mat being configured to wirelessly feed power, is determined. In the second determination step, when the movable body that requests power feed falls under the subject movable body and the power feed mat is feeding power to another movable body, whether or not total feed power in the power feed mat exceeds a power capacity of the power feed mat if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body is determined. In the third determination step, when the total feed power exceeds the power capacity if power is fed simultaneously to all of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body, whether or not to permit power feed to the movable body that requests power feed is determined based on a priority of each of the movable body that requests power feed and another movable body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the power feed method as well, similarly to the previously described power feed system, use of the power transmission coils in the power feed mat can appropriately be restricted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed

In this modification, when a task is set for the movable body, the charging start condition (that is, the condition under which the processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is performed) described previously is satisfied. Therefore, in the modification of the first embodiment, the new movable body found in the processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and the movable body being charged each have a task. Each movable body (the new movable body and the movable body being charged) on the subject mat has, for example, a task shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, movable bodies #1 to #4 correspond to movable bodies on the subject mat.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in this modification, a priority index is calculated in accordance with an expression &#x201c;priority index=coefficient a&#xd7;Pa+coefficient b&#xd7;(1/Pb)+coefficient c&#xd7;Pc+coefficient d&#xd7;Pd.&#x201d; Any coefficients a to d can be set. In this modification, coefficient a, coefficient b, coefficient c, and coefficient d are set to 1, 100, 10, and 0.1, respectively.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Pa represents an amount of power feed requested for the task. Pa is calculated by subtracting the current remaining amount of stored power from a target amount of stored power for the task. Server <b>500</b> can obtain Pa by subtracting a current SOC from a target SOC in charging control. For example, in movable body #1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the current SOC is 60(%) and the target SOC is 70(%). Therefore, &#x201c;coefficient a&#xd7;Pa&#x201d; for movable body #1 is calculated as 10 (=1&#xd7;(70&#x2212;60)).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Pb represents allowance time from the current time until start of the task. As time to start the task that is requested is earlier, Pb is smaller. For example, in movable body #1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the time to start the task that is requested comes within twenty minutes and hence Pb is set to 20 (minutes). Therefore, &#x201c;coefficient b (1/Pb)&#x201d; for movable body #1 is calculated as 5 (=100&#xd7;( 1/20)).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Pc represents a point determined based on a type of the task. Pc is determined in advance for each type of the task. In this modification, the task is categorized into a standard mail, an express mail, a cool service, and an urgent task. The cool service refers to a service for transporting a load in a chilled or frozen condition. The express mail refers to a service for delivering a load earlier than the standard mail. In electronic commerce, a service of the express mail may be provided to a specific limited contractor. The urgent task refers to a task of great urgency. For example, a task for medical care or disaster control falls under the urgent task. In this modification, points for the standard mail, the express mail, and the cool service are determined as one, five, and ten, respectively. In addition, the point for the urgent task is set to a highest value (infinity) such that the highest priority is given to the urgent task. For example, for movable body #1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the type of the task is the standard mail. Therefore, &#x201c;coefficient c&#xd7;Pc&#x201d; for movable body #1&#x2033; is calculated as 10 (=10&#xd7;1).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Pd represents a profit obtained from the task. The profit obtained from the task may be a profit determined based on the type of the task (for example, a profit determined in a contract). In this modification, the profit obtained from the task is calculated in consideration also of a time period required for the task. Server <b>500</b> converts a predicted profit obtained by completing the task into a unit price per one hour. The unit price per unit time of the thus obtained predicted profit is adopted as the profit obtained from the task. For example, for movable body #1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the profit obtained from the task (the unit price per unit time of the predicted profit) is 500 (yen). Therefore, &#x201c;coefficient d&#xd7;Pd&#x201d; for movable body #1 is calculated as 50 (=0.1&#xd7;500).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In this modification, in S<b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, server <b>500</b> evaluates the task for each movable body, and determines the priority of each movable body on power feed mat <b>100</b> based on a result of evaluation. Specifically, server <b>500</b> obtains from each movable body on the subject mat, the current SOC (the remaining amount of stored power) of the power storage and information on the task (the type, start time, the target amount of stored power, and the predicted profit), and calculates the priority index of each movable body on the subject mat in accordance with the expression described previously. For example, the priority index of movable body #1 is calculated as 75 (=10+5+10+50). In addition, the priority indices of movable bodies #2, #3, and #4 are calculated as 340, 181, and the highest value (infinity), respectively. The priority index corresponds to the result of evaluation of the task. Server <b>500</b> determines the priority of each movable body on power feed mat <b>100</b> such that a movable body larger in priority index is higher in priority. The priority of movable bodies #1 to #4 is higher in the order of #4, #2, #3, and #1.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">When a plurality of movable bodies are equal in calculated priority index, the priority cannot be determined based on the priority index. Therefore, the priority of those movable bodies may be determined from another point of view. For example, the priority of each movable body may be determined such that a movable body smaller in remaining amount of stored power is higher in priority.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the power feed system according to the modification, it is expected that only the movable bodies with the task are present on the subject mat at the time of start of the processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Without being limited as such, the charging start condition may be modified such that the movable body with the task and the movable body without the task are both present on the subject mat. For example, when the remaining amount of stored power of a movable body becomes equal to or smaller than a prescribed value regardless of presence of the task, the charging start condition may be satisfied for that movable body. In such a form, in S<b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the priority of each movable body on the subject mat may be determined such that the movable body with the task is higher in priority than the movable body without the task.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In each embodiment above, the power feed mat is flexible to such an extent that it can be rolled into a cylinder (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).
