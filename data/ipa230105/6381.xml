According to this configuration, when the protecting member is at the protection position, the contact point portion of the connecting member is protected by the protecting member and the interference of external matters with the contact point portion can be avoided. Thus, when the protecting member is at the connection position, a state where the contact point portion of the connecting member is in contact with the circuit board can be satisfactorily realized. Particularly, since the protecting member is held at the protection position by the lock portion, the protecting member can be prevented from inadvertently moving from the protection position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(2) Preferably, a mating housing is provided which is connectable to the housing, and the mating housing includes a lock releasing portion for releasing a holding state by the lock portion. According to this configuration, the holding state by the lock portion can be released as the housing is connected to the mating housing, and a special step of releasing the holding state can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(3) The housing may include a first housing for holding the connecting member and a second housing for holding the protecting member, and the lock portion may be provided on the first housing and the second housing may be provided with a locked portion to be locked by the lock portion. According to this configuration, the protecting member needs not be provided with the locked portion and the complication of the structure of the protecting member can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(4) A releasing member may be provided which is displaceable to a partial locking position and a full locking position with respect to the first housing, the releasing member may include a displacement restricting portion for restricting a displacement to the full locking position at the partial locking position and a following movement releasing portion for releasing a locked state of the lock portion and the locked portion at the full locking position, and the lock releasing portion may release a displacement restricted state by the displacement restricting portion. According to this configuration, when the housing and the mating housing are connected, the displacement restricted state by the displacement restricting portion is released by the lock releasing portion and the releasing member becomes displaceable from the partial locking position to the full locking position. When the releasing member reaches the full locking position, the following movement releasing portion releases the locked state of the lock portion and the locked portion and the protecting member becomes displaceable from the protection position to the connection position. Since the lock releasing portion does not directly release the locked state of the lock portion and the locked portion, the complication of the structure of the mating housing can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">[Details of Embodiment of Present Disclosure]</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A specific example of a connector of the present disclosure is described below with reference to the drawings.

Then, the locked body <b>19</b> is separated from the front surface of each lock portion <b>35</b> and the second housing <b>12</b> becomes displaceable to the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As just described, by a displacement of the rear holder <b>70</b> to the full locking position, the second housing <b>12</b> can also be displaced toward the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b>. If the second housing <b>12</b> is displaced toward the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b>, the front end part of the auxiliary lock piece <b>38</b> rides on the rear surface of each auxiliary restricting portion <b>22</b> and the auxiliary lock piece <b>38</b> is deflected and deformed.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the second housing <b>12</b> reaches the fitting position, the locked portion <b>18</b> is resiliently restored and the locked body <b>19</b> is arranged to face the rear surface of the pressing portion <b>76</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The auxiliary lock piece <b>38</b> is also resiliently restored and the front end part of the auxiliary lock piece <b>38</b> is arranged to face the front surface of each auxiliary restricting portion <b>22</b>. In this way, the second housing <b>12</b> is held at the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b> via the rear holder <b>70</b>. Further, the lock arm <b>39</b> resiliently locks the mating housing lock portions <b>93</b> and the housing <b>10</b> and the mating housing <b>90</b> are held in the fit state. The second housing body <b>13</b> is deeply inserted in the second housing insertion portion <b>26</b> and arranged to abut on the front surface of the retainer <b>32</b> at the fitting position.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As the second housing <b>12</b> is displaced toward the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b>, the protecting member <b>42</b> is also displaced toward the connection position with respect to the connecting member <b>41</b>. When viewed from the side of the connecting member <b>41</b>, the connecting member <b>41</b> relatively moves forward with respect to the protecting member <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the process of relatively displacing the connecting member <b>41</b> and the protecting member <b>42</b>, the resilient contact portion <b>43</b> is deflected and deformed, the contact point portion <b>53</b> slides on the slope portion <b>58</b> and the lower end of the contact point portion <b>53</b> temporarily rides on the upper stage portion <b>59</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the second housing <b>12</b> reaches the fitting position with respect to the first housing <b>11</b>, the protecting member <b>42</b> also reaches the connection position with respect to the connecting member <b>41</b>. At the connection position, the contact point portion <b>53</b> falls down from the upper stage portion <b>59</b> and contacts the conductive portion <b>101</b> of the circuit board <b>100</b> through the connection hole <b>61</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The resilient contact portion <b>43</b> is maintained in a deflected and deformed state.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, according to this embodiment, when the protecting member <b>42</b> is at the protection position, the contact point portion <b>53</b> of the connecting member <b>41</b> is protected by the protecting member <b>42</b> and the interference of external matters with the contact point portion <b>53</b> can be avoided. Thus, when the protecting member <b>42</b> is at the connection position, a state where the contact point portion <b>53</b> is in contact with the circuit board <b>100</b> can be satisfactorily realized. Particularly, since the protecting member <b>42</b> is held at the protection position by each lock portion <b>35</b>, the protecting member <b>42</b> can be prevented from being inadvertently displaced from the protection position.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, according to the connecting operation of the housing <b>10</b> and the mating housing <b>90</b>, the lock releasing portion <b>94</b> of the mating housing <b>90</b> releases the holding state (state where relative displacements of the first and second housings <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are restricted and the protecting member <b>42</b> is held at the protection position with respect to the connecting member <b>41</b>) by each lock portion <b>35</b>. Thus, a special step of releasing the holding state by each lock portion <b>35</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, in the case of this embodiment, each lock portion <b>35</b> is provided on the first housing <b>11</b>, the locked portion <b>18</b> to be locked by each lock portion <b>35</b> is provided on the second housing <b>12</b>, and the protecting member <b>42</b> is not provided with the locked portion <b>18</b>. Thus, it can be avoided that the structure of the protecting member <b>42</b> becomes complicated due to the formation of the locked portion <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, in the case of this embodiment, the rear holder <b>70</b> serving as a releasing member includes the displacement restricting portion <b>77</b> for restricting a displacement to the full locking position at the partial locking position and the following movement releasing portion <b>75</b> for releasing the locked state of the lock portions <b>35</b> and the locked portion <b>18</b> at the full locking position, and the lock releasing portion <b>94</b> is configured to release the displacement restricted state by the displacement restricting portion <b>77</b>. Thus, the displacement restricted state by the displacement restricting portion <b>77</b> is released by the lock releasing portion <b>94</b>, whereby the rear holder <b>70</b> becomes displaceable to the full locking position. Further, at the full locking position, the following movement releasing portion <b>75</b> releases the locked state of the lock portions <b>35</b> and the locked portion <b>18</b>, the second housing <b>12</b> becomes displaceable to the fitting position and the protecting member <b>42</b> also becomes displaceable to the connection position. Since the lock releasing portion <b>94</b> does not directly release the locked state of the lock portions <b>35</b> and the locked portion <b>18</b>, the lock releasing portion <b>94</b> can be simply structured and, consequently, the complication of the structure of the mating housing <b>90</b> can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">[Other Embodiments]</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The embodiment disclosed this time should be considered illustrative in all aspects, rather than restrictive.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although the releasing member having a function of retaining the one-piece rubber plug is the rear holder in the case of the above embodiment, a dedicated releasing member may be provided instead of the rear holder as another embodiment.
