The nacelle and the engine are fastened to the structure of the aircraft by a pylon fastened beneath the wing of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to avoid the structure of the aircraft becoming damaged in the event of the engine catching fire, the aircraft is equipped with a fire-fighting system that conventionally has two reservoirs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, the extinguishing fluid contained in the reservoirs is a product called &#x201c;halon&#x201d;. For environmental protection reasons, new products will gradually replace halon, but in order to obtain the same result in terms of extinguishing power, it is necessary to use a greater volume of these new products, and this also leads to reservoirs with larger dimensions and a greater mass.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reservoirs are conventionally mounted in a pylon that holds the nacelle and the inside of such a pylon is a relatively cluttered location. The enlargement of the reservoirs does not make it easier to mount them inside the pylon, and it is therefore necessary to find an arrangement that allows easier mounting of each

Contact between the first shoulder <b>178</b> and the head is then made via the washer <b>190</b>. The inner bearing <b>188</b> makes it possible to limit the compression of the shoulders of the elastomer rings to a predefined value, which is realized during the nominal torque tightening of the bolt. Since elastomers are known to flow under continuous load, this ring thus ensures that the tightening is carried out on a stack of rigid components and therefore the absence of subsequent loosening of the assembly.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0068">In order to limit the transfer of the vibrations, the nesting system <b>158</b> also has damping.
