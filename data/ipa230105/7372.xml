level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0007">Traditionally, personal motor vehicles or taxis comprised one or more equivalent loudspeakers which were apt to generate sound waves over a relatively wide range. Such a sound system cannot achieve a very high quality of sound.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0008">To improve said quality, some more modern sound systems include speakers located at the bottom of the door, which generally can reproduce bass frequencies, below 200 Hz, and also slightly higher frequencies up to 1000 or 2000 Hz. Such sound systems then generally include other speakers for medium-frequency sounds, with frequencies comprised between 200 Hz and a value between 1 kHz and 6 kHz, and/or high frequencies above a value comprised between 1 kHz and 6 kHz which could go up 14 or 20 kHz. Such speakers were for example located in the vehicle dashboard, which comprises the instrument panel in front of the driver, and a transverse extension of the instrument panel located directly in front of a possible passenger. Such sound systems cannot yet achieve very high sound quality.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">Current high-end sound systems comprise a dedicated subwoofer for frequencies from 20 Hz to 60 Hz. The subwoofer is usually located in the trunk or under a front seat of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">However, this under-seat placement is not practical, due to a lack of space. The trunk provides more space, but is not a good source of bass sounds, in particular due to poor transfer to the passenger compartment of frequencies around 60 to 70 Hz.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">More recently, some of the players in the field have developed sound systems comprising one or two bass loudspeakers (woofers), acting as a subwoofer, and integrated into the vehicle bulkhead, i.e., the part of the structure separating the passenger compartment from a front housing wherein the engine is usually located. The membrane of the loudspeakers is for example located in the extension the bulkhead. In this way, a good sound quality can be achieved, but the disadvantage is that the bulkhead has to be designed to accommodate the woofers. In practice, the vehicle manufacturer has to adapt the bulkhead, which must be anticipated well ahead during the design of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Another known solution is to include one or more woofers into openings towards the passenger compartment, for example near one of the rear wheels. The loudspeaker or the loudspeakers emit from these openings. A fault of such solution is that it requires to significantly modify the vehicle and to treat the external noise coming through said openings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">One purpose of the invention is to provide a motor vehicle of the type described above, with a high-end sound system that is easier and/or cheaper to implement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0014">For this purpose, the subject matter of the present invention relates to a motor vehicle defining a central longitudinal axis along which the motor vehicle is intended to move, a front side along the longitudinal axis, and a median plane of the motor vehicle, the median plane including the longitudinal axis and being vertical when the motor vehicle is on a horizontal surface, the motor vehicle comprising:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">a structure comprising a bulkhead,<br/>at least one front seat intended to seat a driver of the motor vehicle,<br/>a floor covering, the bulkhead and the floor covering partially delimiting a passenger compartment of the motor vehicle, and<br/>a sound system including at least one speaker enclosure rigidly attached to the structure, the speaker enclosure comprising:<br/>a box defining at least one first opening, and<br/>at least one first woofer fitted into the opening, the speaker enclosure being located close to the median plane:<br/>either longitudinally between the bulkhead and a front edge of the front seat,<br/>or longitudinally astride a front zone of the passenger compartment intended to receive the driver and a rear zone of the passenger compartment intended to receive one or more rear passenger of the motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">According to particular embodiments, the motor vehicle comprises one or more of the following characteristics, taken individually or according to all technically possible combinations:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0016">The first woofer has a bandwidth including a frequency range from 60 Hz to 150 Hz;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0017">the speaker enclosure has a barycenter located 20 cm or less from the median plane;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0018">the box further defines a second opening, the speaker enclosure further comprising a second woofer structurally similar to the first woofer, the second woofer being mounted in the second opening, back-to-back with the first woofer;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0019">the first woofer and the second woofer comprise two magnetic motors respectively, the speaker enclosure comprising at least one metal rod which mechanically connects the two magnetic motors to each other;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0020">the speaker enclosure defines an interior volume intended to receive sound waves generated by at least the first woofer, the box further including at least one vent apt to channel at least some of the sound waves from the interior volume to the exterior of the speaker enclosure;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0006" num="0021">the box defines at least one or two additional opening(s), the speaker enclosure further comprising at least one or two passive membrane(s) mounted so as to be able to move with regard to the box in the additional opening or openings respectively, the passive membrane or membranes being apt to emit sound waves;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0007" num="0022">the sound system also comprises at least one medium- and high-frequency loudspeaker with a bandwidth ranging from a frequency between 150 Hz and 350 Hz to a frequency of at least 14 kHz, said medium- and high-frequency loudspeaker being located in the passenger compartment;
