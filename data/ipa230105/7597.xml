The figures are not necessarily to scale, and the size of some parts may be exaggerated to more clearly illustrate the example shown. Moreover, the drawings provide examples and/or implementations consistent with the description; however, the description is not limited to the examples and/or implementations provided in the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Wireless communication devices (hereafter referred to as communication devices), such as mobile devices, enable communication services through multiple radio access technologies. Examples of such radio access technologies include, but are not limited to, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GSM, UMTS, Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G NR. To enable communications through different radio access technologies, the communication device may include different types of antennas for receiving as well as for transmitting radio signals. Depending on the type of radio access technology that is to be used for such communication activities, the appropriate antenna may be activated and controlled through a corresponding control circuitry. For example, the communication device may be used for initiating calls over the telecommunication networks, or in some cases may be used for accessing data through Wi-Fi, for which corresponding cellular antennas or Wi-Fi antennas may be operated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advancements in design has resulted in communication devices having thinner form factors. As a result, the antennas of the communication devices may have to be accommodated about the peripheral edges of the communication device, such as near the base portion. In such cases, the antennas may be adjacent to each other. To effect efficient communication, the antennas may operate with a predefined transmit power. Increased transmit power may provide better range for communication, better throughput and data rate, but may increase radio emissions from the communication devices. Thus, in addition to placement of antennas within the communication device, another challenge that may arise relates to adherence to regulatory limits in relation to Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). SAR may be defined as a measure of a rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body on exposure to radio signals. Statutory regulations prescribe limits on the SAR value which is permissible for different types of communication devices. To such an end, the transmit power of the antennas may be limited to conform to SAR limits for the communication device under consideration. In cases where the communication devices include multiple antennas, the transmit power of the multiple antennas may be controlled such that the communication device as a whole conforms to prescribed SAR limits.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain instances, a communication device may operate in different modes. In one such mode, the communication device may engage in communication activities pertaining to different radio access technologies, simultaneously. For example, the communication device may be utilizing Wi-Fi as well as a cellular connection when being used as a mobile hotspot. In such cases, the transmit power of the Wi-Fi antenna and the cellular antenna may be controlled such that the communication is efficient, while at the same time conforming to the prescribed SAR limits.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It may be noted that once multiple antennas are operated simultaneously, the transmit power of each of such antennas may have to be reduced for conformance with the SAR limits in comparison to the transmit power of the antennas when they may not have been operating simultaneously. Reducing transmit power may impact the efficiency and quality of communication activities of the communication device when operating in such a mode. Furthermore, in cases where a certain antenna is operational, the antenna may be operated at a predefined transmit power which may be less than a maximum predefined value for the transmit power which the antenna under consideration may operate at, despite the SAR emissions of the communication device being well below the prescribed SAR limits.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Example approaches for controlling the transmit power of plurality of antennas of a communication device, are described. In an example, the communication device may include a first wireless communication module (referred to as a first module) and a second wireless communication module (referred to as second module). The first module may implement communication using a first radio access technology, while the second module may implement communication using a second radio access technology. In an example, the first module may be implementing communication activities at relatively shorter distances as compared to communication activities implemented through the second module, which may occur over larger distances. For instance, the first module may correspond to Wi-Fi based radio access technology and the second module may correspond to a WWAN based radio access technology. It may be noted that the examples thus provided are only indicative and should not be considered as limiting the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the present example, the first module and the second module may include control circuitry which control and operate corresponding antennas. In operation, the communication device may determine whether the communication device (referred to as the communication device) is operating in one of a host mode or a client mode. When operating in a host mode, both the first module and the second module may be operational simultaneously. For example, the communication device may be considered as operating in host mode when being used as a mobile hotspot (i.e., in cases where Wi-Fi antenna as well as WWAN antenna are active).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Continuing with the present example, on determining the communication device to be operating in the host mode may reduce the transmit power of the first antenna corresponding to the first module, while maintaining the power of the second antenna corresponding to the second module. Since the first module is to implement communication activities over shorter distances while the second module implements communication activities over larger distances, decreasing the transmit power for the first module while maintaining the transmit power of the second module does not impact the quality of the communication.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In case the communication device is operating in the client mode, i.e., only the first module is operational, the processor may increase the transmit power of the first module to enhance quality of communication. In either case, the transmit power of the first module may be controlled in a manner such that the prescribed SAR limits are conformed with. In an example, the transmit power may be controlled based on a lookup power table which provides predefined values of transmit power for the first module and for the second module.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although some of the examples provided in the present description have been described in the context of a first module and a second module, it may be apparent that the communication device may have additional wireless communication modules. For example, such additional wireless communication modules may be a set of auxiliary communication modules which supplement communication related functions of the communication device. In other instances, the first module and the second module may operate to supplement the communication functions of the additional wireless communication modules.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present subject matter is further described with reference to the accompanying figures. Wherever possible, the same reference numerals are used in the figures and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. It should be noted that the description and figures merely illustrate principles of the present subject matter.

While aspects of described communication device may be implemented in any number of different electronic devices, environments, and/or implementations, the examples are described in the context of the following example device(s). It is to be noted that drawings of the present subject matter shown here are for illustrative purposes and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the subject matter claimed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a communication device <b>100</b> (referred to as a communication device <b>100</b>), according to an example. Examples of communication device <b>100</b> includes, but is not limited to, cellular phones, personal computer (PC), notebook PC, workstation or mobile workstation, imaging device, or another type of computing devices, which may be capable of communicating using radio access technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GSM, UMTS, Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 5G NR.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The communication device <b>100</b> may further include a first wireless communication module <b>102</b> (referred to as first module <b>102</b>) and a second wireless communication module <b>104</b> (referred to as second module <b>104</b>). The first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> may include control circuitry and may be further coupled to a first antenna and a second antenna (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), respectively. The first antenna and the second antenna enable communication based on different radio access technologies. In an example, the first antenna may be integrated within circuitry of the communication device <b>100</b> such that it is adjacent to the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Continuing with the present example, the communication device <b>100</b> may further include processor(s) <b>106</b> which may be in communication with the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b>. The processor(s) <b>106</b> may be implemented as microprocessors, microcomputers, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, central processing units, state machines, logic circuitries, and/or any devices that manipulate signals based on operational instructions. Among other capabilities, the processor(s) <b>106</b> is configured to fetch and execute the computer-readable instructions stored in a memory (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), for example, in order to control transmit power of the first antenna and the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, the processor(s) <b>106</b> may perform a series of functions, for example, in response to execution of executable instructions provided within the communication device <b>100</b>. For example, the processor(s) <b>106</b> may initially operate both the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> for performing certain communication activities. The activation of the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> may be in response to the communication device <b>100</b> being operated in a mode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">On determining both the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> to be operating simultaneously, the processor(s) <b>106</b> may cause reduction in transmit power of the first antenna corresponding to the first module <b>102</b>. While the transmit power of the first module <b>102</b> is reduced, the transmit power of the second antenna coupled to the second module <b>104</b> is maintained. In an example, the first module <b>102</b> may be a Wi-Fi based module, whereas the second module <b>104</b> may be a WWAN based module. Both the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> may be operating when the communication device <b>100</b> is being used as a wireless hotspot. In the context of the present example, when operating as a wireless hotspot, the antenna corresponding to the Wi-Fi based module (i.e., the first module <b>102</b>) may be operated at a reduced transmit power while the antenna corresponding to the WWAN based module may be operated at its prescribed transmit power. Since the transmit power of the WWAN is maintained at its prescribed level, the quality of communication activities being performed over the WWAN network is not reduced despite the simultaneous operation of the Wi-Fi module (i.e., the first module <b>102</b>) and the WWAN module (i.e., the second module <b>104</b>), while conforming to the prescribed SAR limits.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a communication device <b>200</b>, in accordance with an example of the present subject matter. The communication device <b>200</b> may include a processor(s) <b>202</b>, the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b>. The first module <b>102</b> may be in communication with the first antenna <b>204</b>, with the second module <b>104</b> being in communication with the second antenna <b>206</b>. In an example, the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> may further include control circuitry for controlling the transmit power of the first antenna <b>204</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b>, respectively, during the operation of the communication device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Continuing further, the communication device <b>200</b> may further include other communication module(s) <b>208</b> and corresponding other antenna(s) <b>210</b>. The first antenna <b>204</b>, the second antenna <b>206</b> along with the other antenna(s) <b>210</b> may be utilized for implementing different communication activities using different radio access technologies. Examples of such radio access technologies include, but are not limited to, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GSM, UMTS, Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 5G NR. Other technologies which may use radio or any wireless interfaces, may also be considered without deviating from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the purposes of explanation, the first module <b>102</b> and the first antenna <b>204</b> may be used for implementing Wi-Fi based communication. The second module <b>104</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b> may be such that they may be used for implementing cellular based radio communication, for example, using Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) based network. In such a case, the first module <b>102</b> and the first antenna <b>204</b> (utilizing Wi-Fi) may implement a variety of communication activities over short distances, for example, over a few meters. On the other hand, the second module <b>104</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b> (utilizing WWAN) may implement a variety of communication activities over longer distances which may extend over a few kilometres. In a similar manner, the communication module(s) <b>208</b> and the other antenna(s) <b>210</b> may implement communication activities using other types of radio access technologies.

The interface(s) <b>212</b> may allow the connection or coupling of the communication device <b>200</b> with other devices, through a wired (e.g., LAN) connection or through a wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;, Wi-Fi). The interface(s) <b>212</b> may also enable intercommunication between different logical as well as hardware components of the communication device <b>200</b>. The memory <b>214</b> may be implemented as a computer-readable medium, examples of which include volatile memory (e.g., RAM), and/or non-volatile memory (e.g., EPROM, flash memory, etc.). The memory <b>214</b> may also be an external memory unit, such as a flash drive, a compact disk drive, an external hard disk drive, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The memory <b>214</b> may further include data which either may be utilized or generated during the operation of the communication device <b>200</b>. In an example, the memory <b>214</b> may include a first power table <b>216</b>, a second power table <b>218</b> and other data <b>220</b>. The first power table <b>216</b> and the second power table <b>218</b> may specify various values of transmit power when the communication device <b>200</b> is to operate in one of the host mode and the client mode. The values of the transmit power specified in the power table <b>216</b> may in turn be such that the communication device <b>200</b> conforms with prescribed SAR limits. As will be explained further, the processor(s) <b>202</b> is to control the transmit power of first antenna <b>204</b>, second antenna <b>206</b>, and the other antenna(s) <b>210</b> based on the power table <b>216</b>, and on determining whether the communication device <b>200</b> is operating in one of a host mode and a client mode. The other data <b>220</b> on the other hand may include such data which may be utilized or generated by the communication device <b>200</b> while performing a variety communication activities.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The communication device <b>200</b> may implement a variety of communication activities during its operation. For example, the communication device <b>200</b> may initiate calls over a cellular network. To such an end, the second module <b>104</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b> may be used. In certain other instances, the communication device <b>200</b> may be used for accessing data over a Wi-Fi based network, in which case the first module <b>102</b> and the first antenna <b>204</b> may be used. The communication device <b>200</b> may also be used as a mobile or portable hotspot during which both the first antenna <b>204</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b> may operate simultaneously.

As discussed in the previous example, when operating in the host mode, the communication device <b>200</b> performs diverse communication activities, for example, when being used as a hotspot. In the event that the communication device <b>200</b> is to operate in the host mode, the first module <b>102</b> (which utilizes Wi-Fi) and the second module <b>104</b> (which utilizes WWAN or cellular network) may be operated simultaneously. As discussed, while operating in the host mode, the communication device <b>200</b>, the communication device <b>200</b> may establish a radio communication link over a short distance using the first module <b>102</b>, simultaneously while establishing another radio communication link over a large distance using the second module <b>104</b>. In such a case, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may control the transmit power of the first module <b>102</b> and the corresponding first antenna <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may operate the first antenna <b>204</b> at a reduced transmit power. The value of the reduced transmit power at which the first antenna <b>204</b> is to be operated, may be obtained based on a reduced value obtained from the first power table <b>216</b>. In such a case, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may generate control instructions for the control circuitry within the first module <b>102</b> based on the reduced value. Based on the control instructions from the processor(s) <b>202</b>, the first module <b>102</b> may reduce the transmit power of the first antenna <b>204</b>. In an example, the reduced transmit power value may be such that it is less than prescribed transmit power of the first module <b>102</b> when it is to operate in a normal mode.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the transmit power of the first antenna <b>204</b> is reduced, the processor(s) <b>202</b> is to maintain the transmit power of the second antenna <b>206</b> at its prescribed level. With the communication device <b>200</b> is operating in the host mode (i.e., while being used as a mobile hotspot) since the first module <b>102</b>, which utilizes Wi-Fi, is to establish communication over shorter distances, operating the first antenna <b>204</b> at a reduced transmit power level may not impact the quality of the communication. At the same time, the transmit power of the second antenna <b>206</b> may be maintained, thereby ensuring the quality of communication, throughput and data rates with WWAN or the cellular network. In an example, the transmit power of the first antenna <b>204</b> may be reduced such that the communication device <b>200</b> as a whole conforms with the prescribed SAR limits. This differs from approaches which involved reducing the transmit power of all antennas within a communication device to adhere to the prescribed SAR limits, which may have had an adverse impact while a communication device performs diverse communication activities.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another example, the communication device <b>200</b> may alternately operate in a client mode. When operating in the client mode, the communication modules and the antennas may not operate simultaneously. In such a case, the client mode of the communication device <b>200</b> when activated may involve the first module <b>102</b> to be operational for performing a certain communication activity. For example, the communication device <b>200</b> may access Internet over a Wi-Fi connection. To this end, the communication device <b>200</b> may activate the first module <b>102</b> (which utilizes Wi-Fi). The processor(s) <b>202</b> on determining the communication device <b>200</b> to be operating in the client mode, may operate the first antenna <b>204</b> at a predefined transmit power. In an example, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may obtain a maximum permissible value of transmit power from the second power table <b>218</b> for the first antenna <b>204</b>. Once obtained, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may generate control instructions for the first module <b>102</b>. The first module <b>102</b>, based on the control instructions, may control the first antenna <b>204</b> to operate at the maximum value of the transmit power. In another example, any other value of the transmit power may also be obtained from the power table <b>216</b> for operating the first antenna <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although the above examples have been described in the context of the first module <b>102</b>, the first antenna <b>204</b>, the second module <b>104</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b>, the same are not to be considered as limiting the scope of the present subject matter. The above-mentioned approaches may be implemented in communication devices, such as the communication device <b>200</b>, in which additional communication modules, such as communication module(s) <b>208</b> and the corresponding other antenna(s) <b>210</b> may operate with the first module <b>102</b>, the second module <b>104</b>, first antenna <b>204</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b>, for performing communication activities. Examples of such devices may include, but are not limited to, 5G and LTE Advanced based communication devices. Multiple antennas, such as the first antenna <b>204</b>, second antenna <b>206</b> and the other antenna(s) <b>210</b> may provide high data rate and enhanced throughout while performing communication activities.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Continuing with the present example, such other communication module(s) <b>208</b> may be enabling communication services through radio access technologies which are similar to the radio access technology to which one of the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> pertain to. For example, a module from amongst the communication module(s) <b>208</b> may also enable communication services using Wi-Fi, whereas another module from amongst the communication module(s) <b>208</b> may enable communication services through a WWAN or cellular based network. In such cases, certain antennas may be positioned in close proximity with each other when implemented within the communication device <b>200</b>. For example, first antenna <b>204</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b> may be located adjacent to each other. The communication device <b>200</b> when operated may cause either interference during signal receiving and transmission, or in some other cases may tend to increase the SAR emissions. In such a case, multiple communication modules and their corresponding antennas may be operated either simultaneously or in various combinations to perform communication activities, while ensuring that the device, such as the communication device <b>200</b>, conforms to the prescribed SAR limits.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, the first module <b>102</b> and the second module <b>104</b> may be utilized for supplementing the communication module(s) <b>208</b>. In such a case, the transmit power of the first antenna <b>204</b> and the second antenna <b>206</b>, depending on the mode, may be controlled as per the approaches of the present subject matter, while the transmit power of the other antenna(s) <b>210</b> may be controlled either based on the present approaches or based on any other factors, such as proximity of the communication device with a user's body, signal strength, etc. For example, the processor(s) <b>202</b> may cause reduction in the transmit power of antennas (such as the first antenna <b>204</b> and the like) which pertain to a certain radio access technology while maintaining the transmit power of other antennas (such as the second antenna <b>206</b> and the like) which pertain to different radio access technologies.
