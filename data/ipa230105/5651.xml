Isolation might be required for safety, noise immunity or large potential differences between system domains. For example, a cellphone charger is internally isolated to prevent humans from becoming electrically tied to the mains if the connector short-circuits. In other applications like factory robots, sensitive control circuitry sits on a separate ground and is isolated from the motors that draw large DC currents that create noise and ground bounces. Similarly, in electric drive automotive applications, sensitive control circuitry sits on a separate ground and is isolated from the drive motor(s) that draw large DC currents that create noise and ground bounces</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In described examples, an apparatus has a laminate substrate that has a first surface and an opposite second surface.

To prevent current flow, no direct conduction path is permitted. Energy or information can still be exchanged between the sections by other means, such as capacitance, induction, or electromagnetic waves, or by optical, acoustic, or mechanical means.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Galvanic isolation may be used where two or more electric circuits must communicate, but their grounds may be at different potentials. It is an effective method of breaking ground loops by preventing unwanted current from flowing between two units sharing a ground conductor. Galvanic isolation is also used for safety, preventing accidental current from reaching ground through a person's body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The general operation of laminate transformer galvanic isolation devices is known; see, for example, &#x201c;UCC12050 High-Efficiency, Low-EMI, 5-kVRMS Reinforced Isolation DC-DC Converter,&#x201d; SNVSB38C, September 2019, revised April 2020, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an example, an integrated laminate transformer galvanic isolator allows information to be transmitted between nodes of a system at different voltage levels using a high voltage (HV) inductive barrier along with inverter and rectifier circuitry on opposite sides of that barrier. The HV inductive device is implemented as two coils that are each formed on one or more laminate layers of the isolation device. As will be described in more detail hereinbelow, a portion of a lead frame of the isolation device package overlaps a portion of the coils to provide a low thermal impedance for heat dissipation from the isolation device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a bottom view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a typical isolation device <b>100</b> that includes a laminate transformer <b>102</b>. In this example, laminate transformer <b>102</b> includes a multilayer laminate substrate <b>113</b> that has a top surface and an opposite bottom surface. Secondary coil <b>111</b> and primary coil <b>112</b> are each located on one or more layers of multilayer substrate <b>113</b>.

Isolation device <b>100</b> is encapsulated in a mold compound <b>104</b> using a known integrated packaging technique. In this example, isolation device <b>100</b> is mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>206</b> on which additional components and/or integrated circuits are mounted (not shown). PCB <b>206</b> includes metallic pads <b>207</b> onto which the leads of lead frame <b>121</b>/<b>122</b> are soldered using known soldering techniques. Various metallic signal lines and power planes within PCB <b>206</b> act as heat sinks for isolation device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Heat is generated within coils <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> due to resistive heating caused by the ohmic resistance (R) of the coils and the amount current (I) being conducted by the coils. This is often referred to as &#x201c;I<sup>2</sup>R heating&#x201d;. Heat generated within the coils must be dissipated to keep the isolation device from overheating. Some heat is dissipated by infrared radiation away from device <b>100</b>. Some heat may be dissipated by convection of the surrounding air around isolation device <b>100</b>. However, most of the heat is dissipated by conduction from coils <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> of transformer <b>102</b> through substrate <b>113</b> and then through lead frames <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> to PCB <b>206</b>, as illustrated by thermal conduction paths <b>242</b>, <b>243</b>.

A portion <b>325</b> of the lead frame <b>324</b> overlaps a portion of a coil <b>111</b> of the laminate transformer <b>302</b>. In this example, laminate transformer <b>302</b> includes a multilayer laminate substrate <b>113</b> that has a top surface <b>1131</b> and an opposite bottom surface <b>1132</b>. Secondary coil <b>111</b> and primary coil <b>112</b> are each located on one or more laminate layers of multilayer laminate substrate <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this example, the laminates are copper clad laminates and pre-pregs. Each pre-preg isolation layer has a thickness in the range of 30-70 um. This allows the copper that forms coils to be much thicker than the metal used in prior digital isolation devices that are formed on a silicon substrate. This allows larger current flows to be handled for power and signal applications. Transformer performance (quality factor, efficiency) may thereby be controlled by using copper thickness of 12 um-30 um and multiple metal layers to allow parallel inductor coils and lower coil resistance. In various examples, two to eight, or more metal layers may be used to form secondary coil <b>111</b> and primary coil <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this example, secondary coil <b>111</b> is fabricated using three parallel conductive layers within multilayer laminate substrate <b>113</b>. Primary coil <b>112</b> is fabricated using two parallel conductive layers within multilayer laminate substrate <b>113</b>. Each conductive layer is patterned and etched to form conductive signal lines that are arranged in a spiral. Vias are fabricated to connect the separate layers to form a completed coil. The secondary coil <b>111</b> is adjacent the upper surface of substrate <b>113</b>, while the primary coil is adjacent the lower surface of substrate <b>113</b>. In this example, there is a thin laminate layer between secondary coil <b>111</b> and the upper surface of substrate <b>113</b> to electrically insulate secondary coil <b>111</b> from magnetic core element <b>314</b> and right lead frame portion <b>324</b>. Similarly, there is a thin laminate layer between primary coil <b>112</b> and the lower surface of substrate <b>113</b> to electrically insulate primary coil <b>112</b> from magnetic core element <b>115</b>. Thus, as used herein, the term &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; means the coils located near the surface are spaced apart from the surface by one or more laminate, pre-preg, or solder mask layers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this example, the coils are fabricated as octagon spirals, but in other examples they may be fabricated in other shapes, such as circular, hexagonal, etc. Fabrication of various examples of a multilayer laminate substrate is described in more detail in U.S. Patent Publication 2020-0211754, &#x201c;Galvanic Isolation of Integrated Closed Magnetic Path Transformer with BT Laminate,&#x201d; filed Dec. 30, 2018 which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Upper core element <b>314</b> is attached to the upper surface of substrate <b>113</b> and lower core element <b>115</b> attached to the lower surface of substrate <b>113</b>. Core elements <b>314</b> and <b>115</b> are fabricated from a magnetic material to increase the inductance density and magnetic coupling between secondary coil <b>111</b> and primary coil <b>112</b>. Upper core element <b>314</b> overlaps only a fractional portion of secondary coil <b>111</b>, while lower core element overlaps the entire extent of primary coil <b>112</b>. In this example, core elements <b>314</b>, <b>115</b> and substrate <b>113</b> are illustrated in a semi-transparent manner to illustrate the spatial relationship between these elements. In this example, the terms &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; merely refer to the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> and are not intended to connote any further limitation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A lead frame is attached to transformer <b>302</b> using an adhesive material. In this example, left lead frame <b>121</b> has a portion <b>123</b> that overlaps substrate <b>113</b>. Similarly, right lead frame <b>322</b> has a portion <b>324</b> that overlaps substrate <b>113</b>. In this example, rectifier circuitry <b>131</b> is fabricated as a separate integrated circuit (IC) die and is attached using an adhesive to a die attach pad on right lead frame <b>322</b>. Inverter circuitry <b>132</b> is fabricated as a separate IC die and is attached using an adhesive to a die attach pad on left lead frame <b>121</b>. In this example, each end of primary coil <b>112</b> and secondary coil <b>111</b> is coupled to bonding pads (not shown) via conductive silicon traces. Wire bonding is used to couple rectifier circuitry <b>131</b> to secondary coil <b>111</b> bond pads and to other leads of right lead frame <b>322</b>. Similarly, wire bonding is used to couple inverter circuitry <b>132</b> to primary coil <b>112</b> bond pads and to other leads of left lead frame <b>121</b></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Left lead frame <b>121</b> spaced apart from secondary coil <b>111</b> by an amount indicated at <b>354</b> to provide sufficient voltage isolation between left lead frame <b>121</b> and secondary coil <b>111</b>. For example, if device <b>300</b> is rated to have a 5 kVRMS isolation capacity, then isolation space needs to be sufficient to prevent a voltage breakdown through laminate substrate <b>113</b> and the mold material that fills the space between left lead frame portion <b>123</b> and magnetic core element <b>314</b> when a 5 kVRMS potential difference exists. Since a high voltage will not be produced across right lead frame <b>322</b> and secondary coil <b>111</b>, there does not need to be a high-voltage galvanic isolation distance between right lead frame <b>322</b> and secondary coil <b>111</b>. However, in this example secondary coil <b>111</b> is insulated from lead frame <b>322</b>. Substrate <b>113</b> has sufficient dielectric strength to provide high voltage isolation between right lead frame <b>322</b> and primary coil <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this example, magnetic core elements <b>314</b> and <b>115</b> are made from a ferrite material. The ferrite material includes fine particles of ferromagnetic material that has a high permeability. The ferromagnetic particles are held together with a binding resin. In this example, the magnet core elements are cut from a sheet of ferrite material and attached to the respective top and bottom surface of substrate <b>113</b> using die attach adhesive by a pick and place machine during fabrication of device <b>300</b>. Spacing <b>351</b> and <b>353</b> are selected to be sufficiently large to accommodate manufacturing tolerance of the pick and place and molding operation. In this example, spacing <b>351</b>, <b>353</b> is approximately 0.5 mm. In another example, smaller or larger spacing may be needed depending on the fabrication process requirements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter-kelvin (W/(m&#xb7;K)). Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials of high thermal conductivity. For instance, metals typically have high thermal conductivity and are very efficient at conducting heat, while the opposite is true for insulating materials like laminate dielectric.
