These conditions have produced excessive stress and an unproductive, disengaged workforce. For example, 83% of American workers report being over stressed by their jobs while only 13% reports feeling engaged. Various factors have led to these conditions including a leadership gap as the &#x201c;baby boom&#x201d; generation retires while five distinct generations remain in the workforce; new mobile working styles and increased connectivity that promote an expectation that people are always available; and the workplace has more commonly become a place where workers expect to gain fulfillment and meaning.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These conditions of stress and disengagement can extend to people's private and professional lives. For example, when working within a varied team, participants may find it difficult to create a culture of inclusion and cooperation. New parents also face many challenges to balance new responsibilities while maintaining high performance. Workers in a remote workforce may find it difficult to cultivate behaviors that create culture across disparate locations. These are just a few of the innumerable circumstances where people struggle with developing the skills necessary to thrive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While individuals and companies take steps to combat challenges such as stress and disengagement, they typically over-invest in formal training while failing to focus on experiential opportunities. Instead, people need personal support that focuses on experiences tailored to the individual. However, finding individual support is difficult and expensive. Furthermore, current coaching providers do not have the insight necessary into their coaches and customers to provide adequate support for the customers or coaching guidance for the coaches.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an overview of devices on which some implementations can operate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an overview of an environment in which some implementations can operate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating components which, in some implementations, can be used in a system employing the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process used in some implementations for analyzing characteristics of coaches and users to provide suggestions for effective coaching partnerships.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process used in some implementations for generating scores in multiple whole-person dimensions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process used in some implementations for selecting whole-person dimensions to update with a pulse.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process used in some implementations for implementing a motivational matrix.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-F</figref> are diagrams illustrating example user interfaces for implementing aspects of a virtual coaching platform.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The techniques introduced here may be better understood by referring to the following Detailed Description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals indicate identical or functionally similar elements.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments for operating a virtual coaching platform are described. A virtual coaching platform can promote development in both personal and professional categories to develop &#x201c;whole-person&#x201d; skills. The virtual coaching platform can be useful to support role transitions, such as promotions or changes in focus, can help users achieve higher potentials, can boost team cohesion, can alleviate skill gaps that hamper collaboration and productivity, and can teach inclusion to promote diversity. The virtual coaching platform can be personalized to support different learning styles and provide accountability through human interaction. The virtual coaching platform can be available through multiple interface types to provide convenient and continuous, as opposed to episodic, support. This can integrate the coaching experience into everyday life, helping to build new behaviors. The virtual coaching platform can also provide results that are measurable using evidence-based processes and measures so that progress is tangible and can be evaluated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some of the virtual coaching platform embodiments include analyzing user and coach characteristics to determine suggested coaching partnerships. For example, coaching partnerships can be based on analysis of coaches and users styles (e.g., economy, accountability, directness, and explorative) and interests (e.g. improve focus; improve inspiration; improve stress management; increase team impact; become more open; communicate with more poise). Scores can be generated for the level of compatibility between a user's and coach's various styles and interests. Coaches can be suggested to users based on a combination of the scores, the coach's availability, and the coach's current coaching capacity. Additional details regarding analyzing users and coaches and suggesting coaching partnerships are provided below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some of the virtual platform coaching embodiments include implementations of a user skills model, referred to herein as a &#x201c;whole-person model,&#x201d; used to track progress and provide coaching resources and guidance. In some implementations, the virtual coaching platform can utilize a whole-person model that provides six whole-person dimensions including: centered, aware, agile, includes, elevates, and drives. In some implementations, these dimensions can each be further described in terms of multiple sub-dimensions. In some implementations, these dimensions can be grouped into categories such as personal or leadership. The dimensions and sub-dimensions that a whole-person model can be divided into are together referred to herein as the &#x201c;dimensionalities&#x201d; of the whole-person model. Additional details regarding example whole-person dimensions are provided below in relation to Table 2.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some implementations, scores can be generated in each dimension, sub-dimensions, category, or any combination thereof. Sub-dimensions scores can be generated by determining a user score in each sub-dimension, comparing the user sub-dimension score to a base score, as a percentile, and converting the percentile into a sub-dimensions score. Dimension scores can be generated in a similar manner where the user dimension base score is determined through a combination of the sub-dimension user base scores. Dimensionality scores can be provided in a whole-person report as a benchmarking tool and can be used to select resources and next steps in coaching based on score mappings. Additional details regarding generating and using whole-person dimensionality scores are provided below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more of these dimensionality scores can be updated, e.g., periodically, where the category selected to be updated can be individually selected using associations between the user and various tags corresponding to the dimensionalities. For example, these associations can include amounts of interactions a user has had with content or coaches relating to the dimensions, where the content and/or coaching is determined to have various tags. Additional details regarding applying dimension tags and selecting pulse categories are provided below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some of the virtual platform coaching embodiments include implementations of a motivational matrix. The virtual coaching platform can assess the user in a readiness versus clarity for coaching goals domain. Based on the quadrant of the domain that the user falls into, the user can be mapped to a type. The user's type can be used to select areas to work on, suggested resources, coaching strategies, etc. Additional details regarding applying a motivational matrix are provided below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some of the virtual platform coaching embodiments include additional features such as a resource manager, communications manager, and others. A resource manager can include resources such as exercises, training materials, videos, etc. to be provided to a user. Resources can be organized by skill that the particular resource helps to develop. As users interact with and complete tasks, the resource manager can track user progress. Resources in the resource manager, can be tagged with one or more whole-person dimensionalities, e.g. by manual tagging, using natural language processing (NLP) to automatically assign tags or to recommend tags. In some implementations, coaches can develop custom resources for users, which they can tag. The custom resources can be tagged based on dimensionalities in which the user for which the resource is created has been working. A communications manager can provide various channels for users and coaches to communicate, such as by video chat, IM or text messaging, audio, through guided exercises, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While current coaching providers do not have the insight necessary into their coaches and customers to provide adequate support for the customers or coaching guidance for the coaches, the virtual coaching platform eliminates these problem by implementing specific rules to match coaches with users and to analyze user skills. Furthermore, the virtual coaching system provides an improvement in virtual coaching by providing guidance to coaches, such as how to interact with users and resources to suggest, all based on user-specific analysis in a whole-person model and motivational matrix. In addition, by intelligently selecting when and which skill level scores to update (or &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; as discussed below), these benefits are realized with less intrusion and in a less time-consuming manner than in other coaching systems.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Several implementations are discussed below in more detail in reference to the figures. Turning now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an overview of devices on which some implementations of the disclosed technology can operate. The devices can comprise hardware components of a device <b>100</b> that implement a virtual coaching platform. Device <b>100</b> can include one or more input devices <b>120</b> that provide input to the CPU(s) (processor) <b>110</b>, notifying it of actions. The actions can be mediated by a hardware controller that interprets the signals received from the input device and communicates the information to the CPU <b>110</b> using a communication protocol. Input devices <b>120</b> include, for example, a mouse, a keyboard, a touchscreen, an infrared sensor, a touchpad, a wearable input device, a camera- or image-based input device, a microphone, or other user input devices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">CPU <b>110</b> can be a single processing unit or multiple processing units in a device or distributed across multiple devices. CPU <b>110</b> can be coupled to other hardware devices, for example, with the use of a bus, such as a PCI bus or SCSI bus. The CPU <b>110</b> can communicate with a hardware controller for devices, such as for a display <b>130</b>. Display <b>130</b> can be used to display text and graphics. In some implementations, display <b>130</b> provides graphical and textual visual feedback to a user. In some implementations, display <b>130</b> includes the input device as part of the display, such as when the input device is a touchscreen or is equipped with an eye direction monitoring system. In some implementations, the display is separate from the input device. Examples of display devices are: an LCD display screen, an LED display screen, a projected, holographic, or augmented reality display (such as a heads-up display device or a head-mounted device), and so on. Other I/O devices <b>140</b> can also be coupled to the processor, such as a network card, video card, audio card, USB, firewire or other external device, camera, printer, speakers, CD-ROM drive, DVD drive, disk drive, or Blu-Ray device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some implementations, the device <b>100</b> also includes a communication device capable of communicating wirelessly or wire-based with a network node. The communication device can communicate with another device or a server through a network using, for example, TCP/IP protocols. Device <b>100</b> can utilize the communication device to distribute operations across multiple network devices.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The CPU <b>110</b> can have access to a memory <b>150</b> in a device or distributed across multiple devices. A memory includes one or more of various hardware devices for volatile and non-volatile storage, and can include both read-only and writable memory. For example, a memory can comprise random access memory (RAM), CPU registers, read-only memory (ROM), and writable non-volatile memory, such as flash memory, hard drives, floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, magnetic storage devices, tape drives, device buffers, and so forth. A memory is not a propagating signal divorced from underlying hardware; a memory is thus non-transitory. Memory <b>150</b> can include program memory <b>160</b> that stores programs and software, such as an operating system <b>162</b>, virtual coaching platform <b>164</b>, and other application programs <b>166</b>.

In some implementations, dimensionalities can have weighted relationships between them such that a user's interaction with an item tagged in one dimensionality can also count as contact with items in another dimensionality, where the amount of contact can be based on the weight defined for the relationship. Dimensionalities with a score above a corresponding threshold can be selected for updating.

For example, the order of the logic may be rearranged, substeps may be performed in parallel, illustrated logic may be omitted, other logic may be included, etc. In some implementations, one or more of the components described above can execute one or more of the processes described below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process <b>400</b> used in some implementations for analyzing characteristics of coaches and users to provide suggestions for effective coaching partnerships. In some implementations, process <b>400</b> can be implemented when a user joins a virtual coaching platform and needs to be matched with a coach. Process <b>400</b> can also be performed if a selected coach becomes unavailable or the user wants a different coach. Process <b>400</b> begins at block <b>402</b> and continues to block <b>404</b>. At block <b>404</b>, process <b>400</b> can obtain a set of factors for coaches that are part of the virtual coaching platform. In some implementations, the factors can be obtained for a limited set of the virtual coaching platform coaches, such as those that have available capacity, those that have certain required qualifications (e.g. a minimum number of coaching hours, a particular degree, experience in a particular field or role, etc.), those that have been allocated to a group of people (e.g. a group of coaches for all users who join the virtual coaching platform from a particular company), those that have a specialty matching the user (e.g. a required interest or position), or those that have a specified behavior assessment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, the obtained factors can gauge preferred coaching styles and coaching interests. Coaching style factors can be organized into types, such as autonomy; accountability; directness; and explorativeness. Autonomy can gauge how hands-on a coach is. Accountability can gauge how frequently coaches provide check-ins, messaging, and reminders. Directness can gauge to what degree coaches work in structured, step-by-step manner. Explorativeness can gauge how much a coach focuses on an open and discovery-oriented process. Coaching interest factors can also be organized into types, such as improving focus, improving inspiration, improving stress management, increasing team impact, becoming more open, and communicating with more poise.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The set of factors for each coach can be obtained from a variety of sources such as the coach responding to a series of questions, each configured to provide a value for a factor type; peer reviews or user feedback regarding a coach the user has had, which can take the form of rankings in categories corresponding to the factor types; or mappings between experiences or qualifications and factor values. Process <b>400</b> can combine all the factors received for a particular coach into a value for that factor type. For example, where the factors are a set of Likert values corresponding to a set of questions, each with a correspondence to factor type, an overall Likert score can be computed for all the questions that correspond to the same factor type. This overall score can be the value used for that coach for that factor type.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, these scores can be stored for coaches so they can be re-used in future iterations of process <b>400</b> without having to be recomputed. In addition, these scores can be updated, e.g. periodically or in response to new information, such as a new user review or coach's achievement.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>406</b>, process <b>400</b> can obtain a set of factors for a user of the virtual coaching platform. The user factors can be of the same type as the coach factors. In some implementations, the process for obtaining the user factor values can be the same as the process used for coaches, e.g. the same questions can be answered by the user or the same mapping to factor values can be used. In some implementations, while the same factor types are valued, the process to obtain these values is different. For example, the questions used to obtain Likert values for coaches can be geared to coaching style while the questions for users can be geared to learning styles. Once the user factor values are obtained, they can be combined in a manner similar to that performed for the coach factors.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>408</b>, process <b>400</b> can set a next factor type, of the set of factor types, as a selected factor type to be used in the loop between blocks <b>408</b>-<b>412</b>. When this is the first iteration of this loop, the first factor type can be selected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>410</b>, process <b>400</b> can compute a factor type compatibility score indicating a level of compatibility between the user and the coach in the selected factor type. In some implementations, the factor type compatibility score is computed by multiplying the user's combined score for that factor type with the coach's combined score for that factor type, and dividing the product by the maximum possible score for that factor type. For example, if the factor type is directness, which could have a maximum score of 5, the user's directness score is a 3.4, and the coaches directness score is 4.1, the compatibility score for the directness factor could be 3.4*4.1/5=2.79. In some implementations, the maximum score is consistent across all factor types while in other implementations different factor types have different maximum scores. A higher maximum score will generally weight a factor type as more important, i.e. the compatibility score for that factor will generally be higher than compatibility scores with a lower possible maximum. At block <b>412</b>, process <b>400</b> can determine whether there are additional factor types to compute a compatibility score for in the loop between blocks <b>408</b>-<b>412</b>. If so, process <b>400</b> returns to block <b>408</b>. If not, process <b>400</b> continues to block <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>414</b>, process <b>400</b> can combine the factor type compatibility scores computed at block <b>410</b>. For example, process <b>400</b> can compute the sum of the compatibility scores, the average, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>416</b>, process <b>400</b> can select coaches with a minimum amount of capacity. For example, each coach can have a maximum number of users that they coach, which can be set for individual coaches or for coaches generally. In some implementations, capacity can be based on other factors such as number of hours each user is expected to require from a coach, guarantees of availability to a coach's users, a coach's users' factor scores or types the coach's users fall into (e.g. users with a high autonomy may take up less of a coaches capacity), etc. In some implementations, instead of excluding coaches with below a minimum amount of capacity at block <b>416</b>, this can occur as part of block <b>404</b> where coaching factors are obtained for only coaches with the minimum amount of available capacity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>418</b>, process <b>400</b> can rank the coaches according to their compatibility scores with the user. At block <b>420</b>, process <b>400</b> can determine each coach's availability, and adjust their ranking accordingly. In some implementations, availability can be a binary determination for whether the coach has a certain amount of available open timeslots within a given amount of time. More specifically, availability can be true where a coach has at least one 45 minute time slot available within the next five business days. In various implementations, whether a coach has availability can cause an adjustment to the compatibility score (e.g. multiplying it by &#x2153;, when the coach does not have availability), or can be a sorting factor (e.g. all coaches with availability are sorted above all coaches without availability, which are then sorted by compatibility score). In some implementations, availability can be a scaling factor, e.g. the compatibility score between a coach and the user is adjusted on a scale based on the coach's availability. In some cases, any amount of availability above a particular threshold can have the same adjustment score, e.g. 100%. Prioritizing coaches with a higher amount of immediate availability can incentivize the user to schedule an initial session as soon as possible. In some implementations, coach availability is determined based on a calendar system of the virtual coaching platform, or based on an integration with a separate calendar (e.g. Google Calendar&#x2122;) such as through an API. In some implementations, correspondence between a user and a coach time zone can be taken into account, to ensure that availability is determined based on open timeslots within business hours of the user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>compatibility</entry><entry>has</entry><entry>has</entry><entry>Is</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>score</entry><entry>capacity?</entry><entry>availability?</entry><entry>recommended?</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Coach A</entry><entry>10.0</entry><entry>no</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>no</entry></row><row><entry>Coach B</entry><entry>20.0</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>no</entry><entry>yes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(position 3)</entry></row><row><entry>Coach C</entry><entry>10.0</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>yes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(position 2)</entry></row><row><entry>Coach D</entry><entry>15.0</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>yes</entry><entry>yes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(position 1)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Table 1 shows a list of four coaches, whether each is included in the list of recommended coaches based on their capacity, their compatibility score to a particular user, whether the coach has availability, and the coach's position in the ranking based on the compatibility score and availability.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">At block <b>422</b>, process <b>400</b> can provide ranked coaching matches.

For example, factor types that had a high impact on the compatibility score between that coach the user can be indicated.

In some implementations, the user can request a new coach, which can result in repeating process <b>400</b>. Once a compatible coach is selected, process <b>400</b> continues to block <b>424</b>, where it ends.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">As a user interacts with the virtual coaching platform, the platform can generate various scores representing skill levels for the user. These scores can be organized by various categories, category dimensions, and sub-dimension, i.e. dimensionalities. This structure is referred to herein as the &#x201c;whole-person model.&#x201d; In an example whole-person model, the scores can be within various categories such as personal and leadership. An example whole-person model can also have various dimensions such as centered, aware, agile, includes, elevates, and drives. The centered dimension can relate to leadership in the face of change and can gauge a user's ability to connect, inspire, make decisions, be empathetic, and create a positive environment. The aware dimension can relate to being focused and present and can gauge a user's ability know oneself, know how to adapt to his or her environment, and know how to direct their energy to maximize productivity and well-being. The agile dimension can relate to facing change and can gauge a user's ability to adjust to the unexpected, continually learn, reassess, regroup, and move forward in the face of setbacks and change. The includes dimension can gauge a user's ability to cultivate a culture of caring, trust, and open communication and create an environment where everyone feels that they can participate, contribute, and do their best work. The elevates dimension can gauge a user's ability to leverage and develop the collective capacity of his or her team, communicate an inspiring vision, and create a work environment of autonomy and recognition. The drives dimension can gauge a user's ability to achieve results, move action forward by making decisions, deliver results, and gain support from others. In some implementations, the whole-person model can have dimensions organized under the categories, such as personal: centered, aware, and agile and leadership: includes, elevates, and drives.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In some implications, various dimensions can have one or more sub-dimensions. For example, a whole-person model can have the dimension/sub-dimension relationships of&#x2014;centered: purpose, engagement, energy, and calm; aware: focus, flow, values, mindfulness, and emotional regulation; agile: resilience, growth mindset, sense of control, and risk tolerance; includes: open communication, participation, positive relationships, and trust climate; elevates: inspiring, coaching, and recognizing ownership; and drives: alignment, problem-solving, feedback, and influence. Another example of a possible whole-person model is provided below in relation to Table 2.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In some implementations, various aspects of the virtual coaching platform can be tagged according to the whole-person model used in the virtual coaching platform. For example, self-reporting questions to gauge a user's strengths can be tagged with one or more dimensions or sub-dimensions of the whole-person model; exercises or activities included in the virtual coaching platform can be tagged for the dimensionalities of the whole-person model the exercise or activity is designed to promote or assess; or interactions a user takes within the virtual coaching platform can be tagged according to the whole-person model dimensionalities.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process <b>500</b> used in some implementations for generating scores in multiple whole-person dimensionalities. Process <b>500</b> begins at block <b>502</b> and continues to block <b>504</b>. At block <b>504</b>, process <b>500</b> can obtain metrics for analyzing various dimensionalities of the whole-person model of the virtual coaching platform. These metrics can be organized according to the dimension(s) or sub-dimension(s) for which they provide a value. These metrics can be based on a variety of sources such as user responses to questions; peer, supervisor, or supervisee reviews; input from the user's coach; indications of the user's interaction with virtual coaching platform resources or activity scores; NLP of user communications that take place on the virtual coaching platform; etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In some implementations, the virtual coaching platform can include multiple questions, each configured to provide insight to the user's strength in one or more of the whole-person model dimensionalities. The questions can be tagged with one or more whole-person model tags corresponding to the dimensionality the question is configured to assess. In some implementations, question responses can be mapped to particular values, e.g. on a Likert scale. In various implementations, such questions can be answered by the user as part of a self-reporting process or through reviews by peers, supervisors, or supervisees of the user. As the user interacts with a coach of the virtual coaching platform, the coach can become familiar with the user's strengths and weaknesses in areas defined by the whole-person model dimensionalities. In various implementations, the coach can provide metrics for the user, either by directly scoring the user in dimensionalities or by answering dimensionality tagged questions about the user, similar to the peer review process. In some implementations, user interactions with the virtual coaching platform can provide dimension or sub-dimension metrics. For example, a user can receive a metric based on individual resources or an amount of resources the user accesses for particular whole-person model dimensionalities. As another example, the user can perform exercises provided through the virtual coaching platform which can tagged via the whole-person model and exercise actions or results can be translated into metrics. As yet a further example, the user's progress through &#x201c;tracks&#x201d; corresponding to various whole-person model dimensionalities can be a metric. In some implementations, communications that the user performs through the virtual coaching platform can be valued, e.g. manually by a coach that was part of the communication or through NLP of the communication, such as by a machine learning engine trained based on communications of other users who have established scores in various of the whole-person model dimensionalities.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">At block <b>506</b>, process <b>500</b> can select a next sub-dimension as a selected sub-dimension to be operated on by the loop between blocks <b>506</b>-<b>512</b>. For example, the whole-person model used by the virtual coaching platform can have six dimensions divided into 25 sub-dimensions. The first time process <b>500</b> reaches block <b>506</b>, it can set the first of the sub-dimensions as the selected sub-dimension. Then, in each iteration of the loop between blocks <b>506</b>-<b>512</b>, block <b>506</b> can set a next of the sub-dimensions as the selected sub-dimension.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">At block <b>508</b>, process <b>500</b> can combine the metrics, obtained at block <b>504</b> for the selected sub-dimension, to compute a user score for the selected sub-dimension. For example, this can be done by taking the average or sum of the metrics for the selected sub-dimension. In some implementations, particular metrics can be weighted before being combined. For example, self-reporting question responses and coaching reviews can be highly weighted (e.g. 100%), reviews by others can be moderately weighted (e.g. 75%), user interactions with the virtual coaching platform can be less weighted (e.g. 50%) and scores from communication observations can be lowly weighted (e.g. 10%). Example results for combining metrics for the selected sub-dimension into a sub-dimension user scores are provided below in the &#x201c;user sub score&#x201d; column of Table 2.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">At block <b>510</b>, process <b>500</b> can compute a comparison value between the user score for the selected sub-dimension and a base score for the selected sub-dimension. The base scores can be determined based on an average of user scores for the selected sub-dimension for a group of users, such as all users of the virtual coaching platform, users within the same region as the user for which process <b>500</b> is being performed, or users within a same category (e.g. based on demographic or biographic information, career role or type, experience level, etc.) as this user. In some implementations, the comparison at block <b>510</b> can be performed based on a difference between the sub-dimensions base score and the user score in that sub-dimensions, e.g. by comparing that difference to the total possible score in the sub-dimension. In some implementations, the comparison can be performed using a standard deviation in the scores from the group of users that were used to determine the base score for that sub-dimension. For example, the comparison can implement one or the &#x201c;normdist&#x201d; or &#x201c;norm.dist&#x201d; function, which provide the normal distribution for a specified mean and standard deviation. For example, in the version of norm.dist provided by Microsoft Office&#x2122;, the comparison can be performed by the function call norm.dist(user_sub_score, sub_base_score, base_std_div, true). The result of the comparison can be a percentile value. Table 2 shows example results of this comparison in the &#x201c;sub %&#x201d; column. In some implementations, this percentile can be multiplied by a constant, e.g. 60, to place the sub-dimension comparison score in the selected sub-dimension on a particular scale, e.g. 1 to 60.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">At block <b>512</b>, process <b>500</b> can determine whether there are additional sub-dimensions which need to be analyzed by the loop between blocks <b>506</b>-<b>512</b>.

While FIGS. <b>8</b>C<b>1</b>-<b>8</b>C<b>4</b> are shown separately, in some implementations these figures can be combined into a single page. For example, a website version of a whole-person report could include each of FIGS. <b>8</b>C<b>1</b>-<b>8</b>C<b>4</b> in a single page or could have any of these figures on different pages of the website. In some implementations, various of the whole-person scores can be provided to the user's coach, which can be used for the coach to determine which areas to focus on, or can be compared to various mappings of scores to coaching materials, coaching styles, suggestions, etc. to help the coach determine how to best provide guidance to the user.

Determining a complete whole-person report, e.g. through process <b>500</b>, can be resource intensive or time-consuming. For example, obtaining the metrics needed to generate all the sub-dimensions scores can require the user, peers, supervisors, a coach, or others to answer a multitude of questions. While the entirety of process <b>500</b> may be beneficial to perform in certain instances, such as when a user first joins the virtual coaching platform, it can also be beneficial to update only a subset of dimensionality scores in particular instances. For example, a subset of the dimensionality scores can be updated periodically (e.g., every set number of days weeks or months) or when certain milestones are reached (e.g. when particular tasks are completed, upon recommendation by a coach, upon the user interacting with the virtual coaching platform for a certain amount of time, etc.). The updating process is referred to herein as a &#x201c;pulse,&#x201d; and entails performing process <b>500</b> using only a subset of the whole-person model dimensions or sub-dimensions. When a pulse version of process <b>500</b> occurs, the base scores used at blocks <b>510</b> and <b>518</b> can be determined using scores of users recorded for a corresponding time period or milestone. For example, if this is a pulse update for the 90 day from joining mark, base scores can be for other users who were at the same 90 period.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">Which dimensionalities to pulse are selected using process <b>600</b>. For example, process <b>600</b> can select dimensionalities to pulse based on a determination of what has been a focus of the user's recent (e.g. since the last pulse) coaching experiences. Process <b>600</b> begins at block <b>602</b> and continues to block <b>604</b>. At block <b>604</b>, process <b>600</b> can obtain metrics for amounts of user interaction the user has had with content tagged for a dimensionality of the whole-person model. The metrics can indicate items, tagged with a particular dimensionality, the user has interacted with or can be an amount of time the user has interacted with such resources. In some implementations, these items can include virtual coaching platform resources and activities. In some implementations, these items can also include conversations or other interactions with the user's coach or with other users. These conversations can be tagged according to the whole-person model, either manually by a coach that took part in the conversation, or through the use of NLP analysis. Such NLP analysis can be performed, for example, using a trained classification engine that used manually tagged conversations as training data to select which tags should be applied to additional conversations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">At block <b>606</b>, process <b>600</b> can use determined weighted correspondences between the dimensions or sub-dimensions of the whole-person model to augment the metrics obtained at block <b>604</b>. These relationships can signify a determination that work in a particular dimensionality can also provide a benefit in another dimension or sub-dimension. For example, there can be parent/child relationships between dimensions and sub-dimensions, where the weight of the relationship is a measure of the significance of the sub-dimension to the parent dimension. For example, a particular sub-dimension can be determined to be 25% of the significance of its parent dimension, and thus can have a 0.25 weighting factor. In some implementations, these relationships can be associative, indicating that a first amount of work on a particular dimensionality is equivalent to a second amount of work in an associated dimensionality. For example, an associative relationship can specify that one hour working in an engagement sub-dimension also qualifies as 12 minutes working in an energy sub-dimension. In this example, there would be a 0.2 weighting factor on an engagement to energy sub-dimension relationship.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">Based on the specified dimensionality relationships, a metric for a particular sub-dimension can cause an addition to the set of metrics for another dimension or sub-dimension by an amount specified by the relationship weighting factor. For example, where one metric is five hours of work in an open communication sub-domain, and where the open communication sub-dimension has a relationship with the trust climate sub-dimension with a weighting factor of 0.35, an additional trust climate metric can be added in an amount of 0.35*5=1.75 hours. In some implementations, the updating between dimensionalities at block <b>616</b> can be limited to one hop between dimensionalities or can cascade based on all relationships between dimensionalities. In some implementations, relationships can be circular, i.e. sub-dimension A can have a relationship with sub-dimension B, which can have a relationship with sub-dimension C, which can have a relationship with sub-dimension A. In some implementations, cascading updates can be limited to prevent adding a dimensionality type of the type that initiated the update.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">At block <b>608</b>, process <b>600</b> can compute a metric total for each dimensionality. This can be accomplished, for example, by taking, for each dimensionality, a sum or average of the corresponding metrics obtained at block <b>604</b>, as updated at block <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">At block <b>610</b>, process <b>600</b> can compare the metric total of each dimensionality against one or more thresholds. In various implementations, the thresholds can be specific to each dimension or sub-dimension, there can be a first threshold for dimensions and a second threshold for sub-dimensions, or a single threshold can be used for the comparison across all dimensionalities.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">At block <b>612</b>, process <b>600</b> can perform a pulse update for dimensionalities that have a metric total above the corresponding threshold. The pulse update or updates can include performing process <b>500</b> using only the whole-person model dimensionalities selected at block <b>610</b>. For example, the user can be asked to respond to only the subset of self-reporting questions that are tagged with the selected dimensionality.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">The virtual coaching platform can track a user's score in each dimension or sub-dimension. As the pulse updates occur, each dimensionality score can be updated accordingly. When a pulse update occurs, a new whole-person report or the updated score(s) can be provided to the user. In some implementations, an indication can be provided in a report to show which scores have been updated since the last whole-person report, timestamps can be provided for each of the dimensionality scores, dimensionalities can be marked to indicate suggested areas of work, etc. Once the pulse updates have occurred, process <b>600</b> continues to block <b>614</b>, where it ends.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process <b>700</b> used in some implementations for implementing a motivational matrix.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">A motivational matrix can be another tool of the virtual coaching platform that provides guidance for coaches on how to interact with the user based on one of four types, selected based on the user's readiness for coaching or clarity of coaching goals.

For example, each possible question responses can be associated with a positive or negative value in one or both of the readiness or clarity dimensions. The sum of the values in each dimension can determine a location of the user in the readiness/clarity domain.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">At block <b>708</b>, process <b>700</b> can receive an adjustment, from the user's coach, of the readiness/clarity domain location determined at block <b>706</b>. As indicated by the dashed line, in some cases no adjustment is made from a coach. In some implementations, the adjustment can be made by providing the user's automatic clarity or readiness scores, or location in the readiness/clarity domain, to the coach, and having the coach edit them directly. In some implementations, the adjustment can be made by having the coach answer additional questions, such as the questions described above, in relation to their impression of the user, and adjusting the user's readiness and clarity scores accordingly. In various implementations, coaches answers can be unweighted or weighted more or less than the user's responses.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">At block <b>710</b>, process <b>700</b> can determine a type for the user based on the quadrant of the readiness/clarity domain the user's location falls in.

The finding type can be for users with low clarity and high readiness, the focus type can be for users with high clarity and high readiness, the nurture type can be for users with low clarity and low readiness, and the prove type can be for users with high clarity and low readiness.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">At block <b>712</b>, process <b>700</b> can utilize a mapping of type to coaching suggestions to provide guidance to a coach. For example, the coaching suggestions can provide recommendations on how to approach the user, recommendations on which resources to suggest to the user, and recommendations as to things to avoid when interacting with the user. An example of coaching suggestions for the &#x201c;Find&#x201d; type are provided below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>. Process <b>700</b> can then continue to block <b>714</b>, where it ends.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">An additional feature of the virtual coaching platform can include a resource manager providing access to a variety of resources. Resources can include, for example, exercises, reading materials, training videos, recordings, or etc. In some implementations, resources can be tagged based on a skill level, e.g., basic, intermediate, or advanced; based on a type of activity, e.g., reading, watching, listening, or doing; and by duration. In some implementations resources can be rated, e.g., based on user or coach feedback.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">In some implementations, resources can be created to help users develop in areas corresponding to the dimensionalities of the whole-person model, and can be tagged accordingly. Resources can be tagged according to dimensionalities in various ways, such as manually by coaches or other resource creators or can be tagged through an NLP method where a tagging engine can be trained on previously tagged resources to provide dimensionality tags for new resources.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">In some implementations, coaches can create custom resources for a particular user. The coach can tag the resource with various of the possible tags. In some implementations, tags for a new resource can be suggested to the coach, e.g., based on the content of the resource or a dimensionality that the user the resource was created for, has been working in. In some cases, custom resources created by one coach can be available to other coaches to provide to their users as well.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Users or coaches can search for or filter resources from the resource manager based on the various tags. For example, based on a recent pulse update, a coach can determine that a user has not made much progress in and &#x201c;inspiring&#x201d; sub-dimension and can select and suggest resources to the user that are tagged with that sub-dimension. In some implementations, the virtual coaching platform can track a user's individual progress through a particular resource or set of resources in the resource manager. A sample user interface is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, showing a track of resources for improving in a &#x201c;centered leader&#x201d; dimension, with a list of sub-dimensions (shown as &#x201c;skills&#x201d;), and activities in the resource manager to complete for this track. Some additional features of a user interface for interacting with a resource manager are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">Another feature of the virtual coaching platform can include a communications manager. A communications manager can provide various channels for users and coaches to communicate, such as by video chat, IM or text messaging, audio, through guided exercises, etc. In some implementations, the communications manager can facilitate setting up meetings between a user and a coach, e.g. through a native calendar app or by coordinating between existing calendar apps such as Outlook&#x2122; or Google calendars&#x2122;. In some implementations, the communications manager can provide reminders to users or coaches about upcoming meetings or to set up a meeting when one has not occurred within a threshold amount of time or on a given meeting schedule. In some implementations, the communications manager can include a &#x201c;to-do&#x201d; component, which can include a list of resources, activities, and appointments, etc., that are upcoming for a user. In some implementations, the communications manager can obtain a textual version of communications between users and coaches, and store these transcripts for use in various NLP processes related to coaching of the user. In some implementations, the communications manager can tag communications between the coach and the user with various whole-person model dimensionality tags, e.g. by receiving manual tags from the coach or through an NLP process performed on a stored transcript of the communication. These tags can be used, for example, as part of process <b>600</b> for determining which dimensionalities to pulse.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Several implementations of the disclosed technology are described above in reference to the figures. The computing devices on which the described technology may be implemented can include one or more central processing units, memory, input devices (e.g., keyboard and pointing devices), output devices (e.g., display devices), storage devices (e.g., disk drives), and network devices (e.g., network interfaces). The memory and storage devices are computer-readable storage media that can store instructions that implement at least portions of the described technology. In addition, the data structures and message structures can be stored or transmitted via a data transmission medium, such as a signal on a communications link. Various communications links can be used, such as the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network, or a point-to-point dial-up connection.
