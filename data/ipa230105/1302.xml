The computer technology enables the events to be recorded and broadcast so they can be viewed by people that were unable to attend the sporting events in person. Video games have further enhanced sporting events by enabling one or more users to become virtual competitors in a virtual sporting event at a time and location that is convenient for them. The video games often provide a virtual reality environment with photorealistic players that can be manipulated to compete against one another.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example computing environment for creating a mixed reality competition between real and virtual participants, in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating example components and modules of a computing device, in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an example method in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating example of a computer system in accordance with an implementation of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These drawings may be better understood when observed in connection with the following detailed description.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Traditional sporting events involve real people competing against one another to determine which person is the better competitor. There are many situations that arise that make a competition between real people challenging or impossible. For example, one or more of the people may be injured, sick, deceased, traveling, or otherwise unavailable or the location of the competition (e.g., course, field, track, or court) may be unavailable. Hosting the competition in a purely virtual environment may address these problems but often loses the excitement derived by a user when participating in person.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technology disclosed herein provides a method and system for generating a mixed reality computer simulation of a competition between real and virtual participants. The technology may provide a mixed reality environment that merges aspects of the real world with aspects of a virtual world to produce a new visualization. The real participant may be any human being that wants to compete in-person with a virtual participant. The virtual participant may include a deceased person, a living person, a famous person, a friend, other participant, or a combination thereof. The real participant may perform actions in the real world that are captured in video content. The technology may augment the video content to also include simulated actions of the virtual participant. The simulation of the virtual participant may be based on one or more people (e.g., actual person or substitute body double), computer models (e.g., graphical model, behavioral model, and kinematic model), or a combination thereof. The technology may also determine scores for the real and virtual participants and determine the winner of the competition.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various aspects of the above referenced methods and systems are described in detail herein below by way of examples, rather than by way of limitation. Some of the examples provided below discuss a sporting competition that involves golf. In other examples, the competition may be a sporting competition that involves a different sport or may be a different competition such as a fitness competition, a scholastic competition, other competition, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example computing environment <b>100</b> for creating a mixed reality computer simulated competition between real and virtual participants.

Participants <b>110</b>A-B may include living entities (e.g., biological organism) or non-living entities (e.g., mechanical devices) and may include one or more people (e.g., human beings), animals (e.g., horses, dogs), equipment (e.g., clubs, balls, cars, carts, chariots), other entity or object, or a combination thereof. Participants <b>110</b>A-B may include real participants that are currently alive and tangible and virtual participants that are computer generated and intangible. A real participant (e.g., participant <b>110</b>A) may be the same or similar to an actual participant, a real-life participant, a human participant, a real competitor, real player, or other term. A virtual participant (e.g., participant <b>110</b>B) may be the same or similar to a computer generated participant, an avatar, a character, a figure, other virtual participant, or a combination thereof. In one example, both participants <b>110</b>A-B may be based on a living organism but participant <b>110</b>A may be based on a person that is currently alive and participant <b>110</b>B may be based on a person that is deceased. The real participant and virtual participant may participate in the competition at the same time or at different times (e.g., time shifting).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The competition may involve one or more competitive events (e.g., games, matches, meets, rounds, holes) and involve one or more participants (e.g., players, competitors). The participants may participate individually or as part of a team and may compete together with one another or against one another. The competition may include a physical competition, an intellectual competition, or a combination thereof. The physical competition may involve performing physical activities (e.g., athletic activities, sporting activities) that involve the use of a set of muscles and physical strength (e.g., arm strength, leg strength). The intellectual competition may involve performing intellectual activities (e.g., scholastic or academic activities) that involve intellectual strength (e.g., problem solving, memory, pattern recognition). The intellectual competitions may involve board games (e.g., Chess, Go), academic subjects (e.g., math, history, spelling bee), puzzles, riddles, other intellectual competition, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Physical competitions may include one or more sporting competitions, fitness competitions, other competitions, or a combination thereof.

The fitness competition may include cardio activity, weightlifting, climbing, pushups, other fitness activity, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Competition area <b>120</b> may be an area where the competition occurs. Competition area <b>120</b> may be at one or more physical locations (e.g., geographic locations or area) or at virtual locations (e.g., virtual area). Competition area <b>120</b> may be the same or similar to a course (e.g., golf course), court (e.g., tennis court, basketball court), field (e.g., baseball field, soccer field, football field), rink (e.g., skating rink, hockey rink), track (e.g., automotive track, dirt bike track, horse track), trail (e.g., ski trail, hiking trail), alley (e.g., bowling alley), board game (e.g., chess board), other area, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Competition object <b>130</b> may be an object that is used before, during, or after the competition. The object may be movable or non-movable and may include equipment that enables or enhances the competition. In one example, competition object <b>130</b> may be a movable object (e.g., ball, puck, club, bat) and the participants may move it during the competition (e.g., hitting a golf ball with golf club, throwing a football, moving a game piece). In another example, competition object <b>130</b> may be a stationary object and the participants may interact with the competition object without moving the object (e.g., hole, tee box, sand trap, basketball hoop, goal post). In either example, competition object <b>130</b> may be a tangible object as discussed above or may be an intangible object. The intangible object may be a boundary line, goal line, start line, finish line, line of scrimmage, other object, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Computing devices <b>140</b>A-C may include any computing devices that are capable of processing data.

A computer model may correspond to one or more virtual participants, real participants, competition areas, competitions, other entity, or a combination thereof. The computer models may be used to simulate, predict, recommend, monitor, interpret, render, animate, or represent an aspect of a participant or competition. The aspect may relate to an appearance, an action, a result, a score, other aspect, or a combination thereof. The computer model may be the same or similar to a mathematical model, a statistical model, probabilistic model, a deterministic model, a numeric model, a 3D model, other representation, or a combination thereof.

The mapping data may be in the form of one or more tables, indexes, if-else statements, other data or a combination thereof. The mapping data may also or alternatively be in the form of mathematical data (e.g., weights, biases, equations, variables, coefficients, constants). In one example, the computer model may be used to map input data (e.g., distance to hole, presence of obstructions, roughness of competition area) to output data (e.g., medium swing with a seven iron, sand wedge, putter, or driver). In another example, the computer model may be used to map input data (e.g., image of an actor) to output data (e.g., image augmented to appear like deceased legend).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The computer models may be generated and/or stored by computing device <b>140</b> in data store <b>250</b> as computer modeling data <b>254</b>. Computer modeling data <b>254</b> may be generated with or without the assistance of a human and may include numeric data that is generated by computing device <b>140</b> or may be generated by another computing device and transmitted to computing device <b>140</b>.

The graphical computer model may be a multi-dimensional model (e.g., 3D Model or 2D Model) and may include numeric data that indicates an appearance of an object. The graphical computer model may enable a computing device to render a digital representation of the object and the digital representation may be incorporated into an image and displayed on a display device (e.g., playing a video). The digital representation may be a photorealistic digital representation of a participant (e.g., deceased person), a competition object (e.g., golf ball or golf club), a competition area (e.g., golf green or tee box), other aspect of a competition, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Using the graphical computer model to generate a virtual participant may involve generating a digital representation of a person (e.g., human being). The person may be a living person or a deceased person and may be referred to as a &#x201c;Digital Legend&#xae;.&#x201d; In one example, the graphical computer model may be generated by analyzing image data of the participant (e.g., video data or still image data). In another example, the graphical computer model may be generated by analyzing image data of a substitute participant. The substitute participant may be an entity (e.g., person, animal, or object) that has an appearance that is similar to the appearance of the participant being modeled (e.g., body double).

Behavioral computer model may be the same or similar to a graphical computer model and may be generated based on data associated with a specific participant (e.g., participant data of a deceased person) or data associated with a general type of participant (e.g., general human behavior). In one example, the behavioral computer model may model the behavior of a deceased professional golfer and may be used to indicate the type of golf clubs selected, the swing of the user, other actions or emotions, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The kinetic computer model may be used to determine an action or a result of an action of a participant, competition object, competition area, or other aspect of a competition.

The kinetic computer model may include numeric data that indicates the motion and interactions of one or more objects. The objects may include portions of a participant, equipment, competition object, competition area, other object, or a combination thereof. The kinetic computer model may be used to determine, recommend, select, or predict an action or a result of an action of a participant. In one example, the generation of the kinetic computing model is based on participant data of a deceased person that includes physiological data having one or more length measurements (e.g., height, arm length) and weights (e.g., body weight) and includes performance data having one or more scores of at least one historical competition involving the deceased person.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Player configuration component <b>144</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to determine a configuration for a competition involving a real participant (e.g., real player), a virtual participant (e.g., virtual player), or a combination thereof.

The user interface may be based on or include a graphical user interface (GUI), command line interface (CLI), application programing interface (API), other interface, or a combination thereof. The computer program may be or include a user application such as a smart phone application (e.g., mobile app), a personal computer application (e.g., internet browser, vendor application), a server based application (e.g., web application), other product or service, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The user of the technology may be the same or different from the participant involved in the competition. In one example, the user of the technology (e.g., app user) and the real participant may be the same person and the virtual participant may be a different person (e.g., living or deceased professional athlete). In another example, the real participant involved in the competition may be different from the user of the technology and the user of the technology may be a friend, relative, colleague, employee, consultant, spectator, or competitor of the user.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Set generation module <b>222</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to generate a set of one or more options for a competition. The set of options may include one or more participants, competition objects, competition areas, other aspect of the competition, or a combination thereof. In one example, the set options may include a set of participants with one or more virtual participants, real participants, or a combination thereof. The participants in the set may include one or more deceased entities (e.g., deceased person or animal), living entities (e.g., person that is alive), fictional entities (e.g., character in a movie, book, or fable), famous entities (e.g., professional athlete, celebrity), entities associated with the user (e.g., relative, friend, colleague, pet, car), alternate versions of a participant (e.g., historical, future, or current version of the user or real participant), other entity, or a combination thereof. In one example, selecting an option from the set may involve computing device <b>140</b> providing one or more options in the set to the user and receiving user input <b>256</b> that identifies at least one of the participants. In another example, computing device <b>140</b> may automatically select one or more of the options in the absence of a user selection. This may involve selecting one or more of the options based on scores (e.g., highest score, scores above a threshold) or randomly selecting one of the options. In one example, one or more of the options of the set may be determined by recommendation module <b>224</b> (e.g., recommended options).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Recommendation module <b>224</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to generate a recommendation that includes one or more options for the competition. The recommendation may include one or more participants (e.g., virtual participant), competition objects (e.g., clubs, balls, footwear, or other equipment items), competition areas (e.g., best golf courses), other options for a competition, or a combination thereof. A recommended option may be automatically selected by computing device <b>140</b> or may be provided to the user and the user may provide user input (e.g., user selection) that identifies one or more of the recommended options before, during, or after the competition begins. Recommendation module <b>224</b> may generate a recommendation in view of an analysis or comparison of participant data <b>252</b>, computer modeling data <b>254</b>, user input <b>256</b>, video content <b>141</b>, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Recommendation module <b>224</b> may recommend a particular participant based on one or more of the participants involved in the competition. For example, recommendation module <b>224</b> may recommend a particular virtual participant based on a real participant selected for the competition. This may be advantageous because the competition may be more entertaining or enjoyable to a participant or viewer when the virtual participant and the real participant are more similar (e.g., a closer match). Determining the similarity may involve the recommendation module <b>224</b> generating a similarity value in view of data of the real participant and data of one or more candidate virtual participants. In one example, the similarity value may be based on one or more comparisons between the physiological data (e.g., participant's age, height, gender, or swing), performance data (e.g., past scores, experience, skill), or other data of the real participant and the candidate virtual participants. In one example, the similarity value may be lower when the data of different participants is less aligned (e.g., more differences) and may be higher when data of different participants are more aligned (e.g., more similarities).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Recommendation module <b>224</b> may recommend a particular competition area based on one or more of the participants involved in the competition. For example, recommendation module <b>224</b> may recommend, based on the real or virtual participants, a particular competition area or event (e.g., Pebble Beach, Madison Square Garden (MSG), Kentucky Derby, Daytona <b>500</b>). This may be advantageous because the competition may be more entertaining or enjoyable to a participant or viewer depending on the competition area that is involved. Recommending a particular competition area may involve determining advantage data that indicates a competitive advantage of a first participant (e.g., real person) over a second participant (e.g., virtual or real person).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The advantage data may be based on comparisons between the performance data (e.g., past scores, experience, skill), physiological data (e.g., participant's age, height, gender, or swing), or other data of the participants. In one example, the advantage data may indicate the first participant has an advantage over the second participant in a first event of the competition (e.g., short distance shots/putting) and a disadvantage over the second participant in a second event of the competition (e.g., long distance shots/driving). Recommendation module <b>224</b> may compare the advantage data with data of one or more candidate competition areas to determine a competition area that provides a competitive advantage to the first or second participant (e.g., select golf course with more challenging putting to align with the first participant's better putting skills).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The competition may have multiple participants as discussed above or may include a single participant and during the competitive activity all other participants may be absent (e.g., without, missing, free of another competitor). In one example, a competition with a single real participant and no other real or virtual participants may occur when the real participant wants to compete in a time-shifted manner with themselves or another participant. In another example, a competition with a single real participant and no other real or virtual participants may occur when the real participant wants to have their activity (e.g., sequence of actions) analyzed by the technology without competing directly against another competitor. This may be used for training, practicing, entertainment, other purpose, or a combination thereof and may or may not involve the scoring discussed below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Competition component <b>146</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to simulate a competition involving one or more virtual participants, real participants, or a combination thereof. In one example, the competition may be between a real participant and a virtual participant and the real participant may compete directly against the virtual participant (e.g., head-to-head competition). In another example, one or more real and/or virtual participants may compete together on the same team (e.g., team mates) and compete with one another against another team that includes one or more real or virtual participants. In either example, competition component <b>146</b> may simulate the actions of the virtual participants and may track or predict the actions of the real participants. Analysis of the actions may be used to calculate scores for one or more of the participants and to determine a winner. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, competition component <b>146</b> may include a simulation module <b>230</b>, a tracking module <b>232</b>, and a scoring module <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Simulation module <b>230</b> may simulate the competition by simulating activity of a virtual participant, a competition object, a competition area, or a combination thereof. The simulation may involve simulating activities or results of the activities. The activities may be referred to as a competitive activities and may be related to a sports activity, fitness activity, academic activity, scholastic activity, or other activity. The activity may include a sequence of one or more actions and the actions in the sequence may be dependent or independent of prior actions. In one example, all the actions of a virtual participant that occur during a competition may be performed independent of another participant. In another example, one or more actions of a virtual participant may depend on prior actions of another participant (e.g., depend on a result of an action of the real participant). Simulation module <b>230</b> may select an action based on one or more past actions, current actions, or expected future actions of the participant being simulated, another participant (e.g., real or virtual person), competition object or area, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An action may include a particular motion of a participant, competition object, competition area, or a combination thereof. The actions of a virtual participant may involve a motion of the entire participant or a portion of the participant (e.g., arms, legs, body, head, hands, fingers, feet) and may involve locomotion (e.g., walking, running, sprinting, jumping, galloping, driving, flying), a swinging motion (e.g., swinging a club, bat, or racket), a throwing motion (e.g., throwing a ball), other motion, or a combination thereof. The actions of the competition object may modify the competition object and may involve impacting, projecting, transporting, or other modification to the competition object or area. The modification may alter the position, orientation, or location of the competition object with respect to the participant or competition area (e.g., moving from a first geographic location to a second geographic location). The actions of the competition area may involve changes that are the result of the participant or competition object and may deform or otherwise modify the competition area (e.g., ball rolling through sand trap).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Simulation module <b>230</b> may select an action or a result of the action based on one or more computer generated models (e.g., computer modeling data <b>254</b>). As discussed above, there may be kinetic computer models, behavioral computer models, graphical computer models, other models, or a combination thereof. Simulation module <b>230</b> may use a kinetic computer model to simulate the physical effects of an action. The physical effects may be based on a calculation, such as calculating the distance a competition object will travel when impacted (e.g., where golf ball will land). Simulation module <b>230</b> may use a graphical computer model to simulate the visual effects of the action. Simulating the visual effects may involve generating a sequence of photorealistic images of the virtual participant performing the action and the results of the action on the competition object (e.g., video of virtual golfer hitting a golf ball with a golf club).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Tracking module <b>232</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to determine the progress of a participant during or after the competition. Tracking module <b>232</b> may be used to track one or more real participants, virtual participants, or a combination thereof. Tracking module <b>232</b> may track the progress by determining the actions of a real participant or the results of the actions. Determining the actions of the real participant may involve receiving input data indicating one or more actions of the real participant (e.g., activity of real person). In one example, the input data may include numeric data (e.g., scores, distances, swings, hits, throws) and may be received from the user via a user interface (as discussed above) or may be received from another service or device. In another example, the input data may include sensor data of a device that monitors the real participant before, during, or after an action. The sensor data may include GPS data, accelerometer data, audio data, image data, or other data. The sensor data may be provided by a sensor of computing device <b>140</b> or by another device (e.g., smart watch, mobile phone, security camera).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Scoring module <b>234</b> may enable computing device <b>140</b> to calculate one or more scores. The scores may include numeric values, alphanumeric values, character values, other values, or a combination thereof. Each score may be associated with one or more participants and each participant may be associated with one or more scores. In one example, a competition may include one or more competition events (e.g., holes, matches, meets, games) and each competition event may be associated with one or more scores. Scoring module <b>234</b> may perform one or more mathematical operation to calculate the one or more scores. The mathematical operations may involve adding, subtracting, averaging, multiplying, dividing, other operation, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Scoring module <b>234</b> may determine a winner based on the one or more scores. The winner may include one or more participants and may be an individual winner (e.g., winning participant) or a group of winning participants (e.g., winning team). The winner may be the winner of one or more of the competition events (e.g., first hole, first nine holes, all eighteen holes), a specific competition (e.g., first game or round), a series of competitions (e.g., tournament, professional golf tour), or a combination thereof. Determining the winner may involve computing device <b>140</b> performing one or more comparisons of one or more scores and selecting, identifying, sorting, filtering, arranging, or organizing, one or more of the scores or participants based on the comparisons. In one example, scoring module <b>234</b> may determine a first score for the virtual participant (e.g., deceased golfer) and a second score for the real participant (e.g., living golfer) and compare the first and second scores in view of one or more handicap score modifiers.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A handicap score modifier may include one or more numerical measures that are based on a particular participant (e.g., golfer), competition object (e.g., ball or club), competition area (e.g., golf course), other aspect of a competition, or a combination thereof. The handicap score modifier of a participant may enable participants with different abilities to compete more closely with one another. In one example, participants that are better competitors may have lower handicap score modifiers and participants that are worse competitors may have higher handicaps. A score may be referred to as a gross score before accounting for the handicap score modifier and referred to as a net score after accounting for the handicap score modifier.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The handicap score modifier may be the same or similar to a golf handicap. In one example, accounting for the golf handicap may involve subtracting the handicap score modifier from the total number of strokes (e.g., gross score) to produce a modified score (e.g., net score), which is then used to determine the final score. In another example, accounting for the golf handicap may involve applying the handicap score modifier to predetermined event scores (e.g., hole ratings, stroke index) and a portion deducted accordingly from each event score before calculating the total score for the event (e.g., total points for a hole). In yet another example, accounting for a golf handicap may involve determining a difference between handicap score modifiers of different participants and using the difference to determine the number of strokes the higher handicapped participant should receive from the low handicapped participant.

Additionally, it should be appreciated that the methods disclosed in this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computing devices. The term &#x201c;article of manufacture,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device or storage media. In one example, method <b>300</b> may be performed by one or more components <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Method <b>300</b> may be performed by processing devices of a server device or a client device and may begin at block <b>302</b>. At block <b>302</b>, a processing device may select a virtual participant. Selecting the virtual participant may involve the processing device (e.g., computing device <b>140</b>) recommending a virtual participant of a set of virtual participants. The set of virtual participants may be based on or include one or more of a deceased person, a living person, a fictional person, a famous person, an acquaintance of the real participant, or a historical version of the real participant (e.g., player's activity at a prior date/time). The processing device may generate the virtual participant by generating a graphical computer model, kinetic computer model, behavioral computer model, other computer model, or a combination thereof. The graphical computer model of the virtual participant may be generated based on image data of a deceased person, image data of a substitute person, or a combination thereof. The image data may include still image data (e.g., photographs) or video data (e.g., user generated video, TV program, or film). The kinetic computer model may be generated based on data of the deceased person and the data of the deceased person may include physiological data (e.g., height and a weight), performance data (e.g., measurement of one or more historical competitions), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Selecting the virtual participant may involve the processing device recommending one or more virtual participants (e.g., providing a recommendation). The recommending may involve comparing the participant data of the real participant with participant data of a set of one or more virtual participants. The participant data of the real or virtual participants may be generated by the processing device and may be based on physiological data and performance data. The physiological data may include a height, a weight, or a swing of the participant and the performance data may include a score of one or more historical competitions involving the participant. The processing device may select the virtual participant from the set of one or more virtual participants based on the comparing (e.g., one or more data comparisons).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At block <b>304</b>, the processing device may receive video content comprising a real participant. The video content may be associated with a competition and may include one or more aspects of the competition. The video content may include one or more real participants (e.g., living golfers), portions of a competition area (e.g., 18<sup>th </sup>hole of a golf course), other aspect of a competition, or a combination thereof. The video content may include image content (e.g., people, background, scenery), audio content (e.g., music, voices, sound effects), textual content (e.g., scores, participant statistics, rankings), other content, or a combination thereof. The processing device may also receive participant data of the real participant from a computing device in possession of the real participant. The computing device may include one or more sensors and may be the same or similar to a watch (e.g., smart watch), a mobile phone (e.g., smart phone), smart glasses (e.g., optical head mounted display), other device, or a combination thereof. In one example, the video content may include the real participant and a substitute participant (e.g., actor, body double). In another example, the video content may include the real participant and be absent a substitute participant.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">At block <b>306</b>, the processing device may simulate a competition that involves the virtual participant and the real participant. Simulating the competition may involve selecting actions to be performed by the virtual participant based on a behavioral computer model and determining results of the actions based on a kinetic computer model. Simulating the competition may also involve determining a competition area for the competition. The determination of the competition area (e.g., golf course) may be based on user input (e.g., user selection), participant data (e.g., GPS of real participant), a recommendation, or a combination thereof. Recommending a competition area may involve comparing performance data of the real and virtual participants and determining based on the comparing an advantage of the real participant over the virtual participant. The competition area (e.g., course, field, court) may then be selected or identified based on the advantage of the real participant (e.g., real person). In one example, the competition may be a sporting competition (e.g., golf) and the real participant may be a person (e.g., golfer) on a golf course. The simulation may include at least one image (e.g., frame) with both the real participant and the virtual participant on the golf course.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At block <b>308</b>, the processing device may augment the video content to comprise an action performed by the virtual participant. Augmenting the video content may involve rendering a state of the virtual participant in view of one or more actions (e.g., activity, sequence of actions). The rendering may be based on the graphical computer model of the virtual participant and updating the video content may involve adding or modifying video content to represent the state of the virtual participant. The processing device may also provide for display the video content before, during, or after the augmenting. The video content may be displayed by a television, a personal computer, a phone, a head mounted display, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At block <b>310</b>, the processing device may indicate a winner of the competition. Determining the winner of the competition may involve determining (e.g., calculating, computing) a first score for the virtual participant and a second score for the real participant. The processing device may compare the first score and the second score in view of one or more handicap score modifiers and determine the winner (e.g., identify, select, or choose the winner).
